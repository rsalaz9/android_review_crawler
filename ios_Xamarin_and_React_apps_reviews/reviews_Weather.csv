0,Elksom,"July 25, 2019",5,"My favorite app I used to rely on the standard Apple weather app that is pre-installed on the iPhone to receive all my forecast knowledge. I had been using it for years to check the weather and daily temp until one day my mother told me to check the radar... what radar? “The radar on the weather channel app,” she replied. "
1,Honey Moon Pie,"October 15, 2019",1,"What happened I liked the fact that being older than dirt I could put this on my iPad and make things bigger so that I could see and read everything. I liked the setup except that as with all things meteorologists have a harder time knowing what is going to happen and make guesses as to times of stuff. GOd still has control on most things and weather seems to be changing in our world also. So old age is not the only things that change in life.  Why everyone uses light gray writing on a white background and expect someone to be able to see it is idiotic at best. I know all of the younger generation may like new update but I personally liked the old one best. There may have been a few things to change but wish you would make so people had a choice. Older people seem to never get a choice any more. At least there are many more apps I can go to and pray to find one I like. Thanks for nothing but causing me more problems with computers which I am getting ever more aggravated with. Not all old people want so many changes in their later years. Every time I finally get used to something, you geniuses decide to change all around. Just getting used to phones and iPads and all their changes every other day is enough to drive someone crazy and I don’t need any help since as you get older people don’t give me credit for having a lot of common since anyway! Thanks at least for trying to please all the people in the world."
2,FormerWeatherAppFan,"January 17, 2020",1,"WEATHER APP TO PREMIUM UPGRADE NOT WORKING!!!! I have had the Weather App for many years, including the add free version. Then suddenly I saw features pulled back from the $3.99 Version and got an offer for premium going from $3.99 to $9.99 to basically get the same features I had before. I decided to pay for the Premium version and that is when the problems began. At first my ipad kept showing the adds without premium features, then when I tried to manage my subscriptions, It got rid of the adds on some of the screen, but when I click on some of the extended features (such as the extended hours tab) the app crashes every time. I tried to delete the Weather App on the ipad without luck and then from all devices and reload them, and now my iphone is also not showing extended premium features and also showing adds. If, I try to get refund I am told that I can only cancel the subscription starting at the end of initial subscription year which is at the end of 2020 (this year fee not refundable) but I can use the application until the end of the year (with advertisements). I have submitted multiple support requests online, since December 22, to the Weather App/IBM and the only response I get is ""the we will get to you as quickly as possible"" from each of the initial contacts. Furthermore, their FAQ and support pages do not have anything to say about what to do with premium features installation failure."
3,IbuSaja,"February 6, 2020",1,"Disappointed Updated Comments:  The app has gone from bad to totally unusable.  The “current location” feature gives me the weather and alerts for an area that is 20 miles away.  This is particularly annoying and dangerous on severe weather days.  Further I repeatedly get notifications about about what the weather will be like tomorrow in different area area that 20 miles away from where I live, in a completely different direction.  To make matters worse, when I try and report the errors, the email address provided within the app come back with a delivery failure because it is invalid.  After years of loving the Weather Channel on so many levels, and trusting them to keep me informed and safe, I am done.  Wish I could give this app a negative star rating.  "
4,Mikesaysstopit,"February 5, 2020",1,"Zero stars I never write reviews. I had to for this one. I’ve had this app as long as I remember. 2010 maybe??? And I’ve always loved it. Accurate and easy to use. Fantastic really. Gave me what I needed and nothing more. Now there’s all this junk. Pure, useless, clickbait junk. Pop up ads everywhere! I like knowing where to touch the screen with a little muscle memory so I can get through my task of getting the weather and getting on with my life. But now this app has sold out SO hard I feel like I’m using a 1998 pc with no virus protection! And it’s not even poorly done! It’s strategic and timed perfectly so the screen moves at the perfect time so my finger correctly hits the ad and not the option I wanted. Effectively navigating me away from the app to a completely irrelevant  ad that’s been tailored to me by the cookies I’ve agreed to use this app, that I’m not even going to look at because I’m now frustrated and trying to get back to my weather app. What over-paid executive approved this ridiculously bad interface? And why? So I can do a sinkhole video I won’t believe? The same sinkhole video that came out 8 months ago on 30 other apps that EVERYONE uses? Way to waste A TON OF MONEY ON NOTHING weather channel! All you did was make me use the weather app that came with my phone I that never really liked. Perfect case of if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Just bring back Joe Cantore. That’s all you had to do."
5,Bsadle,"June 9, 2019",1,"Money grab developers strike again Back a few years ago in the early days of the App Store, probably 8-10 years ago in fact, I purchased the ad free version of this app called Weather Channel Max. Good app, no ads and it worked well. Then about 2-3 years ago the app updated and said that this app will no longer be supported and that would be the final update. It stated the other version(the one with ads) would be the only version supported. I continued to use the app I paid for until it kept crashing after iOS updates and was pretty much forced to use the app with ads. Now I see you can go premium on this app and remove ads. That really ticks me off considering I had previously paid for the ad free version, only to have them snub it. I, at first, just thought they were only getting rid of max so they would force those who paid a one time fee for the ad free version back on the app that has ads. Not only was that true, but now, in hopes that people would forget(which I didn’t) they now offer a monthly subscription service to get rid of ads. This is a sad attempt at getting even more money from me. I will now be deleting the app and using another app instead. I’ve already given enough money to you all only to be asked for more. I’m really disappointed how greedy developers are becoming and all over an app that gives you mediocre weather reports."
6,joshybigmac,"December 22, 2019",1,Monetization is a Cancer in this App I live in snow country and I’ve always relied on the snowfall layers of the radar. I would have never updated this app if it meant that I’d have to pay a completely bogus fee of at least $10 a year just to be able to use the same feature that was free yesterday. The only thing that’s been accomplished by this app’s updates this year is a successive migration of its user base away from the app. I’m surprised I’ve held out this long but I cannot keep using an app that doesn’t want to be used.
7,Cmiester,"February 5, 2020",2,"Used to be 5 stars As life continues in this Land of the Free Market, we see more and more “monthly subscriptions” as alternatives to pesky ads and better performance. BUT THIS APP HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THE WORST APP TO DO IT TO. I mean seriously?!? I’ve had this app for YEARS. It was the best performing, most accurate, and user friendly weather app out there. It exceeded all these built in apps and that annoyingly wrong weather-bug thingy (that was a joke for the ones that’ll miss it) when it came to reliability. "
8,Havin'Fun-in-Louisiana,"May 9, 2019",1,"Could be great app if it worked When it works I like the app.  I like the changes and if it loads it is a useful tool.  For me the videos and weather updates are very good.  Not sure what the problem is, but for some reason and this seems to happen frequently — the app doesn’t load (spinning disk) or it just crashes and restarts and then back to spinning disk. So if it loads (might work for days and then not work for days) it is a good app.  I have noticed the app works best in places with high speed internet.  In a place outside or in a place that lacks high speed internet or great cell service, the app just won’t open quickly (maybe 5-10 mins to open).  I have an iPhone X with the newest software and the newest version of the app, so I don’t think it is the phone.  Anyway, if the stability can be improved and it can open quickly than it would be a great app."
9,Jr High Teach,"August 30, 2018",1,New Update RUINED this app! UPDATED REVIEW: 
10,master red fox,"February 24, 2018",4,"Weather variety multiple locations I have had this app for awhile and use it to not only get local weather but weather for various locations for my son's work travel as surprisingly conditions vary greatly within a 50 mile area which one needs to know if commuting. I get road conditions and various alerts ( rain, snow, lighting, etc) per area. All helpful. Last year because of the reports I got, I saved my son an unnecessary trip because of the weather report. I enjoy the various videos also. "
11,R50an,"August 28, 2018",5,"New Update Nonsense I don’t know why the weather channel felt the need to completely overhaul the layout and design of their app. The previous version, which I had used daily for the last handful of years, was by all accounts a perfect weather app. "
12,A disgruntled consumer99,"September 1, 2018",2,"Bad Update This used to be my favorite 5 star weather app. I love to track weather and preparing for my day each day by using the TWC app but that all changed with this new update. First of all I do not wear sunscreen and base my outfits on the uv index and that has now been removed. Next the app used to be easy to navigate and get all the relevant weather information for the day as well as some great videos that I would watch in the morning as I wake up, but now the app is confusing with too much going on. I understand in today’s world to stay relevant you need to make change but this change was not for the better, to confusing now and hard to find information. I feel bad for all the sponsors that would pay for spots in the videos because based on the way the videos are set up I bet less people will watch them, I know I no longer will. I hope that TWC can fix this app and make it more user friendly again with an easy to find uv index. I am not deleting the app yet but until it is changed I will no longer use the app and will start downloading new weather apps in hopes of finding a suitable daily replacement. I hope this does not fall on deaf ears, the TWC app was the best but not anymore. Thank you and have a great day."
13,Buckeye chris,"September 4, 2018",2,Why change it? I’m sorry but I dislike the new update. It has made the app a lot less user friendly. It’s difficult to navigate and to find specific information. I don’t understand why you think people would like this? We want simple and convenient. If you fixed the small font and color schemes that alone would help drastically. The important information is almost hidden now. For instance the current temperature is so small I need glasses to see it. 
14,Barometerbabe,"September 8, 2018",1,"Does not deserve one star for this update GIVE US BACK THE OLD APP!!! This is no concise weather report. And: Bad background; bad graphics; bad set up. Too many ads, too many screen options. The best weather information is plain and simple (as this app used to be): current conditions, forecast, radar, and then the other options like future forecasts, air quality, etc. "
15,Walterwilson0315,"September 18, 2018",1,"Way too much The new app is a very, very negative change. The old navigation was fine and did not need an overhaul because this is just a weather app. There’s WAY TOO MUCH extra stuff involved with this app, and I really don’t understand why these guys try so hard to make it entertaining. It’s literally just the weather, I’m not looking to be entertained and I doubt anyone else opens up the weather channel app like “oh boy it’s time to have a good time”. We just want to see a forecast and a radar and that’s it. The air pollution number also seems completely inaccurate because it’s different every time I open my app. Not to mention the recent discovery of a weather channel weatherman pretending to be pushed around by winds that just weren’t there. To the point where he’s babbling about the storm being in the middle of an intense surge or something like that, meanwhile a couple of pedestrians walk behind him wearing shorts and hoodies, not affected by the wind at all. Plus, he’s visibly fighting the wind in the opposite direction that it’s blowing. You can see plants blowing in the opposite direction of where he’s pushing. That being said, I feel like all the weather on here anymore is exaggerated because they think it’s entertaining to people. It’s really just a nuisance and the reason I’m getting a new weather app."
16,Frustrated former app user,"October 13, 2018",2,"Less useful since update 2018 I used this app multiple times per day in the past but since the 2018 update, I have hardly used it at all. The data is accurate.  It is hard to find the info you need.  They now have boxes on the screen with different info. The screen is so chopped up you can’t see enough of any one thing to figure out what it is. The previous version was better when current details were on the first screen and you could scroll down to whatever section you need. There was enough info on the screen to understand and you had the option to tap an arrow to get more detailed info if you wish. Now I see 2 or 3 words, then a box with an ad, then 4 or 5 words and then another ad. Nothing is obvious that you can tap to get more details.  I hate tapping all over the screen to figure out what gives more details since the first screen is useless and there is nothing to indicate how to get details. Please revise back similar to the previous functionality which was efficient and obvious how to operate the app!"
17,HenryAppleuser123,"January 31, 2019",4,"Good overall but needs improvement I use to enjoy the app and most importantly the interactive map. I really like it because not only can you read the weather, but you can also visualize it and I think that brings a new way of informing someone when looking at the weather. I think this is important because it could possibly help someone better understand what they are looking at and it also serves for educational purposes and that goes a long way when helping someone understand the intended message that trying to be sent. You never want any miscommunications. Anyway, I like the app overall but with the recent update, the layers of the interactive map now cover the whole screen and I find that kind of confusing and bothersome. For example, the temperature layer now covers the entire map instead of just the land masses. I’m my opinion, I think it was better before when it only covered the land masses and that applies for all the other layers like UV index etc. So if you can change it back to that, that would be great. Thank you for your time and keep up with the great work. Go weather channel."
18,E'sAppreview,"December 31, 2019",2,"Used to be a great app The Weather Channel App used to be a great App. Now I find it difficult to even open. I touch to open and it immediately closes, so I have to tap a second time. It then takes 20-30 seconds to open. Once the app is open an Upgrade to Premium screen appears first (for a fee).  It freezes as I’m using it and I have to close and reopen to get it to work. See steps above that have to be repeated when it freezes. It is slow to respond to screen swiping or moving from one to another. "
19,Mom24monsters,"September 17, 2019",2,"Constant reminders to go premium when I already have and no accessibility support for Apple Watch. I think this app would be great if it worked for everybody on every device, but they seem to have left out those of us who use voiceover, who need to know what the weather is too. It’s not all about the sighted people! I’m trying to figure out why those of us who use voiceover should have to pay full price for premium when everything doesn’t work for us? Also, I’m getting really tired of the constant reminders to go premium, when I already have. I have to go and tell it that I want to go premium first, for it to tell me that I already am, before the stupid thing will go away until the next senseless time it pops up. Until these things are fixed, we shouldn’t be charged to use the app. There’s not a whole lot of premium quality to go in premium when you have a visual impairment and most of the stuff doesn’t work with voiceover, something that’s built into the iOS, and there’s no excuse for it to not work with it. Also, I’m trying to figure out why, if this app is included, even if it’s a dumbed down version of it, with iOS, does it have completely different forecasts? The temperatures don’t always match either."
20,reallyisittaken???,"September 8, 2018",1,Catastrophe Hate the update and redesign. What a mess . . .
21,ArdenBailey,"December 14, 2018",3,"I liked the old App better! Ever since the update my weather channel app is super glitchy. When I go to watch videos I have to watch an ad before every single one(the same ad over and over), this was not true for the old app. Also, if I click on the video and the ad plays but I scroll down to make it picture in picture and still browse the other videos... if I’m not at the video I initially wanted to watch when the ad ends and the screen goes black, when I try to click on it to bring up full screen it doesn’t work. Then, I have to click on a different video and then go back and am forced to watch the ad again. Also, if I am watching a video and the video ends and I’m in full screen, it immediately starts playing an ad(the same one I watched before the video) and the icon to minimize full screen is completely missing. I have to exit my app and go all the way back in just to watch a new video. I used to be an avid Weather Channel user but not anymore... I hardly even used it for the weather I just liked the nature/science related videos, and I can’t even do that anymore."
22,Lise P.,"March 6, 2019",1,"Notifications no longer work! The Notifications NO LONGER WORK on this app!!! No matter how many times I try to enable them it doesn’t work, I just keep getting the “ERROR - Unable to change your alerts at this time. Please try again later.” I’m talking every single day for the last few MONTHS. And why did my notifications shut off in the first place? It’s important to me to get severe weather updates because I live in a tornado prone area, TWC used to be a source for this but  isn’t anymore. And BTW, shouldn’t that be a PRIORITY for TWC? (I have contacted App support multiple times to no avail.)"
23,Lora K Kay,"March 10, 2019",2,"Change Is Not Always Good... I have used The Weather Channel app since I got my first iPhone 4, over any other weather app, and I’m now deleting it from my phone. I have given the new interface a long trial and the “fixes” have not improved this awful design. The adds overtake the screen, the graph is useless and I can no longer find real weather information that I can use. Three out of ten slides on the “Weather Snapshot” are related to my area with little information. The other seven are ads, international stories or ads disguised as stories. AND... this is not a unique look. It looks just like a FB Story, which was not an improvement on FB either. In order to get a TRUE weather Snapshot, I have to scroll through 6 other slides, the first which is usually a sensationalized video, and the second which is a tiny radar map. The aspects which most affect me are not seen until the 3rd, 4th and 5th slide, which often stick when scrolling through and lead to an unintentional advertisement opening. All of the information used to be right at my fingertips with a simple scroll for allergies, air quality and other details pertinent to me. Goodbye, Weather Channel!"
24,fbfbbckdjsbfncjjvjdbfkvjc,"June 7, 2019",1,"We want Weather and not Water; been reliable till the IBM When the Weather Company owned The  Weather Channel the weather was much more reliable. This channel focused on weather and not water. It had people who cared not for money, but for the safety of people. They had people down on the scene of a wildfire or a hurricane or a tornado! Now the IBM is saying they care for people but do they really? The IBM splits its business for agriculture, water, and other things; it does not only focus on  weather like the former weather channel does. Yes, it is important that people around the world get water, hence The Water Channel, but this is not a charity app it is a weather app. The name chance shows everyone that this is no longer a reliable app. The premium option backs me up. The most reliable sorce you can get it only 48 hours out. Anything behind that is something unreliable; something you are fake selling people to get there money. The wind could shift and change everything. 48 hours is the furthest most reliable source there is. Also why is it not giving me accurate alerts for rain, lightning, pollen, or anything? Oh look it started raining... where is my alert. And hmmmm the radar says that it’s not..... like I said we want Weather and not Water."
25,carolinelynchminor,"August 28, 2019",1,"Give back favorite locations! Below is my previous feedback comments! Here is the latest! So, I got the update. I went to the app settings. I tried to add features, but received the message that I must first add to my favorites!!! Good grief! There is no way to add favorites anymore! Remember.... Add to My Favorite????!!!!! It is definitely gone from the options!!!! Frustratingly ridiculous!!!! And, very maddening! "
26,Saturatesinger,"June 28, 2019",1,"If you’re a fan of conspiracy videos and anything BUT the weather This app, the meteorologists involved, and the channel have all gone steadily downhill in both the accuracy and presentation of their work.  Want to know if it’s going to rain?  Well, that’s fine, open the app, click on hourly, click the list, select the particular hour, and you’ve finally gotten yourself to a page that has a 2% chance of being correct about the weather at any given time.  Rain predictions are always wildly off, temperatures are inaccurate, the future radar’s accuracy is nothing short of a joke, the app is overwhelmed by clickbait videos and hidden ads, and the “weather alerts” are both excessive and incorrect.  Weather channel, you are NOT a nonprofit, you have one job (as Loki said “just the one!”) that you are PAID to do, and to be honest you don’t do it well at all.  It is currently drizzling in my area, one minute ago the app claimed no rain, now the app says I have severe hail and thunderstorms in my area....nope, not at all correct.  All these shortcomings, and still, now, you have the nerve to create a subscription service out of your features?  Lost faith, going elsewhere, please find time in your lives to do your one job with at least the minimum standards of care or accuracy."
27,lisanicoleiannarino4887,"October 19, 2019",2,"very glitchy app while it’s informative and sometimes accurate, the app itself is a pain to use. it constantly crashes on open and needs restarted. it’s super slow. they constantly ask me to PAY FOR PREMIUM which is ludicrous. why would i pay for a weather forecast? it’s like you’ve designed the app to operate poorly to get people to pay for the premium. no thanks. they also share data and are one of the worst as far as surveillance of what you do online."
28,bowinick,"December 14, 2019",1,"4 emails sent to Support and no response Purchased one month premium of TWC And my subscription was removed by them. I have tried to restore my subscription a dozen times, trying everything to get it re-stored. Emailed TWC four times now no response. Possible issue with when we delete our personal data. Seemed occurred after I tried it. I am able to restore the subscription on 2 iPad mini II’s (even after deleting personal data - ios 12 on old ipads) but not on my iPhone. It’s obvious that TWC is mainly interested in throwing a lot of advertisement and making people pay monthly subscriptions for premium weather service. They believe this is the future for all of us on how we will get their so called premium Weather service on an app. Too many ads and too many pop-ups wanting you to purchase the premium service which of course I already have. TWC really blew it. How do you make it up to all these angry customers having so many issues. It should not be rated at 4.6?? I begin to question Apple’s rating system which is probably no better than Amazons. Good luck to everyone trying to find your premium weather apps."
29,Thegymbum,"November 29, 2019",1,"Used to love this app. For years I’ve loved this app and used it constantly. However the past few updates have made me use it less and less until I finally decided to delete it and go back to the default apple weather app. Several issues- the ads have become overwhelming. I’ve noticed there are far more ads than there used to be, even when you first open the app. There are long ads between every single video, (sometimes as long as or longer than the videos themselves and you can’t skip it after a few seconds like on most app. Even worse, is usually the exact same ad over and over so if you want to watch more than 1 video, you keep having to watch the same ad as long as 30 seconds for just a 30 video. Not worth it. Probbaly the worst change is that is been draining my battery rapidly since a recent update, and even does so with low power mode turned on which should disable background app activity. I looked into the battery problem and in the last week the weather channel had used 35% of all battery use, despite only briefly checking the weather a few times a day and occasionally watching a video. I will miss it, but sadly it’s not worth it anymore!"
30,happygodavid,"March 10, 2018",1,"It was great, then terrible, then good, then terrible... The original WC app back in the day was pretty solid. I paid the $4 for the ad free version. That version of the app was, hands down, the best weather app that has ever existed in the App Store. "
31,K Rae Reed,"August 29, 2018",5,"Essential I’m a pilot so my life revolves around the weather. I don’t just look at the weather, I live IN the Weather. The professional meteorologists at the Weather Chanel give you the best you can get from the same raw sources available to me as a pilot. I check the Weather Chanel app more than any other app on my phone. They do an outstanding job explaining important concepts which give you the How And Why things work with the weather. I am a flight instructor and one of the first things I ask my new students is if they have the Weather Chanel app so they can track radar and see current weather unfold. I also assign for them to watch Weather Underground as much as possible. I learn something new from them every night. I admire every one of your on air meteorologists and kudos to the crew behind the scenes. There is someone behind the camera in the hurricane to thank. You give your all and have given your lives too. Thank you for all you do from a huge fan."
32,TomahawkD23,"August 29, 2018",3,"Big Issue I am currently have problems with the new app that I can’t turn on notifications to receive significant weather advisories, daily rain/snow events, and pollen notifications. In the old app all those notifications where on. But when the new app downloaded they turned off and now I can’t turn them one. I once I’ve selected the notifications I want and press done, a screen comes up saying select a location. I look under locations, it’s blank, nothing shows up. I go back to the home screen. My current location is showing. I try again turning back on the notifications, I still am not being allowed to to select a location or is that part of the app syncing to my location like the home screen did. In my settings I have my current location turned to always on, still nothing. I used to rely on these notifications because I live in tornado alley so I guess it’s a good thing I also have a weather radio too. The Weather Channel app is now useless to me. I guess I rely on my weather radio now to keep my family safe!"
33,Roll out update,"September 16, 2018",1,New update and coverage of Florence New update is weirdly busy and hard to read and this is coming from a weather junkie. I had a hard time figuring out what those squiggly lines were for and yep supposed to be for day night-why? 
34,YayaHB,"September 28, 2018",1,Horrible “Improvements”= Form over substance Or “Don’t risk a facelift when you’re already pretty good looking!” 
35,sgwilso4,"October 17, 2018",4,"Widget glitching Since I have searched and searched and can't find a way to contact the weather channel, here's a review with my issues. Since the latest update my widget in the Notification Center hasn't been updating properly. It will continue to have a ""current temperature"" from sometime earlier in the day. Even if I click on it and open the app, the current temp will not change. "
36,Rokair,"October 18, 2019",1,"Well it would be ok if it worked I hated that my favorite weather application with all sorts of features, smartly updated often, and simply works very well had to stop using the data from the weather channel as an option since the weather channel decided to no longer sell it to other application makers.  "
37,CStrong4044,"October 22, 2019",2,"Really? Upon opening this app you’ll wait a good 20 seconds to get past the blue startup screen. From there it’ll load your last location before pulling your gps location, so you wait for it to load and it shows you an irrelevant earlier location. Then it pulls your gps location, it reloads, and shows you your current location weather. About 45 seconds after loading the app on a brand new device you will be able to access the weather. From there you better hope you don't pull downwards too far or you’ll refresh and start over! So after you’ve wasted a minute now you're provided with a pretty comprehensive review of the weather, with an interactive radar that is pretty nice and accurate compared to other apps (why I give 2 stars instead of 1).  But wait, theres more! NOW THEY WANT YOU TO PAY FOR AN ADD FREE/FASTER/MORE ACCURATE VERSION?!?!?! Thats the solution to a buggy app huh? No wonder the app never works because it’s constantly generating the best location specific ad!!!"
38,StormHeart501,"June 19, 2019",5,"Great app I like this app because it is easy to use and highly accurate, I would highly suggest it to any of my friends who believe their weather app give inaccurate information and or they don’t like the functionality of the app they are presently using. I don’t have any REAL complaints other than sometimes I have to completely close and reopen the app for it to update on the temperature at the moment, it’s not necessarily giving incorrect information, I mean it kind of is but all I have to do is close it and reopen it. So if you could possibly fix it so it updates like maybe every few minutes so that I hopefully won’t have to constantly have to close and reopen the app every time I use it I would highly appreciate it. <3 but other than that the app is amazing and I would NO DOUBTS request it to my friends, in fact I found out about this app through my mom. But anyhow that’s all for now, please do consider my suggestion ❤️❤️❤️"
39,jmscanlo,"March 27, 2020",1,"Not as good as it used to be I've had this app forever. And years ago it used to be great and up to date. But the past year or so, it's been horrible. It freezes a lot. It crashes constantly and doesn't give you accurate weather reports. I'm constantly double checking other weather sources because I can't rely on this app alone. It's unfortunate because it used to be my go-to weather app. But it's just not what it used to be."
40,Dr Mike 1,"February 8, 2018",5,"Great weather app! Does a nice accurate job.   It had everything until about 2 weeks ago when suddenly, the temperature badge stopped being displayed on my iPhone’s home screen.  The temperature badge allowed me to glance at my iPhone and see what the current temperature was without even opening The Weather app.  Additionally, I’ve noticed that my name disappears everyday under the settings menu within the app.  I add my name and save it and the next day, it’s gone.   I checked ALL my settings within the app, I’m running the latest iOS version, and I’ve checked my notifications setting on my iPhone.  I have emailed the app support, but still nothing.  I received an automated reply telling me that their support people have received my email about these issues and that “they’ll get right on it”.   That was about 5 days ago.  Problems still exist and NO one has contacted me.  This app is losing stars everyday."
41,Mamacitaslg,"April 1, 2018",3,"Soooo many inconsistencies.... For example:  Currently, there’s a warning rolling across the top of opening page. It states that there’s a winter storm warning from midnight through tomorrow at 1pm for 3-5” of snow with up to 6” in some areas. When scrolling down and looking at the detailed daily report for tonight and then tomorrow, it states a less than 1” tonight, and tomorrow 1-3” snow possible.  Hence, huge discrepancies and inconsistencies, often.  Very annoying. "
42,Rev Jude,"May 27, 2018",1,Stupid and also very inaccurate. First reason I call it stupid is because they name the snowstorms. I don’t know who came up with that stupid idea but the weather channel but it’s the most stupidest idea I’ve ever heard of naming a snowstorm give me a break. Also the next you know they’re going to name tsunami‘s earthquakes and every time we get a thunderstorm they’re going to name it. Plus their forecasts are always in accurate for where I live. I depend on the weather I can’t expect them to tell me what it’s going to be like in my area. I find that the cable weather is way off also and I don’t trust him. I also use storm in weather underground including the weather channel itself and they are the most stupidest apps to have. They are also very inaccurate and I don’t trust him. I have decided to delete their apps on my phone. I like to rock storms and when I found out from this app including the others if they do have if you can’t track a storm. This app is garbage for anyone who loves the weather. Anything the weather Channel has offer is all garbage. They don’t track storms do you know Kim good forecast in for anyone that Sirius about protecting the weather don’t use this crap.
43,CLS_1980,"September 1, 2018",1,TERRIBLE UPDATE!!! I tried to contact customer support before leaving this review.  There is no way to do that so here it is.  I have had this app on mi iPad and iPhone for years.  It used to work beautifully.  I even paid to have ads removed.  Later on I discovered location issues within the widgets on both devices.  Then my precise location was deleted in the search.  Aside from those things all was well.
44,jenpilch13,"September 8, 2018",2,App update is disappointing to say the least! The new weather app update is disappointing. The font/graphics are hard to see because they are so light and fine. The graph is not necessary and makes looking at the weather confusing and too much stimuli all at once. Who need that graph any way? The background is now white instead of blue again making the graphics hard to see. I like looking at the hour by hour top to bottom like before and now it’s L-R. The 2 weathers for each day is too confusing at a glance. If I want details I like clicking and reading about that but at a glance it’s way too much information. I have so much more to say about it but I don’t have hours to write a review. I have been using it now for 3 weeks or so and have tried to get used to it but I just can’t. I don’t like it at all. It has been brought up by almost everyone I talk to who used the old one and no one likes the new update. Please please go back or improve this new design. I loved this app before now and used it all the time! Now I dread looking at the weather and get annoyed trying to navigate the new app. 😢😤😠😡☀️❄️☔️🌪🌥🌦🌨
45,BaronBookworm,"September 9, 2018",1,"Was the best until upgraded The latest update is even worse than the last. Takes forever to open and half the time freezes. Wish they’d go back to the original. It was easy to use. I had really loved it. It always was the most accurate, but this latest update finally did me in. I’m moving on to another app. "
46,Ladylake88*,"January 17, 2020",1,"Forced to Upgrade to Awful New App Was forced to upgrade to this app as I was told the Original App would NO longer be available after a certain date. This new app is terrible to use & I wish they never changed it! I left the old version on my iPad & still use it as the new one is Horrible, especially the radar screen. The other radar screen was easy to use. The only plus about the new radar screen is it runs much longer to see the storms moving in over a greater length of time. Why change the app when there was nothing wrong with the old version except the incoming storms didn’t show for more than a few hours & ran really fast through incoming weather, and that new feature works correctly when it feels like it! You should have just added that new feature to the radar screen & left the rest of it alone!"
47,Johnnyz53,"July 23, 2019",1,"Let’s go back in Time I own a manufacturing business in the South. Since we work in a mostly open warehouse the weather is very important there was a time when y’all had sections of importance. Videos: At one time the primary videos offered were segments of weather throughout the country. i . e. Northeast, southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and Northwest. Now it’s a melange of Weather top story, then somewhat insignificant stories with background music and subtitles of stories not necessarily pertinent to U.S weather on a daily basis. It seems you have to forage through the pooo to get what your looking for. There was also monthly data that showed averages for one’s area and where we are compared to the average on a rolling average. That’s completely gone. Nowadays it’s the basic local facts and sensationalism. I’m afraid that you don’t know how to get it back.  Lastly, I find it interesting that your posting a 4.6 average when the Lions share of comments are negative. Himmmm Math channel?"
48,Cnizzle516,"December 30, 2019",2,"Prepare for ads and obnoxious Premium pushes for mediocre weather forecasting. This used to be my go-to for weather. Over the last 6 months however, it’s become more and more annoying to use. The ads that integrate themselves into just your home screen are bad enough, but the Premium push is too much. There is no way - NO. WAY. - To predict weather accurately to 10 days. The sensor and satellite technology currently available, as well as predictive algorithms currently in-use, only allow for 5 days maximum, and even then you’re pushing it. Heaven forbid you live in an area that actually experiences rapidly changing inclement weather. The fact that this false claim has turned into a $10/yr service is absurd and disgusting, and suckers people that don’t know anything about what is associated with meteorologists doing their jobs into paying for “upgraded features” that are simply a lie and a guess at absolute best. And now you have to upgrade to premium to see 48 hour future snowfall? Please. Pick another app for your weather if you actually need valid information. I’m deleting this snake oil-esque refuse from my phone."
49,Nikkig127,"June 25, 2019",3,"Good enough The UI is good enough, but I find myself going to the default iPhone app or WeatherBug more often. There’s just too much on the main screen of this app. It’s very busy and difficult to find the essentials at a glance. "
50,Hm1014,"January 28, 2018",3,"Easier navigation needed I wish it was a little easier to navigate and find the information I need quicker. The main thing I go to weather apps is to find out how the weather will be for the day and the week. For first time users easy navigation is the key to get them hooked. As time passes they will begin to explore all the neat tools you offer. It’s seems to me I see the day’s forecast and when I try to look for the week I’m bombarded by these crazy breakdown by the hour and pollen in the air , barometer pressures, and I have to scroll for what seems like a eternity to get out of all these crazy breakdowns for just ONE day! and frankly by that time I’m exausted!! And I leave the app. Accuweather on the other hand has tabs which I LOVE and easy to find at the top of the page. Makes it easy to access the information 90% of the population generally needs. Simple tabs and all the extra info is within those tabs as opposed to spread all over the page and having to scroll on and on to move on to the next thing."
51,Lefty21955,"July 16, 2018",3,"Change of Info Needed I go to this app, because I don’t watch local news and need real time data. I used to watch The Weather Channel, but unless they changed “Your local on the 8’s”, it’s not as helpful as an app might be. As another user mentioned, this app gives too much forecast. It’s rare to have an accurate forecast for today, tomorrow, or the weekend, so why give the outlook for 15 days? What I would like to see is more current and hourly data. Here where I am, humidity is a big issue; a huge issue really. Hourly forecast showing temp AND humidity would be much more useful. The radar would be helpful, if it were easier to load and gave 15 minute intervals for the future cast. The radar for what passed already is really only helpful as far as the path of the weather, so that timeframe probably could be shortened. I like that this app now features “Watson”, because that should be giving better info. Please keep revising this app! I think we all would like it and use it more, if it were improved."
52,Baby Elliebear,"September 1, 2018",1,"Disappointed I used to love this app, because it was easy for my elderly family members to understand and showed what the air pressure was at any given time. Now that they have changed it I am constantly getting calls from family asking what is going on and that they cannot follow it. You should have followed the age old statement. “If it is not broken, do not fix it.” Now you have created an app that is anything but user friendly for anyone and you removed important information like air pressure. I know that as I am writing this it will fall on deaf ears, but if you have older friends or family or know people who are not weather savvy, stay away from this app!!!! I really wish that companies would stop changing things to “keep up with the times”. Leave it alone if you have something good. Now I have to hunt for a different resource and on top of that worry about making sure that it does not have a virus attached. I am really disappointed with the Weather Channel team. I have been watching them since they first aired on television when I was a kid and never thought I would see the day that I would turn away from them."
53,KZink,"October 9, 2018",4,"Local on the 8’s I have loved the weather channel since local on the 8’s. My sister and I would watch as kids to see if we could wear capris in the spring. (Temperature has to be above 65 degrees.)You are still my go to for weather everyday. Your information, radar tracking, and rain alerts are all very helpful. The only reason I give a 4 out of 5 is I’m not a fan of the stark white background. The pictures of the outdoor scenes in the background before this update were quite lovely to open up to in the morning. It made me look forward to getting to know my weather. While the white is clean it just feels cold. The line graph when you open up the app is cool but I find it more informative if the temp numbers were bigger and you could scroll down to see your hourly Temp change rather than clicking through the different sections. Moral of the story coming from a BFA who loves art: bring back the pictures. It makes the people feel good."
54,SexySweetie18,"October 9, 2018",1,"Unreadable Now I used to love the Weather Channel app.  I could do without the ads, but I put up with them.  At least the app offered easy to read information at a glance.  The newest version has inverted the color scheme, made the font small, and made it a lot more difficult to access the weather on an hourly and daily basis.  I miss being able to see my 7 day forecast at a glance.  At the very least, I should be able to see the hourly forecast for the day without clicking around multiple times within the app.  I actually prefer to use the native Apple weather app because it’s more straightforward.  The Weather Channel should give users the option of viewing the app’s content the old way as opposed to claiming that user’s can “just scroll down” for more information.  I also prefer the easily recognizable symbols for fog and wind that used to appear.  I don’t see the new app as an improvement AT ALL.  To the developers: offer other options within the app if you’re unwilling to change it back.  I’ve spoken to other users, and I’m not the only one who no longer wants to use your app after the recent updates."
55,Don Montgomery,"December 23, 2018",1,Why change what work? I had to come back and re-address this!! I noticed some body gave The weather Channel a four star!! If anyone does it’s from the family of the Weather Channel! It’s a fake review from the Weather Channel! Just be honest Weather Channel just fix the problems and quit selling our data!!! Please we all loved you at one time and we need you back in full form and performing as a shining beacon on a lighthouse as our lives and our family lives depends on your performance!
56,WyoPKdad,"March 17, 2019",2,"Some good, some bad Update: now my travel route of forecasts is no longer visible, just a list of recent locations. Looking for a new weather app. "
57,mligenzaa,"April 7, 2019",1,not that great the weather is accurate so i still use it but the app has flaws:
58,Oh My BMW,"January 26, 2020",1,"Just because you can change something, doesn’t mean you should This is definitely not as good as the 2018 Weather Chanel App.  I understand software changes are sometimes needed and maybe these changes were needed to support advertising etc.  But I don’t understand, why they would move from a platform that had great features, to new one that’s a piece of junk.  We were able to see a five day forecast a glance.  And if you wanted a longer forecast, a left/right screen swipe showed five more days of forecast.  And viewing forecast of multiple city was just as easy.  Swipe the screen above the five day forecast and another other city’s forecast popped in.  The old app made good use of a single screen view and a tap or swipe made it easy to navigate to forecasts.  The latest app tends to jump to a detailed daily screen that must be scrolled vertically to read.  It was much easier to scan weather trends horizontally.  I’m moving on to another App, until they recognize and reinstitute the quick great features they abandoned.  Just because you can change something, doesn’t always mean you should change."
59,Old Mtn Man,"August 9, 2019",5,Story My Daughter was driving me home after having a heart cath among other test at Vanderbilt Medical Center. We were driving 300 miles through strong thunderstorms at a very slow speed. We were both having so much trouble seeing that we could not find a exit to get off then interstate. Finally we got lucky and i spotted one in time to get off. We filled the suv with gas plus ourselves with some hot cocoa and coffee. I checked my phone to try and track the storm. I noticed that you stated there was a 22 minute delay between the bands coming in. I told my daughter let’s wait 10 minutes then leave. Thanks to your app we were able to drive the other half at a normal speed. It would have been an extra 5 hrs at the speed we were traveling not counting the danger we were in with all the 18 wheelers flying by us. Plus I needed my heart meds that were at my home
