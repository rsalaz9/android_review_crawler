0,Hix|,"April 30, 2020",4,"Update Ideas So i think the app is really good but i would just like to make a few requests like when you hold the button for a longer time the video zooms in. Another one could be like there are more filters like doggy, glitch, and other cooler filters. Also I think one of the updates should be that you can duet other people's dubs. Ohh and i think you guys should also let us pick how long we what the video to go until it pauses, do u guys get what i mean? And we should also be able to change the video voice, and pick how long we want the captions to show until. Thank you, sorry if i said to much, i would really appreciate if you made those changes. Again thank you. If you can, can u pls let the sounds go a bit longer than 20 seconds, it should go like to 1 minute at least. Also can you Please Please fix the block people thing and not have a limitation because I think there is a glitch and its not letting me block anybody, and I am getting frustrated can u plss make like a green screen thing, like there is a photo it the background, but its a greenscreen, and some new filters, like a doggy face, a which Disney princessnce are u, etc, it would mean a lot"
1,ilovebillieeyelash üòã,"April 13, 2020",1,"PARENTS PLEASE READ THIS! this app is a lot of fun! You can dance, and have a great time! But adults are also on this app..... so sexual predators are all over the children. You can use this app to text people (that you DONT know!) and it‚Äôs very scary to think that millions of kids that DO have this app are possibly being harassed by a predator. This app should be much much more organized and you NEED to make sure the kids on here are safe!!! People on this app, twerk, show inappropriate parts of there body on camera, use  sexual assault with comments, online date, do sexting, verbal abuse, and the kids who are the ‚Äúpretty ones‚Äù not only get wayyy to much attention from these sexual predators but so do the younger children that use this app! Children that have been sexually abused by predators usually don‚Äôt tell anyone because they don‚Äôt know how the person will react or if they will get in trouble. Especially for the children that are traumatized or are already traumatized. Don‚Äôt let this be your child, or your self. Nobody here that is a good mother or father would want this for there children! KEEP SOCIAL APPS AWAY FROM KIDS UNTILL YOU KNOW THEY ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE!"
2,May.034,"November 27, 2019",3,Read this!!!!!!! Hey i‚Äôm new to this app and i love it!!There ls just a few things i need to say. 1st off some things are inappropriate to see and yeah you know what i mean. If people post those stuff they should get kicked off immediately. Also no songs with cuss words to make it more kid friendly. It makes kids think it‚Äôs ok then they get in trouble from there parents for saying them. Also there should be different speeds to do with the songs like fast or slow. I think you should make a Dubsmash app for KIDS!!! it would be awesome. Parents would be way more comfortable with kids having this app and kid friendly songs like High School musical or just fun things but also have songs with no cuss words and are fun to do even with tweens and teens. The age limit should be 8-14. I would want that app way more. So please keep this in mind!!!! I really hope you use these ideas to improve this app and it be way more fun for kids!!
3,Razii03,"January 10, 2020",4,"Update and Fix It is a fun app that kills time and has helped me learn new dances and make connections with friends. Though it could use some updates because it's the same as it has been for years. Also I‚Äôm having trouble with the sounds, when I try to play a sound it either glitches or doesn‚Äôt work. Is there anyway you can fix it?"
4,nkhnlhnku,"December 1, 2019",5,Fix I love this app with all my life but this new update needs to go I love the format and how you can see the hidden dubs but now I can even put it on private it‚Äôs either I post or I have to save it and delete it which I highly dislike and also i can‚Äôt even save my own dubs and I don‚Äôt like the messaging thing I can‚Äôt see who like my post or anything so if this can be fixed that would be great if it went back to the old ways where we can save them to private or just save them and take all the extra stuff out would be great old way was much better only thing I like about this new update is that the private and the posted videos are separate please take this into consideration pleas and thank you
5,YeetDawwg,"February 17, 2020",5,i like the app but... the app is really good but could be better with improvments
6,khikhiüòÅüòÅüòò,"January 2, 2020",5,"To dubsmash creators Omg I love dubsmash so much and I use it almost everyday but since yesterday it started messing up I couldn‚Äôt watch videos,listen to sounds, or even post videos. I was so upset üòñ. So I tried again today and it didn‚Äôt work. So I tried to delete it and download it again but it isn‚Äôt downloading and i have enough space on my device for me to download dubsmash, but the main problem is that it isn‚Äôt letting me do my dances or watch others. But otherwise dubsmash is a wonderful dancing app I consider sending the link to your friends because I have put mine on dubsmash but yes please fix these bugs and glitches."
7,liberty. giana,"December 23, 2019",4,"Dubsmash is a magnificent app I love dubsmash but sometimes the music has a lot of cussing in it but it is a lit app for only 11 - 14 I like it so far sometimes the music is inappropriate for kids I think little kids like 6-8 should not be on the app but that is up to their parents so not trying to be in other people‚Äôs bissness so I like the app it is ok who ever created this app did ok with creating it for  11-14 again only for this is what I said only for 11-14 if you want to feel the experience go ahead and check it out for your self remember I am not trying to be in others peoples bissnes remember be the one to help others dubsmash be your own hero sincerely,liberty to dubsmash love your app"
8,Matt Matt LOL,"January 24, 2020",4,Slomo OK I don‚Äôt really write reviews because most of my games and other apps are good but the only thing bad about this is delete slow mode because most of the songs that people put in there is used to be slow oh yeah and if they should have fast mode to but I‚Äôm not really into that right now so yeah. Another thing you should block inappropriate text because in this app there‚Äôs lotta inappropriate stuff that I know little kids have it just saying because so almost everybody those little kids have it because of there big sisters and brothers so I‚Äôm just saying you should put some blocking of  putting a inappropriate words in there and tha is it
9,HUMBLE R,"January 9, 2020",5,"Dubsmash I have this app on my phone and two tablets and am on it basically everyday!! I enjoy the app a lot and one of the pluses is the Dubs are so clean compared to the lyrics in the sounds! But lately I have started to see an increase in inappropriate profile pics and an issue with reporting them! The last two times I had to report the profiles via reporting the bug about the reporting not working right! This is an important bug to fix, especially at a time when many apps are having to update their Terms and Conditions!!! Other then that this is one of my favorite apps right now!!"
