0,WHaynie,"February 15, 2020",1,"Forcing ‚ÄúContinue in Watch‚Äù is a very bad move My two stars from the other week in regards to my saved items automatically being saved to a folder when they aren‚Äôt supposed to is now down to one star due to the newest excuse for an update. In the past I would be watching something and if I clicked on it to watch it bigger it would then show other suggested videos from Watch under it. That was fine. But now I will only be a few seconds into a video on my feed without touching it yet and it will COMPLETELY STOP the video and te me to continue watching  it on Watch. HOWEVER when I try to click the video to make it bigger and thus open it in Watch it won‚Äôt do jack squat. This tells me I would have to click over to Watch and then attempt to refind the video just to bloody watch it in the first place. I don‚Äôt know who was smoking the stupid juice this time, but I would rather watch no videos than have to go out of my way to hunt a video down just to watch after it‚Äôs already been presented in front of me. And as someone with a business page that posts videos (AND PAYS GOOD MONEY to use some as ads) it makes me want to cut back what I spend with you all if this is what my users will be left with. Please please PLEASE change it back."
1,WinstonFl,"September 17, 2019",2,"Buggiest app on my iPad Let‚Äôs face it, if you use social media Facebook is a must have to stay connected.  However the Facebook app is a complete bug filled app that only seems to break more with every update.  I‚Äôve been waiting for years for it to work right and yet I always know when an update comes, because something you use regularly will break guaranteed.  If by some miracle it gets fixed in the bi-weekly update, I promise you something else you use will be hindered in the next version. "
2,MKaip,"November 19, 2017",1,"Locked Out of Account If I could give 0 Stars, I would.. Facebook has locked me out of my account for days, saying they need to review a photo of me. There is no one to contact or email to fix it. I have had my account since about 2005 so it doesn‚Äôt make sense.. The Help Page is of no help because it consists of regular people who do not have access to unlock accounts. Facebook needs to have a direct contact via Chat or email to assist their customers."
3,Pu Erh Tea,"April 19, 2020",2,"Attn: FB suspended my account for no solid reason suddenly Greetings Facebook crew! The purpose I write to you is none other than to impart my report as well as to acquire assistance pertaining to Facebook account service. So today all of a sudden Facebook is asking me to submit a photo ID upon logging in; and I have uploaded and sent a photo of my driving license (genuine!). I have been using Facebook since 2009 if my memory serves me well and I never did infringe your ToU or regulations but somehow you team got me as using a fake profile name? I believe someone from within my friend list or a page (I don‚Äôt know as I followed/Liked tons of pages) was behaving mischievously and made a false accusation or report over my profile for no solid reason. What‚Äôs more, I did not do anything wrong ever since I use Facebook, or use the service for illegal purposes. Pretty please review my account suspension that does not hold water and reinstate it in next to no time. Please reach out to me please. It is the quarantine period and I need to work from home. Not to mention I have other foreign accounts that I link FB to login with. Thank you for your concern. Why do I have to bear a fault that is not mine?"
4,Mzkishanicole,"November 14, 2019",2,"Ok app, people you may know feature is annoying The app is ok to deal with but the people you may know feature is completely annoying and frustrating. I must say it‚Äôs a nice feature but it gets frustrating when you remove people and the next day or a few days later they show up again as people you may know. Facebook needs to add a delete button for that and not just the remove button or the remove button should remove that person and their profile permanently because hitting the remove button only brings that person profile back up within a day or a few days. I‚Äôm completely irritated with it because if I hit the remove bottom it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know that person, I don‚Äôt want to know that person, or don‚Äôt want to be friends with that person. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time ‚Äúremoving‚Äù but not permanently removing people from the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù only for them to pop back up as people I may know 24-48hrs later!! IT‚ÄôS ANNOYING. STOP IT FACEBOOK LET ME PERMANENTLY REMOVE PEOPLE I DON‚ÄôT KNOW AND/OR DON‚ÄôT WANT TO KNOW OR BE BOTHERED WITH WITHOUT HAVING THEM POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. REVAMP THE ‚ÄúPEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW‚Äù FEATURE SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER MANAGED BY US!! Thanks üò§üò§"
5,Valensghost,"November 16, 2019",2,"Issues that need fixing There are several things that are frustrating.  1- if I mark See posts first, that means I want to see this persons posts first ‚Äî NOT three days later, and not after seeing countless posts from people not marked See first. See first means see first.  2 - when I scroll through my newsfeed I doesn‚Äôt want it to stop after 3 or 4 posts.  I want it to keep scrolling.  When I‚Äôve seen enough I will quit. If I delete the app it and reinstall, it will work for awhile but will behave the same way again soon.  3-  if I see a post on my Facebook iPad app, I should be able to also see it on my iPhone Facebook app.  Why aren‚Äôt these two newsfeeds consistent? 4 - if I have a custom list or a smart list, why can‚Äôt I click on that list and see posts from just those people?  5- if there are birthdays or events that show up in the right hand column, I don‚Äôt want to see the word DONE, I want to see the event or birthday.  Again, I can get this to work again if I delete and reinstall the app. Perhaps rather than working on enhancements the developers just need to fix the bugs, and then be sure future bug fixes don‚Äôt break things again."
6,Pikaboo09,"February 17, 2019",3,"New update causing newsfeed to freeze Didn‚Äôt have this problem until yesterday when the new update kicked in. Everything else works fine, notifications, clicking through group posts and whatnot. But as soon as I go to news feed before or after doing other things on the app it just freezes. I‚Äôve reset the app, I‚Äôve reset my phone, I‚Äôve cleared all of Facebook‚Äôs caches, and I‚Äôm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling next."
7,ehmob,"March 17, 2020",2,"WHAT IS GOING ON??? A couple of my posts are being removed as going against Community Standards regarding spam. One was an historical article entitled ‚ÄúCoronasvirus and the Sun: a Lesson from the 1918 Influenza Pandemic‚Äù (I posted one and the other that appears on my timeline I was tagged in) The other post that was removed as spam was regarding digitized artwork from Paris museums entitled ‚ÄúParis Museums Put 100,000 Images Online for Unrestricted Public Use‚Äù. In this case I did post both, the first time was March 4th, the second time was March 16 with a title that suggested a wonderful way to view the art work - by streaming the site. A form of entertainment that is both beautiful and educational. I would not be writing this here except for the fact that there is no longer a place on the app under Help and Support were I could pose questions or defend my posts. I was also unable to find FB‚Äôs definition of spam. Did I miss something or miss an update? I do try to update regularly. Or perhaps the most recent update for my phone, needs to get some more bugs worked out and improvements made. "
8,Daaabby,"November 2, 2019",1,"Terrible app, terrible website I hate Facebook. There's more things than I want to even write out. The security/customer service is pure garbage. Why? Because they don't have customer service! My Instagram (of course Facebook owns Instagram) got hacked and the situation was so complex that there was no way the automated response service could help with it. Come to find out there's no live customer support... Honestly, how is that even legal???? Does it even matter how many accounts there are on Instagram? It's not like Mark Zuckerberg and Co have no money to hire people or something? I don't know maybe I'm just crazy. Because I thought they were pretty rich."
9,So Done!,"October 24, 2018",1,"Someone LIED to you Whomever told you this latest update was a great idea, SHOULD BE FIRED. 1)When notifications come in that I‚Äôve been tagged or someone has replied to a comment I made, it no longer takes you to the post, just to the comment. So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There‚Äôs even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to  their page, I haven‚Äôt been blocked and they call me to say ‚Äúdid you see my last post‚Äù and all I see is nothing. "
10,Amyncosolo,"October 3, 2017",2,"Shutting down I don't know why but lately Facebook app has been shutting down and going to my main screen while I'm reading somethingüò°very annoying!!! Fix this bug please! It also refreshes on its own. That's really annoying too when you are going through comments and then back out wanting to continue where you were before going to the comments and it decides on its own ""nope you were done scrolling"" üôÑ "
11,Diane Harris,"October 10, 2017",3,"Irritating App The app has been driving me crazy for months now. If I stay on the Facebook page, it only blacks out once or twice per evening. If I want to read something (my cousin's newspaper article, for instance) posted by my friends, the app blacks out every time and if I want to continue on Facebook, I have to open the app all over again and hope I can find my place. I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing!  Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?"
12,Kristycake,"November 6, 2017",1,"Enough with refreshing the newsfeed! I never write reviews, but these recent updates make me want to delete Facebook. 6 months ago, if I needed to pause my Facebook scrolling go do something else, I would just click someone‚Äôs picture and it would ‚Äúhold my place‚Äù in my newsfeed. This was great. I‚Äôm a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we‚Äôre set! I‚Äôm tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load.  I can‚Äôt imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to ‚Äúok‚Äù these poorly planned ‚Äúenhancements‚Äù."
13,changemessenger,"October 12, 2018",1,"Facebook Messenger Please find a way not to show all your friends when you‚Äôre on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn‚Äôt want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger!  It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don‚Äôt know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I‚Äôm a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do."
14,Sheryl1468,"November 11, 2018",2,"No notifications about my posts! For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess.  The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don‚Äôt load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself.  All I see are notifications about my friends‚Äô posts.  Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications.  When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn‚Äôt refresh to show any more than exactly 20.  Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it‚Äôs not because of anything I did or didn‚Äôt do.  AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I‚Äôm limited to 20 again.   AND notifications for my posts still aren‚Äôt in the list.  I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn‚Äôt fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions."
15,Matti moo,"December 3, 2018",1,"If it isn‚Äôt broken, don‚Äôt fix it Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It‚Äôs amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that‚Äôs across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I‚Äôve done my best to continually update my setting but it‚Äôs getting crazy. Now I‚Äôll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don‚Äôt need a red push notification making it seem like I should."
16,The lord is exceptional,"August 4, 2019",1,Following the prompts doesn‚Äôt work at all I have follow all the necessary prompts that i am suppose to take and every since i got my new phone but it won‚Äôt let me get back into the app at all when i have repeatedly taken four selfies on yesterday with me whole up different numbers and i have taken some other selfies with me whole up different other numbers today as well but by me repeatedly doing this i am putting myself at risk repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again and if you are a new user to Facebook don‚Äôt trust it if you get log out and can‚Äôt get back in because you switch mobile companies and you don‚Äôt have your old phone number or old mobile phone and if you more than Facebook post they won‚Äôt take that down neither once putting you at risk for hackers so if you are a new Facebook user don‚Äôt trust it if don‚Äôt be put at risk for haveing more than one Facebook page and post i will not give Facebook any type of ratings for haveing my identity expose in a manner in which i just stated in this paragraph it‚Äôs wrong and will be getting in touching with the Federal Trade commission center since i no way to deactivate all my pages and post.
17,shortcxke,"December 20, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs good. Not perfect, but good enough. Just be smart and don‚Äôt click on random links, don‚Äôt give away your password to anybody, don‚Äôt accept suspicious links even from your friends unless it‚Äôs 100% sure that it‚Äôs your friend who messaged you. There are many cases that people are ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, when in reality they just gave away their password. I‚Äôve been using the Internet since I was in 3rd grade and i‚Äôve never been hacked. I‚Äôm in college now!"
18,Homanomana,"February 8, 2020",2,"Little details make a big difference Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I‚Äôm just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it‚Äôs entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It‚Äôs frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It‚Äôs too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you‚Äôve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you‚Äôve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button so you don‚Äôt risk closing your page. It‚Äôs little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you‚Äôre on the verge of falling apart."
19,Allymations15,"November 30, 2019",2,Seriously? Okay so well I love the app. I get to talk to my family and join groups specifically the ones about animals and anime‚Äôs I like/have. 
20,asmileforjenna,"April 8, 2018",1,"Nothing loads anymore... When I open the app I can only see a handful of posts from days ago. When I scroll to the bottom, the app doesn‚Äôt load any more posts. Refreshing does nothing. I don‚Äôt get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don‚Äôt load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don‚Äôt show up. "
21,cevans172,"August 18, 2018",3,"Nothing loads anymore I‚Äôve been a faithful Facebook user for years. It is my go to social media platform and I love it. However for the last couple months I‚Äôve noticed it won‚Äôt load random things. Images, comments, and video will stop loading if I‚Äôve been scrolling for a minute or two. Sometimes I‚Äôll be just hopping on and comments won‚Äôt load for something. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm on WiFi or data. I‚Äôve even gone as far as to uninstall it and reinstall it twice this week, which worked for that night and stopped the next day. I never used to have this problem until after I got the iPhone X. My husband just switched phones to the iPhone X like me (got mine on Mother‚Äôs Day) and now he experiences it too, and we have friends who say they noticed it as well on this phone but when they switched phones, it was all good. Is there possibly a compatibility flaw between Facebook and the new iPhone? I hate not being able to use it like I used to. Hopefully this can be fixed so we can keep using it."
22,Tootsdm,"September 4, 2018",1,Most frustrating app ever I have been a holdout since Facebook started. I finally gave in so I could see what was going on with family.  This has been the most stressful annoying experience ever.  No tech support while developer Mark is a billionaire.   I also several times a week only have about 6 items and the feed ends.  Log out and back in. Did setting for a couple people to be on the top of my feed.  Never are.  My daughter is trying to Like things and gets a ‚Äòthis action is blocked ‚Äò reply and tells it 20 times that it‚Äôs a mistake and then it happens again.  Then it locked her account.   Then you have to identify 5 people who are friends to convince FB that you are still really you.  Then she had to change password two different times in two days and she‚Äôs an expert at this app.  Ruining my vacation trying to post our things and encounter glitch after glitch.  Oh log out AGAIN!!!! Try AGAIN!!   By the volume of all these crappy reviews I would think the boss would want to fix these bugs and actually be an above standard app.   Guess you don‚Äôt care anymore once you get really rich.   Hate this app.
23,TamaraMonkey,"September 5, 2018",1,"Unwanted sounds. Huge unusable app. I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It‚Äôs obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea."
24,Xavier Wolfen,"April 1, 2020",1,"Not worth it, borderline violates freedom of speech They‚Äôre run almost completely by bots it seems and you can be banned from posting for the most ridiculous things. Wasn‚Äôt like this before, but either they‚Äôre under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn‚Äôt even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I‚Äôm in (I‚Äôm in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I‚Äôm going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I‚Äôm blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It‚Äôs 8:58 now and I‚Äôm still blocked, but no explanation this time. I‚Äôve had posts taken down before that don‚Äôt break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don‚Äôt offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it. Even been banned just for posting my opinions, no threats, no attacking people, just operating my right to freedom of speech! They shouldn‚Äôt call themselves a public platform if they can‚Äôt uphold the rights of the public."
25,Sarikay1994,"January 17, 2020",1,"Buggy in the app, buggy in the browser, just can‚Äôt win. I use my iPad exclusively for managing a business page on facebook. IT IS INFURIATING. Nothing works properly. The app skips around, comments don‚Äôt post occasionally, and the worst is trying to dig through a whole post to find where someone has tagged me in a comment. For some reason, notifications don‚Äôt bring me to the tag or reply, it just sends me to the general post or group and I have to DIG for it. It‚Äôs a huge waste of my time and a hinderance to my business. Then, in the browser, it inserts double spaces every time I hit the space bar. This is a confirmed Facebook problem, not the fault of Apple, safari, or chrome. It is the same across all browsers. Some have theorized that this is so facebook can force you to use the app, where they have more room for advertising, but THE APP DOESN‚ÄôT WORK EITHER. If I was not dependent on Facebook for my business, I flat out would not use it. It‚Äôs terrible. Terrible platform, terrible apps, terrible algorithm codes. You‚Äôd think a multi million dollar company would at least be competent enough to resolve the double-space issue in the browser. Ridiculous. FIX IT."

27,Tazzie637,"April 3, 2020",1,"Um, what?! I have an idea!! Instead of pretending your app is perfect, how about make a place where people can actually report issues with the programming?? Like false information!! If I put someone on ignore and have their messages go into the spam folder, why can they still call me thru messenger?? Why am I getting the notification that they are calling when it clearly states they will NOT be able to call?? Fix that.. Also, I loathe that when I pause a video and put my phone down, the video starts playing again.. That makes absolutely no sense at all.. Why have a pause button?? It seems like the ‚Äúupdates‚Äù that happen every two weeks are just adding more minor inconveniences and prohibiting more and more options, like changing your name.. Also, why are people I have on my blocked list placed on the list of people to share posts with?? I went to share a post on a specific persons page and two people I have on my blocked list were on that list of people to share with.. WHAT?! Makes so sense!! Please fix the real issues and stop adding garbage to the app.. Sound good?? You have the resources, your facility is huge enough.."
28,yainara,"December 23, 2019",1,"Worst App ever I am literally hating facebook so much! Every update to ‚Äúmake facebook better‚Äù is a scam! Everything gets changed every 2 week and that‚Äôs not to mention such a trashy algorithm. For starters I am being charged $25 on my new page for ads when I have never run an add on this page. However it still telling me my card is not going trough and I‚Äôm just soo confused as to why am I being charged, thankfully I have never put down my card information. Tried contact them and see why it‚Äôs saying I owe $25 dollar but no response... customer service is just trash and non existent. Every time I upload a video or a prerecorded storie it takes several hours and sometimes days to actually upload ... that‚Äôs ridiculous!! "
29,Keetgi,"February 3, 2020",2,"Updating the App into Uselessness I am a member of a lot of groups and rely on my email notifications to decide which posts to actually read and which to ignore. Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I‚Äôm assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What‚Äôs worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the ‚Äúview on Facebook‚Äù button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it‚Äôs doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn‚Äôt show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else. Stop updating the app to make it less convenient for users!"
30,Spotteddog367sweet,"December 12, 2017",1,"Facebook sometimes listens to my cell phone calls A few times I have been talking to friends on my cell phone about a product a friend likes or I like. Minutes later I see ads for the same product. One time a friend said she would like one of those walk in bath tubs because she was afraid of falling. I hung up the phone and checked my Facebook wall only to find an ad for the walk in tubs AND for one of those ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" services. Facebook searches through my private address book and suggests that I might want to ""friend"" people they find. There is so much fake news that shows up on my wall. Some of the ads are so obviously fake and they show up everywhere on FB. Ones about alive celebrities where the ad says so and so died and no one knew she died. Others that say things like Joy Behr is quitting the View because she uses a certain face cream. Our president spends all his waking hours lying to the American public. I don't want to be bombarded with more lies. I wish I could trust Facebook. I like being in touch with friends of my choosing. I don't like being manipulated by Facebook. They are very invasive."

But facebook should provide strong control over the user‚Äôs photo.. so that i wont be downloaded in other devices. Even though some of pic may be screenshot. Facebook should also implement a system like face identifying AI to identify the use of multiple photos of same user over different account.

32,Craigbiz,"May 6, 2018",1,"Privacy Wanted I am a very private individual. I keep my friends list very limited to under 20 people tops (mostly family and not even friends & co-workers) so that I can share video and photos with them about life events. I also post news commentary. I know about the NSA thing with Snowden. This is not what has upset me. Now, Facebook is publicly threatening that instead of just the algorithm and a relatively small team of content curators based out of Facebook's HQ, they are planning to hire an army of up to 20,000 human content police! I have real fears that one of these 20,000 strong may end up being a nosy neighbor down the street. I don't like the idea of having 20,000 people capable of seeing my posts that I don't even know who they are. The NSA is in Maryland, Facebook is in California. I was not worried about people from either of those groups being a neighbor living next door to me that I do not want to have access to my information! I am very weird in what I post (ufo stuff).

That‚Äôs not it! Until it happened to me! I have never purchased or looked up sudifed online or anything like it even Tylenol or anything else online  pain reliever in my life. One day at work I had a headache and asked my coworker for sudifed and and she mentioned the word and then I did that was the only time we ever talked about it and sure enough I check my FB 24 hours later like everyone else within a day or two and as pops up ‚ÄúSudifed extra strength‚Äù very next day remember I have never bought or looked this up I never needed to.

Anyone can be accused of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù and will be punished for it, even when nothing remotely resembling hate speech was said. Meanwhile, someone can make one racist comment after another, get reported, and nothing happens to them. Pictures showing no nudity or sexual content get flagged for ‚Äúviolating community standards‚Äù while pictures actually containing nudity, are allowed to stay. Typing is becoming nearly impossible. The space button either doesn‚Äôt work, inserts ‚Äú.‚Äù, or completely changes the typed words into gibberish. Using predictive texting results in more gibberish. I could go on and on.

A new issue has popped up - when you share a post and select ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù so you can add notes, the predictive text doesn‚Äôt work properly. If you‚Äôre typing and then click on the completed word and hit space afterward, it actually backspaces and erases the last letter of the word that was just put there. If you don‚Äôt catch it and retype the last letter and hit space and start typing the next word, you end up with one long word instead of two. This is is s new glitch that Facebook hasn‚Äôt bothered to fix in its many updates since the glitch started. Also now when I open the app, I have maybe two or three posts and it will not scroll down any further. I guess Mark Zuckerburg is too busy helping Trump and fascism to really give a rat‚Äôs behind about what‚Äôs going on with the app. (You can catch a thirty day ban if you insult a snowflake Republican, but by all means start a white nationalist page that openly promotes sedition because that‚Äôs okay according to Facebook.)"

And it *acts* like it's updating, so if I try to scroll all the way to the bottom (it only goes down about two screens' worth now) it ""glitches"" as though it's adding new notifications and I lose my place and it takes forever to get the notifications hidden and sometimes even then they still take up all the space in the notification list. I miss *everything*. People say they tag me in stuff, poke me, put stuff on my wall... I will never see it! I guess now we just wait til whatever the thing is that takes over from fb.

But I was in multiple mom & small shop groups & these ladies literally bully & harass other moms & I reported the page for bullying. There was no reason for such mean & awful behavior. We‚Äôre moms, ADULTS. These women are 30 & 40 years old being mean girls just because people have different opinions & different taste. Facebook got back with me & said ‚Äúalthough we are aware there are some bullying content on this page, it does not break our Facebook rules/guidelines‚Äù ...I was furious. Does it take a person(s) to take their life due to bullying before a page is taken down?? I have a 0% bullying tolerance. & believe it should not be allowed AT ALL. Yes, people can have different opinions, but to put someone down over small shops/what you choose to do as a mom?? No. I‚Äôve lost too many people to bullying & it should NOT be accepted. "

I have been having to constantly turn off notifications for random people. Every day the past several days. If I want notifications set for people, then I will set them!

Take the gif icon, it‚Äôs a royal pita being inside the comment box, especially with the touch keyboards - hard to avoid with a finger tip when editing a comment. Come to the end of a line and try to edit it, it‚Äôs hard to avoid hitting the stupid thing. Make it optional! I will never ever use a gif in a comment. Plus I do not want to see them, so let us block gif comments. New bells and whistles are meaningless and continue to make FB the number 1 consumer of battery life.

This past year I‚Äôve had a hard time seeing the posts from pages I love and to see new posts I have to go onto the page. I should be seeing a lot of their posts because I‚Äôm liking commenting and frequenting the page all the time and to top that off I got a top fan badge from a page I posted one comment on and never from the pages I frequent which I don‚Äôt care about or understand the idea of badges but I still just found it funny that it happened. Also on any public post I can see that there is thousands of comments and when I go to the comment section it says most relevant comments are selected and there is none. And there‚Äôs no menu to change it like there is on my friends posts. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and I find it hard to believe that out of thousands of comments you find none of them relevant. We all know you have an extremist left wing political view Facebook but it doesn‚Äôt give you the right hide information from people that don‚Äôt think the same as you.

I have no respect for the company today, as they've diluted the user quality and have begun to focus on profit over people. What's the point of having a separate app for messages!?!?

I offered repeatedly to give her money, which she would not take, she needed legal advice but had only enough to provide for her family. The Democrats say one thing but constantly do another.

Should be at least 5 posts a day..... also needs a better reporting system, allowing people to report perfectly legit items that meet the standards just cuz they don't like you personally is you allowing fb members to be harassed, you don't even review the items for weeks and thats if you review them at all! How does someone get flagged for selling a curling iron or video game system?!?! It's garbage. Constantly getting restricted or flagged for perfectly good items that meet the standards is harassment!!!! Also sellers should have a place to go that perfectly states what is and isn't allowed, what posting guidelines are and how many items you can post at what frequency so they can meet your guidelines! Having no information available and constantly changing your standards is kinda ignorant!"
113,Captain Mongoose123,"May 26, 2018",1,"So bad that I had to write a review Facebook is where I like to share with my friends and family back home photos and videos of my life living overseas. However, I have the hardest time doing that because of several reasons: (1) There‚Äôs a 40 photo limit, which is an inconvenience because users who take a lot of photos and videos would have to upload their photos in batches and it can be very time consuming. (2) The app lags while typing out captions and completely crashes after maybe the 10th caption, thus wasting a lot of time. (3) The MOST frustrating thing is that after all that typing and finally clicking upload, none of the photos upload. So I have to do it all over again. Oh wait, actually they did upload...3 weeks later so I ended up with doubles of the same photos. This happens every single time without fail and it is a complete waste of my time. This app should make it more convenient to upload photos straight from your phone, but instead it makes it 10 times more complicated."

Now I mainly just stick with communicating witn the people in the different FB im in. Side note: most are health related. This is by far the best time imo, to create a separate app just for communicating with your groups. Call it FB Groups or whatever, you want but it needs to happen soon.

While scrolling, if your finger is anywhere near a video it will open it and then proceed to take an eternity to close out so you can go back to your news feed which will have, without being asked, refreshed and updated. This forcing you to look for 16 hours for the post you actually wanted to see. Once you find said post the app will inevitably crash, where you will no longer feel inclined to look for that post anymore but instead cry within yourself and wonder why they can't just fix the app. Then when you find something else that you like or want to react to you have to press the like button 4 times before it responds.

So each version you use is different even though they‚Äôre all your account. Now with the newest Apple iOS update you can‚Äôt read the comments in the visitors posts on public pages. They constantly scroll back to the top without even touching anything on the screen. I‚Äôve sent in numerous reports to the Help Center but nothing is being done to fix it. I haven‚Äôt updated my old iPhone 5s just so I can keep up with the visitors posts on the public pages I follow. That shouldn‚Äôt be necessary in this day and age. Fix it please. Also while you‚Äôre at it quit doing useless updates that aren‚Äôt necessary everyday most people don‚Äôt even have access to half the things you claim to offer in the updates. I know I don‚Äôt.
153,Ridndrty800,"October 24, 2017",1,"Latest Update for iPhone Facebook and ios11.3 dont mesh well. FB needs more updates so that our timeline are in order as posted, be more current with posted from friends, not showing up until a day later. Currently all i see on my timeline are day old posts every time i open FB on top of that its the same one from ours earlier. Just because a friend post something doesnt mean i want to see the same post again if i didnt make a comment on it to have it recycle back to top of timeline, nor do we want to keep seeing it just because others commented. This update is doing the same thing it has done several updates ago. It has progressively gotten worse. I know alot of people ive talked to are looking for s new social media site to change to. Just saying....oh and when we toggle between screens for multitasking after scrolling down 30-40 posts, when switching back to FB, it starts you back over at the very top where we started at to begin with which is so irritating!"

And it‚Äôs never the friends I even want to see updates on. For goodness sake it doesn‚Äôt even give me updates on people I‚Äôve marked as family. I learned this because during an entire day I only saw 3 posts from friends or anything related to my friends and the rest was all business pages and ad videos. So I went to a family member‚Äôs Facebook page and it turns out for weeks they‚Äôve been posting things I‚Äôve never even seen. Thanks Facebook.

The reason I‚Äôve decided to review the app after all these years is the recent loss of the ‚Äúview as,‚Äù feature for mobile.

166,tguysky,"May 14, 2019",1,"Update broke in-app notifications I never review apps, but this last update pretty much defeats the purpose of the notifications bell within the app. Prior to recent update, if you clicked on a notification under the little bell in the bottom right corner, the app would re-direct you to the post in which the notification was referencing [IE: ‚ÄúMary Black commented on a post you are following in group X‚Äù or ‚Äú8 new posts in random online garage sale group‚Äù]. This was so incredibly useful as it took you right to the new posts, and now all it does it take you to the page of the person or group so you have to search around to try and find the post with new activity, which is incredibly inefficient for buy/sell groups where there are tons of new posts all the time. It makes absolutely no sense to delete the app‚Äôs capability to automatically redirect you to the post when clicked on from the notification feed.

Meanwhile, videos of actual violence by Antifa or other anti America groups, continue to thrive and flourish because they aren‚Äôt against standards. A funny comic means 7 day suspension, but one story that I complained about was within standards. That was a couple saying the mass shooting at a Sutherland Springs Church never happened. My daughter worked as an ER nurse when victims were brought in. That post was very offensive to the victims, family, community, and First Responders. But it was left in place.

If it hides anyone else, all I'll be able to see is a newsfeed full of advertisements I don't want. To make it worse, before I updated I could toggle between top posts and most recent posts. Now I can't. I can only take what Facebook wants me to see. I never wanted to see the top posts, I ALWAYS had to toggle to most recent first thing, or Facebook would show me the same three posts for five days. Now I can't do that. I hate this. They are cramming too much on a page, it's too busy and it's nothing I want to see. The app just keeps getting worse and worse. Can I roll back to the version from eight months ago?

281,Ambertena,"December 16, 2017",2,"Worthless update! My Facebook app (iPhone) updated itself on the 14th and has been complete garbage ever since. Not only do I hate the new way comments appear over posts (it looks like the post has been shared with a new description), but I suddenly can't edit comments (the ""more"" option leads only to delete), and about 75% of the time I get a comment notification, I click on it and it says the page/post couldn't be found! I have to guess which post it was on and go searching on my own to find any responses. When I am brought to the correct post, it leaves me at the top, so I have to scroll to find where the comment may be (used to be directed straight to the new comment from the notification). Also, things just look really stupid. Whatever you did to reformat things was a bad idea. Please fix these bugs or bring back the previous version!"

You guys deactivated my account and is (again) FORCING me to send in some type of identification just so i can use a social media app? No other app does that except you guys & i REFUSE to send in my PERSONAL information for an app. I used facebook daily & i had years worth of photos on there & now i cant even get them back. Facebook is not the top app in the store to require all of this. I didnt want to use my government name because i use facebook for family and close friends who all calls me by my nickname! i wanted them to only be able to find me , no one else. so by me using my government name that allows so many people to stalk my page without my permission. im furious"

Among all the things other people are saying, the issue that is most critical to me is the fact that after your update on November 1st I believe, we can no longer add non-photo content to albums. I run a daily music album/page where I share a video post with my description and a separate artist portrait that both go into the same photo album every day so that that people can access all the posts in one place. I have been doing this for almost a year and after hundreds of postings it suddenly no longer gives the option to add the videos to the album. This is absolutely critical and needs to be fixed ASAP.

This app doesn‚Äôt let you be the first since you can‚Äôt organize the listings by ‚Äúnewly listed‚Äù.  It picks which ones it thinks you‚Äôd like.  So week old listings pop up first along side ones that were posted an hour ago. You have to scroll forever to find something that was posted within the past 10 minutes. This company‚Äôs obsession with mind control is really quite disgusting. You see all these fb commercials about them  trying to gain your trust back. Rubbish. Stop trying to think for me. Stop making me stay on fb longer by putting all the new listings at the bottom. It‚Äôs no wonder why everyone under 30 is deleting this app.  Bunch of invasive creeps working over there.

Mostly if you have a lot of data for them to store and no crazy engagement with they childish likes competition plus ad clicks with clickbait. It would be hilarious if wasn‚Äôt tragic. Unfortunately I‚Äôve my hard drive with my children birth photos and I had in my mind that I had them on Facebook and they would be there perennially. As any other mega multinational Facebook doesn‚Äôt and will never care for their users it‚Äôs a matter of profit and profit only. Thanks for nothing."

This update comes with an issue that won‚Äôt allow the personal timeline to load, amongst other features having slow loading speeds (not related to my speeds on either cellular or Wi-Fi). The app would be a lot better if the Facebook team took the time to fully review all bugs or potential crashes before posting an update.

Here‚Äôs the tea: I‚Äôve been using Facebook since pretty much forever and I kid you not, this is one of the worst app updates I‚Äôve had to endure. They‚Äôve added a feature to scroll down after clicking on a picture to view similar posts (like what was already happening with videos). The issue is that the feature is so slow. When you click on a picture, it doesn‚Äôt expand it to full size as it did before so you are forced to wait while it buffers and shows a small bar in the middle of your screen that says ‚Äúscroll down‚Äù. I WANT TO SEE THE PICTURE FULL SIZE AND THAT‚ÄôS WHY I CLICKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. It also won‚Äôt let you exit from the picture after the buffering has run its course.

599,Erexodius,"April 17, 2019",1,"Notifications Ok, while I do love Facebook and will never stop using it this latest update has brought an issue for me. When I comment on a post, share one, or even post my own, sometimes I am not receiving notifications of comments. This doesn‚Äôt happen all the time but, since this last update, when it started, it has happened enough to irritate me greatly. The reason I even noticed it was scrolling through my newsfeed and I would see such posts that had additional comments and realizing I never not once received a notification for it. Yes I make sure my notifications or turned on and I‚Äôve also triple checked to make sure I didn‚Äôt simply over look it. It would be greatly appreciated if Facebook could fix this issue and I can go back to loving Facebook completely."

601,Pro-Vaccine CHOICE,"March 13, 2019",1,"Censorship I think we can all agree that the vaccine debate has become a pretty big topic now in 2019. Some people believe it is causing problems, other believe that people have the right to speak openly about their fears and concerns. Today, Facebook decided to take that right away from hundreds of thousands of people. I feel that this goes against our right as grown individuals to speak freely about concerning topics and to educate ourselves on both sides of the story. A mother just mentioned to me that a picture of her own son having a seizure (within an hour of being vaccinated) was removed from Facebook and that her commenting, posting, sharing, reacting and Facebook messenger right have been revoked afterwards. This is happening to thousands of other people expressing their opinions and concerns. This is wrong and Facebook, you should be ashamed."

And to provide rapid, although often times incorrect, current events, it is an awful necessity. And that‚Äôs despite the horrible ads that spy on you or steer you toward an untrustworthy site to steal your identity. Unfortunately, with the most recent update, I can only view about 10 featured items in my newsfeed before I cannot refresh or see anything else.

My first complaint was going to be about how not funny it was that the app constantly reset my setting for the in app sound even when I didn‚Äôt update the app. I was  constantly having to turn my in app sound off EVERY time I opened the app. I found this to be disturbing and odd which made me feel like what the hell else is FB doing to accounts without the users knowledge. The sounds are ANNOYING btw. I recently updated the app and now it crashes out of nowhere. The only use I get out of this app is reading posts and some support communicating with parents from some groups created for children with special needs but other than that I don‚Äôt use it because of the frustrating crap I have mentioned above.

This I think is most of the problem. The community standards are loosely enforced and definitions of what is acceptable are too vague.  There is a lot of bullying and a lot of dangerous posts regarding religious and ethnic discrimination that gets reported and somehow is determined not to be against the community standards. The answer from FB is to block the person or unfollow. If the person is a public figure in the community it‚Äôs important for us to see what they are saying and it should be the responsibility of Facebook to remove harmful posts. There should be an option to comment on why you are reporting something because it seems those reviewing the reports are missing details.

Before this update, Facebook was one of the better social medias because you could watch endless amounts of videos with the occasional ad video between them. Now, almost every video you watch has an ad right in the middle of the video (sometimes in the middle of a sentence) it's very frustrating and takes away from what made Facebook great (the ability to just sit and scroll). Overall the update makes Facebook inferior to its social media competition that does not place ads in the middle of a video if at all. So, if you want to get back to the old Facebook i recommend Instagram because it's just the more modern easier to use platform now."

Facebook admits to manipulating users emotions on a large scale. Congress has directly questioned bigtech companies about ‚Äúprogramming people‚Äù using algorithms. The experiments done by Dr Pavlov prove animals(people are animals) can be brainwashed with visual and auditory stimulants on a biological level.

It either only displays one or two items or displays a message that it can't load the newsfeed right now and I get nothing.  Repeated reports of this issue - Facebook has been unresponsive and has not fixed this.  I have recent model iPhone with 70mb internet connection - issue is not on my end it's this software. Fix it!!!  If give them 0 stars if I could right now.  Customer support this bad for a typical company would signal the death bell for the business.

It fails basic tasks, like keeping news feeds current, and makes simple tasks excessively tedious, like posting photos. Trying to manage a company page is so awkward and frustrating that I gave up on it. Add to that Facebook is committed not to building communities as it claims, but aggressive censorship of those who have different political opinions than that of Zuckerberg and his minions.

Why is it so many people trust and use an app when it screens posts so that you see what they want? I often receive notices that so and so posted on such and such a page. Click on the notice and nothing. In order to view said post you have to reverse the process and go to the person‚Äôs home page just to see what they posted. Oh but sometimes it‚Äôll show up a few days later when everyone is done talking about the topic and know one cares anymore if you have anything to contribute to the conversation. Leave the posts in chronological order or at least make it a setting that can be adjusted by users/admins. Some of pages are used in hopes for communicating r messages.

759,Gilbert.lafebre.3,"July 2, 2019",2,Not fluid at all. Facebook is one of the only apps left that still has the volume bar that blocks what you are viewing. The Marketplace is really hard to swipe out of a post or exit out of a picture using gestures. I can‚Äôt stand using marketplace sometimes when I am in a hurry. I have to keep swiping and swiping and nothing happens. Idk how the developers keep looking over and think it‚Äôs okay in comparison to other social media platforms that are really fluid and easy to use. The volume bar is just dumb on their end at this point.

Whereas pics with exposed boobs and full on sex acts they see no problem with. Today for no reason what so ever every comment I make anywhere is labelled ‚Äúspam‚Äù. I literally can‚Äôt comment on anything! Who made these security bots a drunk at 2 in the morning. Why are there people to look into this? How about instead of constant updates to make the app look sleeker you get people to handle the security bots better. I doubt they will listen. The only reason I still use Facebook is just because it is easier to get into accounts on other websites using it. Other then that screw you Mark Zuckerberg there is a good reason why a lot of people don‚Äôt like you.

Every single time I update the app, the cheesy in-app sounds turn right back on. The setting is already buried 3 or 4 menus deep, making it a hassle to turn the sound off. You post a barrage of updates and simple things are still being overlooked.

Also, when there is new notifications, they don‚Äôt load until you force close the app and re-open it, the main newsfeed completely stops after about 7 posts (meaning you can‚Äôt keep scrolling to see more posts), and last but not least; there is CONSTANT problems with friends and photos being deleted miraculously!!

You will see that 35 people viewed and then the next day all you see are the people who liked it.

1085,Lionheart6576,"May 20, 2019",1,Facebook lacks help service I‚Äôm writing this review based on a situation where last week I believed my profile was hacked because in the middle on a conversation on messenger I was logged lit & tried to log back in to find out my account is disabled. On top of my Instagram being disabled too a few minutes after that. I‚Äôm in dire crying help to figure out what happened & Facebook terms page says I have to file an appeal and I wrote them 4 times to pled my case and got nothing back. This is very disappointing and I followed the terms for years without warning I get disabled. Facebook needs a customer service phone number or hotline or even someone online to do live chat to fix issues like that. I‚Äôm in panic mode now.

Maybe the buyer has to select whether it‚Äôs finance or buy price, and while shoppers see the full price, when they click the post, it shows the payment option in details.

I can now see why the reviews aren‚Äôt good. The app is not at all self intuitive and it was very complex to learn it first in my opinion. The app was also extremely glitchy, giving me a random birthdate which I did not put in and a random name which I did not put in. They‚Äôre notifications on the app that would not go away even if I clicked on it. Not impressed especially after all these years. I also change my name to my real name but it still says John Smith.

You will constantly miss posts that are important or time-sensitive because Facebook decided that showing you a friend's cat video from last week was more likely to get you to stay on the site longer.

Little by little that functionality has diminished to the point that it‚Äôs completely disappeared and now there‚Äôs no way to schedule posts using a smartphone or tablet. Why? Why change something that so many businesses find useful? Scheduling posts has been replaced with saving drafts and it‚Äôs terribly frustrating.

There‚Äôs a button to remove the marketplace frames and when you click it there is a button that says report when you click that it is a dead end and goes to nothing. Thanks Zuckerberg!

The accounts are never taken off Facebook and they continue scamming people for iTunes cards and scam them into laundering money. The same pictures are used over and over but Facebook does nothing to stop the creation of these new accounts. I personally have reported 78 accounts ALL using the last name Deweese and the real soldier's photos and family photos. NONE HAVE BEEN REMOVED and it's been months of reporting. Facebook doesn't offer a way to LINK reporting so Facebook can address the multiple fake accounts.

Now they‚Äôre nuking (deleting) almost all animal groups, even ones that don‚Äôt even allow sales. They‚Äôve taken down fish groups, dog groups, reptile/snake groups, and cat groups. And most even prohibit sales in said groups. What‚Äôs next Facebook? We aren‚Äôt allowed to post animals at all? Facebook is going downhill now. Time to switch over to new platforms I guess. I had hope in this app, but I guess I got my hopes up for nothing. What a bummer. I get the no animal sales policy... but c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs stupid. Hope something turns around soon for this app."

1396,mizzknb,"January 2, 2020",1,App Won‚Äôt Stay Open For a while now I have been having issues with the Facebook App. One issue is that videos do not play. When I would attempt to play a video on Facebook the video either stops or has no sound. It is horrible because I miss out on important videos from family. The other issue that I have with Facebook is that the app will abruptly close. It is very frustrating when you are looking at a page or my timeline and the app just closes. I have contacted Facebook for assistance and no response or fix. As a matter of fact when I contact them the app performs much worse than when I didn‚Äôt contact them. I have since deleted the app.

Their community standards are a way to suppress Free speech especially amongst white people and conservatives. They allow fake news from News sources and block people harshly for speaking their minds or defending their race and historical facts.

I don‚Äôt need to see things I‚Äôve already seen in the past because it has more comments or a recent comment on it. I literally scroll a few inches down and give up.

That being said, take purses for example, I understand people always out there trying to con others, but when you have proof that a name brand purse is real and all you get is your item removed because it didn‚Äôt fall in their rules. Then when you try to get actual feedback because it falls in no category of their rules no one contacts you except blocking you (AKA punish you) from using the marketplace for a while.

I‚Äôve done everything to try to fix it on my own like deleting and reloading the app, signing out and then back in, restarting my phone etc. it‚Äôs sickening. I‚Äôm about to delete my Facebook and go to Twitter or Snapchat. The only reason I‚Äôve kept it this long is for my friends and family to keep in touch with me.

I‚Äôve Googled and YouTubed to see how I can fix this but nothing comes up from this past or this recent year.

February 15th is Annoy Squidward Day, and sometimes you find that meme, but it‚Äôs not on that day, so you could assign the post a specific date and/or time to post so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it later).

It creates political bubbles that isolates people and their points of view and you lose touch with friends that may not like the same things as you. Facebook should NOT be able to dictate which friends are most important to you. 2) the newest feature which hides post commentaries after you read them is beyond annoying.

For more detailed use of the site, it has a few drawbacks, notably the inscrutable inability to tag pages. For anyone using Facebook for business purposes, not being able to tag a page you have, or pages of organizations you have a biz relationship with, this is almost a deal-breaker. The other functions all seem to perform predictably, and well."

They have contrived a covert way of shutting out users especially not so active or lucrative. I‚Äôve reached our three times nothing. So no need to set up an alternative account. I‚Äôm gone.

Last week, my account was hacked into, and I was almost scammed by one of the MANYYYY international scammers on this platform and instead of taking the side of a loyal, clean user, Facebook locked ME out of my account for reporting them. It's been a week and I can't get In. And customer support?? Lol, this billion dollar company doesn't have it. Noone will respond to me. Honestly, screw Facebook. I just want access to my account to regain access to MY information, photos and college activity groups. -5 stars for Facebook!"

There is no glitch. It‚Äôs an intentional act by FB to steal our identities and sell them.

I simply tried to log in on my ipad and know I'm unable to log into my account at all. It's a bothering issue and I don't appreciate the trouble it is causing me.

The latest iPad app has a bug where when viewing your feed in landscape mode if you click a picture to enlarge it the picture will open enlarged in portrait mode.  Extremely annoying.  Please fix this! who wants to constantly be turning the iPad from landscape to portrait mode to view a picture without all the clutter of the feed and comments.  App is useless to me until this is fixed.  Guess I‚Äôll go back to viewing everything in safari for now.

Most of the time it will let me scroll down only a few posts and that is it. Nothing past that. I might get a circle telling me it is searching but it doesn‚Äôt do anything. Sometimes it will only give me the circle without any post. I am in my house with WiFi full signal. Sometimes restart of the app helps, but even then it only works temporarily."

This means when I try to share something I can ONLY do so to my own timeline...not in private message, group, or friend‚Äôs page. Also, in this view you can‚Äôt just view the comments on a post without it taking you to that page. This makes it incredibly frustrating. It can take upwards of 30 times tapping most recent for the app to show you your news feed in the app and not in the mobile site. Please fix it!"

It makes me feel stressed and rushed.  I can go to the bathroom, and when I come back, the post/thread I was on is gone. Also, when I copy a post, why not make it to where it copies the person who wrote it and the date too. It takes so much time to hand type that.  I also wish you would put the accurate number of notifications on the Facebook app icon. It seems like it maxes out at 99."

If I am watching a video, seconds after it starts, the app blacks out and kicks me out of FB. Not sure what you guys did in this latest ‚Äúupdate‚Äù but whatever it is, you screwed up.

The few times I actually got through filling in blanks, FB asked for a photo to verify my identity. Most of the time I got no response at all.

It was less fun when they had advertisements and the videos had an indication when the advertisement was coming so we could expect them. It became not so fun when they took that feature away and you get advertisements at random times during a video. Made me not interested in the video or the product being advertised. And made me less interested in keeping this application."

2196,KArlaRobinson,"December 12, 2019",3,Update browser website The app is cool and all but I deleted it a long time ago because it has very addictive qualities about it and I would find myself scrolling without even being conscious. But I do like to check it occasionally on my browser but it is limited on what I can and cannot do on there. I would appreciate an update on that as well. If you‚Äôre going to make an addictive app at least give the people who are smart enough a trap door or something.

My calendar that once showed all my birthdays now only posts them under hosting not on my calendar. Facebook shows no hacking or problems. Despite writing to help center problems have continued for over three weeks. As much as I like connecting with friends it does not seem secure.

Other than that, my main complaint is that things like nipples will be taken off Facebook but I have reported countless graphic violence videos and they‚Äôre said not to violate the community standards every time.

I go into a contact on my iPhone X and click on their name to have it bring me to my Facebook instead of theirs. It shows up as Samsung Facebook lite version.

The fact that any of you troglodytes can block my comment within SECONDS of me commenting shows you have filters on certain pages meanwhile racists can laugh at us, call us negative names, basically have free range to negatively criticize US but we are supposed to remain quiet and scroll past?

I used to be able to access Facebook via Safari on my iPad and it functioned exactly like my desktop Facebook access. No more.

I can‚Äôt even come up with a decent reason why the application is designed like this. Luckily for them they have no direct competition anymore.

I should be able to set my preference once & FB should remember to load chronogically every time I use the app. While I'm at it, I'm getting sick and tired of FB only showing me what it thinks I should see.

It‚Äôs one thing to not have put any work into laying the pap out well for any iPad size, let alone the 12.9‚Äù, which is probably the least popular version. But the bare minimum for still-update apps is to at *least* let the app recognize what size device it‚Äôs on so it uses the right keyboard and displays sharply.

A lot of targeting based on profiling and stereotyping. Lack of user control of things like friends list organization, news feed settings, for example. News feed has this thing about limiting the amount of posts you see, then just ending. No update, setting, or device/browser change fixes it. And Facebook does not care about its users. Only money, and power."

But I love using Facebook and this update is making me want to switch to another media platform... When someone posts multiple photos, first when you see them it crops out the majority of the photo. Then when you click on it to see it you can‚Äôt swipe or scroll to see the other photos. So then I go back to continue looking and it sends me all the way to the beginning! It‚Äôs a waste of time and really annoying... please fix this."
3031,alexandra56789,"May 7, 2019",1,"The new location of the search bar?! Why would you ever put the search bar right at the top corner of the status bar? Then the search button is so so so small that I have to intently and actively pay attention to exactly where I touch before I start typing. The amount of times I have made someone‚Äôs name my status because I am trying to search for them but you made the search button for ants, is beyond annoying. "
3032,craigohio,"May 9, 2019",2,Post scheduling for Facebook pages stopped showing scheduled posts The Version updated on May 9th has taken away knowing when scheduled posts are scheduled on pages.
3033,RSS1959,"May 11, 2019",1,"Really? Good lord, what the heck are you doing?? Making the app better? No. Just no. Notifications for a business page are horrendous. Constantly repeating. I‚Äôve seen it already! My personal page is ad upon ad. Takes DAYS for posts to pop up in my feed. Just stop with all the freaking updates and fix it! Seriously can‚Äôt tell the app has been updated. Just the same nonsense over and over. Facebook is worse than ever and really frustrating to use. The developers need to look at what WORKS and what doesn‚Äôt. Right now Facebook is NOT working."
3034,AlliMini,"May 22, 2019",2,"Annoying. When I click on ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù, I expect to get all stories on my time line in order. Why is the first story, after clicking on ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù, from yesterday?  I don‚Äôt understand what the deal is with social media, refusing to put things in Actual order. It‚Äôs just aggravating. Fix it."
3035,mithfg,"June 7, 2019",3,Facebook watch I think the new feature you added where when you click on a video it switches to the watch tab is very poorly designed. Partly because of the fact that when you click the video it changes tabs then you have to click on the video again to pull it up to full screen what was wrong with being able to watch a video on the home page.
3036,Jlw0621,"July 30, 2019",1,"Comments out of order Seems like every update is a downgrade. Comments are slow to load and they‚Äôre all out of order. It would be nice if I didn‚Äôt have to load ‚Äúprevious comments‚Äù to view new comments being made on posts. As an admin of a group, this is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. I guess I should know better than to update this app. I am always hoping the ‚Äúbugs‚Äù would be fixed and new ones wouldn‚Äôt be created. Whoever works on the app really needs fired. My 9 year old could do a better job than the morons creating these ‚Äúupdates‚Äù."
3037,fbsucks123,"June 26, 2019",1,"Worst social media ever What a shame facebooks turned into, 6 months ago i deactivated my fb now i have absolutly zero access to that account because i changed my cell phone and number.  Same email same me same face but because i dont have the same phone number now my account is probably one of literally millions and millions that are completely inctive and will be until the day facebook sells out. I tried to contact favebook directly and was able to send them a picture of my license but they still wont let me completly delete the account."
3038,PuddingPandemic,"June 22, 2019",2,"Ads are too much. There‚Äôs ads everywhere. Sponsored ads that show up and take up space on my feed. (Kudos for giving filtering options for ad relevancy, I guess). There‚Äôs ads below the video box when watching and multiple ads within the video clips. Ads on the marketplace section, just too much advertising in general, I could go on. Ads make the feeds feel very messy and clustered to me for personally. It has come to the point were I can safely say I see more ad content than social."
3039,Cc01271998,"June 15, 2019",1,"Sound malfunction I don‚Äôt know what is going on, but my sound on Facebook keeps shutting off. I go to Facebook ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù to watch my videos (like I always do). And I get through one or two videos and then my sound is just gone. I just turn everything up, my volume, make sure the speaker on Facebook is not muted, and made sure my sound wasn‚Äôt on silent. And it‚Äôs still doing it. What is this? Please fix this ASAP or I‚Äôm done with Facebook. I‚Äôve been a loyal Facebook user for over 10 years and now this. I think this is the most annoying glitch ever. üíØ"
3040,Simonrb,"November 25, 2018",1,"Updates are such a pain Why did you mess with the screen? It's odd. I dont need 1/2 of my page to be static showing my games and birthdays while the news feed got smaller. Makes no sense. I don't need to constantly see that stuff on the right side. If I want to see it, I click to open. What I want to see is the feed and you have made it smaller. It continues to be irritating. Also bothered by having the red notification when ppl post to groups even tho I‚Äôve marked NO NOTIFICATIONS. I clear them...they come back within minutes even tho I‚Äôve marked NO NOTIFICATIONS"
3041,Amanda L.,"December 14, 2018",1,"STOP TRYING TO MAKE FB INTO INSTA! People have a preference... Some like fb and the way it is and choose to utilize that platform for their social media because of how it is... Others choose Instagram for the way it is... PLEASE LEAVE FACEBOOK AS IT IS AND STOP TRYING TO FORCE US TO MAKE THIS LIKE INSTAGRAM. The descriptions at the bottom, the swipe to see more pictures, just leave it how it is, I hate how you guys are always changing it, you‚Äôre single handedly destroying it and for some, this is where we keep and share our most precious memories and moments with our friends and families and you‚Äôre making us NOT want to use it."
3042,drazicx,"December 18, 2018",4,"Marketplace fix The app works fine on my iPhone 7 plus with the latest software. However, what I have been noticing for months now and it has not been fixed is marketplace. Every time I click on see all vehicles it does not load. I was hoping new updates would fix it but nothing had been fixed for over 6 months. Facebook, get on it."
3043,fhyrdbiyg,"December 24, 2018",1,"I agree with the person before me! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy... I update the app literally the same day I get a new phone... once the new phone was up and going, the app tells me I need to sign back in... (this I knew) so I go to do so... and it keeps telling me ‚Äúwrong password‚Äù so I click ‚Äúreset password‚Äù of course it asks me ‚Äútype your name, phone number, or email in to find yourself‚Äù well the funny thing is I do that... and it pop up a message that says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no account matching that criteria‚Äù I‚Äôve waited now 2-3 days‚Äù can some admin figure out what‚Äôs going on and get back with me?"
3044,ajos2,"January 15, 2019",1,"Say no to Facebook Facebook is a garbage company that doesn‚Äôt give one iota of care about the user experience.  It shows in their business practices and it shows in the quality of this app.  Not only is it full of bugs, hoard your personal information and has a clunky UI but it is also serves as a vehicle for Facebook to choose what the user is exposed to.  Allowing the user to sink further and further into an echo chamber where outside views seem hostile and civil discourse is a faint memory.  Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt download this app and furthermore delete your Facebook account."
3045,greysanatomy00,"January 21, 2019",3,"Ok As much as I love Facebook there‚Äôs certain things I‚Äôm absolutely tired of. Such as marketplace being taken off and out back on then taken off again. Why?! And another thing I HATE is that my account will get locked and I can‚Äôt do anything such as like, comment, or share. And I have absolutely no clue why. There is no reason for it. I don‚Äôt post anything bad, I could be simply scrolling and go to like something then all of a sudden I‚Äôm locked out. üôÑ"
3046,Kaiser_1989,"January 22, 2019",1,Since 2006 I‚Äôve been a member since 2006 and just the way the platform has changed for the negative in recent years is astounding. You have no privacy if you would like to make a Facebook to stay away from family or have any form of privacy from coworkers via suggested friends. They are always tracking your interests to sell to you. I get that it‚Äôs free but it‚Äôs just become entirely too invasive in a negative way in regards to my social life. I just go on to deal with events etc and log off or uninstall the app can‚Äôt wait to not have to use Facebook ever.
3047,Yo Digity dawg,"January 25, 2019",1,Push notifications? Why can‚Äôt I ever get PUSH notifications. I‚Äôve had to reset my phone uninstall and reinstall the app. Turn on my notifications through iPhone and the Facebook app itself nothing. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe it‚Äôs a iPhone thing because for the longest time I‚Äôve have iPhone I‚Äôve never been able to receive Push notifications it‚Äôs very annoying I would like to be able to SEE or HEAR whenever I receive an Facebook notifications without having to unlock my phone and look to see if anything showed up.
3048,Scott0544,"February 26, 2019",5,Photos have disappeared. I don‚Äôt no when it happened but the other day my photos disappeared off my home page. You can see them through another profile but when I get on the app on my phone they are not on my home page is anyone having this issue or no how to fix it.
3049,alexrulo,"April 26, 2019",1,Stupid security system The security system is so stupid if you get a new phone with a new number then don‚Äôt even ever bother trying to log in you won‚Äôt be able too cause how stupid it is  also no support to contact to get the problem resolved it‚Äôs so stupid  that you can‚Äôt even confirm your information through email you have to either  get the message from your old number that dose t work anymore or get people from your friends list that most likely you don‚Äôt have their number  cause you have so many friends it‚Äôs stupid
3050,DisgustingBR,"October 25, 2018",1,"Member I‚Äôve been a member of Facebook for quite a while now. I‚Äôve had many good experiences here esp when connecting with old friends but there are very bad experiences as well. I feel strongly that Facebook is very bias. When reporting people who post somethings that are obviously racist, ( ie hanging of Pres Obama, calling patrons monkeys or even using emojis, or calling them the N word, each time Facebook reps return a message saying that it does not violate their community policy. The moment that you stand up for yourself and reverse what what was said to you, it violates their policy. This is unfair and is the reason we KNEEL!üò≠"

I tap on it again so it shows who posted it and at what date/time but still it doesn‚Äôt not show the caption. Their must be a minor bug in the latest update because this only started happening since the most recent update."
3052,Thasacoolname,"November 3, 2018",2,"The latest updates to the notifications is TERRIBLE!!! On ipad I get notifications for a couple things, but the majority is yesterday n day before. The notifications disappear after I click on them, AND, they are beyond ‚Äúout of chronological order‚Äù.   Yesterday, this morning, 2 hours ago, five minutes ago, etc.  and there‚Äôs very few up to date ones.  I have to go to my iphone and find a notification that I had commented on, and then find it on my ipad app.  It‚Äôs very annoying."
3053,Dallasho,"November 4, 2018",1,"Chronological order I want to have permanent default setting control over who is displayed on my feed and the order I see content. Posts from 4 days ago can be anywhere from annoying to infuriating to see, depending on what was missed. "

It‚Äôs dumb as hell I have the same notification from Saturday still at the top of my list letting me know one of my friends checked in two states away? Why do I need to see a notification at the top on a post I commented on four days ago yet I have to scroll down to see current responses to group posts that I manage? Smh. Thanks Facebook. The updates are becoming ridiculously stupid."
3055,thatgirlrachelnicole,"November 12, 2018",3,"Disappointed I spend most of my time on Facebook so I‚Äôm super aggravated that for a couple of days now I‚Äôm unable to see more than 4 or 5 posts on my newsfeed, I have to refresh to actually see any new posts. Earlier today, it was just throwing up a blank page saying error. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs anything I can personally do to help it, or if it‚Äôs something that will sort itself out. Anyone else having these problems?"
3056,Staci28,"November 16, 2018",2,"All kinds of issues with notifications My app constantly shows me on the home screen that I have 10+ new notifications, but when I open the app I have 1, maybe 2.. I‚Äôll close out of the app and it‚Äôll be cleared, but within a minute or two another red dot with 10-15 shows up. Very frustrating. To top it off, a few times a day all of a sudden several notifications show up as ‚Äúnewer‚Äù and unread, but were from hours, sometimes even days, ago. Please fix!!"
3057,zahmaxwell,"November 20, 2018",1,Loading issues This new update not only messed up my notifications but it won‚Äôt post comments I make or allow me to share anything. Not to mention I can‚Äôt get my own page to load. It‚Äôs bothersome to have an icon that says I have 9 notifications but when I open the tab there‚Äôs only one or two there. Also can we make the ‚Äòmost recent‚Äô option a permanent setting? I often miss things my friends and family post because it won‚Äôt show up in my news feed until several days after it was initially posted.
3058,BBAFCaveman,"November 21, 2018",1,"Recent Posts not Working After the last few updates, when I switch my feed to ‚ÄúRecent posts‚Äù it only shows a few post of people and pages I follow. Most of those posts are old. Then it only allows me to scroll through a few posts and will not load any others. ‚ÄúRecent Posts‚Äù use to show almost every post of the people and pages I followed from the last minute to whenever I got tired of scrolling. I want to be able to see these posts again without the dates bouncing around like he normal feed."

Everyone I talk to is having the same issue. The app keeps telling me I have 10-25 notifications and there will be none. Or when business group posts I miss out because the app decided it wasn‚Äôt important but the 25 imaginary notifications are. Fix this everyone is annoyed.
3060,monyboo,"July 2, 2018",1,"Error I my app is up to date. My iOS is up to date. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times. Still, I can only see about three posts, before it can‚Äôt load anything else and just shuts down. This has been happening for several weeks. I would assume by now a multi billion dollar company would fix an issue like this. I have about 50 other apps working just fine, so I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs the app, not the OS. No mention of it, no fix date, no nothing. This  is pretty terrible service for the biggest social media presence."

Can‚Äôt see notifications because it constantly refreshes and jumps back to the top of the page. This has been going on for days and days, and I‚Äôve been trying to get on Facebook less and less. It was bad enough that you force me to see ‚ÄúTop stories‚Äù instead of most recent - now I can‚Äôt even read the few updates you allow me to see!! Ridiculous"

In the notifications section there is a blue dot that goes away after you read the notification so you can know what you‚Äôve read and haven‚Äôt read. Now the blue dot won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm in several groups and get lots of notifications so having that blue dot go away is essential. Hoping you guys fix this soon.

Obviously chose the latter but that just logged me out too. No number to call or any way to get around it. No way to log in to my account.

Let me set my feed to ""Most Recent"" and LEAVE IT THAT WAY! This is the way I want to see my feed. I use FB for me, not for Facebook."

I‚Äôve noticed that my comments are always showing up on my friend‚Äôs newsfeeds. They‚Äôd always ask about my comments, which is really none of their concerns.

The short term effect of these practices are the increased feelings of loneliness reported by so many users.

I‚Äôm not sure what Facebook spends all their money on but it‚Äôs definitely not this app. The news feed won‚Äôt update properly anymore. These issues come and go often. Is there not beta testing before a new update is released? I understand the ads are what makes it free but are they really so greedy that they are now plugging them into every little video? Once it says ad starting I quit watching the video. I assume I‚Äôll be deleting Facebook all together soon.

Not sure if its mere sloppiness or arrogance from your side that you will not mention what changes are in the new update. Bug fixes? Enhancements? Dis you find an issue users should be aware of?

But my biggest complaint is by far the amount of space the app takes with continual use. When you first get it it takes up maybe like 50 KB of storage. But after repetitive usage it blows up to about half a GB for me. Between Instagram and Facebook it takes up more than a GB of data. And when you only have 8GB that's crucial.

After you've done all of that, for like 2 days, you're temporarily blocked from doing certain things on your own account. Better off just getting rid of fb altogether!"

If I want to look at a group page, I have to click on the bottom left, then walk away and pretend I don‚Äôt care for about 2 minutes before even that part will load. It reminds me of dialup. And who ever wants to be reminded of dialup??"

Making it hard to use the app as it was intended.  Instead roulette style notifications govern my interactions and i end them abruptly with no easy way to return to them.  It might even be 8 weeks because it feels like it has been 4 update cycles. Or maybe facebook is playing social experiment again?

Every 2-3 posts you see, it‚Äôs guaranteed you‚Äôll be bombarded with ads. Mostly irrelevant ads. Not to mention, FB got in trouble for its data breach and gave away user‚Äôs confidential / personal information by releasing the data to a company working for the Russian government and inadvertently, helped trump win. FB, you‚Äôve lost your grace. Let‚Äôs see if you can come back into the light."

5312,Baconator the great!,"October 9, 2018",4,"Notifications are messed up in this latest version Just a heads up, notifications are acting wonky in this version. It gives a notice of having multiple items and there are either none or significantly less than advises upon opening the app."
5313,Dj Wizzdom@4/20,"October 18, 2018",1,"Security Features Aren't Useful Can't remember my password every time I get a new Phone Device, so when I seem to try and reset my password it always gives me the same message that apparently it can't find any account related to the information I provided . Such bs to be honest. If other options were available to acquire old password or reset password then I'd change the rating but since it's been the same thing over the course of these years ."
5314,Brenda Kadillac,"October 20, 2018",3,Updates Break It More Than Fix It Another stupid problem as the result of a most recent update. What is the point of getting a notification that a friend posted something when you can‚Äôt even see the post when you click on the notification??? You only see comments. Fix that! Now! #stupidestupdateever
5315,Klmurl,"October 22, 2018",2,"Latest update Since the last update I can no longer see my posts. When someone comments, I get a notification that there is a comment but the post is no longer showing, only the picture or the list of tagged people. I also have complaints that the post is missing from friends as well they can just see they are tagged but can‚Äôt read what they are tagged in."
5316,Jbeaute25,"October 26, 2018",2,"Fix the post problem I don‚Äôt know what has happened recently on FB however when people make a post or tag you in one. You go to see what was written and there‚Äôs nothing there. It‚Äôs blank. You need to dig to figure out what was even said. In case the creators at FB didn‚Äôt know, I thought I‚Äôd bring it to their attention. I was seriously hoping this problem was being resolved in the recent update."
5317,kates77,"October 28, 2018",1,"Broken alert page A couple of updates ago, I‚Äôm not sure which, my alert page (when you click on the bell icon in the lower right) scrolls for about a page and a half, then just starts bouncing at the bottom of the screen. I don‚Äôt know if I have any alerts I should respond to! Please fix this! Also, why do my posts often show no content now? Someone will respond and I don‚Äôt know the context because the text of my post has disappeared."
5318,Michelle Alise,"October 29, 2018",2,"Not working anymore This app was great until recently, I can only see 11 of my notifications at a time and I can‚Äôt see any of the words in a post. Just the pictures, no words. If there is no picture in the post and it was just words I won‚Äôt see anything, this is the case for my own posts or anybody else‚Äôs posts. This has been going on now for about two months. I can‚Äôt use the app anymore."
5319,crazy blind girl,"October 29, 2018",3,"Just a suggestion. So I‚Äôm a blind user of facebook and love it. How ever I do have a suggestion. I come accross many pictures that have text in them, maybe for me and other blind users you can make it to where the text in the pictures is read to you and maybe the pictures are described to you a little if they don‚Äôt have text. That‚Äôs all."
5320,TO1066,"August 4, 2018",3,My mobile app keeps crashing It‚Äôs so f‚Äôin annoying that Facebook doesn‚Äôt have any customer service help. My mobile app shows one story then crashes. I‚Äôve contacted Facebook several times over this issue and all I get is a message that says thanks for your submission etc. etc. They need to have people dedicated to helping fix issues that arise
5321,JodiPensFsn,"August 8, 2018",3,"Notifications are messed up since last update Since the last update, my notifications aren‚Äôt working correctly. When I close the app and reopen it later, it looks like I never checked them in my notifications list. It‚Äôs getting pretty annoying having to clear what notifications I already cleared."

5323,scru fb,"August 9, 2018",1,"‚ÄúFeeds‚Äù and ‚Äúmost recent ‚Äú gone?? I‚Äôm tired of Facebook giving me out of date information out of chronological order! Before today, I could go into the menu and select ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù then under feeds select ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù  Although a huge inconvenience, I could properly keep my information in chronological order. I do not see that option any longer and the ‚Äúmost recent‚Äù is not what it says- it is random and not in order, nor does it include all my friends."

5327,iPhones-r-dabomb,"September 4, 2018",1,"Why does my news feed end? Since the last update or two my feed just come to an end. 10 stories In and Facebook seems to think that that‚Äôs all the posts that I have ever gotten. I restart and get one or two more or less. Then I restart again and get 20, but that‚Äôs it. Then I restart again and get 5. I have great internet so that‚Äôs not the problem. My news feed just comes to an end. Obviously the last 29 minutes is all that matters in the world."
5328,S103462,"September 11, 2018",1,"Facebook Version 188.0 This latest version (188.0), just downloaded yesterday, appears to have adversely affected the ‚ÄúNotification‚Äù icon on the Facebook page. After pressing the Notification icon, the message ‚ÄúYou Don‚Äôt Have Any Notifications‚Äù is displayed, when its clear (both on the main page of all icons and on my PC version of Facebook) that there are new notifications. Need some way to revert back to Facebook version 187.0 until this glitch is fixed."
5329,Josh FTP,"September 23, 2018",2,"Too many little bugs and disjointed experiences. Why can‚Äôt I scroll my friends list?  If I try, it always resets to some random number early in the alphabet. On top of that, why can‚Äôt I click a letter in the friends list and just navigate to that group?  Why when I try to edit a post linked from activity am I taken to a web browser?  This is a mobile app. Choose mobile web or mobile app."

5331,casszachchar,"April 18, 2018",2,"About and quotes section From what I can understand, the ""about me"" section and the ""favorite quotes"" section are not included in the Facebook app. I mean, not only are they not accessible to edit, both sections are completely missing from your profile when using the app. Which I'm assuming means when friends visit my profile, they cannot see those sections either. Doesn't make any sense, please fix."
5332,Luke1525233,"April 23, 2018",5,Lucky Day!!! I enjoy playing this game so much. I look forward to just sitting down and grabbing my I pad and playing the game. I have a couple health issues and one which is Parkinson‚Äôs so this game really helps take my mind off of it. Thank you for making this game!
5333,Stanley E Oveield jr,"April 28, 2018",1,Making you stupid This app takes up almost 70% of my time during the day when I have it installed on my phone. It keeps me from making and keeping meaningful relationships or even having a conversation with a stranger because Facebook is so addictive it‚Äôs better to put your face in your phone all day than to go out and live life. It also keeps me from having time to my own thoughts. No time to be creative when Facebook is using all my brain power.

My account was disabled twice , the longest it was disabled was for 2 months all because someone reported me as a fake page . I sent a picture of my ID which was madness because although it told me it would delete it out of its server, I still had that conscience in the back of my head like why the hell you need my ID. I got my page back but it‚Äôs still a wall that comes up when I‚Äôm trying to log on ."

I can‚Äôt scroll past the 1st one, two, or sometimes three posts in the News Feed!  The little ‚Äúloading gear‚Äù just spins on and on.  And then there is the constant CRASHING!  After writing several sentences of a reply on someone‚Äôs post‚Äî‚Äî-POOF‚Äî‚Äî-the FB app crashes and everything is lost!  I have tried uninstalling and starting over, but to no avail.  I usually use Safari.  UNACCEPTABLE!"

When I click on the photos link it comes up with a message that says could not load albums.  Very annoying!  This is a new glitch that just started happening.  I can't even load photos of my closest friends.  I changed nothing in my settings to cause this.  It is a new Facebook glitch and I sure wish they would fix it."
5338,andrewaltogether,"July 13, 2018",2,"Just use a web browser Sometimes the app opens to a blank page until you force-quit and re-open it. Sometimes it gives you duplicate notifications. Sometimes the buttons don‚Äôt work. Sometimes pictures don‚Äôt load until you force-quit and re-open. Sometimes it mutes keyboard clicks. You really never know what bug you‚Äôre going to get, which almost makes it a game."
