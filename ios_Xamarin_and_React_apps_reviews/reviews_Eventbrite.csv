It directed me to the wrong show 1 day later, and I made the mistake of not reading every detail and made the purchase with excitement. AS SOON AS I got the confirmation email I realized there was a glitch with the link that I clicked on bc the show was obviously not the show I was looking for, so I immediately tried to contact Eventbrite to explain my mistake. I still wanted 2 tickets, but I wanted them for the show that I originally clicked on. They emailed me back about 3 days later and basically said it wasn‚Äôt their problem and there is nothing that they would do to help me, but that I am more than welcome to sell them to someone else. Thanks a lot for that helpful response. I will try to avoid buying tickets from this company for the rest of my life now unless they are the only ones offering them. Terrible customer service, even when the mistake was on both of us. I should‚Äôve read the fine details, but they also shouldn‚Äôt have had a broken link. I tried the link several times after that to make sure I wasn‚Äôt crazy, and the same thing was replicated over and over. After they emailed me and told me there wasn‚Äôt anything they would do, I also emailed them back pleading my case and they didn‚Äôt even bother to respond again."
1,Mishel Mandujano,"January 13, 2020",3,"Great but needs improvement to facilitate usage. I really like the app, however I think it would be very useful if we could remove events we saw and are not interested on. For example, when scrolling down I see something I am not interested on I would like to swipe left or something and not ever see it again. Also, events that repeat every week are annoying. They are the first ones to show up and they are like surfing lessons or something and each week is the same thing. Even if I choose filters that do not apply to that they still show up. Finally, filters are not always helpful. I could select community and nothing will come up, but after searching on google events do show up and they are on eventbrite!! Maybe have people posting events answer more questions so the filters can be more accurate."
2,milehighlover,"October 5, 2019",2,"What‚Äôs the point of this app? I have tickets to two Eventbrite events but cannot see the tickets under this app. When I click on tickets they are not there and I am redirected to login to their website where I can see them but there is no way to get them to be on my app. What is the point of this app then if I still have to login to the website to see the tickets I bought? I signed up on the app with the same email and password. Also, thought it was weird that the app didn‚Äôt give me the option to sign in. I was only able to create an account or sign in with Facebook. Must be why I can‚Äôt see my tickets...the app is not linked to your already created profile through their website. Amateurs made this app as far as I can tell. So It looks like I have to buy through the app in order to see those tickets and vice versa. Makes no sense."
3,VoiceOver user,"May 6, 2017",1,"This app does not work for me as a blind person using VoiceOver I enter act with my iPhone using voice over, a screen reader built into every iPhone. When I navigate the main screen of this app, I see categories I can select, but attempting to select them brings up no corresponding events. The window which would list events doesn't even open, and the List box at the top of the app doesn't populate. When I navigate from the top of the screen down, I do not see hashtags I can select, but when I navigate from the bottom of the screen up, I do see hashtags."
4,makersmark8350,"May 31, 2019",1,"Logging in Good luck logging into the app to get the tickets you‚Äôve purchased.  There is no place to put a password after hitting login.  I already have an account with eventbrite but all it does is say ‚Äúthis email already exists‚Äù and it automatically sends an email to change my password.  Kind of hard to login anyway when there is no field to input a password.  Good job evenbrite I feel like I‚Äôm being punked.  It‚Äôs obvious they don‚Äôt care, if you read all the reviews about logging in all they say is contact customer support.  Not even the developers know how to login on their own app.  Horrible app and horrible customer service.  After contacting I still can‚Äôt login.  It‚Äôs sad that people use this and I‚Äôm assuming the rating on the App Store is purely employees trying to save themselves a job while they look for an employer and development team that doesn‚Äôt have their heads shoved you know where."
5,whfjfuisbs,"October 25, 2019",1,"So fricken annoying This would be a great app, if the login wasn‚Äôt impossible. If you go to settings, hit login and then put in your email address it doesn‚Äôt give you an option for password. The options are login with FB or get started. If you hit either of them they send you a reset option for your password, WTH!? You can login when you are registering for an event, BUT it doesn‚Äôt keep you logged in so you can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôve registered for and what you haven‚Äôt. I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to log into the app. Guess I‚Äôll use the site from now on ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6,Sincere S.,"October 23, 2016",4,"Event Bright Wether your trying to be a social elite or not, very hip to what's going on platform in the application out to-date ‚ùïSeriously it gives you inside scoop on events going on for the weekend,weekdays,popular, and you can also set the filter to your liking! Great application for this day and era. If you don't get out much and when do happen to get out, and your trying to find something to do or wanna make plans. But no clue or idea on what? I for one definitely recommend opening the app to see what's going on. You'll go from no plans to something fun and cost effective to do or even free! That's right F R E E ‚ùóÔ∏è So have fun people who've never tried out take this App users word for it !"
7,RV Winkle,"October 14, 2017",4,"Update:  Beware!!! Prior to today, the Eventbrite app settings did not have a toggle nor option to disable cellular use. What I find strange is that since my previous post, now, there is a cellular use toggle option.  I know my previous claim was not overlooked because the app did not list in the cellular section. And when I checked the general listing for apps, inside Eventbrite settings, there was no toggle, nor cellular option to disable. However, there was location option that I allowed Eventbrite to use my location when in use.  I am not sure if this was an app glitch or update, but problem was resolved. Therefore, I increased my rating from 1 to 4 stars."
8,Drew927,"November 20, 2019",2,"Can‚Äôt find events Had used app in the past. Didn‚Äôt have it on my new phone, so when a link wanted wanted to open it, I had to re-download it. Knew exact name and location and tried to find it, but would not work. Have had trouble with wi-fi giving location of internet service provider instead of my actual location, so when it asked for permission I clicked ‚Äúno‚Äù. There was a search window to enter location, but it wouldn‚Äôt work. At that point, rather than go to location services to give it permission, I just deleted it. Don‚Äôt give me the appearance that I have an option if I don‚Äôt! I‚Äôll use something else. Works fine when clicking on a link and it is already installed, but no good in trying to find events that you may be looking for."
9,dirtylooks22,"January 10, 2020",2,"Great product and terrible customer service if something goes wrong I like the eventbrite platform. It‚Äôs relatively easy to use and I‚Äôve met some cool people through it. I have run more than 10 events in the past and the first time I had an issue where customers of mine ran into trouble because of their UI for discount codes I ended up having to eat the fees. When I explained that it was an older audience and they thought that they were not going to be charged, they didn‚Äôt listen to my actual situation. They just followed their policy of not refunding fees."
