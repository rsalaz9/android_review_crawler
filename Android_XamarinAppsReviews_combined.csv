American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, Libe this app... Make dinations on line even checks... Great way to stay connected.
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1," Not as easy as past years. Not very user friendly, even for a computer literate user !"
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, So easy and allows us to keep fundraising!
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, Works great for uploading donations and keeping track of them
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1, The app won't start up. It's stuck on the loading screen and then it eventually crashes.
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3," This app needs to be all encompassing so that you can access team information, not just fundraising."
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,4, It's great but being on 2 teams you can only see and manage 1...

Last year I received an email along with a yellow flower icon notifying me of a donation. Now the only way I know when I receive a donation is when I open the app and check under donations. I like to publicly acknowledge my donations in a timely matter, yet without the notification, it might be days before I find them . Please fix this issue."
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1," Good for keeping track of donations since I'm having issues not receiving any emails when I get a donation. Also, just tried to update, since it told me I needed to, and there was no update option so I had to uninstall and reinstall. Ok just re-installed and it still says I need to update????"
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3," Not user friendly. I personally haven't had a lot of problems, but my husband has and at our team captains meetings I hear the frustrations of others."
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1, I have been able to use this app in years past & it was very helpful. This year's app keeps stopping after less a minute of use. Can't use it at all.
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1," Way too many notifications. I keep turning them off under settings, but it won't save the selection. It reverts to ""allow all"" when I go to another screen. Uninstalling."
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, makes it super easy when people pay you cash or check.... you can use your card and still give the sponsor name and credit!!
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3, It keeps saying theres a required update to be done in the play store window...but no update button to be found. Needs this bug fixed.

American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, Awesome
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,1, Ugh! This is the last time I even try to use this app! It did last year! Extremely frustrating now that I have a team fundraiser coming up on 3/24. It's been of absolutely no help to me this year considering I have to keep uninstalling and now it won't even open! Please fix this for next year!
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3, It's difficult to download to Facebook...
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5, Immediately started receiving donations!
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,2," It won't open anymore. I really liked it, it had everything needed"
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3, Definitely needs work. Some donations are not getting credited to my team. I know they've gone through because my donors have shared transaction receipts with me. Please fix the app.

American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3, This app needs some major updating!! It takes forever to load anything you want to do and does not show what you need to show. I can't see my team nor accept cash donations.

American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,4," It seems easy, I just wish the auto payment amount options started at $25 instead of $35"
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,2, This needs to be more user friendly like the dashboard online.

American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,2, Very frustrating to use!!  Have to log out and go back to the old  Making Strides app just to be able to see who's donating.

American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,3,"Easier to use Easier to use than RFL app but it won't let you ask for donations for luminaries. Would like to have email templates from website available. Right now, using app and website to do what I want"
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5,Love the updates! I used my new app at a fundraiser yesterday to accept credit cards and checks instantly. My profile was updated immediately with my new fundraising progress and it was so simple to use. Thank you for the fantastic updates! SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD APP!
American Cancer Society FUNdraising,Lifestyle,5," It's great to be able to accept credit cards, checks, and now even Paypal for donations. The new version has added a lot of features and a much nicer interface. Well done!"

Lot of other weather apps bombard you with all unnessary information all at once, and it can make looking for what you need at that moment hard to find (and unpleasant to look at). For example, opening the Timeline shows detailed information about current weather conditions, and directly under that a ""card"" that shows conditions for the rest of the day graphically. Below that is another card that does the same for tomorrow in a clear and concise format. And rather than clutter the charts to show forecasts for each hour even though the temperature might be the same for the entire period -- that end up forcing you to scroll to see the rest of the day -- these chart summarize the period in a way only shows when there are increases or decreases, letting you see both the trends clearly. Brilliant! Even Dark Sky involved a lot of scrolling to see a single day's forecast (and only showed data every 2 hours anyway). Finally, the developer is extremely responsive and committed to future development of the app. So glad I found my new weather app. And great widgets too!"

I can count on one hand the number of times this app has provided me with reliable information. Feel like I paid for a pretty but useless interface. Edit: Thanks to developer for your clear reply! Hopefully more services will come in the future. Much appreciated you took the time to reply."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This app's great. Gives me 'feels like' temps, predictions, and a widget that's now part of my routine.

The design is clean, font choices great and well, it's got the right amount of personalization for me and I like it. It's also nice when apps are made and run by real people. I've pestered the dev when the app was misbehaving and they responded super quick with support. Thanks again, would give an extra star if I could. (In the future, if you're looking to create a WearOS buddy app for this, consider me interested 🙂)"

However, it only offers a very high level idea of what the weather is and is expected to be. It lacks critical information such as expected snowfall accumulation. It is a good tool for getting a quick look at what to expect when one heads outside, but then again so is looking out a window. I could see this being insurable to folks in dense urban areas though."

Not super fancy looking or with needlessly large elements. For me it a hood app. The only thing I wish it had was other APIs outside of darksky. Darksky is not the best source of weather data for my country but the dev said he was looking into it and this feature might be coming soon. Overall a good experience. Pretty much the best weather app I have ever used.

I commute so I was hoping to have different widgets for my home town and where I work. Beautiful wonderfully designed app and anyone that doesn't need this functionality should pull the trigger 100%
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Happy to help these guys out now that the Dark Sky app is leaving. Looking forward to see where they go with content providers after Dark Sky turns off their data.
Appy Weather,Weather,4," I really like the app and the way that it gives you weather information. It's simplistic and has minimalistic widgets. The only thing that is a negative critique, is the fact that there is no inbuilt radar. It is irritating to have to be redirected out of the app for radar info and updates."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Great design and weather data -- clean and clear. Helpful widget for upcoming weather.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," 'Not bad', this is the highest compliment available from Yorkshire."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," It's a simple, well made weather app for any Dark Sky fans looking for a replacement."

Nice customization option available Nice and fluid. Update 1/21/20 city location doesn't automatically update anymore. 3/18/20...still loving this weather app... The best!
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This is everything I wanted in a weather app: accurate and detailed information in an interface that isn't busy or overwhelming, everything customizable, and a full suite of widgets. Worth every penny!"

After trying several apps I found Appy and I must say that I am enjoying it more than I ever did WU. Developer seems to listen to his users and updates are coming in frequently. One of the few apps I am actually happy to pay for. The only improvement for me personally would be a widget that combined the today and upcoming ones, maybe adding the next 2 days instead of weekend."

Appy Weather,Weather,4, Even the largest widget's fonts are too small and can not be enlarged at settings.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Really cool and well organized weather app, so far really loving it. Interested to see what weather API the app will switch to after Dark Sky becomes iOS only (boo!), but I'm know I'll stick along for the ride."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," At the moment when most of the world is locked up at home, the weather dosn't bother us :) Many times I find the webpage of Dark Sky forecast more accurate than the app. Except this, clear and friendly weather App"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I like the clean interface a lot. It's a great weather app.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great app, I love the weather descriptions you get each day as a notification. They feel like a weather person in your pocket. The developers are responsive to feedback, my suggestion was implemented, I am looking forward to future updates!"

Appy Weather,Weather,5," Ex darksky user, loving the aesthetic....best of luck Bardi, hope a replacement data source works out in a year or so!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Best alternative to Dark Sky. Uses the Dark Sky engine. Good widgets. 5 stars

The interface is modern and minimal. Straight to the information that is needed. Really enjoy using Appy Weather. Subscription is available. Just a suggestion, its worth it."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I really just paid for a weather app lol. But is was totally worth it though. I do wish there was more customisation for the widgets. I love the layout of the app.
Appy Weather,Weather,3, Ok but I wish it had a better graph data type view. Also wish the timeline could be more compact and timeline data is sometimes less useful not always showing high for the day.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love it so much, it's reports are very friendly and the layout is beautiful. Its also much easier to understand and navigate than most other weather apps."
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Purchased/subscribed to this app just to unlock the widgets and they don't work. Play store won't let me refund even though I purchased it just a few minutes ago. If you want a widget this is not the app for you - spend your money elsewhere.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Gives the weather in a sentence or two, and I really like that. It's unique and personal - the most readable and straight-forward weather app I know of."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," It""s very easy to read, using, and I like the way it looks. I just needed a little more time to use the app to give it a 5 star rating. It a wonderful weather app I love it."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Found this app looking for a dark sky alternative as dark sky is dropping support for Android. I sent the developer a quick question and he got right back to me. I have subscribed to it to get the extras. Overall very happy with the application. Does everything I need.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, The app has many helpful options and the developer has provided quick response to my request for information. I strongly recommend this app for your weather needs.
Appy Weather,Weather,2," App is uncluttered and gives weather, but the two available typefaces are both TERRIBLE. I don't want to feel like my weather app is yelling at me, why so BOLD?"
Appy Weather,Weather,3, Love the app but now I pay for the yearly subscription and it has become less stable and the widgets work sometimes. Will most likely unscub after a year of the widgets aren't going to work
Appy Weather,Weather,1, I've paid for the subscription but it keeps telling me to upgrade. I can't use the widgets. I've given the developer money for nothing in return.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I got this app after hearing about the shut down of Dark Sky. I wish the developer the best luck in finding new APIs. I love this app already, and wish it the best with corporate greed Apple."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love the simplicity, and that it doesn't steal all your personal information every time you use it."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I've tried a bunch of different weather apps and no other app has it all like this one. It's got the data I want and looks incredible.
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Simple and easy to uses with the right information . I take off one star because certain features are not available in my area.
Appy Weather,Weather,3," The widgets are too big, taking up 2 rows unnecessarily. Navigation from day view to week view is clunky and not intuitive."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Timely reminders to help you stay prepared. Beautiful interface for your eyes. Wonderful and short summaries to put on your home screen. 10/10
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Excellent app. I'd never considered paying for a weather app upgrade previously, but this is worthwhile."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Went ahead and subscribed with the hope of real built-in radar soon. Also cause F@#$ Apple and Darksky. Keep up the good work indie dev!
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Quite impressed with accuracy. Good presentation. Thank you
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Great weather app and replacement for Dark Sky now that Apple is shutting it down for Android users
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Just the right amount of material and nice and clear. Well supported and good communication from the dev. Good job dev

Appy Weather,Weather,5, A top app. Thorough and nicely laid out. Deffo worth the subscription...

It would be great if there was an option to switch. Edit: thanks for the quick reply. The other options would be great too in addition to roboto.

Appy Weather,Weather,5," I have used a number of weather apps, and Appy Weather is now my favorite, given it's easy to get information, utilization on Dark Sky data, and the excellent visual layout. I run it on android 9 and it works very well on my phone. Highly recommended."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Great app. The only annoying thing to me is that the 1x2 widget is not precisely centered in Lawnchair. Can't say if it also persists in the other launchers. Would be nice if that could be fixed!
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love it! Minimal UI, great UX. But I suggest adding more weather providers, dark sky's data is not accurate in my location. Also, not sure how Apple buying Dark Sky will affect the API"

I don't see any battery drain either which is a big factor for weather apps that alert in real time. It takes a little time to get use to the interface and how it works but after using it a few times you start to like the layout really well. It's very accurate via Dark Sky and the developer responds very quickly. I definitely recommend this weather app over the others.

At the touch of one finger I can see the weather for the next few days and it is represented in a clear manner.

The weather information is stated in a straight to the point manner, so it is quick and easy to digest. Very user friendly weather app."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I was a Weather Timeline fan for years and struggled to find a suitable replacement. I am very happy to have found this app. I would describe it as having a similar feel to WT but the developer has ensured it's longevity by adopting a subscription model (which is where WT failed).

Having more options would be better.

Appy Weather,Weather,3, Nicely set up app that looks great. Decided to subscribe to the full version to get the radar & was very disappointed. The radar is just a link to a site that I can get for free anytime. This app gets 5 stars for the free version but only 3 for the paid because of the the lack of built in radar.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I love this app! The interface is very user friendly and it's adorable! I paid for the premium version and it lets me know of any weather changes, which is helpful when it rains because I would often forget my umbrella without the updates 😅."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Best wether app I used so far. It's easy to use, intuitive menu and it does not have any premium fetures that require additional fees. Best of its kind so far!

He replied until my problem was rectified! Complaining about the $3.99 subscription.. Huh?? Cmon people 360 days =. 0.0109315..per day! Duh! Buy it! No one should work for free."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Appy is very easy to read and understand, and has all the information most people would want in a weather app. My one gripe is that it keeps misidentifying my location, and I can't pull up the correct location in the search."
Appy Weather,Weather,1," Here's a short list of my grievances in attempting to use this app for three minutes: - It doesn't use the system font - It is butt ugly, with text sizes that suggest an absurd DPI - Its location detection failed - It doesn't understand what a state is, or that two towns might have the same name - A...Full ReviewHere's a short list of my grievances in attempting to use this app for three minutes: - It doesn't use the system font - It is butt ugly, with text sizes that suggest an absurd DPI - Its location detection failed - It doesn't understand what a state is, or that two towns might have the same name - And, most importantly, every single piece of info is granted a separate screen, with crappy controls to get between them, meaning that this app hurts to use. Weather timeline didn't die for this."
Appy Weather,Weather,1," The entire time I was looking at the wrong city of Springfield because it doesn't show the state's name at the top of the screen.

I'm not sure how you convinced Google to give you the award for app of the year, but I definitely would have voted for a different weather app. I have since uninstalled this app due to its incorrect information that it provided. I gave it a try, but I will stick to my Google Assistant. BTW, I did give the app permission to use my location. So that's not an excuse"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Fantastic app! Really beautiful and clean interface, detailed forecast and weather in different modes(street, area, city). I'm using this app for 2 weeks and already it is my primary weather app. Good Job devs, keep doing great work!!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Very good app, what really calls my attention is the minimal design. I really like the big bold numbers, as the icons and rounded corners as well. Still can't decide what theme is my favorite: light or dark."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This is a really nice user friendly weather app. Bardi the dev responded immediately to my original comment, so the fifth star and a donation. I then saw that he'd done Ruff, so I've downloaded that too. Both save to SD card which is an added bonus. (And he's in the UK...)"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Love this app. It is very simple and easy to use. It gives you a more detailed outline of the weather from daily to hours and a timeline. I love the widgets too. Definitely recomend this app. Thank you
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Very simplistic and easy to use. More accurate than any other weather app. Instead of telling me the conditions of the town I'm in or near, it's very precise down to the street I'm on."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Appy is great, I tested all the editors choice weather apps and this is by far the best. I have to cap my rating at 4 stars though as Dark Sky support/accuracy is really bad out of a few countries. So the app is great but the info it provides is not."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great looking app. It performs well. Wish it had more widget features such as transparency and a streaming weather update feature like stock tickers. Overall, highly satisfied with the experience."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This is a fantastic weather app. Not only is it rich with data like their other app, Dark Skies which it's also awesome), it presents your weather in a meaningful, narrative way. Def my favorite!"
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Can only give 4 stars because when you first add a widget to the home screen its invisible. You have to wait for a few minutes before the data shows but its disconcerting and not obvious that you need to wait.
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Purchased the app for the radar. Only to see the radar does not have playability. If you want to see the future, you have to put the date and time into the radar. A rather useless feature."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Beautiful weather app, the design is very modern with a simplistic approach which is very refreshing! The developer is very prompt in taking in the feedback and getting the issues resolved."
Appy Weather,Weather,1," It's ok, definitely not worth a subscription fee for a widget and the so called other features available. I would have bought the app but a subscription fee for a weather app is just greedy."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Excellent app, dev really responsive and helpful. I've got a bit of a weather app addiction, and this one is very well designed, and really stylish. Well worth your money."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," The best weather app till date, very easy to understand but sad that only the paid version has alerts or notifications"
Appy Weather,Weather,3," The concept of the weather app is great, but I can't give it a higher score until there are more choices of weather providers. Dark sky is highly unreliable in sparcely populated areas of the US such as the Midwest."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, So the widget disappearing problem seems to be fixed. I appreciate the continuous hard work put into it. It's one of the best apps on my entire phone. Thanks!
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This is a great clean weather app. Ads are non-intrusive (don't think I have even seen one yet) and the design is great. Would recommend!
Appy Weather,Weather,3, The review notification is annoying.
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Comparing weather prediction with what I see out my window has been spot on. Can't get better than that. Would like to see a little more work on the radar. But this is by far the best weather app I've found.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This is very helpful, it is very accurate,it is very windy where I live and this app can know the speed of the wind,HIGHLY recommended"
Appy Weather,Weather,4, I like the design. Sadly Dark sky is very inaccurate in most of EU. Would be great to have other weather data providers to choose from.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Happy with the purchase and worth the few Euros. More personable than many of the weather apps out there. Honestly for the product you get the price is more than fair
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Just installed, testing at the moment, but looking like a great app..update, it working well haven't had any problems, seems to be spot on with weather ..i now giving 5 stars"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Super well thought out user experience. Minimal , so you're presented with the info most needed and customisable for any detailed info needed. The widgets are also a just as well designed."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," After using the free version for just over a day - bought the subscription without hesitation. Really like the data source, Dark Sky as a weather predictor."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Like it so far. What happens though when Dark Sky is an Apple product and this can't use them any longer???
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Great UI design. Very intuitive and informative. I use the radar a lot on other apps. Not 5 stars because radar is only stationary. Would be perfect if radar function was equivalent to other apps.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I didn't think I'd find a better weather app, but this is more detailed than any other. I opted to subscribe yearly for it almost immediately"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great app with plenty of free features. It looks great, has easy to use controls, and the price per year isn't too bad at all."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Really like this app. Have returned to it after a break and it has improved markedly. All the information you would want is there.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Slick. Simple. Love the paid app. Radar, wind direction and speed for all of you boaters and sail sports. So worth it! Perfect!"
Appy Weather,Weather,4, The descriptive weather info is a welcome improvement over the data points that most weather apps provide. I only wish the radar functionality was more robust.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great layout and lovely dark theme. I like the way that locations are displayed (my home is near WDW, so I set my default location to The Magic Kingdom)"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Gorgeous design, minimalistic, lots of white space and still delivers the same amount of information as some of the detailed cluttered apps. And a very responsive dev."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," It has lots of creative concepts, Loved it ! ☺️ Worth it for premium purchase 👍🏻. But it is struggling with animation effects not smooth enough and data refresh time also slow 🧐."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Solid weather app. Been looking for a weather app with a simple breakdown using natural language for awhile. Some things I'd like to see added are more weather sources and widget options (5x1 widget please).
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app is so good. It makes sense of the weather in a way anyone can understand. I quickly signed up for the premium for a minimal cost.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app actually makes me want to check the weather. Been my daily driver for months and it continues to impress & get better with each update. Highly recommended!
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app is GREAT!! All the weather predictions are RIGHT and I am so happy for this!! I introduced the app to all my friends! :)
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love this weather app. Beautifully designed and built, it provides exactly the information I'm seeking each day."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," So far this app has been very accurate, which in itself came as a surprise, and I just love the graphics, really enjoy using"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great product and great service by the developer when reporting bugs. Love, love, love it!!"
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Bit meh tbh particularly the widgets which have very limited scope for personalisation + mine don't update anymore, bit poor for £4/year subscription. There are many better free alternatives imo."
Appy Weather,Weather,1, The weather forecast for my area is almost always wrong. Right now it's says heavy rain and absolutely no rain anywhere. Switching back to AccuWeather.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, App has worked well and the developer seems to push out bug fixes at a pretty fast pace which is a good sign.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," The best out there. Simple, sleek and precise. Just to add allergies/pollen alert, it would be the best app ever."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Fantastic weather app. Just the information I need, in a well designed, easy to use and understand format. 5 stars."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I really like this weather app, well worth the cost. Everything is organized in an easy to navigate to what you want to see."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great app, developer is responsive. Best weather app on the play store"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great developer feedback, I made a suggested change and it was live by the end of the same day! Great and helpful app."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Best weather app on the Play Store, beautifully presented with detailed information just a tap away, well worth the subscription"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Cool app, and the most accurate in Costa Rica by my experience. Also is nice to have a weather app which uses non scientific language."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, It has a really clean UI and quite accurate. I have a few weather apps and this is definitely up there.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, The app is a beautiful piece of design. Every competing weather app is a disgusting beast by comparison. Dev is responsive too.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app is buttery smooth and the developer is responsive and quick to fix any bugs. Highly recommend! Amazing weather app and well worth the subscription cost!
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love the app just wish it'd use my location chosen in app for notifications and not current location as I don't have gps on. Any way to fix this? Other than that love it, thanks!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I've been a long time fan of DarkSky so I was curious if this app would add value. It's absolutely a better way to view DarkSky data.
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Widgets unreliable. After update, widgets not working at all. Subscription automatically, why? There are better free alternatives out there!"
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Very Nice app, but it consumes 20% of my battery on a daily basis.... Too much for what its supposed to do.... Uninstalling"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Great app with good design. The attention to the details worth every penny.
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Highly complex and confusing navigation, difficult and time consuming to find data easy to get ""lost"". Very plain widgets."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app has the best UX out of any weather app hands down and the free version covers all basic functionality you would want out of a weather app.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," A great weather app. Simple design, user-friendly, accurate and very useful. Would definitely recommend it!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Well done, this app is so refreshing when you compare to more traditional weather apps. I upgraded to pro version straight off the bat."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Very simple ugi and information accurate I would give it 5 stars if radar was able to show movement of storm systems not just a static display
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very nice looking weather app with correct weather forecast. Developer is very communicative and constantly updates app with new things and bug fixes.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I reached out and they got right back to me about where to find light style widgets (in settings, instead of separately in the widget screen) Putting the temperature on the notification bar is worth the sub alone"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very clean interface and easy . It shows the accurate location.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, This is my new favorite weather app! I love the minimalist layout and the timeline format.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Galaxy S10 user, wow what a great weather app, consistent, provides daily and weekly logs. Nice interface to boot."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," If you are looking for light widgets after last update, just go into Settings, scroll down to widgets, and then change the Foreground colour to Light. It's now configurable in-app."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Good app, widget is a bit glitchy at times. Wish there were other styles as well for the widget."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," A good app with decent Animations and performance, Though more Details about Weather can be added like in Accu Weather. Satellite View should also make debut on this."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Why is it forecasting rain when temps are -8f??! Nice clean look, but still, rain? Something is wrong!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Fantastic look, all the weather info I want, beautiful widgets and quick responses from the developer. 5 stars all day long"
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Hi, I am unable to see more than the initial screen. Gps is enabled but the app gets stuck in loading screen. Samsung s8, city: istanbul/turkey Edit: started working now"
Appy Weather,Weather,1," No widget, no frost/freeze alert for gardening, interface not straightforward/not easy to navigate. Uninstalling"
Appy Weather,Weather,2, The new update made the widget inoperable and it doesn't show any weather details. However if they fix the problem then I will update my review.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love the aesthetic, well presented information and excellent range of widgets"
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Why would I pay when it doesn't have data (ie live radar) for Australia!! Should make it clear what is available and where before you pay then find out!!
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Nice, clean, easy to follow. Could use a better radar."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," It really cool app, very easy to use and with cool concept to look at the weather"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Can be improve in future to its full potential as more elaborative and in a fun way! Good Luck!
Appy Weather,Weather,5, A favourite from the Windows Phone days with a rather lovely update and makeover. Recommended.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, The best weather app out there! Very stylish and very accurate.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Great app. Design is amazing and the developer immediately replied when I contacted them.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Fun app, very localized current weather and forecasts, love the look of the app"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I Find Weather Is Accurate With This App And Localize In Your Area. Good Job, Keep it Up."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Like Dark Sky's information but wish it had a better design? Then you've found the app you're looking for
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Good app! Easy information to consume, and multiple widgets."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT, ACCURATE AND NO ADDS. I DISCRIBED APPY WEATHER AS ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE IN THE PLAY STORE. I ALSO GOT THE PAID PRO VERSION. IMPROVE A LITTLE BIT WITH THE ALERT RAIN, WITH THE SIGN OF UMBRELLA AND JACKET WHEN IT GOT COLD. NICE ONE"
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Use it all the time. I like concise style for delivering weather.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very good fuss free and accurate!! Highly recommend you get the fill version
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Cool UI... easily understanding. Good one and I recommend to all over other application.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Been using on other phones for years. Updated frequently.
Appy Weather,Weather,2, Doesn't provide my local weather; all the temperatures are a couple of degrees out (live and forecast).
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Great app, having issues on loading it takes minutes and almost hangs"
Appy Weather,Weather,1," Very cool and user friendly, but it says its sunny and i'm standing in the rain..."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Really good. Even better than dark sky. Keep it up!
Appy Weather,Weather,3, Would like a one time purchase instead of a yearly subscription.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Excellent app. I highly recommend it.
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Too many ads and spying going on.

Appy Weather,Weather,5, This is a trendy weather app with a touch of spice! Definitely worth the buy 😎
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Good it's a unique weather app I really like the design
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Love the design, developer very active!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Best replacement for dark sky
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very good and good app i never seen like this before....
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Appy Weather and MyRadar are the best!
Appy Weather,Weather,3, Widget broke after recent update - P30 Pro
Appy Weather,Weather,5," When Dark Sky announced their Android support dead, I started looking for a replacement. I found Appy Weather, and I subscribed to support them. I look forward to see what the new providers will be, and what functionality will be added or improved."
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Very slow, never opens quickly."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, Like the app just wish you had the option on widget to make all of the selections darkmode
Appy Weather,Weather,2, Don't really like the fact that you have to upgrade to the premium app to see the radar and the fonts need to be in more Styles if you're going to let me pick too many free apps for the weather out there to choose from to have to pay even if it is only 399 a year

Appy Weather,Weather,5, It's a really useful app and designed very well.
Appy Weather,Weather,4, The interface just not my favourite...

Appy Weather,Weather,4, simple minimalist clean interface

If this were fixed, i would get the Subscription and delete the Weather Network app 🙂."
Appy Weather,Weather,1, I personally don't like the design. Trying to be different but hard to navigate. I don't know what I'm looking at with multiple locations or where to find key information. It all blends together in a confusing way
Appy Weather,Weather,1," Lots of bold and overly ornate fonts rather than picking up from my simple settings. Clunky graphics and generally poor interface, with everything that matters at extra cost. Shame, as after 5 mins I uninstalled unimpressed."

I've discovered this app, read the reviews (quite good actually even with only an average of 4.3 stars), installed, and then i'm already impressed. As a former user of that other similarly-looked weather app, this got my approval. As of now I'm on the testing phase. Hope this will turn out to be good kust like that other app. I hope this will improve as time goes on. Thank you, dev."
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Coming from someone in the HEMS industry, having a radar included in my weather app is essential for safe flying. Having to pay for simple feature that most apps provide is not okay. Ads provide plenty of revenue."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Wonderful app. But please do a one time fee instead of a subscription!

Great information presentation. Great job of allowing information selection. Allows you to show info via text or graphically. But it's missing specific location selection. Difficult to know exactly where you're getting your weather. Right now I think I'm getting all my weather from Tucson in general. This is a big town. I want to see weather from the southeast of Tucson. Give me a better location selection method then this APP is a 10 (5 of 5)! Plus I would want to buy it😃

I have been tirelessly seeking out a weather app with an elaborate, more personal forecast... ""partially cloudy"" or ""rain showers"" is meaningless and tells me nothing! This, on the other hand, is an example of what an Appy forecast looks like : ""the day starts off humid, with a slight breeze in the afternoon, with some rain beginning overnight & continuing into tomorrow morning"" Yassss! THANK YOU!"

Appy Weather,Weather,1, Weather radar is literally just a website loaded in the app... Kind of rookie move for a paid app

Other popular weather apps, including those on the Editor’s Choice list, are available for older versions of Android. Unfortunately Appy Weather is not. According to Google's Android Distribution chart,16.9% of users are still running Marshmallow. Furthermore, 19.2% users are still running Nougat. Considering these numbers, why would the developer make Appy only available for Oreo and above? By doing this, the developer has lost a combined userbase of 36.1% from Marshmallow and Nougat alone. This also includes potential in-app purchases as well."

Appy Weather,Weather,5, This app is THE MOST user friendly app I have ever used. It simple but modern style is great. The text and icons are the perfect size too. Worth it totally. So many features from daily to hourly weather. Then you can also find out things like expected or potential amount of rain. It's awesome

Now it might sound like i am fanboi, but it's hard to find beautiful and usefull apps in android with third culture apps, Francisco Franco and Sam Ruston are the few people who makes beautiful andorid apps possible 😄"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This weather app is great. Its Simplicity is all the beauty. It is easy to understand. And it gives me the exact data that I need regarding the weather. Furthermore it has very useful widgets. In addition, the developer is very responsive to questions and comments."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Very good weather app that looks very nice. Very responsive developer as well. Forecast seems very spot on, info shown on the screen is all relevant and not full on. Initially, the UI seems a bit tricky to navigate but you quickly adapt & realise how useful and well put together it is."
Appy Weather,Weather,2," has too many menus to flip through, UI not so intuitive, but the features are great, my advice would be to streamline the UI"

Appy Weather,Weather,5, Simple and concise.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," If you need a Dark Sky replacement, this is it."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," As simple as this app is in its interface (which is exactly what I want from a weather app), it still is as detailed as ever with daily and hourly forecasts including wind speed and moon phases and everything. Not to mentioned the very handy widgets!"

Good job.
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Great app, but bad data. Dark sky predictions are really bad for my country"
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Can't find my location and yes GPS is on..all other weather apps have no problems finding me so don't understand the issue...
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Thanks for your reply, the app is very good for me. (Could not use in China? When I select current location, then display ""Having trouble checking the weather.Please try again,or restart the app(that sometimes helps).Sorry for the inconvenience."")"
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Great weather app, I'd happily pay a one off fee but definitely not a monthly subscription for a weather app."
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Reasons for 3 star are :1) It's UI is not smooth. From app, if i open the SETTING, the animation lags and are observable which makes heart ache!. 2) app is not offering fully pro feature rather it has yearly plan. Who the heck keeps paying for full feature yearly?. Total rating from my side is 5/10."
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Janky animations, unnecessarily huge fonts, scattered layout.. it's the complete opposite of what Weather Timeline stood for. :/"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Was using Overdrop before I stumbled upon this one. Great stuff that. Paid for a premium to get widgets in a few days after I started to use it. Surely recommend this app. The data is superbly put down for your examination in the morning.
Appy Weather,Weather,3, Great weather app!! Very easy to use and understand!! But I always check the radar and when I tried it said I had to had to upgrade and pay $3.99 to do so....The radar should be included in the FREE version of Appy Weather!! So that's why i uninstalled and gave the app 3 stars!
Appy Weather,Weather,1," Contains ads. Yearly payment to get tid of them? It's a joke right? One time fee or max 3 euro. Any thing else is just simple greed.

Yearly payment to get tid of them? It's a joke right? One time fee or max 3 euro. Any thing else is just simple greed. You will probably anyway get more money through one time fee. Only complete idiots would pay for this app yearly when there are other weather apps out there just as good, with and without ads with one time payment and without one time payment"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Friendly Dev and I like the UI
Appy Weather,Weather,4," The design is top notch. I just didn't use it all the time, didn't have a widget."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," I've been using this app for about a week now. It is spooky how accurate it is. ""Heavy rain in the next 5 minutes"" and sure enough it will be correct - almost to the minute. Best weather app ever."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, I was sceptical when I read the reviews saying this is the best weather app ever. After trying it out the reviews were right. Definitely pay for the upgraded features they are worth it. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
Appy Weather,Weather,2," App is okay, but price is way over the top, one off price at that price yes, but yearly you're have a joke."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," easy to read weather icons with enough information so you can quickly get a idea of the conditions, powered by dark sky and so far it's been pretty accurate."
Appy Weather,Weather,4, The UI is certainly interesting and the reports are Very accurate. The app itself is somewhat unresponsive and laggy. Once it performs better I will definitely purchase the yearly subscription.
Appy Weather,Weather,1, For my current location it shows just my country's name. That is something not expected from a paid app. Secondly its difficult to navigate on this app. No info about what kind of notifications it sends . Its raining outside and this app is totally unaware of it
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Greetings from 2014! I finally switched from WP to Android a couple days ago and low and behold I find you here as well. To be frank I prefer the styling of the old app, but you're well worth a second five star review regardless. Best wishes for the future."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This is one of the best apps going ,customer service is outstanding my problem was solved within 24 hrs. Anyone looking for a simple weather app this is it keep up the great work guys. Jacob"
Appy Weather,Weather,3," Good UI but unfortunately really bad forecasts, where other apps are more accurate."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Cute weather app, simple UI informative, accurate"
Appy Weather,Weather,2," Unfortunately, this app doesn't seem to be able to search for some places in uk. I put in Richmond, and no Richmond in uk appeared just USA and Canada. Useless!"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," This app is intuitive, user friendly, and accurate I really like it !"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Beautiful and insightful app for checking the weather. Love the iconography and typography, it communicates the purpose of the app very well. Recommended."
Appy Weather,Weather,1," I can't download it. It goes until 70% and after a while, it goes to disappear."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, The best weather app I've ever seen.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," My ""daily driver"" weather app, Award is well deserved."
Appy Weather,Weather,4," Very nice app, clean, informative and not cluttered. But the annual fee for the widgets is not acceptable."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Best weather app, nice interface, accurate weather, overall a great app"
Appy Weather,Weather,1, does not do anything better or different than other free or one time pay weather apps. a subscription weather app in 2019 is probably not the best way to go.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Amazing product going to buy the pro version soon to help this excellent indie dev out for now the app seems flawless, which is rare hopefully all the pro features will also be flawless, great app!"
Appy Weather,Weather,1, This app force closes upon location retrieval. Whether it's automatic or manual. I tried it...it doesn't work. Very disappointing.
Appy Weather,Weather,4, I would give 5 stars if it allowed the clock widget to access the system clock like most others do. In order to use your weather widget I have to use another widget for my clock and alarms. Not cool. I should be able to access the system clock and alarms thru your widget.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Great way to dress or brace yourself before going out! clean, simple and honestly written."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, A lot cleaner than the previous weather app I was using. Love the crisp icons and smooth animations too. Keep it up 😄👍
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Lots of information, love how it's presented. Great weather app."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Beautiful app very accurate I'm well pleased!
Appy Weather,Weather,5," What a beautiful weather app! I love the design, simplicity and clarity. It's quick and stable."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Excellent weather app. looks great, very accurate and superb support from the developer. Great purchase."
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very good app but unable to see the days welcome and forecast message in full. Otherwise a fantastic app.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," the best and most beautiful weather app, from a team who won't sell their soul to apple"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," Simple, clean and accurate. Love the way it 'talks' to me. 👍"

Appy Weather,Weather,5," Beautiful app! Would love to have more 5x1 widget options, a week view in particular."
Appy Weather,Weather,5," 5 th star for the responsiveness of the developer. Again, Props for the design.. Good work..👍"
Appy Weather,Weather,5," beautiful, but id recommend getting the Pro version for the widget and no ads."
Appy Weather,Weather,3," It says having trouble and doesn't work :/ tried to uninstall and install , restart and nothing helps :/ it was awesome app, going to miss you appy 👋"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Used to be a WP user and this was the best weather app back then. glad to have you back on Android
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Well designed weather app. Asked the developer for some options and implemented them in the nwxt update. Highly recommend downloading!
Appy Weather,Weather,1, This app is dead since Dark Sky API is shut down by Apple.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Beautiful weather app. Simple and pleasing to interact with.
Appy Weather,Weather,1, $3.99 subscription for a status bar current temp does not make this a best app of 2019
Appy Weather,Weather,2, In app purchases for items free on most other weather apps even widget I you have to buy :( Also postcodes don't work.
Appy Weather,Weather,5," awesome application, love the visuals and the accuracy ao far! 👍👍"
Appy Weather,Weather,5, the interface is awesome and the free version gives u enough to enjoy the apo

Appy Weather,Weather,5, Very attractive and fun.
Appy Weather,Weather,5, Love the design! Its comfy and feels nice using!
Appy Weather,Weather,4, i like this app a lot am just wondering why the widget takes up so much space but yet the text and everything this is so small
Appy Weather,Weather,1," Sub-bloody-scriptions needs to go,just charge a once off no ad option"
Appy Weather,Weather,2, Subscription ona weather app?! Is that what today's apps are all about. Pathetic.
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Ads make widgets non-functional. Don't waste your time or money.
Appy Weather,Weather,1, Fort needs to be a lot bigger So you don't have to squint your eyes to view it

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Loved it until an update a couple of weeks ago made it unusable. It wouldn't load any recipes, so I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now it will not let me login. Very disappointing."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," App crashes every time I open it Running on an older device (Android 5.1) but it has always run really well. Now however every time I open the app, it logs me in then immediately shuts down."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Android tablet version is rubbish! Always freezing, don't have access to the comment's, can't select highest rating first, very often it says no internet and can't connect to the point you have to delete app and reinstall. This version is just awful."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," The dishes are amazing but the app functionality is the worse I have met. Ia taking up to 7 seconds to open and load home page and I m always getting errors when I search, like no result or data load fail."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," The app is great. The ads are a little annoying but that's minor. My only real gripe is; does it have to ask if I want to set up/add to a collection every single time I save a recipe? Surely this can be turned off, or at least give me the option to."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Have uploaded app and cannot go any further as have not recieved the confirmation email (to a hotmail account). Have tried multiple times. Please address this, thank you"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Works when it feels like it. When it does work and you open it the loading banner stays on for ages over the tabs. Badly designed.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, I love the recipes but it really annoys me that you cannot see reviews as the comments on them usually help improve a recipe. Also it often thinks I am offline and won't let me search recipes even though I have 4g/ Wi-Fi.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, It doesn't seem to show the recipes that you get on the BBC food website which is really frustrating. Why aren't they the same? Feedback would be appreciated.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Some good recipes - way too many and intrusive ads! Some decent recipes (mind you, I'm saying this about a British recipe collection! 😁). However, the number and size of ads is more than irritating. Not sure if it's worth keeping the app. No option of payment to remove ads."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Like others, can't paste my email and password into the login screen, so no point in wasting any more time trying to go any further. Similar user review took 2.5 months for a response which basically said we'll think about it. Uninstalled. Developers need a user experience tutorial."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," This app had so much promise but 2 days after installing it keeps saying no internet connection and search function doesn't work, when clearly this is not the case. The only way to resolve it is to restart the phone. I won't be doing this so will probably delete if it doesn't get resolved."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," It's alright, but disappointed the browser-based shopping list features don't seem to carry across to the app."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Tried creating an account using Facebook and 2 different emails but I get an error everytime so it's completely useless as you can't use the app without an account!
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Good app with great recipes. My only gripe is that the different advert sizes make the page jump up and down, very annoying while half way through cooking. Either use a fixed space for the advert or stop it changing when in cooking mode to stop it shifting content."

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," The recipes and the layout are fine...if you have 4 hours to wait for them to load. Unfortunately indicative of every BBC site/app that exists, almost great, but always always, some terrible functionality. BBC, ever heard of software testers?"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," It's a decent app, but it runs really slowly on my phone, even when I've just restarted it and even when I'm connected to Wi-Fi not 4G. If it ran quicker, it would be 5*."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Was really good now a disaster. Now asks me to sign in which I try to do with Google then get a database error message and all my content of 60+ recipes have disappeared. If I log in on windows pc all present and correct. I HAVE TRIED TO EMAIL YOU BUT NO ONE RESPONDS.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Good recipes but navigation around the app is terrible. Once you have clicked into a recipe to view it there is no back button, you have to click home and enter all your search parameters again. Just use the website!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, I really like this app however not having the reviews on there which are handy for extra tips is a real mistake as for me and many others it's our favourite bit. If this is added then would be a 5 star app.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Love this app! Easy to use. I can't seem to read reviews for the recipes however. That would be great if I could! I just pop on to the website to check usually but would make for a smoother process.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Why not let people paste a password? I generate the password to logins using a password generator so they are secure and unique and I don't have to remember them.

I generate the password to logins using a password generator so they are secure and unique and I don't have to remember them. Logging in on this app they have disabled paste for password - why? It's a login for recipes, what is the worst that can happen if I cut and paste my password?"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Very useful to use and very good offers to be had, also really great recipes for wonderful food."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, I've had to uninstall and poorly rate this App solely for the reason it wouldn't let me paste my password to log in. I use a password generator which provides me with very complicated intricate passwords. I couldn't be bothered to mess around with it. Sorry BBC
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," It was good for a while, now it just says could not load data whenever you search something (even if i have wifi). The app is still not working."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Very helpful app, especially if you want to keep an eye on your calories intake. It offers a wide variety of recipes that you can easily find browsing through categories. Would definitely recommend it!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, This app is a great idea but definitely needs some tweaks.... priority number 1 is being able to read reviews of recipes. What's the point of telling me there are 40 reviews of a dish but not being able to access them?
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Excellent app with a huge variety of recipes from simple to complex. Directions are clear and easy to follow along with also. Highly recommended.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, Substanial amount of recipes that are easy to follow but app doesn't have the same functionality as the web pages. Frustrating that you cannot sort recipes by top reviewed first plus cannot see comments posted about a recipe
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Good app, easy to find recipes. Would be nice to be able to read comments left by other reviewers to see if they've altered the recipe instead of just reviewing a recipe."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Can't create an account using Facebook Gmail or email so can't use the app.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Great recipes but the app is so slow at times
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Very flaky. Kept failing to auth via Google last week. Now if you login and switch apps it says ""no internet""...But I verified that I do have 100mbps over WiFi currently"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Really good app. Love the recipes as they are straight forward, easy to understand measurements and quick to make! Highly recommended it!!!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, sign in with google or Facebook functions don't work and I'm still waiting for my confirmation email before i can sign in...until then it's a useless app. Just go on the website
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," I wish this app actually worked. It was so full of bugs I couldn't even get in. Repeated cookies notifications on the same page, broken links, and inability to reset password. A real shame..."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, This app is so slow. Takes forever to load recipes and searches. And for some reason it takes a lot of power to run the app
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Great app so many things to cook. Also it's so easy to follow with all the ingredients listed and the great step by step method on how to actually make it
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Its ok but could be so much better. Access to reviews is key when choosing a recipe, and ads are too interuptive of the browsing experience"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Can't login with Google, once I finally got into the app I got errors when searching. Oddly now it's working but some searches never load..."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Couldn't log in, kept redirecting me back to the beginning, wouldn't take any password, completely useless, just like the BBC really, don't bother trying it, just cut and paste from their website recipes."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, Invalid Request when logging in with Google as other users have experienced. Logged in with Facebook instead. Good ideas here though.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," I do like this app, but would love option to pay to remove ads, they are starting to become a tad intrusive."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," ok for storing recipes, but not so good for browsing for new recipes. Not as good as the website. Can't see reviews or tips on the app."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Can't read comments from others who have already tried the recipes. I'm going to uninstall this app right away and go back to using the website.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Not loading recipes even though good fast signal.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Won't let me login either with Google or by inputting my email and password. Therefore app is useless as you can't access anything without logging in.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Irritating notifications and no easily visible way to disable them. Automatic uninstall from me. If you're a recipe app, notifications should be disabled by default. Obviously not important enough to nag people's attention"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," The recipes are great but everything loads slowly. Please implement caching or work on the app performance, it shouldn't take over a minute to download recipes that I already saved."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," This app would be 6 stars if it is had the function to ""copy ingredients"" so they could be pasted into a shopping list. Otherwise very impressed."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," It is not working, the log in tabs are not active."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Can't log in to app, even when I try to reset password the email that is sent has no link. Tried numerous different times an every time the is no link attached"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," 1. Why must I create an account to use a recipe app? 2. OK, I give in re point 1. But when I attempt to create an account using my Google account, it errors consistently. Uninstalled after 3 minutes."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Confirmation emails never received. Have tried many times and checked to see if has been filtered. Not working, please fix."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, absolutely love this app. it's a godsend! can look up recipes when Im shopping and it's great for helping me meal plan.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Loaded quickly and accepted my Google login but search always brings up nothing. Too many intrusive ads. Uninstalled.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, The app is way too slow to load recipes. Best take screenshots if you plan to cook something from here.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, often fails to sync or slow to open. Great when it works though.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Works occasionally, but recently become unresponsive in the evenings, exactly when you need it!!!!!!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," had problems with sign in and uninstalled the app, customer service contacted me promptly and resolved the problem immediately. enjoying the app now"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Unable to login with Google account, gives error message as other users have reported. No customer support to repair issues. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP RILL FIXED"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Always worked fine for me on any device and the recipes are easy to follow and are, least the ones I've tried, really good!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," pretty good app. would be an improvement if the shopping basket tool was included in the app, future improvement maybe."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Cannot login with Google, useless as I have recipes stored from when I had iPad ( iOS app has no issues);fix please"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Loads of lovely recipes. Easy to search and save them in folders.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Great app.. useful to have an option to prevent the tablet ftom switching off while cooking. And I like being able to create and keep my own collections
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," I don't like to feel forced to create an account just to try the app, this should be optional"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," As ither mentioned, it's not possible to log in, tried both Google log in and Facebook and neither button does anything."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Just waste of time. Can't use without login. And login is not working. Uninstalled the app.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Fantastic resource. Highly recommended. The best cooking app and website. Thanks Beeb.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Disappointed to find ads all the way through it especially as it's associated to the ad free BBC. Deleted.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, deleted after 5 minutes because all it did was freeze or take ages to load. Website is far less hassle
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Yet another app that doesn't allow the pasting of passwords during registration. Uninstalled immediately.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Terrible app. Full of bugs rendering it useless. Really poor from the BBC.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, unfortunately the app keep telling me there is no internet connection and freezes while internet works perfectly.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, Great app but a shame you can only rate the recipe and can't read comments made by other users who have made the recipe and suggest tweaks like you can on the website
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Unbelievably slow to load up the recipes. Such a shame as if this app worked properly it would be so useful.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Can't even make an account or log in? Such a shame
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, I love the easy way to plan menus
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Can't log in using Google. Just get 'invalid request'. Useless!
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Completely stopped working. Pointless battery drainer.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Takes ages to load recipes and always crashes - terrible especially as it's from the BBC!
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, chrome version is better. unable to make a list of ingredients or see tips.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Very good and helpful, healthy eating"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Used to love this app, but now crashes within 30 seconds every time it opens"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," awful, created an account and can't sign into the app. reset password and keeps saying incorrect password. given up and deleted!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Can't sign in with Google and when I try sorting an account it won't let me create a new password..... I think I'll just go buy a cookbook
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, really good app for looking up recipe's but would like to see the add the shopping list/add to basket feature added to the app
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, The app works well for me but it definitely needs reviews/comments and tips available to view like on the website
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Sign in screen none responsive, forgotten password email never comes. Sadly it's broken."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Sign in with Google not working. Can't get into my recipes at all anymore.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Every time I open a recipe it shuts down, I've since deleted it and use other apps for recipes"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Love the app, use it everyday. Wish I could see reviews of recipes or can I just not find them?"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, There's a meal for everyone on this app. Perfect for being on a budget as well.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, One of the main reasons I love BBC good food so much are the reviews. The app doesn't show any of the reviews. Will stick to the website.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Way too many adverts interrupting recipe searches. i uninstalled the app and will use the website instead.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Doesn't work, never loads."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, It's so slow. It would be great if it was about X10 faster!
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Can't login with Google as just get invalid request. Instant disappointment and uninstall.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Buggy. Need to shut app down in order to use it again and it crashes allot
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, I love the app. but would be a 5 star if it showed the reviews and the tips like the website.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Average at best. No print function. so unless you like your technogy in the kitchen dont bother
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Nice layout but doesn't save the recipe half of the time so defeats the object a little bit.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Great for storing recipes you like to keep at hand.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Please make a built in shopping list, would make it even better"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, I love BBC good food but it is frustrating not being able to see receipe review comments on the app as this means that I always have to use the web version
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, it's a good app but could be a bit better adding more recipes like Chinese food
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Hi BBC Good Food, I had a question about advertisements on this application. being funded via the BBC should mean that no advertising in any media. Can you explain why I am receiving advertisements on this platform? regards"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Decent app, would like the ability to view and write reviews though."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Everytime I tried to log in it wouldn't recognise me, even after resetting my password! 😞"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Only works with an account. So you pay with your privacy. 💩
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Be nice if the app worked. Terrible reliability, as others have said. On the one time it worked it was great."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Love this app. Recipes are great and easy to find.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Cannot search for recipes, search box is useless!!!"

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Yum
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Great
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Love it
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Good app, the only thing that's really annoying is when you go into a recipe and then press back, it takes you right back to the very top of the recipe list which obviously is very annoying, you then have to scroll back through them all to find your place again"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," I love the app and can't wait to try cooking some of these dishes. I would love it if the app had a personal section were we can keep a diary and add photos of the dishes we cooked, and perhaps a tick box for when we've tried the dishes that are saved in our cookbook"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Works like a charm since last update
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Since the update the app is working as expected. Thanks BBC

One problem, and it's quite a big one for me.. You aren't able to view the 
reviews or comments on the recipes meaning the suggestions and tips are 
inaccessible. Bit disappointed in that!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Why display the total amount of customer reviews per recipe but then have 
no way to actually read them! You have to go to the website to view the 
comments, which then makes the app pointless! The app should have the same 
functionality as the web site."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Not sure why, but it is always apps created by the BBC that constantly 
crash. I've had this particular app 20 minutes and it's already crashed on 
me 3 times. I've had the same experience with iPlayer as well. Frustrating."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Great recipes and worked brilliantly before I got a new phone. Now the app crashes everytime I want to look at a recipe. Not helpful. Being able to see the comments on recipes would also be great.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Could be brilliant, but just doesn't work right now. No longer loads recipe's. Tried reinstalling app, can't login now. Service unreachable apparently. App is too flakey to be useful in it's current state."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Crashes out of the app as soon as you try and access a recipe. The same 
problem as numerous users have already highlighted in other reviews of this

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Previously this app worked brilliantly. But since moving to android pie the app auto closes when opening any of the recipies. Fingers crossed an update comes out soon and I can update my rating.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Not a terrible app - everything they have works well however the lack of a 
shopping list feature makes it significantly worse than just using the 
website so I'm afraid it's an uninstall for me"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," No better than using a web browser and no print function. I can print from 
Chrome though. Kind of, what's the point in it really?"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5," Wonderful app, simple and easy to find what I'm looking for. Some things I 
hope to see in future updates are the ability to save whole collections 
already made by the BBC, such as the student dishes collection, and more 
nutrition information such as cholesterol, vitamins, calcium, iron, etc."

I'm completely unable to sign in. It's a shame as there are so few good 
recipe apps."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Really good recipes but the app keeps on crashing whenever I try to select 
a saved recipe. This is quite disappointing!!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Crashes every time. Totally unusable. Such a shame as I love BBC Good Food. 
I hope you get it sorted soon."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Great app and really useful for using your account fully but being unable 
to view reviews is a massive down side"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Has stopped working on Pixel2 after Android 9 Pie update. Unusable as it 
closes when I select a recipe"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," It don't work i search for a recipe and it says you have none but i just found the recipe on your website and saved it to my favorites but it's not on my favorites in the app and apparently you have over 10,000 recipes apart from anything i look for"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Tried to view a recipe and the app kept closing on me. Cleared cache and 
storage to try and clear problem. Couldn't login with username and 
password. Tried forgot password and attempted to input new password, 
website just tells me to ""try again later!"" Something seriously wrong here."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, It's very slow and often crashes and you can't see recipe tips on the app but you can via Chrome; you're better off using it on the web.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," Used to be good, now crashes every time I try and open a recipe....so it's 
useless!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3, Keeps crashing like a total digital bastard. Please patch.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Ok app, would be a big improvement if when you view an item then return 
back to the list that you returned to where you were rather than back at 
the top of the page."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Unfortunately crashes as soon as I try to view a recipe.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Would score the app higher but for the fact there are no recipe comments

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Good but drains battery, might have to uninstall if it continues to do this!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Sign-in didn't function. Couldn't even get the basics right. Poor.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Great app if it works. App closes at the point of opening a recipe?
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Love this app and all recipies so easy to follow.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Great app when it works, but I find it keeps crashing after a few minutes use on my Samsung Galaxy S5 which is mildly annoying. Other than that, there's loads of delicious recipes and easy to follow instructions. BBC is always my first point of call when looking for new dishes to try. Thank you!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Hmm. Disappointing. I wish it'd remember your food preferences or intolerances so you  can search for appropriate recipes more easily. I'm not a huge fan of the page format. The recipes look good though and scrolling through is pleasant
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1," Downloaded the app as always use BBC good food recipes on my internet explorer. This app won't allow me to log in even though I've followed the link in the email. Waste of time, tried it numerous times and still won't work. Uninstalled."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Brilliant, except... you can't read the reviews! I can't imagine why the 
developers showed the stars but disabled the comments. Because of this I've 
gone back to viewing the recipes via Chrome and will keep doing so until I 
can see what people say about the recipes. What a shame."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, It's such a shame that this app doesn't have the recipe review comments that are on the website. I am a regular user of the website and find the comments invaluable for tweaking. Please add this feature!
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, Very useful especially easy access to favourites and placing them in collections. However I can't seem to be able to find some of the recipes that are on the website when using the app

at least a poorly designed user experience."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Started off great and then just stopped working. Can't sign in and can't search for recipes so basically useless now
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Way too many ads. It's better to use mobile version of the website than this app.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4," Incredible content, one of the best databases of amazing recipes. I would 
love it if the app actually cached my recipes offline, and didn't load 
every time I opened the app - the only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2, Won't load properly half the time. Layout and design are really poor.
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," I like this app, but I would love it if I could see the recipe reviews. 
Comments by other users are really useful."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," I didn't go past the sign up screen. If you can browse on the website why 
can't I do the same on the app?"

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,5, Crashes now and again but other than that
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,1, Too many error messages
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,4, I'll give it a 5 star if you can confirm the developers used Xamarin forms

The few nuisances I find in the app is inability to view comments under recipes, which has been mentioned by other users.

BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,2," This app is great if you want to look at 1 recipe. If you're browsing through a few though, it's torture. Exiting a recipe takes you right back to the top meaning you have to scroll right back down the list again. I feel like this is such a basic function to have been overlooked!"
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," Two main issues, it gets stuck loading when you scroll and the back button takes you to the home page instead of the previously viewed page. These two things mean it's hard to quickly view and save recipies. For me, the app is not usable. Pity, because the recipies are good."
BBC Good Food,Food & Drink,3," A good app BUT it keeps losing its Internet connection, even when the rest of my apps are online. The only way to remedy is to Force Close. Frustrating."

It's very frustrating to have to scroll through hundreds of recipes to continue my search. A temporary bookmark for search would be great.  *Invite to app/ tell à friend button would be great.  *If I leave app to read a message or perform another task on my mobile, when I return to app I'm back at the gf homepage again.  * Recipes I previously deleted still appear in my saved recipes section. It would be great to be able to delete multiple recipes at once.  *Recipes I saved and category I created on app have in faut not been saved or created.  Looks like I'll be sticking with the gf website for the foreseeable future.  Keep up the good work."

Would be better if it remembered were you were when browsing collections as it currently takes you back to the top of the list if you go back from having looked at a particular recipe. Also needs an option added to remove saved recipes from your own collection which only seems to be offered at the point you've added a recipe. Otherwise you need to log in to a pc to edit your saved recipes. All in all however, great app!"

Paying a credit card bill through BBVA is almost not worth the effort. If not for a fairly high credit limit that I was given, I would scrap this all together. You guys need to study how other credit card card companies receive payments, either online or via automated phone systems, and try your best to emulate them."
BBVA,Finance,2," App works when it wants to, basically just a blue screen and have to wait for next update. Not a great banking app...."
BBVA,Finance,5, It's worked everytime. I'm impressed with BBVA over other banks I've worked with both personally and commercially.
BBVA,Finance,2," As far as the app goes its pretty good but customer service being available, even before the pandemic hasn't been efficient. When you need someone its take a day and when you try to leave a call back request their system doesn't allow you to put in the time correctly. In military time or basic time."
BBVA,Finance,1," Bbva sucks horribly in general. I have no idea how theyre still in business. From incompetent customer service to constantly broken app, nothing works.

BBVA,Finance,5, I have been using a version of this app for many years. I have not had any problems with it. The updates always come on time and the notices are give 72 to 48 hour's ahead of time. Keep up the great work!!!

BBVA,Finance,4," This app is fine in most regards, 38 dollars for overdraft fees are way too high though and if things hit your account in the wrong order you can get a few. If they can fix that this bank and this app would be perfect. I don't think the bank wants to lose people but maybe."
BBVA,Finance,5," Convinient and easier to use. Very understanding customer service representatives. I highly recommend them to everyone especially low income people who are exploited by other banks. They give free checking accounts unlike other banks. If my reviews helped you, tip me. (Cashapp:$edgarasa)"

For some reason every week I make the same transactions and the last two weeks they put a fraud block on my card. I cant call them because it's not during business hours. Have to wait hours until its business hours to contact them. So now after waiting all night to call I've been on hold for 35 min. Frustrating. You think they would be able to see that I have made the purchases at least10 times a week for the last 6 months. Ready to change banks over it
BBVA,Finance,4, Used to get notifications for purchases at walmart grocery store and withdrawls not anymore. The only notifications I receive now are for online purchases and direct deposit. I am on android 8 and the app is updated whenever play store nitifies me.
BBVA,Finance,2," Alert push notifications are unreliable. The old text messaging alert system was flawless. Please either fix push notifications or bring back text alerts. And btw, i have turned off battery optimization for your app, allowed notifications, and allowed autostart."
BBVA,Finance,1, Website is down with a notice to download this app. App is down as well. Left with no account access whatsoever other than going to the bank..... which is closed due to Covid. Good job BBVA!
BBVA,Finance,5," Very, very convenient. Find I can do practically everything from from home. Thank You. So glad I bank with BBVA."
BBVA,Finance,1," Has functioned excellently. As of recent & patiently, it does start up AT ALL. What's the deal? No further info is provided. Any directions in assistance? Nope🙃 Can anyone assist?"
BBVA,Finance,5," Great app! Extremely easy to navigate and open new accounts and makes banking easier because I don't have to worry about making it into a branch before they close, even more handy now that COVID-19 has everyone mainly staying home."
BBVA,Finance,4, The app is great and very convenient. I think that a couple improvements are in order though. While viewing transactions it would be great if the time and location were included for all transactions.
BBVA,Finance,5," BBVA mobile app is highly robust and reliable. I have used it for bill pay, deposits, transfers and my favorite feature... mobile check deposits. This is a full featured mobile app that does pretty much everything the web portal does."
BBVA,Finance,1," I would suggest finding a new bank. The app works amazing but the bank it's self has no customer service, and horribly long wait times. If you like to keep your money safe I would say go to a different bank."
BBVA,Finance,1, Paper statements are turned on by default in this app and I was charged a 3$ fee for this. I never wanted paper statements. Ridiculous.
BBVA,Finance,1, Not showing card transaction pop ups anymore. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and tried all settings and alerts and nothing. I don't know what happened. Used to work perfectly then stopped out of nowhere.
BBVA,Finance,2, I have been trying for two days to get into my account using this mobile app to no avail. All I get is a blue screen. I tried my desktop and got right in
BBVA,Finance,1, The app doesn't display your username name so if you forget it and you enter it wrong more than three times it locks you out and you have to call customer care. I wouldn't bank with them. I

BBVA,Finance,1, Won't even let the registration process finish. Of you reach anyone on the phone either.
BBVA,Finance,1, Deposit checks doesn't work at all and is a frustrating experience. Shows multiple contradictory messages while scanning checks.
BBVA,Finance,3, Inconsistent data update and synch. Not dependable across Android devices. Needs work to be user friendly. Please!!! r f
BBVA,Finance,5, So helpful and easy to deposit checks without visiting local location.

BBVA,Finance,4, Great app and great support if ever a problem
BBVA,Finance,5, I been with BBVA for years and Had no issues they couldn't fix. Love them.

My only issue is sometimes when trying to use the app, it tells me it isn't able to retrieve my information, which is frustrating.

Useless over the weekend. If you get paid Friday morning and then pay a bunch of bills, you have to really keep track 9f your money yourself, because it won't update your balance for 72 hours. Meanwhile, you'll be getting receipts from your bills saying they've been paid, but the BBVA app will reflect none of this--nothing--for basically 3 days. It's pathetic."

BBVA,Finance,1, Extremely difficult and confusing to set up autopay. There are two ways to set up autopay and one requires you to open a BBVA checking account. It screwed me because I thought I had autopay enabled but it wasn't. Caused me to miss a payment. Will never use BBVA or this terrible app again.

I feel like it would make it easier to use. At current it does feel new in performance but the app feels bland, back when it was BBVA compass and before the logo rework everything matched but the app doesn't feel like it fits the new logo or overall theme of the bank."
BBVA,Finance,5, Excellent user friendly mobile banking app 👌😁
BBVA,Finance,1, Newest version of the app is not working correctly on my phone. Negitive 5 stars. The app opens to the new changes page but will not advance to my accounts so I can do any banking tasks. In fact Make it Negitive 100 stars. The app sucks! Moving the chase bank.

BBVA,Finance,1, Downloaded the new version and now I can't get past the terms of service. Can't check balances of neither account. I want my old version back. At least I know it works.

BBVA,Finance,5, Top tier customer service; stay loyal despite generous sign up bonuses!
BBVA,Finance,5, Have not learned how to use completely but i think it is great to be able to look a phone and see where you stand. And the fact of being notified within seconds of the use of your atm card
BBVA,Finance,1, Got locked out of my mobile app. Which I use daily for years. I am going to my local bank and closing my account. This is completely ridiculous.
BBVA,Finance,1, It's doest update your transactions. Atm cash deposits don't appear on my list until two days. It used to work fine but know it's terrible.

BBVA,Finance,1, Have not been getting notifications lately and it has caused some serious issues. Might have to find new bank.
BBVA,Finance,1," Barely ever works. Always ""temporarily unavailable."" This never happens with bank of america app or chase app."
BBVA,Finance,4, Great app outside of it not registering my fingerprint when I try to log in. It's like it's trying to process it and because it takes so long it won't allow me to log in.
BBVA,Finance,1, Does not work. Cannot go past that first page when yousign in. The WORST
BBVA,Finance,5, I've been with BBVA Compass 4 19 years. It ran pretty smoothly when the name was just Compass Bank. The bbva people go why above and beyond then most banks do. So I say kudos to my Compass Bank.
BBVA,Finance,5," Simple, easy to navigate UI. Stable, with all the alerts and push notifications I want. Best banking app I've used."
BBVA,Finance,5, Definitely one of the best banks Ive ever banked with. Even the online free checking account is an actual bank and not PREPAID. Although its not currently in my state I will most definitely make due and whenever I visit other states I can go directly to the branch
BBVA,Finance,4," On this tabletm for some reason, the bbva app got messed up. So I uninstallec it and installed it againm, hoping it will work fine. Otherwise, it is a great app. Thankx"

BBVA,Finance,1, I hate it and the bank. I can't even use my debit card after waiting over a month for it
BBVA,Finance,2, Been good I really like everything you can do with the app you sure is good to have I wish everybody could have one
BBVA,Finance,5," LOVE to see accounts with my other banks so easily, BUT they're not always there. Descriptions of transactions keep me REALLY confused. LOVE ease of logging in! It stores my username and allows me to see my password."
BBVA,Finance,5, I have no problem with the app. Easy to see all my accounts
BBVA,Finance,5, Awesome updates and easy to use
BBVA,Finance,2, Finally uninstalled the app. It seems to work randomly. Sometimes fingerprint id works; sometime it doesn't. Same for choices inside it. Much more aggravation than it's worth.
BBVA,Finance,1, I don't like changes!. I was used to the old version. Changes aren't for the people.
BBVA,Finance,5, I LOVE IT. BBVA COMPASS IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. TYSM
BBVA,Finance,5, Very easy to use and understand

This issue has persisted over at least 1 update. I don't have the ability to get to a branch to deposit checks during business hours and don't trust ATM deposits from past experiences with losing checks. The inability to use the app on a phone with an Android OS is ridiculous.

BBVA,Finance,5, Check my balance without a hassle
BBVA,Finance,1, App keeps crashing
BBVA,Finance,1, Repeatedly denied access and recognition of passwords
BBVA,Finance,5, No hassle AP it does it all.
BBVA,Finance,1," You have ruin, a good app with the last update. I can't see or use any of my business accounts. That I use on a daily basis.I have several accounts with bbva. If I can't get to all my accounts, there is no reason to stay with BBVA I will be switching banks. This week."
BBVA,Finance,5, Best app ever! Makes banking easy
BBVA,Finance,1, Everytime I try to send Popmoney the app crashes. All I have to do is select Popmoney & automatic crash. Happens on both my Galaxy8 & Samsung Tab A. I've uninstalled & reinstalled with no solution. I can't use Popmoney. EDIT: I've emailed BBVA twice & zero response. Very disappointing.
BBVA,Finance,1," for the past 3 months I've had to call every month to make a payment as it wont go through now. When the payment went through before this it went through twice and they wouldn't cancel the 2nd (pending) payment until after it went through. This app, company has just been a head ache."
BBVA,Finance,4, So far so great. Good updates and allows me to manage my account very well. Getting better each update.7
BBVA,Finance,1, You get locked out of transactions for 24 hours every few months because their systems can't understand the difference between a password expiring or being changed on purpose.
BBVA,Finance,5, Awesome service anything
BBVA,Finance,1, No mobil banking no help at all
BBVA,Finance,1, Keeps buffering when im trying to do a transfer. It was so bad that it transfered same amount 3 times because of the buffering. Please stop updating because its not working. Had to go to bank to fix the problem your app has caused. Love your bank though!

BBVA,Finance,4, Very nice tellers and very fast
BBVA,Finance,1, slow and frustrating

BBVA,Finance,5, Very nice and easy to use.
BBVA,Finance,1," I will list the problems that this app has:  1. You cannot do a principal payment + curtailment in the same transaction. You have to do one, then the other.   2.

You cannot do a principal payment + curtailment in the same transaction. You have to do one, then the other.   2. When you submit a payment, you don't get a confirmation number or even email (why doesn't this app send you an email that you made a payment??). This WILL lead to double payment since 1) you don't get a confirmation, 2) the balance on the loan will remain the same.  3. You have to select frequency on a loan payment....why? If I'm selecting to pay,   BBVA shouldn't have broken the app further. If you make an accidental double payment, don't let them bounce you around between the call centers in South America and Asia.  If you do that, they will allow the payment to post...  I am now receiving no responses or replies from the devs after I told them what happened."

Pretty good app. Many useful features and information accessible through online banking to the app. There's so much to use I'm still ""setting up"" what I want made available after 18 months of review (once a month). The only limitation I've found is the app uses the set up from Online Banking to display a ""condensed"" version of Online Banking's information. The app has been capable of everyday uses like balances, bill pay, statements, and any banking task I may have easily....."
BBVA,Finance,1, Current version and last version don't work and sit on blue BBVA startup screen until it times out. This is on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ Android version 8.0.0. It worked fine before BBVA 7.2.2.1106 and version immediately prior.
BBVA,Finance,5, Really easy to navigate

BBVA,Finance,1," Update: they added the ability to make payments, finally, to the app. Scheduled a payment on the due date USING THEIR APP after speaking with their phonebank and they still drafted my account and had the balls to charge me an overdraft."

It's easy to use and you can literally monitor every transaction. The safety feature I like is that you can disable your card if its lost or stolen.And reactivate when found."

I have spoken with the IT department at BBVA, they were not able to help. I miss my real-time alerts. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled, I have double checked all settings.I still receive instant text on daily balances but not realtime debits.The option for text is not even a option in my alerts.This only happened when the new card was activated.No one at BBVA can tell me why."
BBVA,Finance,5, This app has been working perfect for me.
BBVA,Finance,5," great so far. The branch I opened my account @, the atm has been down a couple times, but other than that its been a good experience. The app works great. lets me know every transaction that is made, when its made. Also, very user friendly."
BBVA,Finance,5, ok very frustrating. YOU are told that if you sign up for checking account you will receive 200.00 from BBVA COMPASS. NOT!!

I was given some lame excuse as to why I'm no longer eligible. The first they first determined had something to to with $0.095 cents. With further discussion with me they changed that lame excuse for another . I believe BBVA COMPASS has a scam going to sign you up and then when it's time to pay they come up with different lame excuses NOT to honor their incentives.
BBVA,Finance,1, app stops working every week on friday. unless you memories the most pointless stupid info in the world the over the phone service cant help you unless you know your account number they wont even help you in store. hidden charges and fees apply. account thats is set not to over draft gets over draft...Full Reviewapp stops working every week on friday. unless you memories the most pointless stupid info in the world the over the phone service cant help you unless you know your account number they wont even help you in store. hidden charges and fees apply. account thats is set not to over draft gets over draft all the time. nothing works as described and thier customer service is a nightmare and not even based in the same country as the bank apparently
BBVA,Finance,4," Great app, easy to use. I love the quick view feature, unfortunately, it doesn't work all of the time. it will work for a few days and then it doesn't. i have to log in, go to settings, turn it off and on again. not the worst thing, but still frustrating. It is easy to make transfers."
BBVA,Finance,5," This app for banking is not appreciative enough of their services and offers. First of all there are no checking maintainence fees like that of competitor banks.

First of all there are no checking maintainence fees like that of competitor banks. Secondly their website makes it easy to find previous tranactions from prior months without having to go to the bank and printing out bank statements.They have a search option that you type in keywords to find transactions that were made based on your word input (saved me so much money amd time!) And finacial tools, and discount offers!"

I try to use it with all my devices sometimes I get device not recognize and to put certain information in to verify who I am but lately I have not been given the area to insert that information and I get locked out of my account because I have no where to insert said information for verifying.
BBVA,Finance,5, I've been using BBVA for years. I love how you can just take a picture of your check front and back without even having to go to the bank and deposit it. I've always had a good experience with them.
BBVA,Finance,1, This is far and away the worst banking app I have ever used. Almost every single thing you try and do on the app just brings you to a screen that says to call or use online banking. Why even have an app at all then!? Completely unintuitive hot garbage. Stay away if at all possible.
BBVA,Finance,4, ever since update it continues to tell me system failure cant do anything with it and need to know my balance....but cant get in to see it. loved it prior to that. seriously disappointed right now. update my rating as issue was fixed. got immediate response which was highly appreciated.

Back to working great for my needs.
BBVA,Finance,5, Everything you need at your fingertip!
BBVA,Finance,1," If you use the the app for check deposits, it will take over two weeks for the money to deposit. My amount was under $50, I have no clue why it takes so long. I definitely do not recommend, as it is faster depositing the money physically at the bank instead."
BBVA,Finance,5, This was a five star app until I just now updated it and my fingerprint feature is gone? Someone else mentioned the alerts were as well but I haven't purchased anything to see if I have the same issue. I really liked the biometric security of this app and hope it will be reinstated.
BBVA,Finance,2," Android 9: this is THE best banking app ive ever used 👍🏻 so many useful features .

BBVA,Finance,2, It is. Inconvenient. Please allow me to see the password if I choose.
BBVA,Finance,5," (Sorry! I thought I fixed my review when the notifications started working. I believe part of the problem was my connection, so I wasn't getting the notifications. Again, sorry about that. The app works fine and I no longer have any problems.)"

I don't want to be forced to make recurrent transfers between my accounts, I want to select when I do those movements and how much each time. SERIOUSLY, this needs a FIX ASAP, or i will def move to another bank, that's how dumb that decision was."
BBVA,Finance,1, All I want to do is just check my account it's aggravating why do I have to update constantly and then it takes forever to do it I don't want any new apps I don't want a credit card I just want to check my balance😐
BBVA,Finance,2, Something is wrong with this app. I cannot sign in as easily as I used to because they say my account is locked for security reasons. I just want to sign in to check my balance and leave. I hate having to reset my security questions each time I sign in. this also applies to the wallet app as well.
BBVA,Finance,5," Beats the ""competition"" by far. Love the small international surcharge of 4% compared to other Banks. Multiple layers of security can be burdensome, unless you actually read user agreement and plan accordingly. All in all, stands above the rest in mobile banking."
BBVA,Finance,3, Great app except I can't use autofill my password with LastPass or they haven't updated for Face Unlock yet for the pixel so it's annoying getting into my account bc my password is long
BBVA,Finance,5, I've used this app for a few years now and it's worked great every time. I mostly use it to check balances and for mobile deposits.
BBVA,Finance,5, Fast and easy! All in the palm of your hands!
BBVA,Finance,3, I keep getting this thing to tells me to update the latest verse of this and when I press it it says I already have it please take it off
BBVA,Finance,5," Very great app, love it so far!"
BBVA,Finance,5," I enjoy the ease of mobile banking because as long as I have the internet in whatever form, I can find out my balances, check which transactions have cleared my account and track my spending. Clearly this app is an asset!"
BBVA,Finance,1," Would have given 5 stars prior to the last 2 weeks, but for 2 weeks, I have been unable to access my accounts. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still says system failure. Very frustrating as I do all my banking through the app."
BBVA,Finance,1," App v7.0.1.0613 boots me out to login screen on Android v8.0.0 running on my VS995 LG V20 when I try to enable fingerprint login. I also get booted out of the app when I try to snap a photo of a check for mobile deposit. If I can't utilize its features, what's the point of having the app?"
BBVA,Finance,1, Terrible! Wont let me make a payment. I press submit and the app closes and restarts. I have to use a computer to make my payments. App is worthless for me.
BBVA,Finance,5, This BBVA app is just perfect.
BBVA,Finance,5," I have had this app in the past and it use to work. Now for the last couple of months it says there is an error when trying to log in. ""please try again later"". Even updated the app today and it still has the same error. Please fix."

BBVA,Finance,5, I like the app and its interface. Very modern and update to date. I also like the convience of being able to login and check on your bank account. Therefore I give it a five star rating.
BBVA,Finance,1," Overall, excellent app experience, but there is a bug that makes the app freeze on the login screen when fingerprint authentication is enabled (Note 8). This has gone unfixed for months! Fix this basic feature and I'll fix the rating, k?"
BBVA,Finance,5, i like this app cause I get to see my transaction.. never had a problem with my bank.. going to 16 year's with them..
BBVA,Finance,5," i highly recommend Compass Bank if you do a lot of mobile banking but still wanna be able to walk in to the place if necessary!

BBVA,Finance,3," The app is pretty good. Only issue I have run into is that I have to actually sign my check instead of just using a stamp. Without the written signature, for some reason it won't deposit the check."
BBVA,Finance,1, Mobile deposit not working
BBVA,Finance,5, so easy and helpful.
BBVA,Finance,1," Cannot log into the app. Keep getting ""There was a problem with your username and password"". Changed password 2 times in case I remembered incorrectly. Online site works fine... App not so much."
BBVA,Finance,1, I've had so many issues with this app in the last month. it has signed me out. refuses to accept any of my information and constantly crashes on me. thank goodness for the quick view
BBVA,Finance,5," I love BBVA, just wish there were more branches or ATMs in more locations out here in Southern California. they give the best customer service , always.

BBVA,Finance,2, The fingerprint scanner on the note 10 needs improvement please. The app doesnt highlight where to put your finger so you have to just put it in the area where it usually is. Every time the app just freaks out and says I have to enter in password due to too many failed attempts at the fingerprint
BBVA,Finance,5, Easy to navigate
BBVA,Finance,1, To pay your credit card online you need a BBVA checking account. You can dissable your card online. Then pay credit card at a BBVA branch. Get this if you pay your credit card with cash at a BBVA branch it still takes up to three days to post. Get a capital One savor card you cannot go wrong.
BBVA,Finance,1," This app is terrible, I have been without mobile banking all week because the system needs an update, ridiculous"
BBVA,Finance,5," there were times were I've had unauthorized transactions but only two in my years with BBVA, and for both of those times they were able to help me gain back what I have lost, and for that I am very happy for the help and service!"
BBVA,Finance,4, I like this app so far and the convienience it provides. My main concern is security and the privacy of my personal account. Nowadays people are worried about hackers. This is a safe and secure app.
BBVA,Finance,5, The app is easy to use and it is very helpful by letting you know what you just spent you don't have to login to check your statement. I'm always login to check any.
BBVA,Finance,1, Difficult to use. I installed the app to make it easy to pay the credit card bill. why does it have to be so hard? Just have a easy to find button that says pay card!. This company needs to take a lesson from Capital One and Chase!
BBVA,Finance,5, The app works great and I've never had any problems with it. Today when I went to log in it is telling me to update my password. I was wondering why as I've never been told to do that before.
BBVA,Finance,1," BBVA has potential of being great bank but lil BS like this stupid app not working properly, try logging in, it just repeats itself askin for my log ons and nothing. I've had issues with their ATMS too not giving me my money, having to go thru hoops to report it. Geez"
BBVA,Finance,3, I dont like how it asks me to select a frequency of how often i want money to be added to.my savings when i only want to add once. Then it automatically transfers money into my savings that i didnt want to add. I always see alot of money from previous times being deposited into the savings
BBVA,Finance,2, Not user friendly unless you have a checking account at BBVA. but i Love BBVA other than the app!
BBVA,Finance,5, Love the Ocala branch. Fast and friendly service
BBVA,Finance,5, It is a great app to go on and i like it
BBVA,Finance,4, great!! only thing is the fingerprint gives me trouble 9 times out of 10. I have no trouble with it except on this app. other than that it's great
BBVA,Finance,1," It did work great up until their most recent update. They removed ""Financial tools"" without warning, which I relied on heavily. They just deleted it out of the blue no warning. What kind of terrible business practice is that?"
BBVA,Finance,5, Very enjoyable experience
BBVA,Finance,5, I use the mobile app every day and have done so for the past few years yet I'm still finding new things that make I didn't know about. I love your app.it makes keeping track of my money simple and fun.
BBVA,Finance,5, App is very secure. The ability to turn my debit card on and then off after use is very useful. This support helps the customer and BBVA Compass. I absolutely love it.
BBVA,Finance,3, The login does not prompt for Samsung Pass approval for use with iris scan. Such a useful security feature that does not work. Please fix and this will instantly be a 5 star.
BBVA,Finance,5," Very useful, well put together banking app. Does well for business and personal banking! Helps keep me on top of things without having to visit a local branch."
BBVA,Finance,1, It won't let me make a one time transfer from savings to checking without selecting a frequency that doesn't include once only. this is a recent stupid change that's going to make me switch banks.
BBVA,Finance,5," The app keeps me on track. I don't have to worry & know that anytime, anywhere- I can check in to be sure I always have good control. Being prepared for Car repairs, a plumber,"
BBVA,Finance,2, Transactions usually don't post but balance changes. Why don't you fix this issue???
BBVA,Finance,5, Very user friendly!
BBVA,Finance,1, Update the damn app please. Crashes every single time I try to deposit a check.
BBVA,Finance,5, I love your app and each version release comes with notable improvements! I am a happy BBVA compass customer with 3 accounts and am opening a credit account later this month. Thanks BBVA Compass!
BBVA,Finance,5, Great real time account of actual balance
BBVA,Finance,3," The works well for the most part, but if you need there security setting to send you a message via text message it doesn't."
BBVA,Finance,1, App shuts down to log in screen after taking photo of check. No other way to make a mobile deposit. No desktop application for deposits. Phone app doesn't work. This bank relationship is over.
BBVA,Finance,5, Never had a problem with App. Great for transfering money.
BBVA,Finance,1, This app is so dumb! They want you to make a payment but I csmt create an account because it doesn't let me pass a certain point on the app even though all my info is correct
BBVA,Finance,2, Both my Husband and I are locked out of our accounts. Every time we try to log in it tells us wrong username/password. I am highly upset. It needs to be fixed ASAP!
BBVA,Finance,1," Never EVER use the mobile app to deposit any funds you need access to in less than a week or more! And if you call cust service, be prepared to hear 5 different tales about the disposition of your money."
BBVA,Finance,5," The besk banking can get. What more can I say? This app got me out of a pinch sooo many times its not even funny. Got a BBVA Account? This app will help, give it a try peeps."
BBVA,Finance,2, Poorly designed app. Cluttered layout. Would expect more from such a large bank. The wallet app is just as bad. Simplify BBVA. Simplify.
BBVA,Finance,4," Its convenient to be able to check transactions on the phone. First time mobile check deposit didn't take, had to do again."
BBVA,Finance,5, very informative and well managed.makes bank apps worth it. mobile banking done right. keeps accounts organized and your finger tips. provides on screen display of financial records
BBVA,Finance,2," this app needs a simple "" pay my bill ( credit card ) button. ""instead, you have to navigate through multiple steps to find it."
BBVA,Finance,5," GREAT App. I use it everyday, helps when you forget about a transaction or dont use a check register. You can get your daily withdrawal balance, and your Deposit information. It's the best app I have ."
BBVA,Finance,4, Quick and simple

BBVA,Finance,5, Makes banking a lot easier
BBVA,Finance,2, pop up notification was removed..i hate the text messages... also the pop money feature now reboots the app. I called to get it repaired only to have clouded the ticket 3 days later without resolution. Award winning my backside......
BBVA,Finance,5, it could be better if you didn't have to wait all weekend and three days of the week before your paycheck clears after a mobile deposit. they should make some of your money available on the next business day that's the only problem i have with BBVA
BBVA,Finance,4," overall great app, however i used to be able to use the it's scanner to log in which was VERY CONVENIENT but now it is not giving me the option! any help???"
BBVA,Finance,3, trying to make an online deposit every time I do that it says that allow BBVA Unites States to access photos media and files from your device I never had a problem with this before so I don't know what's going on now
BBVA,Finance,5," Gets You In Quickly, And Gets You Out Just As Quick. Very Efficient."
BBVA,Finance,4," App works great, but recently pressing back from main screen does not exit app. Fingerprint reader tries to read fingerprints way too fast it seems like and causes failures"
BBVA,Finance,1, Gotta pull some teeth with this buggy app to access it every time I get a new phone they want you to remember a user name just for them your email will not suffice and the retrieval process is a nightmare.
BBVA,Finance,1," App crashes when I try to submit a payment. This app was working fine for me until recently. In response to your response, not my job to email you about something you already know. Fix your app."
BBVA,Finance,4, Old school not sure of electronics over 60 but it makes my life easier I only hope it's secure I don't know anything about modern technology hacking and identity theft I always worry about that because I don't understand it but I think it's good
BBVA,Finance,2, to many things to go into detail. but the app is not consistent. pop money not working. which stinks becausr now Compass is demanding third party cookies!! goodbye compass.
BBVA,Finance,1," The app keeps saying temporarily out of service, when i try to log in, its been like this for a week straight. 😤"
BBVA,Finance,1, Really wish the fingerprint sign on actually worked. My phone's fingerprint reader works on everything else and every other app I use it with except for this one. Just touching the sensor auto fails it without retry.
BBVA,Finance,4, Great! Great experience and very accommodating on info pertaining to account updates!
BBVA,Finance,1, As usual. BBVA dumps the Wallet app and all the useful notifications (i.e. ATM activity) and replaced it with nothing. The high school kids working on this app need to be more closely supervised.
BBVA,Finance,5, wish you could have the option to unblock your card when it auto blocks while traveling. instead of having to call and do it.
BBVA,Finance,5," Best bank ever! I would just like to add that BBVA Compass rocks and they are very personable, friendly, attentive and well organized... I will never bank anywhere else."
BBVA,Finance,5," EXCELLENT! BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE! App is super easy to use, you can name your accounts, manage or turn your card off, and see all banking details you might need."
BBVA,Finance,5, this works really well for me. well designed and easy to get stuff done with multiple accounts. very reliable.
BBVA,Finance,1, Their mobile banking and app sucks. It never accepts verification codes. Then they deny your request and you have to give through hassle of calling customer service. Zero stars.
BBVA,Finance,1, I have tried on several occasions to download my BBVA moble app and have not been successful! It is very frustrating!
BBVA,Finance,5, Easy to use and it provides the same experience as when I log in my laptop. Keep it updated!!!
BBVA,Finance,5, I love BBVA Bank. It is very easy to use and check you transactions. It tells you about possible fraud transactionsband you can remove them.
BBVA,Finance,5, this app is the next best thing to the excellent service provided by the staff at so many locations around the country! Never been happier with BBVA and I tend to not like bankers..go figure
BBVA,Finance,1, The app won't let me sign in. It was working perfectly fine recently but now all of a sudden I can't sign in. I even Uninstalled and then reinstalled and it still doesn't work. Any ideas on how to help?
BBVA,Finance,1, This at crashes It gave me a deposit date to be cleared then it switched to a differnt day. Then the bank couldn't do anything cause it was thru mobile app. So disappointed with this bank and the Customer service was horriable they do everything so you dont speak with a supervisor
BBVA,Finance,5," Good app compared to others I use. Easy to navigate, no issues logging in or crashing."
BBVA,Finance,1," Difficult to use app, if you forget your password you only get one time try before it makes you reset the password."
BBVA,Finance,1," Can't pay cc bill after update. When try to finalize payment, app crashes. Hasn't done this before until last update. App now no use for me."
BBVA,Finance,5, I like the app and the quick view.
BBVA,Finance,1, Garbage app says I'm putting in the wrong password all the time and locks me out all the time and a super pain to reset it just for it to do the same thing again by locking my account super annoying
BBVA,Finance,2," Great App. But the mobile Check depositing doesn't work. I signed the back and wrote what it told me to ""For Mobile Deposit"" but it won't take it!!!"
BBVA,Finance,1," BBVA is the worst bank I've ever used. I'll say that on any platform I'm able. Trust me, use anyone else."
BBVA,Finance,3," Nice app, but I use dark mode on my phone and when BBVA tells me when money is being taken out of account I can't see the notification. Can you make a dark mode for this app?"
BBVA,Finance,5," This is hands down one of the best mobile banking apps ever made! It's bug free, glitch free, fast, secure and very easy to use."
BBVA,Finance,5, This app is very helpful. It allows me to view my transactions and see my balance quickly.Thank you.
BBVA,Finance,1, Impossible to move to another device without a phone number
BBVA,Finance,5, Love the app and BBVA Compass bank! They make everything simple and easy to use.
BBVA,Finance,5," Love it, a lot of nice features only some issues to deposit checks but very good in general"
BBVA,Finance,2," not able to use all wk. must be due to ""New Name Change"" Very, Very bad customer service. Cannot even get ""BBVA on phone..."

BBVA,Finance,1, Used to work great now it just bugs my phone splashing try again literally 30x sec even taking over screen when you go to home. Horrible
BBVA,Finance,1," Every time I try to log in, I get an error saying that ""the service is temporarily unavailable"". I would like to know why."
BBVA,Finance,5, I love this app. I work long hours Most times the bank is closed when I get off So I simply capture an image of my Paycheck and its deposited to my account
BBVA,Finance,1," I tried activating my online banking and it directed me to call customer care representative which I did ,till now they find it difficult to open my online banking for me,so I called them to close the account..I cant have a credit card I can't monitor"
BBVA,Finance,5, Super easy to use
BBVA,Finance,1," Bbva is almost always down during the night, and mobile banking is unavailable. It is absolutely ridiculous that i cannot acvess my money on an almost nightly basis."

BBVA,Finance,4," I've really enjoyed all the features,so convenient and not having to stop at the bank for every little thing!"
BBVA,Finance,1, whats going on? i have been getting a system failure for trying to login for a couple of days?
BBVA,Finance,4, Like it but my phone crashed and im using my old phone but it wont let me set up the fingerprint log in! So frustrating!
BBVA,Finance,1," Forced update to use all of a sudden? Costing me data and time, you massive jerks."
BBVA,Finance,1, Unable to login after new update. I'm using a Note 9 with latest operating system.
BBVA,Finance,5, Absolutely great it's the first banking app I've ever put on my phone and itll be the last because everything I need is right there
BBVA,Finance,1, EVERYTIME I update I have to jump thru hoops to sign back in! I KNOW my username and password but this app says it's wrong.
BBVA,Finance,2, App is okay. Notifications are no longer able to be read in dark mode since the android 10 update. Please update so that this feature works again
BBVA,Finance,5," Wonderful App, wonderful people to work with. Customer service line not so much"
BBVA,Finance,2, App works great except the quick view option. It will NEVER work!!! so frustrating
BBVA,Finance,1, I've deleted this app three separate times because it causes popup adds on my phone. Half my banking is through this app that I can't do on the wallet.
BBVA,Finance,1," DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT use this app for mobile banking! You can only count on the app being wrong and you being negative EVERYTIME!! ..... If you call them to complain you'll be told it was your fault. Worst bank, banking app and customer service, hands down!"
BBVA,Finance,5, Great app! Never had a crash or any type of problem.
BBVA,Finance,3," app use to work great. now, when i try to pay my credit card, the app crashes. please fix"
BBVA,Finance,2, For the past month...when i try to deposit a check it takes the first picture then it kicks me off of the app...WTH
BBVA,Finance,3," the app was always great, idk what's going on but everytime I try to log in to see my balance, it asks me to create a new password? please fix"
BBVA,Finance,1, It always down no matter time. I couldn't check my balance on my check account
BBVA,Finance,3, i like da app a lot but latest update sucks. wont allow me to set up fingerprint nor my number. keep sayin password wrong and app system is down.
BBVA,Finance,4," Upset, since the last 2 updates have not been able to use fingerprint login! Otherwise every works fine"
BBVA,Finance,5, Easy and simple to check card information and checkings/savings account balances.
BBVA,Finance,3, since the update I continue to get error when I try to log-in to TryAgain.
BBVA,Finance,5, Great app that is quick and easy to use with real time functions.
BBVA,Finance,1, it's ok it doesn't have the feature where it shows your cvc code like the wallet but beside that the wallet has been cancelled overall this app is ok cool cause it shows you your info but it's aite
BBVA,Finance,5," Great app, best of all banks. Dependable and reliable."
BBVA,Finance,5, I had a issue with the app. A representative called me and fixed the issue. Very pleased!
BBVA,Finance,1, Horrible cant get to anything it always says terms of use only
BBVA,Finance,4, only one negative issue with this app.the tool for turning off or on paper statements is confusing.
BBVA,Finance,4, it was okay but could be better they need to tweak it a little more then I would give it 5 stars
BBVA,Finance,2," Unlike all of my other banking apps, this does not display accurate acct info, e.g., payment made does not update on info screen for weeks."
BBVA,Finance,1, update: check deposits takes 1 min per check. app crashes during check deposits. Cannot use fingerprint to login. Mobile check deposits not working.
BBVA,Finance,5, I like it is great No Charges to me I make a deposit only one time a mo. and this account has been free of any charges Thank's to BBVA sincerely Glenn
BBVA,Finance,5, I love how easy this app is to use. I have another bank and their online is not user friendly at all.
BBVA,Finance,2," The old app would notify me when my card was being used .. even though i have the ""notifications "" set up it rarely does it....."
BBVA,Finance,5, It's convenient and easy for anyone that is constantly on the go. Thank you BBVA Compass
BBVA,Finance,5, The only ever problem i had with the app was one time i was unable to deposit any checks but that was same day
BBVA,Finance,5, Great app I love how it really helps and is very simple to use thanks BBVA the best bank ever
BBVA,Finance,4, Sometimes difficult to get to during peak access times....but you may call customer service.

BBVA,Finance,4, Used the app since i opened the account but since the last update it won't sign me in put in my username and password wheel spins then nothing still on the login screen
BBVA,Finance,5, It makes my record keeping for tracking business expenses a whole lot less complicated.
BBVA,Finance,1, The fingerprint scanner scans your finger more than once without letting you adjust your finger in case of missplacement and then locks your account.
BBVA,Finance,5, there have been errors on my account by the bank.But they always fix it. thanks
BBVA,Finance,1, Fingerprint unlock no longer works. Now pulls up iris unlock that struggles with glasses.
BBVA,Finance,5, The apps was great but it doesn't support Samsung Galaxy s10 in display fingerprint reader
BBVA,Finance,5," First off let me say thank you ! Thank you for giving me a second chance at banking regardless of what my chexsystems report says .

BBVA,Finance,1, theres no point of having overdraft protection if your not protected from being overdraft... plus if you go overdraft there should be a grace period of a couple of hours to make it right and not get charged 40$ for 10c
BBVA,Finance,1," after installing the latest version, it wont open....just sits and spins before timing out"
BBVA,Finance,1, You make a payment on this app and it shows that you haven't made an payment so you can't make a payment anything less than the minimum it sucks
BBVA,Finance,1, Garbage. I always get a notification that my scheduled payment was unable to process! This app is trash!
BBVA,Finance,4," Great for the most part but the fingerprint reader does read my fingerprint, but rather uses my eye data to login to my account"
BBVA,Finance,5," let's you do anything from transfers check deposits, and super easy to use!"
BBVA,Finance,1, once the app updated i can no longer sign in... never had a problem before the update

BBVA,Finance,3," I tell my local banker that I'm movingl!, i give correct address BBVA stil doesnt have life and adresses . Thanks Bbva for not allowinng a swift trannsfer. My transfer is still under the subjeect of your slow decicion."
BBVA,Finance,5, having the app is so much help tracking everything you spend.

Also had made a payment to my credit card with money in my account and they still charged me $38.00 when it was made on time. Get another bank like chase or bank of America.

They place holds on any amount over 5K and charge exorbitant fees to wire/DD to employees who do not bank with them.

I did leave a bad review in the beginning but BBVA Associates did do their best to help me and I really appreciate that more than they can imagine, I give him a five out of five star rating since they actually tried to make contact with me and get them settled. I'd give them a 10 out of 10 if I could."
BBVA,Finance,4, calling BBVA yields no information about the purpose of the daily accruing notification alerts nor the information they are purposed to convey. Business as usual.
BBVA,Finance,5, Update: it's working again Update: since the merging of the two apps the transactions alerts no longer come on. fix that please Great banking app. I've used plenty others and it ranks up there with them.
BBVA,Finance,1, won't give text alerts or allow fingerprint login. called tech support twice and still not working.

It is structured like a puzzle that has to be navigated like a maze and often can not tell you the information you seek. The website is simple and informative. Hopefully future plans for this app are to simplify. The help feature tends to send you in circles looking at features that you likely have seen already while looking for what you needed. Try to answer these questions in a few minutes. What is my interest rate, how long is my special rate on a purchase, how much was the payment I made a few hours ago, and did a payment I just made go through ok...on the app this is going to take too long. It is better to just call them. Oh, and to save you time trying to find it, the auto pay function is done through mail or fax not on the web or through this app."

BBVA,Finance,3, I have never seen a app where you cannot select other amount for loan payments. I like to make my payments every 2 weeks. On this App you can only select full amount or extra principal payment. Not user friendly at all.
BBVA,Finance,5, I love that I can just log on to see how much I have in my account instead of calling.

want to have a call back number That will not work Then when you finally 
get to talk somebody they don't understand English Worst bank ever"
BBVA,Finance,2," I only have a credit card account, and I have been forced to use the app as 
the website is no longer available to me as a non-account holder, which 
wouldn't be a big issue, if the app WORKED! Either make the app functional 
or give desktop access back"
BBVA,Finance,3, Its a good app and easy to use. What i hate is that it only shows the amount you spent not wear you spent it. I have to sign in online to see that.
BBVA,Finance,1," These reviews are so fake lol, ""best app"". Seriously? How many compass apps are there? Hahaha... Oh man. Thanks for the laugh."

amount of money and even 1 $38 fine is tough for me right now. Why can't a 
charge just be declined and that's it? Almost $40 being charged to people 
who obviously don't have money to spare is just plain evil."

shows I'm overdrafted 6x! This is insane & ridiculous! I called customer 
service & they say they can't do anything at the time, but I can go to the 
bank & maybe they can clear it for me. This defeats the purpose of using 
the app to avoid the long waits at the bank during my lunch hour which is 
my only time available. They also just told me that even in person they can 
choice to hold a check if they'd like. This is just wrong & bad customer

BBVA,Finance,1, Worst banking app ever! Its the most confusing and hardest app to navigate. All I wanted to do was pay my credit card bill. 3 phone calls later and still can't do it. I'll have to write a check and mail it. There's no reason to make it this difficult!
BBVA,Finance,1," Both apps suck. Won't let me log on with my online banking pw even though I can log in online just fine. Spent all day on the phone with them still haven't solved the problem.

Won't let me log on with my online banking pw even though I can log in online just fine. Spent all day on the phone with them still haven't solved the problem. Going to Uninstaller both and close bank account. I can see others have crazy problems too, including incorrect balances and weekly password resets. No thanks."
BBVA,Finance,1, The deposit checks function has consistently not worked for a least 1 year.  I deleted and reset the app and still doesn't work.
BBVA,Finance,5, As a small business owner that lives about an hour away to the closest Branch I find this tool to be a very very useful. It saves me a lot of time. Ironically I actually miss going to visit the team in Orange Beach they're so nice.
BBVA,Finance,5, So easy convenient and user friendly. Def recommend if you are a Compass Member
BBVA,Finance,2, This app is easy to ude but system errors occurs very often
BBVA,Finance,5, As far as the features I've used this app does what it's designed to do. I can't  ask for more than that.
BBVA,Finance,1, The entire purpose of a mobile app is to monitor transactions and pay your bill. The app does not allow bill pay or if it does it is not user friendly.
BBVA,Finance,5, It's a great app.  I do so many things with it.  I just love it.
BBVA,Finance,5, This is one of the best banks and App's Iv been in that I really a injoy

BBVA,Finance,5, Good
BBVA,Finance,1, I can't get on this app at all. I have even had the bank itself attempt to set it up for me. Constantly says unavailable try again....I will not continue to bank with a company I can't check my balance with. Terrible to the max!
BBVA,Finance,5, I like the multiple options.
BBVA,Finance,5, This app is the best!!
BBVA,Finance,5, I love that its very easy to use

And when you call they ask you what is the amount of your last deposit. I would be able to give you that if I can log into the account. You change the password on your phone and it doesn't work on a desktop or vise versa. Also why you need to download BBVA wallet app also can you just have one app.
BBVA,Finance,1, Biggest pain for phone customer service and dealing with auto loans. The tellers have been nice the rest is almost the worst I've dealt with. O ya and the app likes to tell me the wrong amount for my payment due and then charge me the difference
BBVA,Finance,2, Inaccurate account info! My primary use for this app is to get an accurate account balance and it's never accurate.

Not sure if it's the fault of the bank or app itself but it's totally useless if you're trying to get a balance.
BBVA,Finance,3," Some features work, the same features that are on the website should be in this app. Now that would be convience. Having to reset my password constantly is also bothersome."
BBVA,Finance,5," Easily manage all of your BBVA Compass accounts with ease. Instant notifications about my account, I'm very pleased with this app. Very easy to use and also very useful. Thanks BBVA!"
BBVA,Finance,3, We've only had it a short while but so far it's ok. Still learning how to use but it looks promising.
BBVA,Finance,3," After update can't get correct summary data, mobile deposit available again but limited"
BBVA,Finance,1, Will not work with mint. Makes you reset security questions and  password weekly
BBVA,Finance,3, App works fine but the bank holds your deposit for a while i mean i got my next paycheck and cashed it before my first check is available which is ridiculous.
BBVA,Finance,1," Never remembers my stuff, never loads, will not let me do anything 😠😠"

When it works it's not even good for checking account balances, they sort them as they wish to maximize penalties and withdrawals that should show up immediately are marked as pending. Since they sort everything according to their whims and randomly mark transactions as pending, you'd think you could search for drafts by name, but their search engine is incapable of this simple feat. You can't contact anyone unless you go through the website which doesn't matter because they will not contact you back. If you call them, they will lie to you to get you off the phone. I deposited a check a week ago on an account that was over drafted $180. Somehow, in one week, with nothing else going through, I somehow owe this mafia bank $500! They are the WORST. There is no comparison. You're better off burying your money in the yard like a dog than dealing with the hassles of this bank and their terrible app."
BBVA,Finance,5, I have had a really great experience with the telephone representatives who work for this establishment. And I've never once been overlooked with a concern by a scripted service recording or call rep. Thanks.
BBVA,Finance,1, Tried to set up username & pw and the app always said temporarily not working try again later !!! Happens every time I tried to set it up !
BBVA,Finance,1, My app never goes to deposit checks. It keeps repeating itselfx
BBVA,Finance,5," All I have is a bank account with my husband and the app does what it's supposed to do I love it, it's simple and easy to use."
BBVA,Finance,5," I like this app because I can keep up with the balance in both my checking and savings at the same time, LOVE IT"
BBVA,Finance,5, Simple and easy to use
BBVA,Finance,5," Of all of the bank apps I've used, this one is by far the best."
BBVA,Finance,5, I've been using this app for a couple of years now with no issues.

BBVA,Finance,5, Great app. Everything is there that i need.
BBVA,Finance,2, Trying to link accounts.  It won't let me.  Talked to bank idiot they know there's an issue.  With validating.  Have not fixed it.
BBVA,Finance,1," The old app worked. This new one just kicks you back out and makes you sign back in. Won't let me make a deposit. I take a picture of one side..it kicks me out, have to sign back in and start over again. I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it too and it's still the same."
BBVA,Finance,1," This app is garbage. I can't submit any payments on my auto loan through it without getting an error saying I've exceeded the amount, I have to go to the website every month. This app is a waste of memory on your phone."
BBVA,Finance,1, The app does not allow you dispute charges or setup fraud alerts from particular vendors. Responses from assistance center are generic.
BBVA,Finance,5, This app is very useful checking all my accounts. I just opened my account with BBVA and they are great. I know I'm in good hands
BBVA,Finance,1, This app doesn't work.  It just freezes and crashes.
BBVA,Finance,5, I hit one snag one time in six months and it was my fault! Good security
BBVA,Finance,3, Don't like how when you make a transaction it doesn't deduct from your account right away. It also did away with displaying the pending status
BBVA,Finance,5, It's awesome 😍 just wish I had more money to deposit

BBVA,Finance,1," 1st,  it didn't recognize my password. I had to establish a new one. Once I got in, I couldn't do anything except look at my account balances.  I could not pay bills or transfer funds."
BBVA,Finance,4, The simplicity is what I like
BBVA,Finance,5, I use it daily
BBVA,Finance,5," Nice app,"
BBVA,Finance,5, I love it
BBVA,Finance,4, App is good

Also, when making transfers it walks you through adding the destination account but then there is no option to continue to make a transfer you can only exit the process which means you can t transfer funds.  Very frustrating until you realuze you can t make tranfers on the app.  Otherwise its good for keeping track of balance"

Now it has trouble taking images of the check and when it does accept the image it sends an unclear image thus resulting in a return deposit fee.  I spoke to a representative at the mobile banking customer service and was told that the transaction would be totally reversed but said nothing about a return deposit fee.  The rep at mobile customer service i spoke to this morning wouldn't help me and was going to hang up on me even when I asked her for a supervisor.  I went to a branch and told a really nice lady about the situation and got it taken care of for me.  I'm never depositing checks with the mobile banking app again!
BBVA,Finance,1," Worthless since update. ""Better"" apparently means ""no longer able to deposit checks"". Any software generated check with placeholders like leading or trailing asterisks cannot be deposited. A banking app should be able to handle computer generated checks. That's online banking 101."
BBVA,Finance,3," Quick view NEVER works, constantly asks me to turn on quick view....TURNED IT ON...57 TIMES!! Also has problems reading checks on mobile deposits."
BBVA,Finance,5, Definitely great service BBVA personnel were able to solve my problem with a reasonable time and now I am able to access all features. Thank you and I recommend banking and using this app with BBVA Compass!!!!!
BBVA,Finance,5, Very useful app and easy to use. You can even scheduled a phone call and BBVA calls you right back...
BBVA,Finance,1," Have 2 accounts but now app won't let me make a mobile deposit into my personal checking. After having my credit card cancelled without even 1 late payment, am cancelling all my accounts with this bank after more than 15 years. They are NOT the same bank now. Cannot recommend them."
BBVA,Finance,3," I would give this a higher rating, but it's still asking if I want to enable fingerprint scanning EVERY SINGLE TIME I log in, even though I've already enabled it a dozen times"
BBVA,Finance,3, Zero sucess uploading checks.  Even bank teller had no luck. Install quick view and for week afterwards kept prompting. No means to check off transactions already seen.
BBVA,Finance,5, This app is perfect for me im a spender and I've managed to save money im in shock and they gave me a chance no other bank would 5 stars
BBVA,Finance,1, Do not use their app to deposit checks. Worst idea ever.
BBVA,Finance,5," As soon I started using the app, I liked it right then and there."
BBVA,Finance,5, Just love the convenience of having the app on my phone right next to me I can check my balance anytime it's an instant that you can manage my account anytime
BBVA,Finance,5, Great app. Very easy to use.
BBVA,Finance,5, This is one of the best banking apps I have ever used.

BBVA,Finance,3, I really have liked this app. But the new update the mobile deposit is a hassle. The pictures of the checks are clear when I take them then they fuss out in the app.
BBVA,Finance,3, Overall the app works well.  After the last couple of updates I get asked every single time I sign in if I want to use my fingerprint scanner and account quick view.  No matter how I answer it always asks.  Slightly annoying.
BBVA,Finance,5, A very good banking app.  Had Woodforest and their online banking was very lacking.  This one has great alerts and you can shut off your card at will if lost and turn it back on if you find it.

BBVA,Finance,3," I like the app, only problem is you can't report a lost or damaged credit card on it would been real helpful instead of having to call customer service."
BBVA,Finance,4, The set up of this app is actually kinda shi**y but it does its job so *shrugs*
BBVA,Finance,5," Good app for banking with BBVA Compass. Love the quick view feature, easy access to view your balance."
BBVA,Finance,5, This app works great for what I need to do.
BBVA,Finance,4, I really do appreciate it wish transfer would take immediately

I  made a deposit about a month and they can't credit the deposit because they have lost the check. Issues like this has occurred  more than once. Save yourself a headache and don't bank here!!!!
BBVA,Finance,5," This App is easy to use, so convenient to switch between accounts, make payments, review my statements, make intra bank transfers between accounts or set up recurring deposits in other accounts. Great App so don't fix what's not broken!"
BBVA,Finance,1, Their atm machines are the worst. They always freeze. You can sends 30 minds easily at their atm trying to do a simple transaction.. I m going close my account
BBVA,Finance,1, This app use to give me a up to date balance but just stopped about  month ago.  When I called to find out why the guy was clueless
BBVA,Finance,4, Would prefer to have the balance after each transaction clearer. Have had problems knowing exactly how much money I have or don't have.
BBVA,Finance,5, Practical and useful app for those who do not have time to spend in the bank. Excellent tool to prevent overdraft fees.
BBVA,Finance,4," User friendly interface and Easy to get used to. You can set any alert you'd like, or receive texts or emails daily upon balance of account.  Very nice app."
BBVA,Finance,1," Every ""improvement"" breaks something that was working, if barely. Constantly aggravating, requiring frequent do-overs."
BBVA,Finance,5, Ive been a customer for 25 years and compass bank is so awsome. I absolutely love 💞😍this app.
BBVA,Finance,3, The app is okay. But popmoney is absolutely BS and useless through the app.
BBVA,Finance,5, Best bank account to open online just sitting at home no need to go anywhere you get all the facilities *****
BBVA,Finance,5," Working good I love that I can manage all my accounts from the app and make payments for my credit card there, good job 👍"
BBVA,Finance,5, This is easy to use.  I access it daily. Cystomer service is helpful
BBVA,Finance,5, Perfect it shows me every transaction being done with my card very great app.
BBVA,Finance,5," Quick view is awesome.. Let's you know what's up with out logging in, pretty accurate so far.. Keep it up.. 👍"
BBVA,Finance,1, Every time I try to activate fingerprints on it the verification code never sends and account get locked out
BBVA,Finance,1, It does exactly what it says!
BBVA,Finance,5, I've used it to track my checking account and to deposit and I've never had any trouble doing so.
BBVA,Finance,4, I love being able to transfer money from accounts and checking how much is currently any time I need it!
BBVA,Finance,5, Perfect and convenient app. I recommend it to all users banking w/ BBVA Compass Bank

BBVA,Finance,5," Very easy and helpful. A recent update caused a display issue on my phone, but this latest update took care of it!"
BBVA,Finance,1, It keeps getting worse and worse. Every time I try to deposit a check it shuts down. Total garbage.
BBVA,Finance,2, If u change phones on the weekend your screwed no support and my security answer thing never worked correctly.
BBVA,Finance,1, App doesnt work & customer services only solution is telling me to continue to redownload.
BBVA,Finance,5, It works I like it.

BBVA,Finance,4, I love this app EXCEPT I used to be able to make deposits... But now it tells me my account isn't set up for it...no other explanation. The number provide is impossible to get a hold of anyone during business hours.
BBVA,Finance,1, When ever I logon and try to navigate thru the app most of the screen disappears. I can only see the top line.
BBVA,Finance,1, App constantly locks me out. I reset the pw only to be locked out again. Same thing with the wallet app. I reset pw there and it locks me out of the banking app on the first try. Many calls later and still no resolution.
BBVA,Finance,1, Not good for me !! Things I could do now don't work!! Can't see my transactions???  Checked it out at Bank and still no work! Worked fine before!
BBVA,Finance,2," new version will only load on the top 1/4"" of my tablet, so I call get put on hold finally get someone and get hung up on. So I try to email the developer to see if this can be fixed or if I can get an older version like I had. But the developer email does not exist."
BBVA,Finance,1, this app sucks and so dose this bank they put you on hold for hrs or you never get to talk to anyone they just suck and they don't like homosexual
BBVA,Finance,3," It's a very good app but quick view hasn't worked since about 3 updates, if it wasn't for that then it would be 5 stars."
BBVA,Finance,1, Wasted 10 minutes of my time setting it up then it locked up. It won't let me log on with it password I created. Worthless.
BBVA,Finance,1, No real capabilities. I can't really do anything but view my information.
BBVA,Finance,4, I LIKE doing mybanking needs I would tell my friends about The Bank
BBVA,Finance,5, Easy to use. Finger print login is the greatest.
BBVA,Finance,1, Can't see everything on the screen
BBVA,Finance,5, I love it. Very easy to use and I love the real time alerts!!
BBVA,Finance,3, Deposits take forever to clear and havent found a way to access other accounts with bbva.
BBVA,Finance,4, like it. only thing what happened to the quick view?
BBVA,Finance,5," I find it very easy to use, thank you compass bank for giving me a second chance..."
BBVA,Finance,5, I like the app because it alerts when ever a check is presented or when my balance reaches a certain amount

I DON'T KNOW MY CURRENT PASSWORD, THAT'S WHY I'M DOING PASSWORD RECOVERY IN THE FIRST PLACE. Needless to say, it's been months and I still can't log onto my banking app and access my account."
BBVA,Finance,5," The app continues to grow and make improvements. Some people do not believe in giving credit for effort, but I do. They improve the app monthly and purposely work towards a better product for their clients. I have been a user since the beginning and I am pleased with the progress."
BBVA,Finance,1, I just tried to sign in login first time and it is giving me terms and conditions page as blank and I stuck at this page. There is no button to move forward or accept terms and conditions to use this app. So basically I can't use this app aince I can't go past terms and conditions.
BBVA,Finance,1,Transfer does not work I loved this app until the update. Now I am unable to make mobile transfers. The app says 'must enter one time security code' but there is NO space to enter the code. Also half the time my accounts for transfer do not appear in the drop down menu. PLEASE FIX.
BBVA,Finance,1,"This App SUCKS!!!!!! This used to be a great app but some time ago an update broke the damn thing. The app use to log me out once, allowing me to log back in and deposit a check. NOW the app logs me out every time I attempt to take a picture of the front of the check being deposited.  Such a damn disappoint."
BBVA,Finance,2, Basic banking app. Forget managing scheduled payment. Difficult unintuitive interface for sending money to people and billers.  Have to log on to full site. Can't understand why BBVA can't get this right.
BBVA,Finance,4,I will have to be able too much for all my love to see you I am a little bit more time with you on this one and only for use with My new one for  my money on a sprint forum home HTC dream about it but I don't know what the problem with my new email account and it is not a problem with my new email .
BBVA,Finance,2," This app is inconsistent. Hardly ever recognizes my finger print. Would lock me out, despite the correct password (i'd test on my PC). Have attempted several deposits and received a ""system error"" every time."
BBVA,Finance,1, App was great till up grade last week. Now can't get past new Terms of Service page. Which is a blank page by the way once u log in.  Now in order to see account got to old skl it! Thanks for sending us backwards upgrade. What a nightmare!

BBVA,Finance,5," This app is very easy to use, remembers your name and is basic to work with. Gives real time updates on server issues, and is ten times better than have to call the 1800 number for you balance"
BBVA,Finance,2,Pain to deposit checks I've used this app for over a year and always find it frustrating to deposit checks with my mobile device. There's always constant errors when taking pictures and what the app says I acceptable.
BBVA,Finance,1," Everything was fine until the app started saying my password was incorrect. I had to call the bank twice to deal with that, but unfortunately the app continues to perceive my password is incorrect constantly. It's unusable."
BBVA,Finance,1,Unreliable! Half the time doesn't work! Makes managing my account much more difficult. I have fees because inaccurate info on app.
BBVA,Finance,2,Needs bug fix I've tried to look at quick view and it always errors. And entering my correct password once locks out my account. Been sitting on the phone for an hour just to sign into my account.
BBVA,Finance,1, I hate everything about this app. I can put in my login info perfect and still get locked out of my account. This is the second time in less than a week.
BBVA,Finance,4, Not as great as BBVA Bancomer (the Mexican BBVA bank app)  sometimes BBVA Compass unlinks your customer id against your account information.  But the look and feel interface is nice.
BBVA,Finance,1, Bogus bank. Bogus app. Everything is absurd. Can't wait to close my account and leave! Smdh
BBVA,Finance,1," Gets stuck on terms and conditions page. No option to continue, skip, go forward or anything and is therefore unusable"
BBVA,Finance,1," I am so disappointed.  I paid a wire transfer (""same day""), there was a fee of $15. It took Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and bbva made the transfer until Tuesday noon. It caused me a lot of problem with my finances."
BBVA,Finance,3, Doesn't let me deposit checks. It won't take any pictures and it used to be awesome. I don't know when this all started going downhill. Other than that it's great.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Annoying Half of the time it doesn't even work, which is quite frustrating because I usually check it to deal with important money matters. How am I supposed to get anything done if both this app and the website are awful?"
BBVA,Finance,5, I haven't had any problems with this app. I check my balance and transfer money around to a couple accounts in the same bank. Works perfectly for me.
BBVA,Finance,5," So easy to use and has so many features that I love, like the debit card temporary block and access to full account number through mobile banking."

BBVA,Finance,1," This current update is awful, after you put your password in it goes to terms of conditions page which is blank and therefore you can't continue or do anything. I hope this issue is corrected asap!!!"
BBVA,Finance,1,Loan payment I had been making my payments online on a weekly basis for over a year. Now all of a sudden I can no longer make a regular payment. All I can do is pay towards the principal.
BBVA,Finance,4, Good app. Like all apps it's bound to be buggy so don't get all high and mighty on them. It's safe and easy-to-use. Download it....hypno-toad bids you to.
BBVA,Finance,2, It doesn't work well like it used too.  The deposits aren't showing and and this has happened more than once.

It will not send the security code to actually start the transfer.  It just tells you to enter the code but there is no where to enter it and it never sent it in the first place.  The first time you use the app it asks you if you want to enable certain things but gives you no option other than to accept.  Then it tells you that you can then go into security setting to turn it all off.  They are requiring you to confirm that you want it turned on but no option to continue without giving them permission.
BBVA,Finance,1, Every time you update this godforsaken app you lock me out of my own account. Either save my information when you update or make it easier to recover password/ username.
BBVA,Finance,2," Unreliable.  Inconsistent.   When it decides to work I'm happy with it, but that seems to happen less and less."
BBVA,Finance,1," It was great. With the new updates, I can't move money between my accounts. I'm not a happy camper."

The mobile check app is perfect love it don't have to drive all the way to the bank to make a deposit check so I can use the other check for my phone
BBVA,Finance,5, So far every option in app is working very well. Love the availability to deposit personal and business checks just by taking pictures of the checks.  The Auto alerts keep my accounts current and gives me a sense of security knowing when deposits and withdrawals are made by instant notification
BBVA,Finance,5,Best banking app App really easy to get around and great for all banking needs. Recommend this app for compass customers.  And the finger print scanner on the Samsung s7 makes it fast and easily to sign on.
BBVA,Finance,3, My problem is that the system is down a lot and i cant check my balance. Itll tell wrong username or password when I know it's right or itll say system error. Been happening to much this past week...
BBVA,Finance,1, Can't even get past the terms of use page completely blank. Major disappointment
BBVA,Finance,2,"Check Deposits I have to retake several pictures of my checks before the app would allow me to process the deposit. Sometimes, after check has been processed, it will be returned by the mobile app and I have to physically go to a branch to deposit it"
BBVA,Finance,3,"Bad passwords Wont let you use characters only alphanumeric, no fingerprint swipe either"
BBVA,Finance,1," The pending and posted tranactions do not match what the bank uses.  The amount of fund avilable could easily differ from what is actually in your account.  If you are on a shoestring budget, watch out,  you could find yourself oweing the bank money and they will not help you."
BBVA,Finance,5, It's like having a virtual Bank teller in the palm of my hand. Always up to date on my account. Fingerprint entry is a plus.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Best app ever Very good app, allows me to view my balance without signing in. Very useful"
BBVA,Finance,5, This app is really nice especially for me that I'm always on the road and can't go deposit at the bank daily.
BBVA,Finance,5, I have used this so for many years.  It helps me manage my accounts and monitor my spending.  I have 2 teenage daughters who have separate accounts when they need funds i can transfer from anywhere.  Great life support!
BBVA,Finance,3," It crashes often, logs you out and deletes saved username even after setting to remember username, it needs work"
BBVA,Finance,5,Bbva banking Works like a charm.  Great way to deposit checks into your account..no need to leave the home A+++.
BBVA,Finance,1, Not sure what's worse...this app or the call center! Live my local bank but this app sucks and so does the support
BBVA,Finance,1," Terrible ATM, will retain your money and will take atleast two months to credit your account!"
BBVA,Finance,3, Idk what to say if it's the app or bank that keeps screwing up account transfers

BBVA,Finance,1, I have had more trouble with this app than any other banking app.
BBVA,Finance,5, Keeps informed of any and all transactions the second my card is swiped! Love it!!
BBVA,Finance,2,Always unavailable. The app and website sucks
BBVA,Finance,1, New update is crashing and force closing. Basically a useless app. Fix it.
BBVA,Finance,5," I love this app it's amazing and bbva makes banking easy, by far my favorite banknote been with ever. I'm a customer for life!"
BBVA,Finance,1, The app is just as horrible as the bank.
BBVA,Finance,1, Not sure what you can do with the app. I can't get pass the blank terms and agreement page
BBVA,Finance,4, I really like the quick view which is no  longer available bring it back 5 stars other than that it does what it is supposed to do

BBVA,Finance,1,"What the %&#^#&$ I swear I'm going to switch banks, because your freaking app SUCKS! every time I try to log in as of late, I can't get to my page because the people who code this app don't know what they are doing. Very disappointing to say the least"
BBVA,Finance,2,Update Sucks This was fine until the update. Who told you guys to update something that was working perfectly. Improvement is more of a fail. Haven't be able to login since the update what's the point of having the app if you can't use it. I'm deleting mine. Is rather just login through the website.
BBVA,Finance,5,Really weird seeing so many negative reviews about the app I'm a new BBVA customer and just installed the app on my Google Pixel... Works just fine for me! Pleasantly surprised at it having fingerprint sign-in support! That's kinda rare on Android it seems. I'm giving it 5 stars cuz it's working perfectly for me and the fingerprint support is big for me!
BBVA,Finance,1,"Why did you change it? I don't know why you guys feel the need to constantly change this app and rearrange everything. It was working just fine until this latest update. Now half the time I can't log in or it doesn't remember my login information and I constantly get System Errors.

It was working just fine until this latest update. Now half the time I can't log in or it doesn't remember my login information and I constantly get System Errors. I use this app to transfer money back and forth between several accounts. The transfer process used to be very simple and easy. Now you have to go through three more steps to get to it, and 3 of 4 times it fails with a system error. Roll it back!!!"
BBVA,Finance,1,Transfers to existing accounts..poof? I am now going to have a late payment AND FEE because your app has erased transfers and payments to the BBVA Credit Card account. SCAM!
BBVA,Finance,1,Fix your app!!! I cannot log in or view from quick view since last update... please fix ASAP!!! i hate having to call just to check my balance.i uninstalled and reinstalled the app still nothing! Please someone fix this!
BBVA,Finance,1,Can't sign in Of course when you need to check your balance the app never works. I've been able to log in a total of 4 times since I've updated. Fix the app or you might as well take it down all together.
BBVA,Finance,3,"Fuctional It's not awful. Can usually do what I need to do. Clunky design. Not very intuitive. Camera for deposits is inverted. I give it a solid ""meh""."
BBVA,Finance,1,All of a sudden stopped working Not working at all. Now have to drive to bank to get all my money out of my account don't like not knowing anything
BBVA,Finance,4,"Great way I love this app because it keeps meuodated on how much money i have and if i have any need to get assistance, i just select at what time they can call me and i will get the call, on the bad side, there are sometimes my account gets locked wven though i am putting my right password.

It has happened 2 or 3 times already. Id i didnt had those inconviniences i would have rate it a 5 star"
BBVA,Finance,2,Was a great app til the update Was able to do everything from the app until the update. Now I have trouble signing in and can't do mobile transfers any more.
BBVA,Finance,1,App is terrible & isn't user friendly at all App always fails to let me pay through it instead of having to log in on my laptop which is just incontinent sometimes. Log in is constantly messing up and the app always messes up if it does let me pay on here. Fix this please!!
BBVA,Finance,1,"HATE IT. Seriously BBVA, I can't check my damn balance. It's pissing me off. Fix it"
BBVA,Finance,1,Doesnt work! You cant add accounts. It wont let me sign in. I'm having trouble even making payments. Fix this app or get rid of it. I had to go to the local compass bank to make payments. Very unsatisfied.
BBVA,Finance,1, This is the worse banking app and bank I have ever had the atm in its self will get you Robb cause it takes a effing hour to do a deposit ..
BBVA,Finance,1,"Bbva app update is horrible! The old app worked, this one does not. Did Compass even try it? Now every time I try to use it, I have to update it again. Progress, NOT!"
BBVA,Finance,1,Always messing up This app never works. I love the bank but this banking app is terrible.
BBVA,Finance,1,"It's okay The app is okay, but customer service is pathetic! I switched my business from Bank of America thinking that they were bad, but this ppl is horrible!"
BBVA,Finance,3,Mobile Banking I used this app every day before the update. Now I am unable to use it now. I don't want to download something that I already have. Please fix this problem.
BBVA,Finance,1,Can't log in anymore The login keeps telling me my password is wrong in which it is not and It keeps locking me out because of it.
BBVA,Finance,1,No longer works After the update I can no longer deposit checks with my phone. After 1 photo it goes back to the sign in screen.
BBVA,Finance,1, Won't work and now is accessing an old unused account and now tells me password and username is wrong.before update used multiple times a week.totally useless now
BBVA,Finance,5,"Super Really cool, I have 3 business accounts (2 different businesses) and 1 personal account and I can see them all in one place and transfer funds among them. Plus ""quick view"" allows you to take a quick look at all the balances without actually logging in. Best banking app I've seen."
BBVA,Finance,5,"Old faithful Nothing flashy.  Love BBVA, period.  Great customer service and support. The app does everything but make breakfast in the morning."
BBVA,Finance,1,Constantly unavailable About 25% of the time I can't access my account.
BBVA,Finance,4,"Love this app Haven't had it long, but works well, so far. I can manage multiple accounts, but it seems to be down a lot."
BBVA,Finance,5,"Banking when I need it Sounds cheesy, but I live the convenience. I transfer money and check balances all the time. This app makes it that much easier."
BBVA,Finance,2,"Site keeps going down Site is always down. Log in is wrong. Then it locks,u out. Then it let's you in."
BBVA,Finance,1,Constant problems Since the update it fails and locks me out constantly.  Sick of it.  Ready to switch banks
BBVA,Finance,1,"Go back to older version! It worked great before the update, but I haven't been able to log in for a week now."
BBVA,Finance,1,WORTHLESS!! Worthless app never seems to be working 2/3's the time and
BBVA,Finance,1,Broken App This app is not functional. It cannot log in correctly.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Unreliable Always crashing, and can't access online either. Step it up"
BBVA,Finance,1,Lousy bank system Bank holds a check for 2 days even if it is drawn on their bank
BBVA,Finance,1,Only works half the time. sometimes it won't work all day...like today.
BBVA,Finance,1, I dislike Compass bank.i have had it for several years and it stinks.
BBVA,Finance,5," I've used this app for more than a year. I'm pleased with the updates, & the app does everything I need an app like this to do."
BBVA,Finance,1,Should include USA constitution in mission statement supports human rights abuse by investing in dakota access pipeline.
BBVA,Finance,3,Wheres Quick Balance?? What happened to being able to quick glance your balance?? I used that a lot and now its gone!!
BBVA,Finance,4,"Good Job! I have been waiting for a fingerprint scanner security option. This is the first app I ever used with it, and I fealt like you guys were ahead of the game with this."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Can't deposit checks. Sitting on hold with support for 45 minutes.  After 3 days of promises, I still can't deposit a check!"
BBVA,Finance,1,Unable to retrieve information Please try again later.
BBVA,Finance,3,"Idk what happened I havent been able to use the app since October 29th, it says on the log in page"
BBVA,Finance,4,"What's the problem? I have no idea what these people who say the app sucks, or they're having major issues are talking about.  I haven't had a problem from day one.  I like this app a lot."
BBVA,Finance,1,No help at all Lost card and this app says I can block or cancel card but there is no where to do it.

BBVA,Finance,3,"Cant use after update! Ever since I downloaded the update for this I havent been able to sign in! Sometimes it will let me see the quick view, sometimes not! It keeps saying ""Cannot retrieve information. Please try again later."""
BBVA,Finance,2, Has no way to save data and information as you move around the site and other functions on your phone. I had to repeatedly reenter the same info because I could not save it. You have to sign in too often when you are still working or waiting for a call back.
BBVA,Finance,2,"Quick view never works The whole reason I got the app, was for the quick view. Being able to just click twice to get my balances, without having to sign in. HOWEVER IT NEVER WORKS. Ffs"
BBVA,Finance,3,"Getting better! Still has some issues with not launching properly, but it no longer crashes when activating rewards.  Functionally this app is great. I can almost do everything I could do on the website.  Keep up the improvements!"
BBVA,Finance,2,Unreliable Shuts down when trying to log in. Mobile deposit rarely works. Transactions/ balance are not current.
BBVA,Finance,1,Terrible Every time the app is updated it gets harder and harder to use. If you want to make something better dont make it more and more difficult to find things.
BBVA,Finance,5,Doesn't work Now all of a sudden it automatically shuts down when trying to log in. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still does it.     :/    ***UPDATE***  Working good again.    5 stars

BBVA,Finance,1,Constant error message When trying to transfer funds from my savings account to my checking it will continually give the same error message alert over and over. There's a lot if bugs which is quite uncomfortable.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Love it I do everything with this app, set up payments, make transfers and easy-to-use. So easy to check your balance at the touch of a finger. I've never a problem with anything.

BBVA,Finance,5,Great Banking App I've had this app for 2 years and it just gets better and better easy to use and very helpful
BBVA,Finance,3, Camera deposit times out too quickly. It gets stuck on first picture and submits it over and over.
BBVA,Finance,5, I never have any issue with this site. Easy to use! Always give you plenty notice when they will be updating site.
BBVA,Finance,1,Always Unable to Open Getting very frustrating every time I go to check my account and it's unavailable.
BBVA,Finance,1,Was perfect Now it keeps locking my account and refusing to take my password. Smh. Horrible.

BBVA,Finance,5,"Works great I use this app constantly, and have never had any problems with it. Account alerts, photo check deposit, fingerprint quick access.... I love it."
BBVA,Finance,1,A Moreno This app is the dumbest thong Compass has done it is unmanageable I've been in the bank several times and your own staff doesn't know how to use it.
BBVA,Finance,2,"Disappointed I'm so disappointed that after the update I can't sign in with fingerprint anymore, sometimes I jsut need to check my balance quick and I hate entering my password. Fix it please"
BBVA,Finance,2,"Not I have been using this app for quite some time now I don't like the new update not allowing you to view your funds on the weekends! , if it was not for that I would give y'all five stars"
BBVA,Finance,2,Really If we could do it on the website how come we can't add other account numbers so we can easily transfer funds.

BBVA,Finance,1,"The old app was superior to this one! The newest version is, predictably, WORSE than its predecessor. It still takes up to four minutes for a deposit to go through. Other bank mobile apps I have take seconds. This bank knows NOTHING about how to put together a good mobile banking app."
BBVA,Finance,1,Worst bank app ever Can not even get my money when it's a Compass check from my millionaire boss to my little account. This is a joke!
BBVA,Finance,1,Low Mobile Security Needs to have fingerprint verification & stronger passwords.  Too easily defeat with spyware.  Especially now days as bank spyware is at its highest it's ever been.
BBVA,Finance,5,Works for me... ...and they do not screw it up every little while with a makeover update. It works. It always has. BBVA Wallet is really helpful with its real time transaction alerts. Love them both.
BBVA,Finance,5,Best Banking Mobile App Does everything I need. Alerts are awesome. Deposit is easy. This banking app does more than most big banks. :)
BBVA,Finance,5,Very valuable tool!! It never fails when you need to make sure how much money is in your account you can't until you go to the bank. With this app I transfer money from one account to the other in seconds. It's awesome you'll love it!! Enjoy.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Doesn't even work App is always down,I can't even check my balance because app is always down"
BBVA,Finance,2," Only use it to check balances, otherwise not very good"
BBVA,Finance,2, Trying to cash checks sends me into an endless loop.
BBVA,Finance,5,Love it I left my other banks for BBVA. Their app alone did more than my banks when you walked through the front door. Love BBVA SO FAR
BBVA,Finance,3,"Very useful... when it works Loads of great features, user friendly interface, and more bugs than a roach farm."

Then it stopped working. Unistall, reinstall.....and my account info is even less accurate and updated. What did you guys do? If I can't be up to minute on my banking, that's enough to change banks. Times are tough, and you have to stay on top. You guys are sliding...... Shame. I like my bank. But now I question my bank. By the way, I work in accounting....just sayin'."
BBVA,Finance,1, This app goes directly to solicitation for BBVA bank card and won't let me go into my wallet. I have to start from the browser to get into my wallet. This app is USELESS!

Now the transfer money between accounts option is completely jacked and won't show my other accounts regardless of restarts, backing out but then will randomly work for no reason. I can't even list everything else that doesn't work or glitches without getting aggravated. It's frustrating and inconvenient, fix it or turn it back to how it was, because it's garbage."
BBVA,Finance,1,Poor mobile app I deposited a check on mobile app two days ago. Called and was told there is no record of it coming through yet. It's from another Compass acct. So yes going into the branch is my next step. No thx to this app. Frustrating. Should have just gone in to cash it instead.
BBVA,Finance,4,Check deposit broken in Android 6 There was lots of problems in android 6. They appear to be fixed now. It is working ok for me again
BBVA,Finance,1,"Won't install I have 90mb free on my android, but it claims to have insufficient memory to install."
BBVA,Finance,4,Great job This app makes banking so easy and convenient. It's quite user friendly too. Gets a little better with each update.
BBVA,Finance,1,Not good It used to be. Really accurate with my acount... Not any more
BBVA,Finance,1,Broken Tries to do the login via fingerprint but is stuck on that screen.
BBVA,Finance,3,Ok I rated 3 stars only because I like the quick view of my accounts more than I like the finger print login.. they are both great but I benefited more from the quick view..
BBVA,Finance,5,Love the app Easy to use - can transfer from accounts - I love it
BBVA,Finance,5,Works great. Never any issues for me. Love it Works great but I wish it could do more. Hi

BBVA,Finance,5,Love the new querks! I absolutely love this app!  Real time posting and it can 10x more than any other bank app out there.  Noncompareable.
BBVA,Finance,1,Update: 26 July 2016 Will not load Update: Downloaded most recent update and now the app will not even load.
BBVA,Finance,3,"Reduced security? With the previous version, I had to type a username plus a password. I used a username that is not the same as any other username. That required a hacker to know two things. Now the app remembers my past my username, and someone who finds my phone only needs the password. Bad news."
BBVA,Finance,2,"BBVA Are a Bunch Of 卐卐卐's! I hate calling customer service, but when I do ""John"" tells me he can't give me certain information. Then I call again and ""Susy"" does give me that information. I want a banking app that gives me enough info so that I don't have to call customer service."
BBVA,Finance,2," I really loved this app and suddenly the bill pay stopped working. When I called for technical support nobody could figure out how to fix the issue.... and now I can't use that function.

When I called for technical support nobody could figure out how to fix the issue.... and now I can't use that function. I've wasted so much time on the phone, on hold and being transfered around with no resolve. It never worked again. Never had issues before the update."
BBVA,Finance,1,Don't Trust This Software Nothing is coordinated to be up to date with your account. If you use anything to do with computers with this company they will surely mess it up. At your expense. Save every confirmation number do not trust this company.
BBVA,Finance,2,"Logs me out when making deposits I have spent more time on the phone with customer service than it takes to drive to the bank! Never had problems before the ""upgrade."""
BBVA,Finance,4,NBA checking It says there's an error in retrieving scores. Update - the fingerprint login has been removed with the new update? !
BBVA,Finance,1,Bad version I can access direct always ask for update fix plz

Always says contact customer service.  I don't like taking to ppl bc they are useless.  That's why i want MOBILE BANKING.  It's not the convenience,  it's to avoid speaking to ppl who are as helpful as taking to a machine or some moron representative named ""Scott"",etc. Do better at giving me information,  not just an app to replace me checkbook."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Application will NOT OPEN I have downloaded this application 5 times hoping that it would open and function properly, but it doesn't on my Samsung 7. Very Disappointed"
BBVA,Finance,3,"Nice idea It always unfocused the check, then does not let me change it. So I have to start over. Once I get it to a correct photo the app many times will crash. When it works it is great"
BBVA,Finance,1,Hate it. This app is a waist of time and space on my phone. Would be amazing if I could actually log in and access my accounts with it for once with out having to call customer service.
BBVA,Finance,3," Nice app, however, when I tap on a debit or a deposit I would like to be able to see a picture of the check paid out so I can see to whom it was made  and a picture of the check/or item deposited so I know from where that deposit came.

I used to be able to tap on a debit and see a picture of the check.  That feature seems to have been taken out. It seems that if a deposit can be made by taking a picture of the deposited check then that picture should be available for viewing."
BBVA,Finance,2,Fingerprint not working Gives me no option to use fingerprint on my note 4. Contacted bbva and sent emails. No response....
BBVA,Finance,2,Doesn't work I downloaded the app to deposit a check and it never worked. Even with diffrent phones. Deffinately thumbs down.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Ehh The app lacks user friendliness, complicated and bland compared to other mobile banking apps."
BBVA,Finance,5, Thank you so much. I love being able do everything on my phone and the quick app is so wonderful. Thanks for all you do. Great Bank.
BBVA,Finance,2,"Mitek sucks The check depositing feature ""powered by Mitek"" is inconsistent, buggy, and frustrating."
BBVA,Finance,1,Mobile deposit a week ago still not in my account Unreliable! First I was shocked by.notice that mobile deposit was going to cost $1 then it was going to take 3 days. This was a Dallas Texas county payroll check. It's been a week and I'm the way to get ALL of my money. Worse than Bank of America.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Thank You for job well done keep-up the great work! BBVA COMPASS BANK I AM HAPPY TO BANK WITH VERY WELL TRUSTED I GIVE IT 10-*s and more if any, Thank You All.!!!"
BBVA,Finance,1," I hate it, if you use bill pay they automatically sign you up for paperless billing, what does one do with an app you can't use to pay bills,.......HATE IT"
BBVA,Finance,1,Stopped working I can no longer get the app to open at all...
BBVA,Finance,4, As a truck driver this app brings a little more comfort to your life being able to transfer money to drivers an to have a bank with this app is great.
BBVA,Finance,1,Can't open app I've used this app before. Now I have a Galaxy J7 and the app will not open. I've installed and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Won't open. Says app stopped working.
BBVA,Finance,1, It is not very user friendly. It gives instructions with reference to line items that are not available through the app. Limited usage.
BBVA,Finance,1,BBVA compass bank app I tried many times doesn't work on Samsung j7
BBVA,Finance,1,Why the change? I like the old app better! Please bring the old app back.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Great bank app Never any issues, works how is supposed to every time."
BBVA,Finance,5, I downloaded the bbva app but the app is not opening up on my phone.please assist.
BBVA,Finance,1,App installation I download the app. Then when I try to open an error message appears.
BBVA,Finance,1,Doesn't work App doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy J7
BBVA,Finance,1,Crashes. ! Can't even access my accounts
BBVA,Finance,3," During mobile deposit, the preview image is mirrored horizontally and vertically. This makes camera positioning over the check reversed and extremely difficult to align properly."
BBVA,Finance,3, Like the old app better give quick view for a quick look at your account. Able to view account with out signing in
BBVA,Finance,1, This app does not open most if the time I find it very frustrating

You guys are going backwards, just like microsoft..."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Can't use app to deposit a check I can't tell you how many times I've tried, how frustrated I get every time. Like the other posters, my experience is it's not getting better. Bbva, by all my experiences, is a second rate bank. I don't have this problem with their competitors."
BBVA,Finance,1, This is the worst app ever. I have Galaxy 6 edge plus. It just won't open. I have to uninstall then re install to open the app. Bbva you can do better
BBVA,Finance,2,Go back! Can't deposit check.  Bombs at defining which account deposit goes to.  Uninstaller and reinstalled twice and same thing at same place.  Android Marshmallow on S7 phone.

BBVA,Finance,5," I can check my account anytime I want , so I can see when checks clear or what payments have been paid. Very helpful.  I recommend this app."
BBVA,Finance,2,"Super slow The app is so slow, opening. It's faster just logging in online."
BBVA,Finance,2,"When will they fix this... New version and they still have not fixed the following! When using Bill Pay and scheduling a payment, it would be nice to have check amount deducted from available balance to make it an Actual balance. Come on. When you write a paper check you deduct it from the ledger balance. Please fix."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Can't deposit checks!! Please fix this!! Since this updated I am unable to use the deposit check feature. When you click on it and it's prompts you to select account, it gives you an error message that it has unfortunately stopped. I have the Samsung Galaxy 7."
BBVA,Finance,1,Hate it! After the update it wont let me log in. It locked me out of my account and I called the 1800  number and they unlocked it. But its locked again.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Used to work, now it doesn't This app was fine before the update. Now it won't open. Great."
BBVA,Finance,4,BBVA APP Very good with getting things taken care of on the banking side.
BBVA,Finance,3,Needs more options Wish it had option to put card on hold or report card when lost/stolen.
BBVA,Finance,5,I love the app. By far the best and I would suggest to anyone
BBVA,Finance,5,Great app!!! Makes online banking easy and convenient. I definitely recommend it to ALL Compass account holders.

BBVA,Finance,1,"Deposited check is un-deposited 5 days later If I deposit a check and the app says Success! Don't come back 5 days later and roll back the deposit. Make that determination the moment the app accepts the check.  That's what other banks do, I really dont know why i waste my time with BBVA."
BBVA,Finance,3,"Decent app Mostly works, lots of functionality but not not the most stable thing. Check capture is buggy phone to phone, messaging help is cool, if you don't want a reply since you can't read them  in the app, only send. It's not bad, but it's got some work yet."
BBVA,Finance,5, Am new to online banking can't wait to start working with u. It will also help with bills that I have to pay ex for BC I use my card and not checking. So hoping things will go good.
BBVA,Finance,4,Easy to use I don't use all features so can't say 100% how they work but I haven't had any issues except for maintenance being done and can't use it.
BBVA,Finance,2,"Mobile Check Capture BAD Mobile check capture does not work. Attempted to deposit multiple checks, always receive same error, ""cannot read check"". Needs to be fixed."
BBVA,Finance,1," Total aggravation. Requires too many updates. Won't let you do anything without updating it. I don't know how many times I had to update the darned thing before I finally got fed up. Uninstalled. Save yourelf the trouble with this one. If you need account information, make a phone call."
BBVA,Finance,1,"What?! Why can't I deposit my check? I even asked my branch they said the app probably needs an update...ok im still waiting. Menu on bottom ""I want to...deposit check"" is there but when you click on it it will not let you take picture. Fix this.please."
BBVA,Finance,1,Failed login in 8 out of 10 times there's a problem with my login. Super frustrating
BBVA,Finance,2,"Fails to launch I use the app daily. Since the new update, frequently I have to uninstall then re-install in order for it to open."
BBVA,Finance,5,BBVA mobile app It's the best one I have ever used .
BBVA,Finance,2,Needs work Interface is ok. Takes longer to recognize images for deposits and does not refresh to show new deposit pending.

My new account became overdrawn by ONE CENT, which was caused by their internal process, and they STOLE a $32 overdraft fee from me and are refusing to return it! Beware of these white collar criminals, and do your banking somewhere else. If you have an account with BBVA, I would recommend withdrawing your money and closing your account ASAP, and putting it into a reputable bank or credit union."
BBVA,Finance,1," First BBVA sucks.  2nd, the mobile deposit options are terrible, focuses in and out, won't take a clear pic, crashes.  Don't waste your time."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Idk I don't like the setup on this one. I wish I could get the old one back :-/       with the new one you can't view all the checks, you have to go online to do it now"
BBVA,Finance,3,Fix Every time I try signing in it says I have the wrong username and password (they are correct). then it ends up locking my account.
BBVA,Finance,4,Love this app! Use just about every day to access my accounts and love the ability to deposit checks from anywhere.

BBVA,Finance,5,"Best Bank, Best App Extremely useful app. I recommend it."
BBVA,Finance,3,Okay Could be a tad better. But works fine. I like the options it has. Maybe a few more selections and such would help.

BBVA,Finance,1,I'd give it zero stars if I could This is the worst banking app. The main feature of these apps is to do things like deposits and you can't do that at all. I have a Samsung note 5 that's less than 2 months old and it refuses to 'read' the check and make the deposit. F- guys. This app ain't worth the data to download
BBVA,Finance,4, App crashing? Uninstall then reinstall. The update causes existing installs to crash upon opening on Android Marshmallow. It did for me and many others it seems anyway. A great banking app when it works.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Works well First, anyone who is having issues, reinstall. I was having the same crashing issues, but did a clean reinstall and now it works fine. Good app, love the check deposit and card activation features."

It works in that it allows me to check the status of my accounts, pay bills and make mobile deposits.   What this app lacks is any checks and balances for deposits that usually comes with banking and accounting. If I make 5 deposits of the same amount during the month, I cannot from my online statement tell which customer's check was deposited. I can't tell if I have a deposit or an accounts receivable problem. There is not a picture of the check that I took a picture of. When I make the deposit, there is a 6-7 digit number number that is displayed on my phone. I record that number, but BBV Compass never shows that number again. The 800 number and the online support people tell they are working on a solution, but I have been waiting for several months. If I go to the bank for deposit, they make a copy of the check, not for mobile banking.   I consider not having checks and balances on a mobile app a serious problem."
BBVA,Finance,3,"Needs fresh install on 6.0 App loading problems solved after uninstall and reinstall, but you'll need to  log back in"
BBVA,Finance,1,Bad app App just crashes when I try to open it. If you can't even get an app to work right why should I trust you with my money?
BBVA,Finance,3,"Mobile deposit does not work It worked briefly before, but in latest version it doesn't let me take a picture of a check."
BBVA,Finance,1,Doesn't Work with Android 6.0 Tries to open then closes. I'm about done with this bank.

BBVA,Finance,1,"doesn't open after Android update had trouble with ""compliant"" images when it was working. app seems to need work."
BBVA,Finance,1,Latest version unusable The app crashes every time I try to open it.

Deposited a check thru APP they decided to put a 4 day hold on a check for $200. No reason and can't get someone on the phone to talk to. So I had to wait for it.
BBVA,Finance,4,No Weekend Update? The only problem is my deposit amount is not accurate on the weekends and caused me an overdraft.  It's accurate on the weekdays though. Otherwise I like the app.
BBVA,Finance,5,Extremely easy to use Use it all the time. Never any issues. PopMoney is pretty great except that it used to replace my contacts in my phone. I don't know if that was ever fixed.

The mobile deposit feature is the main reason I use it, and it functions marginally at best. I often have to manually take the check photos. I had one deposit returned and a $2.50 fee charged because the app accepted a deposit then determined the image was not readable. I reported this as a bug via their Facebook page, and got the standard ""someone will look into it"" reply. Haven't had any luck so far of getting the fee refunded. The schedule a call feature is broken for next available - no confirmation. As long as this app has been around, you'd think all the bugs would be worked out by now."
BBVA,Finance,3,"Mobile deposit not working Everytime I take a picture of the front and back of a check, I get a red check. Never happened before. Extremely annoying and inconvenient. Time to change banks"
BBVA,Finance,1,This app is the worst banking app of all time Depositing a check is almost impossible. Auto focus never works and you have to wait for manual option to appear after failed attempts. App is a complete waste of time.
BBVA,Finance,3,Refresh button This app could really use a refresh button. I don't like that I have to log out and back in to check if the latest transaction was posted to my account.

The automatic snapshot is never bright enough or clear enough no matter what I do.  After 30 minutes and repeated attempts I end up having to go to the bank anyway.
BBVA,Finance,1,Deposit by phone is terrible Got the new app. Tried 1000 times and could not get a single deposit to go through. No problems with the other app. Just frustrating and terrible.
BBVA,Finance,3,Liked old one better... I can't figure out how to pay my credit card on this new app. It no longer will let me. The old app was way better. : (
BBVA,Finance,5,Awesome So far this bank has been great don't think I want to go elsewhere happy my husband signed up
BBVA,Finance,3, This app at times shows different data than the computer Internet does.  I notice this on status on bill pay payments.

BBVA,Finance,2,Partial app. Needs work Making transfers and bill pay is pretty easy. However you try to make any deposits this app will drive you nuts. It'll take 10 minutes to take a good pic of your check and you go to complete transaction to find out the pix are no good. Frustrating to say the least.
BBVA,Finance,1,Non productive updates They are continously late with the technology. Paper and pen would be better.
BBVA,Finance,4, BBVA Mobile App is easy to use and very user friendly.  The only feature I struggle with is Bill Pay and only because I would like to see a confirmation message that my payment is successfully scheduled..
BBVA,Finance,1,Not user friendly 1. Low monthly limit on mobile deposit ($1500 per 30 days) 2. Transactions page has no info 3.the app is difficult to navigate and things are in weird places. This is by far the worst baking app I've used
BBVA,Finance,5,BBVA Compass  Bank Friendly and pleasant personnel make doing business with you a joy.  Thank you for help navigating the website when I opened my new account.   Now that I have my bill pay & direct deposit all set up it is a piece of cake taking care of all my expenses at the end of the month.

BBVA,Finance,1, It keeps giving me incorrect user name and password while the old app was OK.
BBVA,Finance,1,Money Where or who took the money? Just gives an amount and a date really bad way to bank. Please fix or i will be forced to drop you as my main bank
BBVA,Finance,4,"Good, but there is a bug in Bill Pay When using the Pay a Bill function, the first payment does not present the ""Payment Sucess"" screen, it stays on the ""submit"" screen."
BBVA,Finance,5,Nice Absolutely no problems at all..able to transfer money within accounts seamlessly..posts within 20 seconds..the electronic method of taking a pic of check for deposit is modern and accurate...no more making trips to the drive thru long lines on a Saturday..
BBVA,Finance,4,"Bank app Works well, never have had a problem with it and does everything I need and more."
BBVA,Finance,1," Thanks guys, I could acess the mobile banking from my mobile phone  with the old version and now the ""new and improved version"" I can't acess it at all.  Why fix what ain't broken.!!!  Now to acess the mobile app I need to buy a new phone. Go figure!"
BBVA,Finance,1," Hard to set up and start, hard to handle o  android"
BBVA,Finance,3,Phone deposit Doesn't work. Won't take approved picture. Using Samsung Galaxy S6
BBVA,Finance,5,"Absolutely the best I like the ease of looking at my account,  balance,  and deposit checks with just a few clicks. Wish all banks was up to date with this technology."
BBVA,Finance,1,Doug C New updated app won't let me sign in. Imagine that!
BBVA,Finance,1,"Buggy Does not accept correct passwords, many attempts."
BBVA,Finance,1,Retarded The available balance is the same as what you have
BBVA,Finance,1," Had no problems with the old app, now it won't let me log in ... 😡"
BBVA,Finance,1,Worthless This app is stuck on stupid way too often.
BBVA,Finance,2,Deposit doesn't work It takes 5 min to take a picture of a freaking check! It used to be easy
BBVA,Finance,1,It's not as  easy to use I really hate it
BBVA,Finance,1, App Sux and so does the customer service!
BBVA,Finance,1, Should have kept the old one!
BBVA,Finance,1,Doesn't work Cannot log in.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Love Easy to use, let's me see everything I need."
BBVA,Finance,5,Very good app It works very well. It would be nice to see monthly graphs of your balance
BBVA,Finance,5,One of the best banking apps out there. Now they just need to get onboard with Android Pay.
BBVA,Finance,1,Terrible The old app was much easier and  worked better.
BBVA,Finance,1, always having to uninstall and reinstall miss the old app
BBVA,Finance,3,Android pay When will we have support for Android pay
BBVA,Finance,1,Cw Doesn't let you see previous statements. Previous version worked better.
BBVA,Finance,2,Old was better Some functions don't work like search for transaction
BBVA,Finance,3,Banking Hafe the can't log in
BBVA,Finance,5,"Bbvacompass application Quick, 24/7 access to my account, easy to use and understand"
BBVA,Finance,5,Compass banking Online banking
BBVA,Finance,1, Don't like it
BBVA,Finance,4,Smooth and Easy Works quickly. Intuitive. Needs more functionality in ACH transfers.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Love it!!! So easy to use, fast and  reliable. Live it love it love it."
BBVA,Finance,5,Great app Everything works great.
BBVA,Finance,5,:) I like it
BBVA,Finance,5, I like the new user friendly interface.

Opening the transfer section often fails and I have to close and reopen the app to try again. After transfers you have to wait and refresh and wait and refresh to see updated balances... That's all I can remember for now."
BBVA,Finance,2, Mobile deposits just don't work. Impossible.    The only feature I wanted.
BBVA,Finance,1,"This app stinks First 3 times I installed the app, it kept telling me that my user name and password were incorrect  (when they weren't ). So I continued using the old app. Now I am at the deadline it tells me I must install by 9-15-15, now it won't install at all!  WTH."
BBVA,Finance,1, I cannot manage auto pay with this new app.  It's so frustrating.
BBVA,Finance,1,Old app was better Stop trying to improve on something that already works
BBVA,Finance,1, It won't install. Been trying for days to install and it wont.
BBVA,Finance,5,Good job! Keep up the hard work. You guys are the best bank hands down.
BBVA,Finance,5, Buenisima la aplicación
BBVA,Finance,4,"Compass, love it. Does everything I need it to do."
BBVA,Finance,5,Loving this bank Simple simple very simple bank
BBVA,Finance,5, Great app never misses
BBVA,Finance,5,Nice APP Online banking
BBVA,Finance,5, Grateful app
BBVA,Finance,3,"I don't like it. I liked the previous version.  I had already uninstalled this one, but the other version tells me it's not supported. And now I can't see my check's image. I have to open my checkbook to remember whom I made the check to."
BBVA,Finance,2,Mobile deposits not so convenient Waited for years for Compass to catch up to the competition and getting mobile deposits. In 2 tries I have had numerous troubles making mobile deposits. Keep getting processing errors when images and deposit amount are good.
BBVA,Finance,1,Needs to be fixed After I use it once but need to look at it again I have to restart my phone because it won't work. It's like one real use per day. If I knew this would happen I never would have updated the app to this version.
BBVA,Finance,1, Horrible version.  Functionality from old version missing.  App shuts down for no reason.
BBVA,Finance,3,"Brian Floyd App changes are not user friendly. Also, app has an error that pops up when trying to open app that says ""unfortunately BBVA Compass has stopped"" and I have to re-log on to the app. It usually works OK if I start over, it's just an inconvenience at times."
BBVA,Finance,2,"Mobile depositing needs fixing The app runs smoothly, and for the most part works very well, but I have been waiting 3 days for my check to be verified, that's kind of ridiculous"
BBVA,Finance,5," Great app! Good interface, easy to use, has everything I need"
BBVA,Finance,3,Needs fixing I have to force stop the app then open it again every time I wanna see my account balance or anything really. Would like this to get fixed.
BBVA,Finance,4,'Bout time Would go 5 ☆...unable to access pending transactions on the deposit side.
BBVA,Finance,5,Love the new updates This app just keeps getting better and better!
BBVA,Finance,1,Unexpected error Always gives me unexpected error has occurred
BBVA,Finance,1,Worse app I had more problem with this app than the old app.
BBVA,Finance,4, Freezes too often but otherwise good app
BBVA,Finance,1,Garbage I'm switching to wells Fargo.
BBVA,Finance,1, Very much worse than the previous
BBVA,Finance,3, Liked how the old one would separate pending transaction now it's all mixed in
BBVA,Finance,3, Can't seem to turn off my paper statement evertime i try it close out
BBVA,Finance,3,Mobile deposit Mobile deposit for closes after the first picture taken .. Every single time
BBVA,Finance,2,Compass bank I really like the old version it was better I had no problems at all😯😞
BBVA,Finance,1,Can't even load ir How can I rate it
BBVA,Finance,1, I liked the old app better. It was much easier to read.
BBVA,Finance,5,Good and useful! The latest upgrades make this essential.
BBVA,Finance,5,Very good app I can't think of anything that is not good with this app
BBVA,Finance,5, Love it great app. BBVA great bank
BBVA,Finance,3, Liked the older app better.
BBVA,Finance,3, I prefer the old version !!!
BBVA,Finance,4,"So so... Most important part of this app is being able to deposit a check. But when it takes a bad photo (often) and try to retake it will give you an ""I can't read this"" error and you can't go back it has to be restarted. Other than that, fairly useful"
BBVA,Finance,1,"Deposit issues The app is better, but if you have to deposit a check you are out of luck. No matter how you take the picture it will tell you it can't read the check. Just awful."
BBVA,Finance,5,Love it! This App just keeps getting better and better. The design makes it easier to use. This App is one of the reasons that I cannot imagine leaving BBVA
BBVA,Finance,1,Like the old one better. The old version was MUCH easier and showed pending vs. posted transactions. Don't like this one at all.
BBVA,Finance,3,Really preferred previous interface This interface is too clunky. Previous interface perfect.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Woah! We can make deposits by snapping a pic of our checks!? Cool, app keeping getting better and more convenient"
BBVA,Finance,5, Best one I have.  The alerts saved me from fraudulent charges!
BBVA,Finance,5,Wonderful! In today's fast paced world this app is amazing. Banking at my fingertips. This app had never let me down.
BBVA,Finance,4,"Mostly good It still has issues, but it's getting better."
BBVA,Finance,5,Use it everyday. I use this app daily to monitor the activities of my personal and business accounts. A must have.
BBVA,Finance,1,Stops Working Constantly shutting down
BBVA,Finance,2, Took twice as long for check deposit and seemed to have a challenge keeping track of itself. Have uninstalled.
BBVA,Finance,1,Will not deposit the correct amount Will not deposit the correct amount
BBVA,Finance,3,Happy camper again Was finally able to configure alerts. Thank you for fixing the issue.
BBVA,Finance,4,Good stuff Like to see my account without going into the bank
BBVA,Finance,5,Great App This app kicks butt
BBVA,Finance,4, Great way to manage my accounts.
BBVA,Finance,3,"Old one better Really preferred they layout of the old app.  Also, if I forget to logout, the app still thinks it's logged in the next time I use it, and I have to make it crash to reset."
BBVA,Finance,5,I love this app It always works for me. Been using it for years. I'm shocked at how much it can do. Hurray for the modern age!
BBVA,Finance,1,Terrible Doesn't work. Old version was much better!
BBVA,Finance,1,Log in doesn't work. Says check username and password.  It did let me log in once but it said $0.00 and said no info available.
BBVA,Finance,1, This is AWFUL!!!! I was an employee for 30 years.  This is the worst thing that the bank has done.
BBVA,Finance,5,BBVA Compass App Response I liked the way that the information was explained in a way that is understood. It should always be a easier way to access my personal bank accounts at the Times I need them. Thanks!!!
BBVA,Finance,4,Better Cannot configure alerts from the app on galaxy s5. The button to configure doesn't perform any actions
BBVA,Finance,3, It always forceclose on me
BBVA,Finance,5,Easy to use. Love this app
BBVA,Finance,5,"Does what I need it to do easily and no hassle. Transfers are smooth, loads quickly, never had a crash. I wish BBVA would make an app for tablets but not really any issue's on my tablet. Banking at your fingertips what more can I ask for. Can get my balance in under a minute. Think back 10 years, we are truly spoiled these days."
BBVA,Finance,4,"Not bad, but not sure how it's better than previous One simple feature the new app neglects was the different color for deposit/credit transactions. The view now is all one color. Not as easy to identify money coming in"
BBVA,Finance,1,"Horrible App! This is supposed to be a new updated app and I couldn't even use my username or my password to log into this it!!

Miraculously it FINALLY, let me log it after it made me change my password to what it wanted it to be! Horrible App!!! Stick with the old app if you have it, it's much easier to use and better to look at."
BBVA,Finance,3," after playing  with this new version, about 20 times, i finally understood how this application works. i am not into business, marketing, real estate, wall street, i am just an individual with modest means. For others maybe it works quiet well and more."
BBVA,Finance,1,"New but not improved This new version is awful, I actually feel like I took a step backwards. The old app was way better."
BBVA,Finance,1,Not happy I really liked the old version way more driscriptive all in the same section all deposits and withdrawals and would reflect right away
BBVA,Finance,1,"Unable to log in. I've tried many times and it said it ""couldn't load data"". Old app works perfectly"
BBVA,Finance,3," Most of the app works fine for me, but I hate the Find Us feature. It simply takes too much time and focus to use it while you are actually on the go. For example, if I try to pull it up now, it takes forever to finish drawing the initial map because it finds ""at least 90 Branches/ATMs in this area....Full ReviewMost of the app works fine for me, but I hate the Find Us feature. It simply takes too much time and focus to use it while you are actually on the go. For example, if I try to pull it up now, it takes forever to finish drawing the initial map because it finds ""at least 90 Branches/ATMs in this area."" That's because it includes every Allpoint network ATM, and there's no setting to exclude those. It takes a lot of pinch-to-zoom before I can even find my own location among the 90+ icons. If I switch from map to list view, I can do a search to filter out ATMs by looking for ""branch"" in the description, but that takes many taps to accomplish, and there's no way to make list view the initial view by default. What this app really needs is some shortcuts for Nearest Branch, Nearest ATM, and Nearest BBVA ATM. Save the 90 data points for desktop web site; when I'm on the go, I want to be able to tap once and find the most convenient location ASAP."
BBVA,Finance,1,"Stinks!! Right off the bat, this app locked me out even tho all info was correctly entered.  Now I am stuck waiting for a callback from 'customer service'.  Who does that to their customers?!"
BBVA,Finance,1,"I am very disappointed. I am very dissatisfied with the app because for the last couple of days I have not been able to access my account because this app won't load. I ended up using the old version to gain access, it is highly frustrating for me."
BBVA,Finance,4,Better in many ways This update is pretty decent. Make sure to clear your app cache before using it and it should run fine. The layout is different. Better? In some ways yes in some ways no. I like it and it still does exactly what I want it to do.
BBVA,Finance,3,New App Not impressed. The old one is far better.
BBVA,Finance,3," What happened to ""Pending"" transactions? I liked that feature on old app."
BBVA,Finance,2, I in 10 chance  of transaction  going  through.  Lousy  !
BBVA,Finance,1, No ability to make principal payment = worthless app
BBVA,Finance,3,Needs another update! It's keeps crashing!
BBVA,Finance,5,BBVA Compass App The app to have for y'all of your online banking needs!
BBVA,Finance,1,Wth Just did the update cant even log in!
BBVA,Finance,5,Ok it works Works just fine now.  Samsung galaxy s5  5.0.0
BBVA,Finance,4, It helps me out wen I need to know anything
BBVA,Finance,5, I use it quite a bit for deposits. Very convenient.
BBVA,Finance,4, A lot easier to read navigation was a breeze
BBVA,Finance,5,Perfect app.service Love it perfect app personal

I'm dyslexic and the new way is hard to read. There was nothing wrong with the old version.     I hate apps on my phone for banking. Too much info on my phone if it gets lost. I'd much rather go to the website each time, and that is no longer an option."
BBVA,Finance,2,"App misbehaving upon login Log in keeps asking me to verify my username and password after I've put in the correct info.  After deleting the app and reinstalling, same problem.  I literally can't get into this app.  Please fix!  I use this everyday!!"
BBVA,Finance,5,Works great now! Had trouble accessing my information after updating this application so I sent an email and low rating and the app began working immediately. I like the new update now that's it's working correctly. Very easy to maneuver around in.
BBVA,Finance,1,Login error After numerous attempts to login I have given up. Says to verify username and password but I know that it's correct. Also won't let me enter security question. Should have stayed with Apple iPhone 5S
BBVA,Finance,1,I thought easy I thought it was going to be easy that a monkey could do it but no it turned out to be bullshit. Please get your passwords and usernames straight so people won't get locked out. YOU SUCK AND THE APP AS WELL. :(   &lt;(
BBVA,Finance,1,"Grrr It doesn't let me login in n it doesn't recognize my device when I have always used this device. The update is no good, had to uninstall n installed again n I'm still w the same problem, hope the problem gets resolved cuz I really liked it how it was before. I do use it a lot n depend on it."
BBVA,Finance,3,"Will not let me log in I have entered the correct info, app says wrong password. I uninstall, re install; app says wrong password. I click forgot password, app will not let me enter security question/answer. Same issue on two different devices, using android 5.1 ( nexus 7 & HTC one m8)"
BBVA,Finance,2,Give me back the old app! Crashes...harder to navigate...HATE the new font!!!  I have already opened an account at a new bank...hope their app is better!
BBVA,Finance,4, The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it won't let me transfer money to a external account. It says I have to use a computer. But other than that I love it
BBVA,Finance,1,"Can't even use it! I enter the correct information and it tells me ""Please verify username and password"" I can't even reset my password in case I did enter it wrongly because it says ""Security information required"" after entering my account number"
BBVA,Finance,1,"Fix the mobile deposit This feature worked great on the old app. The new version will not read the check even if I take crystal clear pictures, frustrating"
BBVA,Finance,2,Harder to read I don't like this update. It is harder to read with the font style. Everything seems jumbled up. Not happy with it at all.
BBVA,Finance,2,Deposits It would not let me deposit it to my account only gave me my business account and shows my personal account as a savings account. On top of that tried to deposit at drive up and nether machine could read my State of Alabama check. Flustrating
BBVA,Finance,1,This app stinks Gives me more problems logging in lately than ever before and nothing works
BBVA,Finance,1,Always crash on startup App always crashes on startup And I have to open it 3 or 4 times before I can get to page with all my accounts.

BBVA,Finance,1,Crashes It never works. Whenever I try to transfer money an error message pops up.
BBVA,Finance,2, The update doesn't show you who the transaction is from so now you have to log in at a desktop or laptop
BBVA,Finance,4,Love it Nicer app. Easier.  My only dislike is that it doesn't separate pending from posted.
BBVA,Finance,5,"Great app Great app, love the new upgrade"
BBVA,Finance,1, Not good at all
BBVA,Finance,3,"Not well tested... premature release Subscriber does not exist error, mobile banking error please call number missing... font is huge in account details compared to the old version.. makes scolling more tedious.  Really?!"

Some things are better: look and feel of UI is better, ""I want to.."" menu is easy, account activity seamless. Viewing a real-time statement is wonderful, as well as history of various transactions. That's where it stops. They want us to use this app, why not make it useable?"
BBVA,Finance,1,The bank is just bad in general/the app always crashed or was down Was charged up too 300$ for a banking error on their half and even after getting them too waive 2 of the fees they gave us another one the next morning anyways. We closed the account and now happily bank with Capitol One.
BBVA,Finance,1,"Worst bank app ever. 75% of the time mobile transfers fail...but here is the kicker,the app shows that it is successful, but you have to wait about three days to find out that it didnt go through. Total junk.  Try Simple.  They do all the same stuff but no fees. This bank has a fee for everything."
BBVA,Finance,1," Too many issues to list. Ever since the mandatory update, the app and experience is terrible. Assuming am allowed to login, which is 50/50 at best.   Just have to decide which bank am going to move to. It's that bad."
BBVA,Finance,1,They stole 76$ overdraft fee from me Refused to refund when I call the branch. And  btw i have signed TO  HAVE  OVERDRAFT FEE PROTECTION PROGRAM WHEN CREATING THE ACCOUNT. But now they are telling me it excludes online purchases!!   Totally unfair! Don't trust this bank! I paid and closed the account...
BBVA,Finance,1,Uninstalled immediately This app requires my password to be less than 12 characters. It's already bad enough I can't use special characters in my BBVA password. I didn't get past the login screen before uninstalling.

BBVA,Finance,5, Why couldn't you just update the old app? Kinda feels like there were some security issues they didn't tell us about. Think it may be time to switch banks again...
BBVA,Finance,1, Terrible UI and terrible interactivity. When recovering account info it becomes useless. When working with multiple accounts it becomes useless. I have seen better coding in 3rd world countries written in charcoal. Disgraceful.

When i log on ...it tells me that there's maintenance being done.  I log on through the main website and it goes through.  I don't lime it...wish it would get fixed
BBVA,Finance,1,Why make it worse? Only point of new version is to collect your personal info including contacts. It has less functionality than before. Not worth it.
BBVA,Finance,1," For those who arent able to accept the terms and conditions download the bbva wallet app. It appears to be the same thing. The only ""problem"" i have with it is that it makes you sign in again whenever you reopen the app. I suppose its for security reasons. Hope this helps(ed)"
BBVA,Finance,1,Negative stars! I should've expected as much from the bank that'll screw ya every chance they get. Amazing that places like this can stay in business! Save yourself the headaches and get USAA - you've been warned.

BBVA,Finance,1,Old one was good This is horrible.   Forced me into new one.  No way to manage repeating monthly payments.   Revisions are supposed to be an improvement.   This is awful.
BBVA,Finance,1,"This modification SUCKS. I used to be able to make a simple transfer, now it takes twice as long and twicecas many steps.  If your IT guys need work so bad that yhey havd to find ways makeing tour customers life worse, perhaps you have too many of them.  CHANGE IT BACK."
BBVA,Finance,4, Very Useful. Idk what these other bad reviews  are about but you don't  have to be Einstein  to use this app however you do have to be illiterate.
BBVA,Finance,1,Will not load Very frustrated with this. It will not load even after uninstalling old one.
BBVA,Finance,1,Like the old version better I hate that if I forget to log off the session doesn't expire and log me off. It's more difficult to navigate..like the old version better!!! Uninstalled
BBVA,Finance,1,Does not work! Please fix your app. A customer should not have to keep calling just to check balance! And customer service is not open on weekends. Very disappointing!!!

BBVA,Finance,1,"Worlds of NOPE I'm NEVER downloading this app again. It was a waste of time, energy, & life... I'll stick to driving to the closest location, which isn't all too close mind you. That is how much I hate this app."
BBVA,Finance,3, Does not show the current balance under the transaction. It did like a few days ago then all the sudden it stops. Probably trying to trick me and public into getting nsf fees
BBVA,Finance,2,Verify I had already verified all my information from my password to my login username and the app decided to lock me out this is extremely annoying and I would like for it to be fixed
BBVA,Finance,1, update: instead of crashing when I deposit checks I am unable to login now... the app is useless if it does not perform the first most basic function.

Btw 1 overdraft fee=38$ and they charged me 2x within minutes! They also scheduled to close my account without warning or no reason or anything! UNTRUSTED! I closed my bank account asap after withdrawal!

BBVA,Finance,1,Update horrible The update is horrible. I can't get it to load no matter what kind of signal i have...

BBVA,Finance,2, Poor because lock my account and i feel so hungry whit these stupid thinks
BBVA,Finance,3," It's okay I guess, really haven't had it long enough to know but so far it's been a helper, I'll update my review in a month and give it a satisfaction or unsatisfied rating."

Benihana,Food & Drink,5," I went to Benihana FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME last year!!!! I haven't been to a Japanese restaurant before, it was my Aunt's birthday. I ate sushi food and drink, and I loved it. Maybe I can come back EVEN MORE!!!!🔥💥🔥💞💞💞💞💞💞👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤗😊♥️♥️♥️♥️"
Benihana,Food & Drink,1, bad rating due to restaurant giving me an incomplete order on my first visit. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER WHEN YOU PICK UP.

to add the mustard sauce as an option to pick from as it is not there... it 
would be nice to have a note section to leave a personal note to the chief, 
such as temperature of meat or food allergy."
Benihana,Food & Drink,1, Doesn't even recognize the Benihana in Honolulu. Says it doesn't exist. That sucks.
Benihana,Food & Drink,3," Would be nice if it had the options you have when ordering to go in person. Would also be nice if you could enter gift card information for payment, it would prevent me from having to actually wait there in person. Makes the app worthless."

I did everything right,  I had the right location, I had an order number and everything.   One of the employees even told the manager that this happened a couple days before as well.   I'm not sure where our order went but,  they asked us to click on the button at the bottom of the screen showing our order that said place this order again.  Then it worked.   So then they had our order and we waited for our food."

Burgerville,Lifestyle,1, Worthless. Menu not even current. Uninstalling.
Burgerville,Lifestyle,1," I am very disappointed that online ordering is no longer available. It made ordering and pickup so easy for my family. All locations that I researched, which is a large area, no longer offers online ordering."
Burgerville,Lifestyle,1, Awful app. Steals your money and the store doesn't even get the order.
Burgerville,Lifestyle,4, Works great!
Burgerville,Lifestyle,5, Very convenient
Burgerville,Lifestyle,2, This app doesn't show which locations actually do take online orders. How can 1 proceed then..?

CA Mobile,Finance,2," Em geral funciona, mas o facto de não fazer logout automaticamente quando mudamos para outra aplicação é mutio mau.. O logout deveria ser imediato como está implementado em qualuquer outra aplicação bancária (incluindo o MBWay)."

CA Mobile,Finance,5, Otimo e funcional
CA Mobile,Finance,2,Impossível usar para quem tem password alfanumérica O único teclado disponível na fase de autenticação (password) e numérico.  Como a minha password e alfanumérica (mais segura) e impossível fazer o login... pfff...
CA Mobile,Finance,5,5 estrelas Funciona na perfeição sem falhas. Falta a opção tap & pay quer para ios quer para Android.
CA Mobile,Finance,5,Great app .
CA Mobile,Finance,5,"Great app This is very easy to use once set up! It would be even better if you could add a frequent transaction option, but still very good."
CA Mobile,Finance,3,Da jeito mas os limites de valores são demasiado restritos. Falta poder fazer download dos documentos e poder fazer transferências bancárias  normais.

Segundo quando aparece o ecrã para introduzir a chave de 12 dígitos só me permite introduzir caracteres numéricos e não alfa numéricos... não sei se por culpa do meu LG Optimus Black ou da concepção do software que induz o método de introdução em erro como código numérico e a minha chave de 12 dígitos é alfanumérica... ou seja nada feito... não me serve para nada!
CA Mobile,Finance,5,Muito bom! Aplicação com performance excelente e fácil de utilizar.

California Fish Grill,Food & Drink,5," Newborn app so not a lot of bells and whistles! Easily understandable for leaving a complaint or compliment! I haven't tried ordering from the app yet.

The text overlaps and the UX again is just bad.
Captio - Expense Reports,Finance,1, For a tool that has a very limited scope (capturing expenses) you'd think it would at least be good at that. It isn't.

Cheba Hut Ordering,Lifestyle,5," Super easy to use, everything including tip can be paid with by card.  Makes for a quick dropoff.    One thing though, the ""save card to file"" option isnt clear.  Does the light dot on the left mean yes or is it the dark dot on the right?"

Cold foods, like cold sandwiches & salads taken to go are not supposed to be taxed. Ordering through the app, it charges taxes on these cold items, yet ordering in-store, not taxed. Unless you dine in, then you are charged a dine in tax. So why is everything in this app charged with taxes on each & every item? I pay less by ordering in-store than by using the app.There are no rewards, no incentives."
Corner Bakery Cafe,Food & Drink,1, App continues to close when attempting top place order. It's been like this for couple months. Please fix.
Corner Bakery Cafe,Food & Drink,4, I wish there was an option in the salad section to substitute a different kind of lettuce for what's normally the base lettuce. Example: if something comes with spring mix I would like to substitute romaine for it.
Corner Bakery Cafe,Food & Drink,3, Attempted to check out a 2-from-4 special but the app doesn't accept 3 digits as a code.
Corner Bakery Cafe,Food & Drink,1, thought this app would allow me to load gift cards on it and keep as a balance to pay at store without having to carry all the cards in my wallet. take a lesson from starbucks.

Down to Earth Deli,Lifestyle,5, I have never had issues with the app. They have even started including the seasonal grill items. Makes ordering from the grill easy.

Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Useless Wouldn't scan my last 2 receipts and emailing is pointless cause they won't respond. It's all a trick to get you to buy more then stops working when you get to your last punch. THIS APP IS A SCAM AND I'LL NEVER GET EARL AGAIN UNTIL THEY FIX IT.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Can't download. Error 505 Had the app and it updated and now I can't download it. Says error 505. Tried from my wife's phone and same thing.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1," Really?  You won't accept a bar code that is only 4 days old?  ... and I dared returned to your store and when I scanned the barcode at the bottom of the receipt, it tells me that the barcode is invalid!

You won't accept a bar code that is only 4 days old?  ... and I dared returned to your store and when I scanned the barcode at the bottom of the receipt, it tells me that the barcode is invalid!  The app then asks me if I want assistance.  All that does it create an email so I can report the bug."
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,"Still broken They get my name wrong in an email, and have yet to ""fix"" the problem. Been close to a month. Need some help solving your issues?"
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Missing Locations Neither of the locations on Disney property or in Las Vegas appears on the location map. I tried scanning receipts and they didn't recognize them.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Always broken Android and iOS7 One day I just might be able to redeem a free sandwich I earned. Horrible Support!
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,"No Punch I visit their Anaheim store often. It didn't even show on their map, therefore it's not a participating store. If you use the business name then follow the business model. The whole participating store thing is a sham."
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Always says invalid barcode Always says invalid barcode even when manually typing.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,5,Yes! Hurrah! on my way to free sandwich.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,4,Cool app Nice but need more locations in Houston
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,5,Easy to navigate.... Hope it gets connected to ordering.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,2,"Barcodes don't work. Every time I try to scan a barcode, it says it's invalid, forcing me to go to the website to punch! Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help at all."
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1, Rarely ever works.  Every time I try and punch a receipt the app closes.  Not work the effort	Doesn't work
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,5,Simple Quickly scans the barcode on the bottom of the receipt and links to Facebook for a free punch!
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1, After a recent app update I lost all my punches. It wont let me log in and just says app is unable to fetch data
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Lost of punches I lost all 4 punches I had when you had your last updates and would like them back please.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,2,"Good... When it works Half the time the app doesn't work, so you can't redeem barcodes. Contacted tech support multiple times and my only fix was reset of phone..."
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Subpar App says I must be at location to scan punches when I am standing right at the register at the store. Constant issues and way to many updates.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,5, Best subs
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,"Unfair If you scan receipts in one go, it treats them all as one visit, and invalidates them, never to be used again. Even though the dates on the receipts are different."
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,5,Really cool Being Earl of sandwich's fan this app made me feel over the moon. i already got free rewards and through this app i am updated about all the changes and offers which are given by Earl of sandwich. I am looking forward for more free rewards and offers of Earl of sandwich.
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,3, Its ok the last thing i would like to see is being able to access your coupons when ordering online i had a cast member coupon code that wouldnt apply when ordering
Earl of Sandwich,Food & Drink,1,Can't load it Can't get the app to load at all

Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,5," I used Fareboom for international trip including multiple stops, I loved it. I didn't have to use any airline app or website; all info I needed was in Fareboom App, with real time notification about flight status, gate assignments, etc. I will definitely use it again."
Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,3, Not the best prices actually...I still use expedia as well.
Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,5, Great with notifications and rates. The only bad thing is the pack of 24/7 assistance When running an International travel agency this is a must.
Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,5," Best experience ever, information updates automatically and let's me know right away what ever changes! Awesome price, easy app to use!"

Finally you'll be charged lot more (after you authorize the payment) + you'll be charged additional payment from Fareboom. Note that all the money you'll pay will be in US dollars. All you'll finally will pay you'll find down after the money are taken from your bank account and there is absolutely nothing you can do about that. As well your flight may be changed without notice.

Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,4," Easy to book. Only issue is to call helpdesk to verify payment. Need to call IDD and waited for 10mins till your call is picked up.

Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,5, Excellent services enjoying it

They apologised but I did miss my flight ) Never had to pay extra to fareboomto get rerouted. I was skeptical at first but they sorted it all out in a matter of minutes not hours. I had a horrible trip but none of it was due to Fareboom. Outbound flight cancelled due to weather on the east coast. They rerouted me through Canada and made my following connection. Return trip United screwed up my first leg, had to spend an extra night in lillongwe. Fareboom got me on a flight the next day and I arrived 10 hours later than scheduled despite leaving 24 hours later than scheduled."

Fareboom Discount Flights,Travel & Local,4," There are basic functions to this app, and it does well with them; but the app can use a wide arrary of features."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Won't let me login. Says email or password is wrong, but I can login on a computer. 1 star until fixed."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," While the app allows customization of burgers, I feel like the fries are left out. Personally, I love well done fries, but in this case it's not an option. Nor is a option to ask for condiments"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," The CC scanner didn't work for me. Not that big a deal, though."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Easy, no fluff, worked great."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, This app is horrible you should be embarrassed you can't even do anything everything you put in the app keeps crashing tells you to try again later literally it's worthless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Quick and simple
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Simple app, perfect!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, This app needs comments section.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I have a friend who works for 5 Guys. I've never had their food before, so I decided to give them a try. I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger and regular fry.

I've never had their food before, so I decided to give them a try. I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger and regular fry. I'm in LOVE with their food! Their homemade fries reminded me of my Dad's growing up as a kid. My burger melted in my mouth. I'm drooling just writing about it LOL I highly recommend 5 Guys Burgers and Fries. Thank you for making my dinner yesterday, you're very much appreciated!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Cant apply a gift card and pay the remaining balance with a credit card. And once the gift card was applied, I wasn't able to use it in the store. Not rocket science to set this up. Look at any other app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Works well, would be nice to be able to notify on app when getting curb side."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Used to work fine, but now no matter what credit card I use I receive an error stating that my billing address was incorrect, so the order doesn't go through. Meanwhile, I get a spending alert that my credit card was just charged the full amount."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Everything was great except it wouldn't let me apply a small gift card balance towards my bill that didn't have enough funds to cover the entire bill. I now have 2 gifts cards with a little money on each.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, This app doesn't allow you to order. When you submit your payment it doesn't accept it. Then later it charges your card numerous times without ever submitting your order to the selected location. If you use this app make sure you check your bank account.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Error message preventing me from using the app. ""There was an error processing your request. Please try again later."""
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Unable to place my pickup order now. They've removed the ability to order a fountain drink.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Seems like a good app, but there is no way to add textual details to customize your order like to ask for light salt on the fries or two bottom buns due to a sesame seed aversion. There are options for no bun, but that's not what I want. Unfortunately that's a deal-breaker for me."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Love the app & the ease of ordering ahead of time. My only issue is that there seems to be no rewards program which every other place offers. I was under the impression that there was with app use guess five guys hasn't quite caught up yet.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is really fun and I've enjoyed playing all the different scratchers.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, non-operational. i think i was able to successfully order one (maybe two times) out of a dozen attempts. usually the order ends in some error and after 3 errors you are stuck with an error that said you tried to order too many times. but i guess its a good menu...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, It's a great app but you can't order milkshakes on here you also can't tell them to make the fries before you get there since you have to drive 10 minutes to get to them. An area for special instructions would be nice.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," This app sucks. The moment you sign in, your giving a choice to order pick up only never showing the deals or specials. They don't even honor veterans day!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Ordering was easy, but at the end of the process, i was told the order ""could not be placed at this time"", no reason given. Bad credit card entry?

Bad credit card entry? Network problem? Problem with my specific restaurant's location? So i have no idea whether the problem is temporary or if i should expect it to work in a future attempt Why should i keep it installed?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, I shouldn't have to scan my card everytime I order. Annoying
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Found one key thing that kills it for me. Can't split-pay. This means I can't use my gift card unless I want to buy stuff worth less than what's on the card. I can't use the entire balance then pay the rest on my debit/credit card. Please fix.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Everytime I order through the app, my order is never ready in the time frame that it gives me.

I have waited 30-45 minutes past the time it was supposed to be ready. Makes the app completely useless. Also you cannot customize orders. We like our fries extra crispy, but theres no way to communicate that."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," App's very good - if you can use it. Worked great on my Moto X with Android 7, but not compatible with Moto G6 with Android 9"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Terrible time estimates. I usually add 2 to 3 times the estimated time for food pickup. App works great othet than timr estimate which isnt even close to accurate.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Easy to use. Can easily customize my order. Saves me time so my meal is ready each time I get there. Could not eat there and finish during my lunch break without it. Thanks!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Uninspired waste of a download. No discounts or insentives for downloading. No heart.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I tried to order some food with this app, the app told my the order could not be placed but charged my card 3 time. Now it's taking several days and a lot of phone calls and I still haven't gotten the $45 back.. don't use this app"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," APP ORDERS ARE NEVER READY WHEN YOU GO TO PICK IT UP. Either the app sucks, or you wierd burger making does. 6 times I habe ordered using the app and its never been ready. They wont start it until you get there and ask for it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," app doesn't work anymore, period. nothing but errors on everything that u tap on"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," I don't understand why they wait to drop the fries everytime you order from the app, I order to be in and out not wait the time it takes to make the burger. I call ahead usually but sometimes they don't answer. They should make it a button when you check out."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Tried to place an order but the app would not accept ccard payment. Checked ccard info several times. Five Guys app is totally useless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," With location service turned on it will show nearest location to be the next town over, happened multiple times on pixel 3 xl running stock android (duh)"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Horrible app, won't even start correctly"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Can't pay with amex. Can't pay with cash. App fails....
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," All in all great app. One little niggle is it always gives estimated time of 7 minutes, regardless of current orders."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, best burger in town app works awesome when you click regular or lite or extra they actually do what u say every time I have used the app they got it right it deserves a 6 *
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I strongly discourage anyone from using the app. It told me the closest store was 10 minutes away, I went ahead and ordered from that store, I then followed the gps link in the app that took me to a place that did not exist.

I then called the store to find out where they were and they were 30 minutes away from me. I have no complaints with the food itself"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, What kind of idiot developer doesn't understand that there needs to be a way to split payments or else people won't be able to use their gift cards when the balance gets small? How infuriating.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Tried to order but said the store was closed and it wasn't. App doesn't work if you don't update the info properly
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, when making a order the app gets stuck at 1 location and will not update your location
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Not a very well made app. They keep marking my order as complete and I still end up waiting 30+ minutes before it is really ready. What's the point in having an order status if it is always wrong.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, never works. always get error at last step.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Very minimal app with no nutrition facts or rewards.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Keeps crashing. The order may or may not go thru. Go shop elsewhere.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Placed order and did not receive all items ordered. They did not provide refund.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, App keeps crashing any won't let me place an order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, I clicked on the 5 Guys that was 2 miles from me and ordered. The app sent to the wrong 5 Guys and I couldn't cancel the order. I had to drive 13 miles away. Why would the app do that? It should automatically default to the one closest to you. It couldn't even send me to the 5 Guys that I chose.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Said that I wasn't connected to the internet and wouldn't let me review my order. I find it easier to just go to the website and order there. Its quicker and works better than the app itself.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Five Guys are one of the best burger I have ever eaten.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Kept crashing for no reason
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, online order was easy but the pick up process was not fast.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, credit card not supported at this location is not my problem
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Their ordering system must be down. Couldn't place an order after trying three times on both the app and their site, with a different obscure error message each time. Five Guys definitely needs to invest in QA and stop faking reviews."

I had to wait through the lunch rush even though I ordered on the app. ... Not doing that again, that's for sure. In fact people that order AFTER me in the restaurant got their orders before I did. ABSOLUTELY REDICULOUS. Get it together!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, this app is horrible... put in my zip code and the location it gave me said it was 4 miles away turned out to be 7 milea away by the time i got there the burgers were cold the fries were soggy. I have never been let down by five guys the way i was lwt down tonight...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, need option to edit and delete credit card info
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Excellent app for an amazing burger joint.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," does the basic job. not flexible to manage favorites, billing prefs or other things without placing an order"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Staff at the restaurant is always happy to accommodate my wife's gluten free requirements, but theres no way to communicate that in the app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Non stop please try again later
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," This app is absolute garbage and Five Guys online presence is deplorable.

The whole point is to kick your order over to door dash, so save a step and go through doordash's app if you're so inclined. Also be aware that doordash does a poor job of communicating with restaurants as to what's actually available, so what you order may not be an option."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Works fine for me.. Not sure why so many negative reviews..
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, The app offers no perks. At least their competition offers a frequent buyer program.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Me and my girl ate here and got so sick from food . Would have went to hospital if I had health insurance. And the app sucks too.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, changed my default location elsewhere... and i cant pickup where I am. defeats the whole purpose of the app...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," No option to pay on site. Also, the whole point of ordering ahead is to have your food ready when you arrive. They don't actually make your fries or shakes until you show up. Completely defeating the point."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, There's no way to input or state gluten allergy in a note for pickup orders placed thru app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great food, wonderful staff"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love being able to order and pay on the app and then just pick up my food.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Every time I use the app it takes over a half hour to get my food. They know how to take orders, but the people on the stores don't know what to do with them. The whole thing is a terrible experience."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great App easy to use
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, they should add on the app a way to earn rewards
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Payments option doesn't work
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Fairgrounds location in Brandon is the best location. Kierra is amazing

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, App doesn't work. Pretty useless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Failing during the COVID pandemic. Order wasn't delivered after waiting an hour. Called. Was told that they don't deliver because there's no dispatch. They hadn't even started our order yet. Lied about leaving a voicemail. So sad.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, No coupon discounts
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, what's the point of ordering and paying through the app if they dont start the order until you arrive. this has happened 3 times now
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," horrible service. I was told my food was delivered, it never was. I was told to call the location, they did not pick up. I was told to call customer service, they did nothing. I srill haven't recieved my order or a refund, absolutely ridiculous."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, whats the point of placing orders through the app if the fries are not cooked until you arrive there. I'd prefer if the food was ready when i arrive.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, are you satisfied with the choices that I pick out I pick up my choices no bread I get my items I get all the way home and it's the wrong thing he didn't even look at that order slip. so buyers beware buyers
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Unable to order extra bacon on my burger from this app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I love 5 Guys...great burgers anyway you want them. Make you always want to come back, especially International Drive store."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Dont bother with the app. You get horrible service ordering ahead.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, What is the point of ordering online if you don't make it until I walk in? I want it ready and waiting for me.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Worst food order ever. Took 1.5 hours for a burger. Total BS. Use their competitors

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, no coupons etc
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Gets the job done for online orders, but could still use some QoL improvements. Intead of going up to the counter to say im there, it would be nice if I could just tap an ""I'm here"" button in the app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, App shuts down as soon as I tap on anything.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Amazing
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, great taste
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great app, awesome features. Needs third party, mobile payment integration. Don't like entering card every time, don't want you to store it on file."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Why don't you take credit or debit cards?! WHO PAYS FOR DELIVERY WITH A GIFT CARD?!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, easy!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, mm
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," This used to be much better. Animations and UI are good, but it doesn't allow credit card payments any longer. I can skip the line, but then I have to pay in store, which makes it like I'm cutting because they don't have a register dedicated for online orders."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Easy to use, saves favorite orders and payment types. Would like to be able to update credit card on file without placing an order, no option to do that currently. Not app related but prices are going up a lot in my area so I find myself buying here less."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, 💕💕
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," This app has incorrect information about which stores use the app, and encouraged me to try again, charging me for my order twice, but not providing me the food I ordered. call the store directly and don't waste your time or money with this app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," We ordered ahead of time to pick it up and when we showed up to pick it up, 
they hadn't even started making it yet, even though the app told us it'd be 
ready by a certain time. Might as well just order in person."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Such a crisp layout. Never in my life bothered reviewing an app until now. 
10/10 just like the food please le t I'd pay with cash at the store !!!!!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," This is a useless app, they don't prepare your food until you get the 
restaurant anyway. Five Guys just gets paid in advance. Don't bother."

I will never visit another Five Guys and have been sharing with everyone I 
know to avoid it at all costs. Horrible app and service!"

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," It is a great fast ordering app for pickup orders. Mind, the restaurant 
will not cook your order until you arrive. It is a great way to get a hot 
meal to go."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Used to love it but it now says they have no fountain drinks only bottles 
and this is FALSE."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," No deals, no pictures, no nothing. Worthless app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Handy, well designed ordering app, but chews through battery like it's going out of style"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Good burgers bad app easier just to walk in and order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is so simple that anyone could use it... I LOVE it!!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, CHEDDAR SWISS MOZZARELLA Try using real cheese instead of the fake and I may stop going to Smashburger
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Easy to use. Great to order ahead.

Like ordering before I get to the store and having the food already made thus not having to wait. I assume this because other burger apps do this. This is not the case with five guys.   Thanks to a policy of not making the fries until you are in the store, you have to wait no matter what.  Don't use the app? You're going to wait. Use the app? You're going to wait. While you may wait marginally less time using the app, to me it's splitting hairs.   I really don't see the point of this app thanks the to the ""Fresh fries"" policy. Odd that they would let the burgers loiter in a bag but not the fries.  It is Five Guys Burgers right? Not Five Guys Fries? Oh well off to delete this app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Absolutely useless. Online ordering has been temporarily unavailable for 
over 6 months now."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," I use the app all the time and it is good. Yet there is no way to cancel an

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," I love the food and being able to order while I'm still at work. There is one issue with them having a different order number in the store than the online order confirmation  has. They have your name on it, but call out the number - a number you don't know."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," The whole point of using this app is ordering ahead so your food is ready at your designated pick up time.

They don't drop the fries until you get there, and in my case I waited 20 minutes longer because they never cooked the fries and just forgot about me. People who technically ordered after me were getting their complete order and leaving. This seems to be a trend with this app. In their defense they did try to make it right by offering free food. Still irritating."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," The stores have a policy of not making your fries until you arrive, to ensure freshness.  This is a quality measure no doubt, however defeating the time savings by the mobile ordering.  It would be nice if the app had an option to make my fries NOW or WHEN I ARRIVE5"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Have to wait to have fries cooked every time, what's the point of app and 
speed when have to wait 5 minutes for fries. Understand freshness but user 
can accept being on time or if late on cold french fries. Anyway Five Guys 
has good burgers and fries."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," The app does exactly what it should. No extra screens, no fluff, no ads. 
Login, order, pay and go. Very convenient and very easy. Only 4 stars 
instead of 5 because it does not allow you to place your order then pay in 
cash when you pick it up."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," The app is pointless! Maybe it's just the location I go to, but I STILL 
have to wait in line despite already ordering. Then I have to wait even 
longer for the fries to come out. What's the point of ordering on here if I 
can't skip the line???"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," The food is fantastic. The app, while it works, is pointless since they 
don't make the food until you check in at the register. Why bother ordering 
ahead of you have to wait anyway?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I love this app. Easy to use. Pay in the app. You can save your orders for 
fast re-orders. The fries and shakes are served fresh made, AFTER you 
arrive for pick up! 🍔❤️ Ideal for people that travel, find 5Guys 
ANYWHERE!!!!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Great app!  Love the way they treat you special when you order online and pick it up! Just wish they would let you add items on the side... or extra bacon.   But they'll always hook you up when you get there!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Pointless! I ordered ahead with this app, and they wouldn't ""drop the fries"" (which is all I ordered) until I showed up."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Went through the entire process of selecting store/food/ingredients/name/telephone number/e-mail address/credit card info.  At the end, it finally says the store is not taking online orders.  Waste of time."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, The great thing about Five Guys is they have food on the menu that our son with food allergies can eat! And we love the app feature of ordering ahead and having it waiting for him!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Not a bad app but I wasn't able to use the remaining balance on my gift card when it wasn't enough to cover the order. Add the option to add a second forn of payment for 5 stars.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Good app, in that it saves your recent orders-but retarded in that you have 
to enter some password to reorder...a password you can't create because 
""there is already an account under this email address."" Nonsensical 
dumbness...."

Having an option to allow me to include a note stating that my choice of a bowl is not due to an allergy would be helpful. On a couple occasions, this has led to me having to wait for my food pickup when I have arrived."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I love the food, they get 5 stars.... only bad thing is I'm having issues 
ordering fountain drinks and can't order shakes from the app...."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great App! Super easy to use, accurate to menu and let's you save favorite orders. Have one for all the combinations in the family! Used to wait for food, now I order in advance!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, App is great. Needs notes section for requests like heavy/light salt or condiments and MUST HAVE OPTION FOR EXTRA BACON
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Excellent UI. Makes ordering burgers and fries very easy to do. You should give your app developers a raise or at least a bonus. Maybe a few extra burgers.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Makes ordering our burgers with same favorite toppings so easy! I like mine loaded and have decided upon the perfect combination of toppings I don't have to remember and repeat!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," This is just about the best,  easiest,  cleanest ordering app i have ever used.  I downloaded it and was done ordering 3 burgers in less than 5 minutes.  Wow!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Can't seem to get app to work on Android. The old one did just fine, this one sucks. Bring back old be one."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Killer customer service and one of the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure of eating! And don't even get me started on the mounds of fries you recieve! 😍
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Its nice to order ahead of time. But I sat in the restaurant for 10 minutes only to find my food was ready the whole time. They didn't bother mentioning it was finished.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Store was closed for technical difficulties but acted not notify me. And I see it was charged on my credit card
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," It no longer allows me to pay for my order. The stores are ALWAYS too cold 
but the food and service are super awesome so I endure the crummy app and 
cold store conditions"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love the food! Always cooked to order. The staff is always prompt about greeting you when you walk into the establishment. Glad I discovered this place.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Won't scan or save my credit card but it's a great ordering app anyway!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Same as all the other complaints. Had to wait twenty minutes after I got to 
the store to get my order. What the purpose of the app?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Love the ease of the app, but I think a Note section would be helpful.  Either that or a checkbox for extra bacon.  :)"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," App charged my account twice after an error pops up, now have to wait and 
see if these charges drop!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Functionally not great. You can order without password but you need one to retrieve previous orders? No pay in-store option
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Would like to be able to order fries with no salt from the app. I currently 
have to place my fry order as a separate order upon arrival to pick up my 
online order."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app works great! Gives you a lot of choices that are not available from just taking the menu.   The ability to actually make the food per the schedule varies from location to location.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Very easy to use and allows customizing that would be difficult in the store
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Location services is not accurate. Often have to double check since it is wrong location.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, For some reason I cant pay in app anymore which use to be an option. I'd give it 5 stars if I could skip the checkout line by paying in app and go straight to pickup at the store.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Love this app and Five Guys! The app is so easy to use, and your order is always right when you pick it up!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Why can't you pay using it? I had to wait in a long ass line to pay when I 
could have just paid online got my food and walked out. Very inconvenient."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Not accurate at all. Food doesn't even get started until after it's already supposed to be done. Asap means as slow as possible to them.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, I would like to see notes or being able to customize fry order.  Like the fries with little to no salt.  Have to tell them when I get to the store.  Otherwise great app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, App works. 5 Guys stingy with the fries once your a regular
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Tried to place an order and it denied both of my credit cards cause it said the billing zip code was wrong, it's not. And surprisingly my card worked at another restaurant that asked for the same card info and ZIP CODE!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Awesomesauce. Easy ordering, saves my faves, can make my food ready now or wait and keep it fresh for later AND gives me an ETA. Bam😎"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This is how an order app should work. Quickly and without having to give every bit of information about myself 10* app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," It takes WAY too long for new locations to be updated. 10 days and waiting 
on the new location by me, yet all advertising and signage says I can order 
online."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," There is no option to pay when I arrive,  which is extremely annoying and bothersome"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Took forever to get order and is way under staffed!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Did have order ready when it said completed and order incorrect.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great food. Great service. Great convenience.  We always use the order ahead option, and we love that they don't drop your fries until you arrive."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Great app but no section to add notes. All I want is to order some extra 
bacon sometimes and there was no option. But there was an option for extra 
cheese..."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Can't justify paying more for burgers elsewhere.  Beef is fresh, ingredients are fresh, and management gets it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Brian, at the Manchester, CT location was downright fantastic!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Super easy to use the app!! By far one of my favorites and convienent!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Only thing missing is an extra bacon option.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Place your order via this app, and in minutes your order will be waiting 
for you. Five Guys is the BEST burger around, and this app makes it easy 
for on-the-go."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I thought the point of ordering online or through an app was so it was ready the time specified. Not watch 10 plus customers come in and order at counter and get there before you.  Finally approached someone when my order was 10 minutes past...thay was 10 minutes ago, still waiting."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," unable to order from it, this app useless"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Very convenient and comprehensive app. Able to customize accurately what you want. But the predicted completion time is way off during peak times.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, The app saves a lot of standing in line time. So much easier to order on line and pick it up. Awesome app and very easy to use and understand.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is so easy to use. In less than a minute you can have an order submitted and ready for you to pick up.

arrived a few minutes after our pick-up time to find almost every employee 
outside on a ""break"". When we walked inside no one went to wash their 
hands, no one had bothered to see our printed order ticket either. They all 
acted like it was no big deal and since I'd already paid, they wanted us to 
wait. Then we were told they couldn't reverse the charge. The Maize Rd. 
location always rocks it though! They are unfortunately affiliated with the 
jerks on Rock rd."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app was much easier than the last one. Thanks for the update.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, I love the ease of ordering from the app. It's so convenient to place your order and pick up in store!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love the food! The app makes ordering on the go so easy! Make a favorite and it's almost 1 click ordering for your standard favorite!

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love it! Easy one touch ordering with my favorites to my nearest location!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Very easy to use.  Allows you to save the order detail for easy reorder.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love tbis place wizh they had a rewards/points program tbey are s lil pricey

great. Have a customer for life. Thanks five guys"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, My order wasn't even at the store 10 minutes after the app said it would be ready. Not ready for prime time.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Easy to use. Super easy to navigate. My favorite part is that it stores your previous orders so I don't have to enter each item every time we order from here. We order the same thing every time any how so just 2 clicks n dinners ordered.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Only improvement I could suggest is that my store in Lebanon, PA doesn't have an option for milkshakes yet but they serve them. Not sure if milkshakes aren't available for online order at any store but if they were that'd be great! Food is great"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Sadly, my food is ready but now it's cold. Really doesn't help to order via the app when they don't have a quick way to pay, or three shake ready when you get there. So now I get to enjoy my cold hitfog. Nevermind. B"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," It's already paid for, so I just run in with a $1 tip. My burger is always hot, fresh, and ready to go! The guys at Elmwood recognize me now, because I always order the same thing. (The trick is to never order fries or a drink. You don't need the carbs, and water is healthier too!)"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Great app, you can pay with it, only gripes are that there are no special instructions and that they don't have the fries ready with your order. Also they should have more specific times than 15 minute intervals"

I'm just trying to figure out the exact amount my lunch will be after tax before I commit to it.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, This app got much better now that it supports ordering breakfast. Finding a store is still annoying if you're trying to find one near work but you are far away from there when searching.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, I have to put my card number in each time I order even though I choose the option  to keep the card on file. The card scanner does nothing. I have to enter card info in manually. App worked better 2 versions ago.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," First time ordering a burger from here, cause a friend suggested it. I used the app. Went in, waited for my fries, they were having trouble making for some reason. Got home, burger was not what I ordered. I ordered a hamburger with all the fixin's... I got some soggy (too soggy to eat, bread) double...Full ReviewFirst time ordering a burger from here, cause a friend suggested it. I used the app. Went in, waited for my fries, they were having trouble making for some reason. Got home, burger was not what I ordered. I ordered a hamburger with all the fixin's... I got some soggy (too soggy to eat, bread) double patty burger with nothing but jalapenos, pickles, tomatoes, mayo (I think)... yeah. Just sucked. Terrible first experience. This happen to anybody else? I mean, for that price... it should be flawless. We're not in LA afterall... just Baytown. C'mon y'all! Disappointing."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," When trying to add grilled anything, (onions, mushrooms, green peppers, jalapenos) it says regular is unavailable. You can't add them if you try to change it to lite, or extra either. Fix this and I'll change my review and rating."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," The app does a good job of letting you order, but just sent an order to Norwalk as the ""closest store"" when I was 100ft from the store in Stamford 10 miles away. All location services are on, the app just can't manage itself or warn the user that it's deviating from what is normally done."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Love the app, makes ordering easy for me since I'm Deaf and I don't always want to write my order down, now I can order, customize and pay for my food in the app and just show up at store and grab my food.  Love it!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Super easy to use. Placed my order. Payed for it in-app. Drive to the location and picked up my food. Could not have been any easier process.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Horrible app. Order from one location, it goes to a different location, automatically bill your card so you're stuck. Deleted it after one order"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Easy to use. The only thing missing is gift cards on the app.. Give me a gift card qr code or something
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, It's great to order your food but you still need to go to the order window to tell them your here. I waited for 6 orders after my order to get my food. Might as well go to the register first.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, What happened to being able to pay by app... defeats the whole purpose of ordering ahead of time
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, The app used to be great. Now you have to stand in line to pay instead of paying through the app. Kind of defeats the purpose of using the app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Easy to order, saves your favs to reorder. Only change I would make is card should be universal for any 5 Guys."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Great food, flexible ordering, but the app forgets my info every. frackin. time. Too frustrating!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, I was hoping it would have promotions or coupons like the McDonald's app but it doesn't. Still convenient to order through the app though
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Easy to use, clear info. Able to quickly order and see my order status. Definitely one of the best restaurant apps."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," First time trying it, got a cheeseburger but the cook forgot both cheese and burger patties, got a new one pretty fast but still wasted time walking back, burgers really good."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Be ready to pick it up in 8 minutes and you will have no problem. Nothing better than the interface. Simplicity at its finest. A checklist of the menu with the amount.   5 starz for 5 guyz
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Best burgers in our little town! I'm gonna get fat lol :-D
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Best thing I've downloaded got my food instantly after paying just wish you could pay from app as well
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, I love Five Guys burgers & fries the only thing is its a little expensive but if i could i would eat their burgers & fries all the time
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Order again should give you the option to change to location by default or they should at least let you cancel an order that was just placed.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Paypal promises to protect my money when shopping online. You promise to grill me a burger. I want to pay with paypal, not trust burger jockeys to store my card info on an app. Give me paypal options please."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," This app is AMAZING! I have used it twice so far and will continue to us. I would suggest adding an ""instructions"" section to include how you would like something cooked but other than that, this app is great! Thanks! :)"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," The app works well. It doesn't accept Android Pay! I don't like giving my credit card information to apps, especially with so many companies being hacked these days."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Good app. Easy to use. Wish could select more pickup times then just every 15 minutes.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Doesn't provide quicker service. Could have ordered in store, had it, and been on my way. Boooooo"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, I like it better than before but a check in feature would make it great - like when you're about 5 minutes away. Seamless delivery.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, A simple order app for convenience...  There is nothing to get wrong.  I have a 5 guys in my neighborhood. this app is awesome i order my food walk to the store and it's hot and ready when I get there.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Be careful to verify the store it auto picks for you... I was within sight of the store I wanted and it placed the order 3 miles away 😕
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, THANK YOU FOR BEING THE BEST. WE LOVE FIVE GUYS BURGERS AND FRIES IN RALEIGH N.C BY CAPITAL BLVD
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great app. Makes ordering really fast and simple. Shows closest location and allowed set pick up time
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, The best app ! I was on the way to a long trip and had to make a quick stop to eat something and this was the best idea of  it all ! I was just in time for it when it was ready ! Perfect !
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Took the time to load this app. Placed my pick up order. Arrived only to WAIT. Why did I bpther?!?!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Order on the app and every time I still end up waiting 10+ min after it's supposed to be done!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," The design on this is super slick in Eligent, I really enjoyed using. I love my Five Guys meal even more."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, The app is very easy to use and navigate. I really like being able to save my favorite orders!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," this used to work great, order while I'm walking to my car at work, have my food 10 minutes later when I arrive at my local five guys. Now the app can't find any location near me at all and it's become totally useless."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Super responsive app! All app devs should treat this speed as the gold standard.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Loved this app till it said there was no stores near my location which there obviously is cuz its right down the street....
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is technically the official give guys app (partnered with olo). I had ordered several times and works great!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, They forgot my beacon on my beacon cheeseburger... so I ended up with just a cheeseburger but paid for a beacon cheeseburger.   Too late once you get home!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Delicious! The same every order, my go to Burger place, never fails."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Five Guys is hands down the best burger and fries.  The staff is always fantastic and it NEVER disappoints!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," No point in this app. They started making the food when I got there, so had to wait regardless"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Best burger app available. We eat 5 guys because the app works so well! Flawless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Often sends orders to the wrong store, ""nearest store"" function useless."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, We love 5 guys! This app makes it so easy to order to go!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, My food was supposed to be ready at 442pm. It was not ready until 503pm. I had to wait several minutes when I was hoping to walk in and out with my food. I do like the app though.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love their shakes! Dip your frys in too! Best fry and shake combo around!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, This app is good but it needs to give an option to pay in person at the store
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Pick up was quick and easy! Great way to skip the line and trap your food,"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, It never saves the payment option I've put in multiple times who h is incredibly annoying but other than that it works fine.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Good app, needs a way to input comments/instructions (like ""don't wait to make fries till I arrive"")"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," I like using the app, but it never saves my cc Info even though I select to save on file every time."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Fantastic  no more waiting in line to order, then again to get your food"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," This is a great app, it would be better if I could update my credit card in my profile, rather than at the point of ordering."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Poor communication between the app and the restaurant....
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Pointless app no faster then going in.....
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, There is no way to cancel or edit an order once its sent.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, They really need to add some way to request condiments on the side. Other than that this would be a five star app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Easy peasy to use. Nice they are trying to speed service up
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great app but it needs a no salt option for French fries.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Gift cards are a pain to use on the app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Glitches seem to have been fixed,  working great now"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Best online order app I have used. Let's you pull up an old order modify it and order fast. No glitches.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," So easy to place your order and make it how you want it, definitely recommend if you're on the go!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, App always works and  my food is ready when I arrive

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Easy fast and simple app I had some issue at the beginning  found was my wi-fi interfiere with, turn it off and fast  and easy to place  an order. Never used another app for fast food this one works. Only one thing! Will be better  if they explain what is Cajun fries or regular fries. It will help to know what to order"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, On app does not store credit card info correct. It erases the 0 from the front of #'s and won't process. Liked better before new update. If it won't work it's completely worthless!! way to go five guys stop people from ordering on your app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, The app itself is great. Its easy to use and convenient. Maybe it's just my location but when I go to pick up my order I always have to wait like 15 extra min. That is a lot when your trying to make it on your lunch break.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Made order on app money charged to my bank account. Drove to the location. They didn't get the order. Even with proof they would give my refund or food. Horrible service.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Burger and much more If you haven't tried 5 guys... You're missing out!!! It's incredibly easy to negotiate and order from their site or the app! Fast food @ five stars!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Lives up to the name, now This used to be a clumsy app.  After the recent update, it's a real pleasure to use.  I love Five Guys, and now I love the app -- makes me want to eat more burgers."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I tried to use this app.  When I entered my credit card to pay, it said that my CVV code was invalid.

Which should mean that the payment was not pulled from my account.  I entered the # again, and received the same error.  I was looking and my card, and everything was correct.  I uninstalled the app, re-installed it and tried again, received the same error 3 times.  So 6 times I tried to place my $21.72 order.  Now (4 days later) there is a $130.32 hold on my account for 6 pending orders.  This is causing all kinds of problems now, and should not have happened.  There is not even anyone I can call to try and sort this out!  I will NEVER USE THIS APP again!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Love the food,  love the app! Such a time saver! It couldn't be easier.  The only thing I would like to do is be able to add the tip."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," I love this app, just wish there was an option to notify the restaurant you've arrived. Waiting behind 5+ people in line to verify you've arrived is painful."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Disappointed in the new app. Doesn't allow plan ahead ordering. When you order you better be within 8 minutes of the store. It doesn't allow for later planned pick-up .
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Can't pay with Card? Used to be able to, but with the latest update it doesn't seem to let you pay with your card... At least this was the case for me. There's no option anywhere... Other than that the app has always been great, but they need to add card payment again asap."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Didn't give me a payment option... I placed a large order for coworkers and myself... Every one had their own cards so I had to eat the bill and collect cash... A cash on pick up option would be awesome...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Five Guys Love my local Five Guys! Always nice and personable! One tweak for the app would be to set zip code so you don't have to enter it each time. Also the option to pay in the store would be appreciated. Sometimes someone other than me wants to pay but not have to enter their credit card number in my app...Full ReviewLove my local Five Guys! Always nice and personable! One tweak for the app would be to set zip code so you don't have to enter it each time. Also the option to pay in the store would be appreciated. Sometimes someone other than me wants to pay but not have to enter their credit card number in my app and doesn't want to install the app on their phone.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is the only way I order my food any more.  When I arrive I can take it to go or eat there.  LOVE THIS APP!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Update to the app sucks App worked fine before and you broke it. Said I placed the order but the store didn't get it. Get it together or lose my business.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Obviously the burgers and fries (particularly the amount of them!!) can't be beat. I find the app easy to use. I think they just added the ability to re-order previous orders, which I like because we're creatures of habit. No complaints with the app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"This app really improved, but.. This app improved with the latest upgrade but still lacks some important information such as indicating which are the ""all the way ingredients""."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Waited 15 min once I got to restaurant for my order because the app did not tell me I needed to let restaurant know I was there to begin fixing my fries. App is pointless if I still have to wait for my food once I arrive.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Highly recommended I wish every app work as well as this one! I am a customer of Five Guys and usually order online at home. Was out doing errands, and downloaded the app. Once I signed in it already had all my favorites and information. Made a few adjustments and submitted. No complaints"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Problem I really like the new design, very clean and organized. Awesome food too"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Fast download. Extremely easy to navigate and order. Log into your account if you've ordered online before, and it will show your order history, and you can re order your faves. They even call to confirm your order once you place it so make sure your number is out in correctly lol"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Two times in a row I asked for extra cheese and didn't receive it. Clerk behind desk never spoke but expected me to speak and seemed annoyed to be helping me. 530pm 1/23/17 foreign person
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," I ordered online and it promised that my order would be ready in 10 mins, I show up to pick it up and turns out that they didn't get my online order yet and I had to give the details in writing to the cashier 😒. I wasn't going to pay again for sure."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, I open the app and tells me there is no locations near me.um we eat there all the time. I go to map and I see no five guys. So this app is useless if I can't even get it to know where it's locations are.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, App is great. Food not ready when I got here...still standing around waiting :(
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Man I had a uber outside waiting and I already ordered off the app and got there 30 minutes after I ordered and it was saying it was ready but I got there and was waiting for 20 mins!! Atleast 6 orders went ahead of my already made order but I just left it wasn't worth my uber going up waiting...smh...Full ReviewMan I had a uber outside waiting and I already ordered off the app and got there 30 minutes after I ordered and it was saying it was ready but I got there and was waiting for 20 mins!! Atleast 6 orders went ahead of my already made order but I just left it wasn't worth my uber going up waiting...smh do better
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, I would give a 5 but hate that they don't start the fries till you show up? So WHY order on their app a head of time?
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Said my order would be ready in 8 minutes. I get there 25 minutes after I placed order and still had to wait 10 minutes. What's the point of ordering ahead of time to pick up if it's going to take 35 minutes to get. This was supposed to make my wait time shorter.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, It's just a easy way top order no coupon codes or good deals for having the app underlying pointless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Order sent through garbage to the restaurant so it wasn't ready. They could run it once I got there, but defeated the purpose of the app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Got this app to order before I got to the restaurant, to ""skip the line"".

After I ordered, the app did that the food would be ready in 9 minutes and I was 15 minutes away. When I got to the restaurant, I waited for my order to be called. After the rest of my party of 6 people went through the line and got their food, I went to the order counter, asked about my order, they printed a receipt with an order number and that's when they started making my burgers. So, even though I had ordered and paid 15 minutes before everyone that showed up 20 minutes later, my order wasn't placed until I went to the line. Ridiculous."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Since the  new updates the app no longer allows you to pay online with card would  like the option to pay online. Food is great now improve the app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"One suggestion though! Would like to suggest you add a moment where specific instructions can be put, or the option to get things on the side!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Works great but local store not used to it yet I love the convenience of using this app but the local staff doesn't always recognize how to look for a ""web order""."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Good update but needs continued refinement I like this workflow, but I feel the smaller font without the icons makes it harder for the list selection. Also it would be nice to be able to ask for toppings on the side."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Please add 2FA so I can leave my credit card info tied to my account. Either that or give is options to pay with PayPal or AndroidPay. I will not leave credit card info in accounts that have no 2 factor authentication.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Nice & simple app to order great burgers & fries! I only wish I could order no-salt fries. There is no comment field for the fries. If you like to eat around noon, you need this app to beat the line."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," One thing that the app is missing, is  a rewards program.  Like BurgerFi"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," The only option for payment is to enter in my credit card info, including cvv? Um, no thanks. Let me know when I can use Android pay or Visa pay."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Fast, easy to use and able to customize your order. Can even save your orders to reuse in the future. Fries and shakes aren't made until you arrive to ensure freshness."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Horrible experience using the app. It said the food would be ready in 8 minutes which is when I arrived.

The hamburgers ended up being ready 15 minutes after ordering and they would not give me the fries in the order until 30 minutes after I ordered it. People who came in after me and waited in the line got their food before me. It took 30 minutes to get my food and the burgers where cold but the app said the order was completed 8 minutes after I placed it which was not true. Another negitive point is the app doesn't tell them when you arrive like other chain fast food places apps. Basically the app leads to longer waits and cold food.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Why doesn't it accept gift cards or pay cash option? That would make this app better if I could pay with something other than a credit card.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app Galaxy S7 Easy to use and straight to the point. Would be nice if they had a field for special prep instructions, but I can understand why they dont."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Clingy storing credit cards. Is red yes or is gray yes? Why not use green and red?
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is super easy to use. I love that you can save orders incase you are craving something different or want to easily load up your favorite combo.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, This doesn't select the nearest store for you and i ordered from store that is 25 minutes from where I was and there was no option to cancel even right after you submit. Had to drive almost an hour to get a hamburger
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,I love the butgers These burgers are better than gf but donut tell her I said that! LoL
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, They as far as I know of have the best burgers recommend going there to eat and the App allows you to place an order while you sit at your table.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Really nice app The old app was serviceable, but this update is awesome.   The folks at the counter are great.  The app makes it too easy."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Simple application to order Five Guys food. You can save orders and payment info. Wish there was a comment section when you place an order to give specific instructions.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,The new version is pure garbage Bring back the previous version!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Great..til the update It used to be great, but now the menu is super tiny. Hoping it will go back to the original or an improved format"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Simple, with well chosen defaults, and a very well thought out layout. Usually all quantities are always arranged from least to greatest. This app does it differently and for the better."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Yum! Sooooooooo convenient for that favorite burger run. Enter order. Drive. Pick up order. Eat. Repeat!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love being able to quickly order my food using the the save order function. All I have to do is press a couple of buttons and I'm all set.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, What's the point? The store will not begin making your order until you arrive there so why bother spending any time on this app?
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Very convenient to orders on the App.  I'm a mom of a toddler so talking on the phone is sometimes a challenge.  Orders are always right and staff is very friendly
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app This is smooth and concise. Good interface. You just need to show what ""all the way"" includes, I didn't see that at this version."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, 1. Needs default phone number & other phone numbers stored in settings so don't have to input for every order.  2. Should note stores with milkshake options with an icon so we don't need to click every stores menu.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Love the redesign! The redesign makes the app so much easier to use.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Nice! I really like the update. Much better interface and I like that can ask for extra pickles when I place my order instead of asking when I get there.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Update killed the app. Won't connect anymore. Can't order. Useless.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I can order 4 patties in the restaurant but I can't do it in the app. Let us add 2 more patties, not just 1."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Love 5 guys and the app makes it easy to order, pay then go in and get your delicious food."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," the app works well, but double check your order before you leave the store."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Gives you a pick up time but might as well order at the register. Takes same amount of time.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love t just wish I didn't have to pay with my phone. Sometimes I'd like to pay when I picked up
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Good interface for order ahead, but it would be soooo much better with Android Pay and/or Samsung Pay to pay."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Fast, Fresh and HOT! Love the mobile app ordering!  Our Williamsport, Pa location is super good and always reliable!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," The app, whose only functionality is to order food, will not let me order from the Five Guys nearest me."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Never an issue with orders from the app and there's a massive amount of order customizations. Great food as always!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, The five guts app lets you place your order and pay for it ahead
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Love that I can save my order for future use and love how fast and simple app is! Love Five Guys!

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, App has been updated and improved until it's no longer usable.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Good app, easy to order, needs to have a spot for minus items. For instance, all the way minus pickles."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,5Gs Love! Food is great. Service is fantastic. Ams now I can order on my android! Woo!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, You guys need a section where we can add notes for the order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, The app service depends on the dilligence of the crew at a particular location.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Killed my battery!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Five Guy's Ordering for in store pickup and save waiting at the register.  Quick East to use

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, What happened to paying for my order in the app?
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Worked well to avoid the long line.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, No bun because of Allergy aware status identifying selection would be an improvement.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Nice clean app, no problems and I've been using it for a while."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Flawless ordering.  Easy and intuitive interface.  And as always, great food!"

Only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that you can get bigger than triples in store but not on the app.. And.. After every order it asks you to save it as a favorite but never gives you the option to order a favorite.. Kinda dumb.. I assume it saves it on the website if you were to order on there.. Bit doesn't help me out I only ever use the app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Our favorite fast food even easier The app is so easy to use. The only thing that would make it better would be if you could indicate an allergy. Five Guys is so good about taking care with my husband's celiac disease (no gluten or cross contamination), but there's no spot on the app to let them know about it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"No good. App doesn't work.  After creating account, setting up entire order, and then selecting to place order... the app fails.  I tried to order again and it crashed again.  Needs work!  HTC M8. **No response from developers...Doesn't seem they care about their own app. Too bad!  Love the burgers, though."

Then on top of that when I asked about my order they said it will never be ready if you order fries since they will not drop the cries until I get their.  First it wasn't even being cooked and worse even if it was ready it wouldn't be since they refuse to have the fries cooked until after you show up.  Seems all wrong!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Can't find My Favorite Order Great app except you tease me asking to save my family's favorite order and I can't find it easily to order next time. It would be so wonderful...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Works good needs one thing I perfer to use the app to order however with five guys I cannot do so as there is no special request option. I like my toppings on the side when it's to go so they don't get to hot before I eat, it is a preference. I think this would also allow for a name to be left for pickups."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"its great this app is great, super simple, and fast. the only thing it lacks for me is that theres  no way of asking for toppings on the side.  like a side  of ketcup or mayo etc.  would  have given  it 5 stars if it did that."

Normally I wolf burgers down,  bu I took my time amd savored it for 15 minutes.  Honestly, I can't remember a burger that tasted that good!!!!!  Ever! Thanks, Lew H"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Weird permissions I have never had trouble with the app or getting my food. But this latest update, which I have not approved yet, wants access to my camera and I don't know why a food ordering app needs access to my camera."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Won't stay logged in App worked fine on my M8, but won't stay logged in on my pixel. Pretty much means it's worthless now since I can't order without being logged in."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Not working Will not allow me to place orders. Continues to say cannot submit basket and then says enter CVV code. have attempted to reorder and reenter the information numerous times to no avail.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Love the food but the app needs work. Please accept google pay or paypal or something else so I don't have to keep typing a credit card into every damn app. Also the fact that they don't start the fries until you get there defeats the entire point of ordering ahead.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"The CVV wont save I've done everything right ... multiple times. Fix it. Jeez, this isn't a difficult patch, morons."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," I would love to use it, but it crashes every time! Luckily, I was near a computer and could place my order there this time. Fix the app so I can order your food more!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, I used to love this app but now it has too many bugs. Says my credit card is expired because it's the same month as my expiration date. Cards don't expire until the END of the month!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Said cc zip was wrong, but it wasn't. Charged my card but didn't send the order to the store. So I had to prove I've been charged already."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Error on credit card info I tried installing my card 5 times and it kept giving me an error app deleted
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Location unavailable Needs an update for new stores new store opened up in my area unable to order from there yet
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Crash App crashes while trying to place order. After I entered my entire order. Go figure.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Good app, lacks Android Pay App works great for ordering food, but you have to provide credit card info to them directly. Will bump to 5 stars with in-app Android Pay support."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,I like my Burgers.... This app would be perfect if there were an option to say how we want out burgers cooked. If there is such an option I have not seen it.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app but add milkshakes We use the app all the time to order from our local five guys. But, could you add milkshakes to the app? Our local store offers milkshakes but you cant order those in the app. Thanks."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Good but not worth the price Too pricey...I can get just as good of a burger from the W and pay about $4-$5 less.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Crashes App constantly required login. Couldn't place order. Crashes during order submit.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, I don't like when I'm going to update the app it's requesting permission to access my camera. Why? No thanks I just want to order a burger.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Used to be awesome This app used to be really great till it forced me to update now it is super buggy.  Used to be a 5 now a 1 so I gave a 3 based on past performance.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Camera Permissions? Was a solid app, but now asks for camera permissions and access to call history as well as contacts.  Why?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Only accepts card I was about to checkout but it forces you to add a card. You guys need to add the option to pay cash at the store.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Simple and effective Order food on my phone, ready when I get there."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Zip search doesn't work and map doesn't refresh.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Not putting CC info in.  No way to pay when you get there
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Best Burgers My favorite place for a quick bite.  Plus it's hot and ready before I get there when I order ahead.  Dine in or carry out.

And yes it's true. The second you place your order, the app charges your credit card, and tells you when it will be ready. Just go to the restaurant, go past the line to the cashier, tell him or her you placed a ""Web order,"" and they know immediately.  Your order will be waiting for you, except for the fries, as the restaurant insists that the be as fresh as possible; not waiting around getting cold.  But since there are usually fresh fries already being made, there's no wait for them,  either.  Just download the app and use it to save time and enjoy a great meal!  Just one issue though: If you need to update or change your credit card (payment method), you first have to go to fiveguys,com, sign in (there's nothing that says ""sign in,"" but you will find that option under ""Sign Up""). From your account page, remove y our credit card. There is no way to add a new one in, or to edit existing card info, i.e. update expiration date.  The only way to add your card - again - is when you place an order using the app, it will ask for your card number at check-out.  It's easier to type on the larger Website, but hey, what can I say?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,You can order a meal But you can customize a meal more with their website. You can select light or extra on the different toppings and condiments on the ololite mobile site. That cost it at least a star. The fact that I installed it and found it inferior to the website cost it another.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Crap app Love this app WHEN IT WORKS!! Stops working constantly in the middle of my order.  I've uninstalled and re installed several times.  Sent the issue msg everytime. Pleeeeeeeese fix it!!! I have 4 hungry boys at home this is a life saver on my late work days!!! Galaxy 3
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Works for Me Every Time I love this app. Food is ready to go when I show up, though they serve fries fresh to order when you get there. It would be nice if the app allowed use of their gift cards as a payment option."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Love it For everyone saying that you cannot skip the line, I do every time at the ones by my home. I simply walk past everyone and tell someone at the register that I placed an order on the app, give them the order info and they usually have it ready and waiting."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Good It's great if you have a lot of people in your party. Allows you to get everyone's sandwich just right. And even though you have to still wait in line when you get there, you only wait as long as it takes for your fries to be done."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"App is fine, execution sucks I put an order in 2 hours in advance so that I could swing by, pick up my order  and be on my way.

They didn't even start my order until after I arrived and was informed that, even if they had my burgers ready when I came in, they wait until you let them know that you are there to make the fries. 20 minutes later, my order is ready and I am late for my appointment. Very disappointing."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Not Good Enough This app would be so much better if you gave us the ability to edit saved orders. Also, put the pick-up time at the end of the order process."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Permissions? Still don't get it... A step in the right direction removing wifi and bluetooth. But why do you need access to files and photos? Explain in plain language what that's used for. I've kept from updating but now I'm convinced that y'all just don't get it. Uninstalled.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Super easy to use. This app couldn't make ordering food any easier. I like that you can just pass you phone around and let everyone build their own burger.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Online order fail Used the online app to conduct my order.  Drove up to the store and they had no recollection of my order.  Verified the store but no order was received. Will call my order in from now on if at all.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Ok?? The way the app described your order is not correct. You do not get to skip anything.! You still have to wait in line.

If I have to wait ten minutes between placing orders it defeats the purpose.  Worked just fine till recently.  Now I order one & am forced to call in the other orders.  Please fix.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Spy App Interface was never great but then they decided that they wanted to turn their app into a customer tracker and added a bunch or radio and location permissions. No thanks. You already know when I'm in your restaurant when I order the food.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"A little dated, but useful. Honestly, I expected this to be some ugly/archaic app, but it's fine!  It's responsive and easy to select your store, place your order, and be done.  It may not look like it, but it's more intuitive & stable than Taco Bell's app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Needs work Locks you out after too many attempts even when you reset your password.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Credit card necessary At most places you're able to order online and click pay upon pick-up in store, but you can ONLY order online with a credit card. I have a gift card but cannot use that online either. Would be nice if there were alternate payment options for those of us that don't pay with credit."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"No potential for gluten free I would love to use this app, but there's no way for me to request that they change their gloves when making my burger. Any chance of getting a note added in so I can order ahead of time like everyone else?"

Why would this app need these permissions:     read/modify/delete the contents of your USB storage     access Bluetooth settings/pair with Bluetooth devices     set an alarm     view Wi-Fi connections/view network connections/connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi     prevent device from sleeping The previous version (2.3.2.412041556) had only 4 permissions, all of which made perfect sense for locating a Five Guys and placing an order. It is in very poor taste that Five Guys thought their user base didn't deserve an explanation for why they suddenly needed such unrestricted access to our devices & information. At the time of this review, the only explanation provided (if you could call it that) was: ""Support for new in-restaurant technologies"". I can't imagine that, at no point during the development & testing of these new features, not one employee thought an exponential increase in required permissions warranted any explanation beyond 5 words. I'm very disappointed Five Guys."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Decent app PLEASE GIVE THE OPTION TO HAVE FRIES PRE MADE (BEFORE PICKUP). I Appreciate the commitment to crispyness...but some of us only downloaded this app so that we could arrive and leave the store in under 50 seconds. Thank you
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"What's the point? They don't start making it until you show up and tell them, so you have to wait in line anyway."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Crap Should be able to view menu and other info without creating a profile. Why should I have to log in to see anything. Guess that makes my decision whether or not to give them a try.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,This used to be awesome!! Why would this app possibly need access to my photos and bluetooth connection information?  I have chosen to uninstall.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Win This app actually found my phone number when I had to do the obligatory subscription. This I found helpful if a little creepy.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,App order don't work I placed a order on the app and charged card. Got confirmation email saying it would be ready in 10 min from the time I ordered. Got to the store and had no order on their system.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Does what it says I'd like to be able to use my gift card with this app.  It's how I budget my lunches.  I like being able to set my pickup time in the morning and pick up my lunch at noon.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Whats the point? Local stores now make me stand in line to check in while my burger sits on the fry warmer going stale? Might as well just order in store.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,It's the way to go It's simple and easy. I use the app every time before stopping by Five Guys. Never missed my order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Menu!!! I still don't understand why the restaurant has ""cheese dogs"" without an option for chili...  You may as well have chocolate chip cookies with no milk!!!"

I'v tried a handful of the chain restaurant apps, and this one is my favorite. Simple and straightforward to place an order. I'm holding on to the 5th star until the order timing in the store is improved. It seems to be a best effort approach. As far as I can tell, my order just gets in line with everyone else at the store. I think that is great. Just give me a status. Tell me my order has been received. Tell me when it will be ready. The 10 minutes I spent waiting in the store on Friday are understandable, but I would have much rather spent that time doing something else. I was not entirely sure my order was being prepared. Still a great app that I will continue to use."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Its ok It is full featured but requires a credit card. I pay cash so this app is worthless to me. If ordering with coworkers it would also be worthless for the same reason. Wouldn't they prefer an 11 person order be done electronically than clogging up their lines with people? I guess not

The online ordering - by home PC or via my cell phone carrier- was so streamlined and seamless! And quick! After you've submitted your order, it says it will be ready for pickup in 10 minutes. I'm about that far away, and it's ready to go when I get there. The menu was easy, adding extras to a burger was everything you would want - click a topping, then it asks you: regular, light or extra? For each one. I only give this 3 stars because there's no need for the app. Online ordering works better than any ordering app I've used across the board.   The app for this sucks. I'm glad I don't need it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Stuck at the beginning It says looking for location and never does anything else I have used this app once it was cool that one time that's it... fix that and it would be great

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great place to eat, app doesn't work. I dunno why, but the app didn't work correctly on my stock galaxy s3.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"The app worked but the restaurant didn't I ordered with the app, the store got my order but never made the food.  In fact they started serving people who came in after me. What's the point of pre ordering? Save yourself the hassle and order at the register."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Easy to use It was easy to select choices.  The different items were well organized (burger choices together, fry choices together).  The store had my burgers ready, and cooked my fries when i got there, so approx 5 minute wait at restaurant."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,What's up with surcharges. Gomobo charges my credit card $1 for ordering through this app.  That's a steep surcharge for a $10 order. App should tell you about the fee and have you confirm that you agree to the extra charge.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Good app to get great food 
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,No issue 
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Map is not accurate. 
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Good app! Order food on your way to give guys! Would like the ability to see and  edit my favorites before ordering...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Good app, wish the ordering process was actually better though. I love the app as I love Five Guys, and you definitely need to order online and pickup as it gets crazy there.

However, I wish you didn't have to enter a credit card in order to order online, I wish it would allow cash pick ups.  Especially since sometimes I have cash on me and don't feel like charging anything.  Also, when I save an order as a favorite, next time I'm in the app I can't actually access favorites.  Will give 5 stars when this is something that can be done."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Saved orders While the app tells you you can save an order to quickly reorder it later there is no way to actually do so.  You can look at your past orders total cost but not simply reorder it.  Please get this feature working as we almost always order the exact same thing every time.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Better to order online I set up an order on this app and asked that it be ready 45 mins later for pick up. When I arrived to the restaurant, and let them know I was there, they informed me that not only had the ticket not printed on their end until my arrival, but that the app had also changed my ready time to 40 mins pas...Full ReviewI set up an order on this app and asked that it be ready 45 mins later for pick up. When I arrived to the restaurant, and let them know I was there, they informed me that not only had the ticket not printed on their end until my arrival, but that the app had also changed my ready time to 40 mins passed my requested time. They said they run Ingo this all the time, and recommend ordering from their website (at least until the app is better).  So we got to stand around and wait for our entire order to be made."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"No explanation for 'All the way' One of the topping options is 'All the way' but no explanation to what is included. Plus for the veggie it automatically generated some toppings for me. So when I selected all the way and didn't delete the toppings it auto-filled, they didn't make my order so I still had to wait!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Simple App for A Simple &Delicious Burger It's easy to use, but I'm not a person who has the need to special order a burger. It lists all the options to put on your burger, you either want them or not. I've never had issues with the app working or crashing either."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Easy ordering, no cash option The app works really great (Galaxy S4) and ordering was fairly intuitive.  The app did a good job of detecting my closest restaurant.    My only real complaint is that I want to have the option of paying cash when I get to the store.  -1 star for that missing feature."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,crashing for over a month Been crashing on me for over a month.  Used to work great.  I reported the crash at least 20x so far no luck. Have not ordered one since.  Dont like to wait in line. Using galaxy s3

Nope.  For the first several times I started up the app, it would crash with a server certificate problem. After finally getting past that,  it had trouble locating a restaurant in my area. Finally, it would crash and force close every time I tried to add something to my bag. By the time I gave up and uninstalled it, I would have spent far less time by just driving to the restaurant and ordering at the counter in the first place. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Uninstalled."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Pay with cash! I would give this app 5 stars if you had the option to pay with cash when you pick up... Otherwise.. I hate it.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Can't even use it crashes Zero stars. As soon as I hit add to bag, it crashes. Tried several times. Nothing else running at the same time. Can't even use it. HTC"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Garbage I made my first order and the order didn't go through and I had to pay at the store. Now that wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't double charged. -_-
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Takes the hardest part of ordering out of the equation! Love this app. I can make sure I don't leave anything off my favorite burger!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Only downfall - requires you to add CC info before order is placed. Other apps allow for pay at pickup. Its not that I don't trust FG with my card #, but I sure don't trust the app market with it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Does this app take PayPal or bill me later? We are wondering because if so we will eat here more often.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Entered pick up times doesn't work Entered an order at 5:00 for a pick up at 6:00. The order got entered for a 6:20 pick up. Ended waiting for another 20 minutes. Why???
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"3 Nicely designed, but a cash option (since we have to come pick it up anyway) would be nice. I don't want my credit card number locked in you data base. I know the option is available to go delete it on your website. The chances I'd remember to do that... Zero."

As the title of this review says, if you want an awesome, juicy, and most irresistible burger with some kickin' fries, you'll wanna get ordering using this application so that you can walk in on a busy day and skip the lines (proudly!)   If you've never tried Five Guys, use this application to find the nearest location and order online using the app! You'll probably taste heaven in your mouth!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Its ok Like ordering online options because every time I call im on hold for 10mins. Please add pay with cash option would be 5 stars then
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Flawless Fast, non glitchy, cute, super handy! Usually these simple little apps are crap but it's so perfect"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Easy to use interface Wonderfully built app. Worked exactly as it s should, my order was placed correctly and fast. 5 Guys know their fries!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Needs GPS. I don't use location. I use mock locations. I don't like that I need to have GPS or location on to order. I should be able to enter a location to purchase from. Thanks. Otherwise love the burgers and fries.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Can't provide instructions/requests Just tried using the app. I didn't notice an option to request certain condiments on the side. Next time I'll look into ordering by phone.  I love this place though and sometimes I'm craving it enough to make the wait worthwhile.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Broken process Order frequently incorrect. Customers walking in after you will get their order first. Just order at the store. The app doesn't add any value.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Nicely done. App is nicely done. Very clean and intuitive. Just need to update the icon. Looks out of place on the newer devices compared to other icons.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Easy to order. A very polite app to use. Felt like I was in the restaurant!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great way to order great food! A no-frills app with a simple layout and intuitive interface. Great features such as finding a nearby restaurant, saving favorite orders, saving payment options, and navigating to a restaurant."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Horrible app Keeps crashing, just order online and skip the app"

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Hate the app, love the burgers. It doesn't locate any of the places I eat 5 guys at....."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"No way to pay with Cash Unlike Jimmy Johns mobile ordering,  this requires a credit card.  No thanks."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Works great Great way to see menu and pre-order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,EXCELLENT Absolutely wonderful food and fry's with vinegar for dipping... YUMMY
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Need cash option Nice app but would like a cash option.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Really easy Great app, but doesn't accept gift cards as payment, only credit cards."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"No special requests. Needs a way to add comments to an order. Otherwise, easy to use and works great."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Rebootaliciois This app makes my Nexus 6p restart.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Great app...but Needs cash option.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Amazing 
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Better 
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Probably The Best Functioning App EVER I love how I can place my order, leave work, walk in and get my bag and be back at work within like 6 minutes.  I many times walk in, say ""web order"" and walk out.  I love how quick it works and it just hits my card on file.  Totally maximizes my lunch hour when I want a nice burger..."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Fantastic The Five Guys here just opened last week.  Lines are huge all the time.  I used this app on the Galaxy tab, went in, got my large order, and walked out before the line at the counter moved at all.  Great experience and fantastic app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Incorrect order Added toppings I did not request. Also does not allow light/heavy toppings like the website ordering system which I will use over this app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Made Five Guys my favorite restaurant Samsung Galaxy Nexus: The app is awesome.  Makes ordering and paying extremely easy.  One thing I would like to see is the option to have something ""on the side"".  Ex. Bacon burger with pickles on the side."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"Not supported? This app worked great for a very long time but recently has instead been saying that the current version (#2.1.2) ""could not be supported"" and that I should upgrade to the latest version...but this IS the latest one, so now what?!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Best App yet... This makes Five Guys faster then the drive-thru.  I love the look on the other customer's faces when I pass them all up, walk straight to the pick-up counter they put fresh fries in the bag and I walk out.  Love it...love it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,No waiting.. Five guys has the best burgers and fries so the place is always mobbed. Nothing like near instant gratification instead of drooling in line waiting for your number to be called.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Great app.  Staff needs training The app works great. The store had no idea how to handle the order. Call out an order number even though I told my name and that I used app.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Feature wish Great little handy app.    On thing I'd love to see though,  the ability to request extra toppings (extra jalapeños etc)  Otherwise flawless."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Did not work It would not let me select condiments for my burger. The app fires not use my existing profile. There is no reason for this app as the website works well.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Excellent! I love me some Five Guys and this app made it simple and easy to order my food for pick up. The food was being packed as i came in to pick it up right on time. The burgers were freshly made and delicious!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,It's great but ! I don't like having to pay only by credit card. If its a store pick up why cant I choose cash online and pay in person??
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,I loved it on my EVO 4G But sadly doesn't work on my gs3.  Adds toppings I didn't want and crashes my phone.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Great but... It works great, but you need to be able to disable the current location. It hangs the app every time."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Needs a small fix When you place an order for a future time the time comes out wrong at the store. I ordered for 1:00, but the order went to the store for 1 hour after the time I ordered, so food wasn't ready."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Best app on my phone! Love the food, love the app. Order exactly what I want, how I want it and pay for it so easily. Go to the store and pick it up. Wish all my apps worked as well as this one! More restaurants need to be doing this"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Line buster!!!! This app is awesome. I put in the time I would be there to pick up my order. Walked to the front of the line and my order was ready to go. Right on time. BOOM!!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Crashes when I add burgers :| I can add fries to my bag, but anytime I attempt to put a burger in, the app crashes.  Running on a GS3."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Best during busy times If you use when they aren't already making fries,  be prepared to have your burger wait on the side while they make you fresh ones."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Would be 5 but Sometimes when selecting toppings some items are already selected and you can't deselect them. Also, tried to use the feedback within the app to report this and that wasn't working either."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Crashes Only worked a couple of times and now crashes every time I try to place an order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,GNex Can't order a hot dog cause it won't let me uncheck toppings. Very annoying
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Cash option? Why not allow people to pay with cash if they already have a card on file? Jimmy John's does
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Horrible design Crashes a lot, and isn't even using the Holo UI... come on now"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Sucks As soon as I turned the app on the 1st time it found my 5 guys and everyone within 50 miles of me....works fine with me. Online is great when u r out
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,waiting for current location it sits there and does nothing because it's waiting for current location
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"Grr Every time i try to sign in it ""stops"" very frustrating!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Great app So convenient!  Love Five Guys but not having to wait on my order makes it even better!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Really really wish they would disable the apparently required GPS use.  I know my zipcode dammit, let me type it in and stop hanging the app!!!!!!!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Why isn't my Five Guys listed? My towns Five Guys has been open for months but I cant use the app.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Burgers and fries This place is amazing I love it I won't have a burger anywhere else but here

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Delightful time saver—perfectly done When I'm out and about, I pull up this app, select my usual order from favorites, and the shop has it waiting for me when I get there.  Five Guys took the time/resources to build the infrastructure and do the employee training so that the whole thing works like a charm every time.  BRAVO!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Works Well. The app works well, and for those uninitiated, the burgers do too! Only thing preventing 5 stars is a post-order time estimate.

Highly recommend app and ...Full ReviewThe app works well, and for those uninitiated, the burgers do too! Only thing preventing 5 stars is a post-order time estimate. We frequent a busy joint and have had to wait 10 minutes in store because their flattop was maxed out. A post-order ETA might have prevented this. Highly recommend app and grub!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Good intentions We waited and then asked how we would know if our order was ready. They said we had to confirm the order first. what is the purpose if we have to wait in a line?? is the credit card info not a good enough confirmation?
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Fantastic Don't listen to reviews saying you can't see the menu. You CAN. Create an account, select your store, login and its all right there. Works great on Xoom as well which is a great plus! 5 stars for the app. 10 stars for the food!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Galaxy Nexus - I used it almost every time we go there and love it.  The store gets busy, but I walk right up and got our food.  They wait until you arrive to drop fresh hot fries into the bag. One of my top apps!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Nice app This is a great app to use if you're in a hurry and have a cc.

I would give this app full stars if it had a complete selection of the options that are available in store, as well as the option to pay cash at the store.  Not everyone has a credit card and the option to pay in store would make this a much better app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app Idiots, call and order if u want to pay with cash. Can u imagine how many fake orders would be sent with this app, without CC. Stop bitching"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"*participating* locations This is a great app for ordering burgers when I'm in a hurry. To those dinging it for not having their store in the app - check their website - it says ""participating"" locations and offers you the ability to search for stores near you that participate."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,"Great, but favs suck Love the flexibility and convenience. Only downer is u can't copy your favorite order from one store to another. Otherwise works well"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app I agree with previous suggestion of as post estimate time. The ready time only works if there's no traffic related issues, and they aren't inundated with orders. But other than that, it's a great app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Needs a bit of tweeking. Works MOST of the time. it also bases its taxes from the city your area code belongs to, not from the pick up locations city. So I would like to see that changed."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,AWESOME Great for when im at work! I can order and by the time i get there its ready for pickup! And you pay on the app so you just walk on and grab your bag fill your drink and leave!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Update for plain orders Doesn't allow for plain orders. I get to the restaurant and they say my order is incomplete because I didn't add toppings. I don't want toppings.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Awesome! Just when you though Five Guys burgers couldn't get any better...BAM! This app comes along!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," This app seems like it was programmed by a beginner.

It transmits to and from the server with EVERYTHING you do (and freezes while it does so), such as getting a list of toppings everytime you try to order an item.  This ends up taking so long that you might as well just go there and order in person and wait.  The smart thing to do would be to put all toppings in a single file and transmit it once when the app starts.  Then, when you complete your order, transmit it ONCE to the server instead of continuously ad hoc.  I only gave it two stars because it actually works...eventually."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,This App is a scam!!!!! Every Time you order using this APP you get a charge 0f $1.00 for your trouble. It makes a hell of a lot more sense to call and place the order. I am very unhappy that I wasn't made aware that I was going to be charged for using the APP each time.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Somewhat rocky experience I submitted an order for immediate pickup and arrived at the restaurant about 20 minutes later. They hadn't even begun making my order, so I ended up waiting about three minutes to flag down an employee, then another six or seven waiting for my food to be made."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Awesome app! Simple and easy to use. Shows the closest with all info. Long lines? Order w/ the app and bypass them all!!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"It's O K..... The app functions fine but you can only pay with a credit card, which I guess is fine unless you want to pay with cash."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Love this app! I literally can't think of anything else I want this app to do except deliver the food to me or work with other restaurants. Flawless!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"What every resturaunt should do! This is awesome! Log in, see the nearest store. Place an order, review it, pay automatically, then get GPS directions! Well designed, easy to use."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Easy to use! Love how easy it is to use. Just wish they have a button for xtra items like for mayo or mustard. Other then that great!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Fixed Times Can't get the hours to work in my area so it won't let me do anything. Worked the next day awesome!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Works flawless Mmmmmm. Good food and app. Fyi - they drop your fries once you arrive there. They r fresh!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Yes!! Oh hell yea!  What else can I say?   A heart attack in a bag. LoL.   I LOVE THE FOOD!!!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Works perfectly! Two suggestions: Give the ability to manually enter time of pickup instead of drop down choices and have a section for special instructions/requests. Great app otherwise!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Add gift card payment I want to use my gift cards instead of my credit card. Also let the user put in their zipcode instead of using gps.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I agree!Absolutely awesome app! Every, and I mean Every restaurant that does any kind of takeout should have an app like and as well designed as this!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Lin Love this game. Kills boredom.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Five thumbs up! Way too convenient! Log in, order and pay through the app. Then just go to the pick up area once you get there......DONE!!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Orders get done right away and exact The people at the Sunnyvale, CA location even called to make sure the specific orders were done right as I requested. Five guys are the best!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Never finds the location....just stuck at the first screen. Consistent problem since downloading this. Uninstalling.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, This app is awesome..well worth it..never had to wait.more then 2 minutes once I placed my order and got there they droped my fries I was out the door
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Order ahead, pay ahead, walk inskip the line. Get your food. What more could you want?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Location Uses auto location only. Sorry, I don't let my phone spy on me that much. Feedback from the app always fails."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Wow Very cool app I just hate that threw five guysthat's closest to me didn't accept orders through this application
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Worked perfectly. Walked right in, picked up my Burger and fresh fries."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great app and food This application works perfectly! It anticipates what I want to do, it saves the right info, and I love the burgers at Five Guys."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Love it! Quick and easy. Ordering through this app help me skip the line straight to pick up!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Can't even find my location! This is the second time I downloaded this app (even after upgrading to new OS) and still can't get beyond ""finding your location""! Sad, I love 5 Guys."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Meh I've had better bang for my buck at other places. Almost 10$ for bacon cheeseburger and regular soda, and the burger is a modest size at best."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Nice time saver... Send in my order, leave the office and no lines. One time I was in and out in 30 seconds in the middle of the lunch rush."

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Super App!! Downloaded, installed, and completed an order for our family of 4 in less than 5 minutes!  Hubby is picking it up on his way home!  Love it!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Says it doesn't require a credit card, but then it does... Also, why would you provide addresses and directions to the stores, but no phone numbers?"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Ordered right before I left my house since I was running short on time and when I got there my food was waiting for me :)
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Does exactly what I want it to. Order my food. Thanks.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Still have to wait in line Still have to wait in line, but food is ready when you get there."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Dont use Was charged for using this app 5 days later without accepting any additional charges!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Convenient It was convenient to use, but takes just as long to get your food if you ordered it in the store."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,3 Stars for Five Guys Not too expensive but I would rather have a bigger burger for the price.  In & Out is a better value.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Great app. Easy to use. I like the app and the food! :)
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, No phone #. We drove 10 min. In the car and we got there before we could finish ordering. Would be WAY better to be able to call.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Improved
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Awesome
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Store claims they never got order n said it happens ALOT! So ended up taking us even longer to get our food. FAIL!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Missing a few key things... This app is missing 2 key things. 1. The ability to call up saved orders (you can call them up online when you're signed in, but not on the app) and 2. The ability to modify toppings (lite, regular, extra) as you can on the website. For now, I'll stick to their mobile we page."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Should add a skip gps ability at the start of app. Also, didnt have the five guys I was looking for making this useless."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,The app is not the problem. The crappy rating is because of crappy Five Guys policy where they won't make your fries until after you arrive to pick up your order.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, App is a little buggy. When order is placed it hangs up on sending order for a long time and then reports an unspecified system error. HTC Speedy.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Great app if you eat 5guys. Directions need choice of navigation or map tho. Too bad their burgers and fries, suuu-Uck! *Gag*"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Can't save order as favorite without committing the order. Can't change pickup time without canceling order and starting over. Lame.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Just let me skip a 20 minute wait just to order! No added fees for doing it online. If you have a smartphone, you'd be crazy not to use this app!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Works as promised Great app, saves me time during the lunch rush. Their policy to not make fries till arrival ensures the fries are fresh, not soggy."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Very difficult to hear your order number, music loud. Fries a bit under cooked, but burgers are great."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Set pick up time for 2:30. Walked up to the pick up area at 2:30. ""I am making your fries right now."" 2:32 food in hand. Never had to pull out wallet."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"doesn't remember pending orders ""in the bag"" 1. created an account it didn't ask my username. I can't order on a regular browser b/c i don't know usrnme. 2. building an order... If you have to sleep your phone or do other things on your phone while building an order it doesn't remember items in your bag after a few minutes. *^%$^%$# !!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Yum! ....Great burgers and a great app! Love it. Now I don't have to wait in the long lines. And awesome fries too!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," The best!! Tried it yesterday and set pickup at 2:55, walked in store at 2:54 and walked out less than a minute later with a smokin hot burger. A+++"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Does not work on DROID X2 Log in, click on the store, click on burgers it takes me back to the map to choose a store again. Repeats this over and over again."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Have used it 2 days in a row. I get there, give them my name, and they give me my burger. In, out and done! They don't even have to swipe my cc. 5*"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," If you're gonna rate the app, rate the app... Don't one star rate because the restaurant only serves burgers and fries. Awesome burgers I might add"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Good app works well simple interface on another note seems some people need to step off their pedestal always easy to insult when your faceless
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Does exactly what it was designed to do. I love just walking past the register right to the pick up area. Food is ready and am on my way again. Great!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Has my local 5 guys in Rio grande new jersey thank god lol finally an app that has southern nj stores unlike papa johns which isn't in south nj
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Worked perfect, please note that posts and comments should be regarding the app not your opinion of the food. Food is a 4 to me but app is a 5"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," When you try to view the menu items to order, it just blanks out and takes you back to the home screen. Flat out doesn't work. Motorola Atrix."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," I am sure it would be great, but app stays stuck on searching for nearby locations screen on Droid 1 on 2.3 build GPA14"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Good food, but the app could be more secure. Once I enter a credit card, anyone who steals my phone can place orders. Order should require password."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Love it!! So easy to use and convienent since five guys is a two min walk from work.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Wow, what a terrifically designed app! Seriously. I like 5 Guys but I loved this app. Every restaurant should model themselves after this one."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, If your Five Guys location doesn't support online orders it won't be listed in this app. Awesome app though!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Best food app ever. Why cant everything be this great?! Five guys rules
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,Sweet Needs to keep me you logged in. Works great! Every place should have one. Thunderbolt @jasonstuff
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Best app ever, just used it in few mins ordered my food with toppings and picked up in The next 5 min awesome!! And delicious!!!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Great app, great food. No location for kent, Ohio is found in the search --> 4/5 stars"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Unsure about secure transactions I don't like the fact that I'm asked for my card information. I'd rather call Five Guys to order ahead and pay when I get there.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," This is great, placed the order and paid for it on my DX for a 1:00 pickup got there 5 minutes before and at 1:00 I was leaving with my HOT food."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great app, great burgers! ProTip: tap and hold on a topping to select extra or light."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Used it for the first time today. Walked in after placing my order and my food was ready w/in 30 sec. Evo Deck
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Can't ordet Every time I pick a food item, screen goes black and then goes back to list of locations."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I ordered expecting traffic, got there 20min early, they immediately made my order and it was ready in a few minutes! So great"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Finds the nearest locations just fine, but when you then want the directions and it pulls up your GPS, it puts in a random address, ended up lost!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Great idea. I ordered food tonight, got the email confermation, went to pick up my food and they didn't even have my order started yet."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I love five guys and wanted this 2 work but app hangs at checking for nearby restraunts, never does anything. Android 2.3.3"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Excellent idea! After a long mountain bike ride, I order just before leaving the trailhead, and it is ready when I get to 5 guys."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Over priced fast food crapola lol
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Frustrating. Try to order but returns to store listing every time. Droid x2. Sad face
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Easy to use, found my local Five Guys, I want a bacon burger now! Droid X"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Set pick up time for 845, walked in at 843, straight to the pickup station. A guy said give me 2 minutes. Never touched my wallet. I love efficiency!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Good app I just wish I didn't have to drive 4miles out to the nearest one in the Bronx New York area.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Awesome app and superior food. Wish I received the e-mail after I order... but its always ready!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Awesome! Saved our favorite burgers, so now ordering is even easier! And nothing beats walking right up to the counter and getting ur food when they are busy."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Mmmm Bacon cheeseburger. Its amazing how fast the spinners make the app appear!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, I have five guys in Ftp@ Walton Beach FL.says nearest one is 50 miles away in Panama City or Pensacola. Duh
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2," Never got past the 'submitting order' screen, but I was charged anyway. Did not receive order confirmation. Two orders waiting for me when I got there"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great burgers & great ap however its not so great for all the obese people I see eating at their restaurants. Makes it to easy for the fatties!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, I hate people that don't wait in line!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, I tried five guys when I visited my brother in Florida and was hooked! Wish you guys were in Puerto Rico :(
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Defective! When I try to enter my order program defaults back to start. Removed 5 Guys!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," got there a few minutes before my order should have been ready n find out it's been sitting there for about 10 minutes with fries done, not very hot!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Easy and quick. Very simple app. I received a text immediately after placing order with my pick up time.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Droid app has problem not allowing cash payment, hence will not let you place order after all the info has been entered. Fustrating."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Only used once so far. Order was almost ready by the time we got there! Didn't receive email confirmation but order was correct. Galaxy s
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, It just can't get any better than this!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, make sure your gps is on or it wont work
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Won't open Would be nice if the app would open
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great food, and now I don't have to wait forever to get it!"

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Just placed my first order. So awesome! Love 5 guys!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great App, clean and efficient. I love how easy it is to pick what you want."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Ok App but it does not have all locations listed
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Useless to me, I have a location 2miles from me and the app doesn't list it."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Crap wont even open
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, First time going here. App ordered perfectly. Food was excellent and so was the customer service. Highly recommended. Droid 2
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Ok but the food there is not that great.... I was major disappointed
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Major letdown. Just order at the store.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, I was in the parking lot of the local store (Ft Walton Bch) and the app wanted to send me 30+ miles away. I entered the correct zip but no joy.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Ridiculous password complexity requirements. This isn't a banking app!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Doesnt work!! Wont even open....cant use with my galaxy S....uninstalling.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," I gave five stars, one for each guy!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Does not have my local five guys in Fort Walton Beach, FL. 5 star when fixed. HTC THUNDERBOLT"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Bomb diggity Android love son. Place is bomb app is bomb
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Im across the street from one a mile from another and it cant find either. Broaden you search from just major metro areas jerks
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Doesn't work on Droid X. Just freezes while looking for location.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Very simple and works perfect. Jus wish they were cheaper ;)
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great app. Cool to order and pickup without waiting. Ten stars!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," This app worked perfectly, found my closest location quickly and easily. It is very easy to create an order and pick the toppings, the order sent fast"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Good idea, but no participating stores Come on Louisiana, get with the program. This is a great app for those quick bites when you're out and about."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Last OS update Good app, easy, works...unfortunately it stopped working after the last OS update on the Motorola ATRIX (2.3)."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Doesn't have the location just down the street. Fail.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, Won't work unless it can obtain your location...
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Every time I use it. It works as expected. Seemless with google navigation. Order confirmation is almost instant. DroidX
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Worst restraunt app ever! Wouldnt even let me see the menu. I wouldnt even give it a one star.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Can't edit ur burger once u add it to bag. You can only remove it or add a new one. Dumb!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Great app. You make your order, pick it up and always on time. Perfect for shift worker."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Used it today for the first time, worked great! Highly recommended, order was ready at the time I designated"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4,decent app should be able to choose time after order is placed and be able to view and change favorites before choosing a time of pick up. great app otherwise!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, It does what it says it will do. I placed order and it was ready when I got there.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, For some reason the app can't pull my phone # so I'm unable to place an order and there is no option to manually update your contact info.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Last week in March a new 5 guys in Gainesville FL net thornbrooks. Great app
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Come on, people. You are supposed to rate the app and not the restaurant. Use some common sense, please."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," service on the 29th one sucks there burgers are always all smashed when the wrap them, all greasy, going to spend $5 not the quality I want to receive"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Terrible...won't find my location. Droid X
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2, The app doesn't have my closest five guys listed!! Maybe they just don't take online ordering ..but I would rather not have to drive 2 more miles
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Doesn't work. ""Says unable to find restaurant. Unacceptable"""
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Great!!!!! Never have had these burgers yet. Thanks for app to show me some in my city. Droid X
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Need a credit card on file, whack! We decided to go to In N Out instead. Your loss 5guys, party of 10=$$$$"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Needs to support payment services like PayPal and Google Checkout. Five Guys shouldn't have to save my credit card number.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," Gorgeous and functional, but I wish you could pay on location - i'm not tying my credit card to a burger joint...alas, this app is useless"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Great app but needs a cash payment option like Chipotle. Some of us don't like to use credit cards to buy food. {{-_-}}
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Crashes at order login. Htc evo 4g
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Best app in the Market!! Simply put the only app you need or that matters!! Five Guys just needs a rewards card.program now too!!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, 5 stars when the store next to my house shows up.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4," Would be five stars but I'm in five guys on outer banks and it tells me no locations found, lol"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Well if it was updated to show the location thats been open for a month in pearland, they might have made a sale from us today. Update the app!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Very useful. Really wish I could install to SD.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Great app idea and design, but wouldn't place order. So it doesn't work. So one star."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," FIRST TIME, LAST TIME. GREASE, BAD TASTE AND HEART BURN. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME RIGHT. ALL THE HYPE IS SHORT COMING. THE FOOD IS THE WORST."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Bullshit charged me 3 times!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, Best way to order food in a hurry. Great food but a little pricy.

Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Only thing I don't like about it is you can't stay what time you'll be there like online ordering. Otherwise love it.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Extra pickles + favorites FTW! Love the long hold on modifiers to get lite/extra toppings, and the fast repeat ordering with favorites. #win"

Jersey Mikey's even gives a free reg sub and a small drink on your birthday via email. Needs improvement and real rewards before I would ever reinstall this app."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, They lost me when they popped up the text keyboard for my zip code.   _Then_ I realized that they shouldn't be asking for my credit card anyway.  Unusable if you're trying to quickly submit an order at a stop light.

When I added the auto order, it only showed ketchup and mayo when IT  selected grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and multiple other options. Tried informing the location I ordered from but they didn't comprehend. Please fix this."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3," The quality of the food is excellent, but my order was not correct. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, a hot dog, a regular fry and 2 large drinks. My son picked it up and brought it home. The burger and drinks were fine; but there was no hot dog and a large fry."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,"Better to order from website 1.  Not able to order extra pickles,  or little mustard,  like I can from the website.                                       2.  No way to order fries ""well done "" until getting to the store, slows down the pickup."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," App keeps saying that I'm not connected to the internet when I am. I thought that the app would be better than their website, but neither one would let me place an order. I guess we'll have to phone in our orders."

If I could have placed my order with the app and paid in the store it would have rocked, but maybe they're concerned people would order something and never show up so I understand if that's the case."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,"Great food but app crashes Grrr! Nothing like placing a big order through the app only to have it crash when sending it. If you're ordering more than one or two items, you might be safer with the Web site."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Hate this app It needs to give an option to pay in the store & not just put credit card info in in the system
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," You can save your favorite orders, pay from app, I appreciate that they don't make the fries until you get there, I like them fresh and hot. Zero complaints."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Terrible application for a fast food joint. This app needs a LOT of work still yet.  Read some of the reviews  and you see why.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5," Not only does Five Guys make the best burgers in town, they make a smart and simple app that anyone can use!  I order before I leave the parking lot at work and it's ready by the time I get to the restaurant.  Great job Five Guys!"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,New permission is used for tracking No. You're not getting that permission.    Uninstall and run away.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"Ap doesn't list all the free burger condiments. There is a limited # of condiments listed in the app & too many to list in the resturant.

It wouldn't accept my debit card info, but took my husband's which is linked to the same account and now that I think of it it kind of bothers me that it processed the payment from my husband's card w/o his name being anywhere in the app and we have different last names.  It should at least require the name on the card to process the payment IMHO. Food issues will be covered on Yelp. Ap has already been deleted."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, I'm heavily biased because this app makes food become mine. 5 stars.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Sucks. Would be nice if it worked for all there locations.  Can't order from the stores near me.  Useless.  Uninstalled
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," I thought it may have had coupons or specials on it but it has nothing but 
just the ability to order food and purchase very sad"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,4, Great food and wait time not bad for fresh prepare as you order food. I think it is slightly over priced.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,Didn't  work Tried ordering from app three times earlier today. Everytime after I hit the submit order button only a blank page came up. Went to pick up food and they said they never got the order
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,"GPS Does Not Turn Off When returning to the home screen either by pressing home button or menu>exit in the app, the GPS stays on. Have to kill the app to make it turn off. Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX"
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1," Ordered through the app, got to Five Guys and then proceeded to have multiple people in store show up after me, order, and get their food before me. The mobile app isn't worth it if it doesn't save you time and is inaccurate as to when your food is ready."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5, So easy to order for pick up! Especially since I have food allergies; I can be sure that my order is correct.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Just a ordering app Why would they have or need this dont you want your food fresh why dont they have a loyalty program do they not care about the loyal customers
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,Yummy yummy After eating a burger and fries from five guys there is no going back lol. Every person I have introduced to it that is their new favorite hamburger place!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1, Crashed four attempts!!!! Very disappointing after entering our entire order 4 times only to have it crash each time!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,LOVE IT!!! Okay I haven't use the app yet. But I really love 5 guys and I'm so excited that they have this app!
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,2,What's the point... What's the point of having the app if the closest place doesn't accept online orders?  Ugh.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,Too intrusive GPS has to be on. Google has to see even if app not on? No thanks.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3,Wrong hours Tried to order. Hours on app are wrong for Hayward location.  Couldn't order prior to arrival.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,1,. Demands to know pickup time before I even look at the menu or even decide if I want to order.  That ought to be the last question after I decide all other things.
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,5,"Great! Great app. Never had any problems going and picking up orders. Unfortunately, there isn't a five guys around here anymore, due to the economy..."
Five Guys Burgers & Fries,Shopping,3, Tried the app before trying the terrible food.  Never again

FoodKick,Shopping,2," Difficulties logging on to make purchases. Zip code information would vanish and when I attempted to re-enter info, I received an error. I still had issues after uninstalling and reinstalling more than 3 times. This issue has been going on since February."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," It's supposed to be a NYC delivery service but the zip codes never work. Can't order without using the chat feature for help. If they are busy and no one is available, forget about your order."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," After you place your order, they imediately place a hold for the full amount for everything you ordered, and state that it's all on the way. However what you receive is somewhat random, based on what actually happens to be in their warehouse. Don't count on receiving a fill list for a recipe."
FoodKick,Shopping,2, I keep getting a pop-up box telling me about produce freshness rating. Once was enough. It popped up literally 20 times the last time I shopped. Think this is a bug on Android app. I just switched from iPhone and never had this issue on old phone.
FoodKick,Shopping,3, Love the service but the app is really bad. Why do I need to log in and enter my address every time I use it? I usually end up opening a Chrome tab on my phone because it's a lot faster.
FoodKick,Shopping,1," wont let me login, says not conmected to network though i am able to browse the site"
FoodKick,Shopping,2, I love the service but the app sucks. i have to restart my phone evey time I order for it to work.
FoodKick,Shopping,1, Regularly does not show item images or load properly.
FoodKick,Shopping,2, love the service. app is frequently unusable
FoodKick,Shopping,4, Slow app. Fast food delivery though.
FoodKick,Shopping,5, Smh! If only there was 10 stars!😍
FoodKick,Shopping,1, Can't enter zip code
FoodKick,Shopping,1," Ever since the intro to 9.99 monthly unlimited deliveries. Can never get 
same day anymore all slots always taken"
FoodKick,Shopping,2," This app is buggy as hell. It's not showing all the items I purchased in the basket, so ultimately I abandoned my purchase. Very annoyed!"
FoodKick,Shopping,5," Order was perfect, nicely packaged and the gentleman who delivered walked up five flights of stairs to my apartment and was very nice.  I'll be using food kick again for sure."
FoodKick,Shopping,5," My neighbor had been trying to get us to do FK for quite awhile. Finally decided to give it a shot and this **** is life changing.

Granted I've only used it for beer, but its nice to not have to ever leave the house when the wife is out of town and I'm spending the weekend binge watching shows. Life. Is. Good. 😎 Works completely fine on the LG V20 by the way. One would even say... ""Flawlessly""."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," Opted out of push notifications, but FoodKick still pushes promo notifications, jerks..."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," This app is ridiculously poor, randomly refuses to log me in even with a reset password. Fresh Direct has terrible tech, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," The option to log in with FreshDirect failed because my FreshDirect account password didn't meet a requirement that FreshDirect doesn't impose but FoodKick does. Fine, app deleted, good bye."
FoodKick,Shopping,2," Consistently logs out after a session, but at least I can modify orders after I place them. Delivery address is somehow misplaced after logging back in…"
FoodKick,Shopping,2, 90% of time the app loads without and items.
FoodKick,Shopping,1, I don't like that you can't see the discount after a promo code is applied. You can only put the promo code in the box then submit your order without knowing whether the discount works. This needs to change then I would give the app a better rating
FoodKick,Shopping,1," Current  app won't let me select a delivery time, so can finish the order"
FoodKick,Shopping,2, This app is just a glorified website. You're probably better off using their real mobile site.
FoodKick,Shopping,1," It's a great service but provides no settings for notifications. I appreciate the delivery notifications but loathe spam. It sends you ads every other day or so. Even if you're into sales, the ads are just reminders to spend more, often with no sales or deals going on. I'd love to be able to disable...Full ReviewIt's a great service but provides no settings for notifications. I appreciate the delivery notifications but loathe spam. It sends you ads every other day or so. Even if you're into sales, the ads are just reminders to spend more, often with no sales or deals going on. I'd love to be able to disable those without disabling my delivery status notifications."
FoodKick,Shopping,3," It's great when it works, but that's not often enough. Half the time I open it, no foods show up so I can't order."
FoodKick,Shopping,1," All of the delivery slots are always filled up, so it really doesn't get to you until 4-5 hours after you order it. What's the point of this app if you have to wait so long...?"
FoodKick,Shopping,3,Nice service but the app is buggy I like Foodkick due to its convenience and selection. The app however has a nasty bug. If the app is minimized and reopened it signs you out. I have to exit and reopen the app to sign in again. It's annoying especially when you are switching between apps.
FoodKick,Shopping,1," Avoid this service. We used FoodKick several times and they never once got our order correct. At least one item was missing every time, which is a real bummer to discover when you're in the middle of a recipe."
FoodKick,Shopping,5,"Very handy Delivery is spot on, delivery attendants are on time and courteous. Filtering in the app itself could be improved, but I really enjoy the convenience."
FoodKick,Shopping,3,"Has improved a lot, but needs a bit more ux Quick chat feature is great and can resolve most questions. Filtering could still be a bit smarter to help you find products quickly. A little unclear on how much meat /cheese you're buying from the counter/deli. Food delivery is a bit slow, but quality so good."
FoodKick,Shopping,1,Useless I tried to search for gluten free options and only got packaged food. I found some prepared meals that looked interesting but there was no allergen or ingredient information. I tried chatting with the support staff and they were very helpful but the app crashed twice while using the chat. I give up.
FoodKick,Shopping,5,"You HAVE to Try it!!! I'm  super impressed with this app, the service (delivery guy) was super courteous and FAST!! And  I got $15 off my first purchase of 30.

The cart doesn't refresh when you delete items, the pop up error messages were blank before but now show cryptic messages. Delivery time slots that are full/unavailable still keep showing as available so you have to keep guessing, going to the next time slot down hoping your order goes through. Also, there is no Android Pay support. Please address this."
FoodKick,Shopping,2," Great concept, poor execution.  The app is a buggy mess, sometimes it works great, sometimes I get error after error.

I've tried to buy things from them multiple times, and have succeeded one time so far.  I really *want* this to work, but most of the time, no good.  This feels like it launched around 3 months early - should've spent more time fixing bugs first."
FoodKick,Shopping,1,Horribly buggy and underdeveloped This is a disgrace of an app. Do some QA before releasing to the public
FoodKick,Shopping,5,Awesome food- FASt Great app and concept. High quality food And booze delivered the same day- what's not to love?
FoodKick,Shopping,5, Nice!
FoodKick,Shopping,5,Amazing What a great app. Amazing look and feel. Easy to navigate. Love it!
FoodKick,Shopping,1,"Misleading They don't serve the neighborhoods they say they serve. You can even try making sure they serve your address by entering your zipcode on the website, but it won't mean anything, you'll learn at the checkout of they really serve or not. I learned the hard way. Don't waste your time"
FoodKick,Shopping,1, Made an order on this and i was unable to log into check status after it passed the delivery time.  Had to call in to cancel my order.  Terrible service.  Its faster to just go to the store to buy what you need.
FoodKick,Shopping,1,"Crashes What a huge waste of time. I tried for 20 minutes to work through their buggy glitchy system. Never did get to order anything for lunch. I wanted to pay you, foodkick! Alas."

Since I stopped using FD years ago, I had no idea what my password was. So, it sent me in circles to create a new one. Once that was done, it refused to recognize it once I tried logging on again!!  Also, be prepared to endure lots of cutesy comments like ""Remembering things is hard!"" and ""Can you input your 'deets' again?""  Who is their target customer?  Kindergarteners?"
FoodKick,Shopping,1,Kept crashing hard to search - immediately uninstalled Kept going to a blank screen and locking - had to chat w/cust svc re my order and it crashed so I had to call. Fd app is awful too so maybe like that this is just better online
FoodKick,Shopping,5,Great app!!! And now on android YEA... Always to my rescue with food and my daily essentials within an hour.
FoodKick,Shopping,5, Love it's functionality.......Renu
FoodKick,Shopping,5, I think this app is good to the people who can't go anywhere
FoodKick,Shopping,1, Enough with the push notifications. No way to turn them off. Deleting.

May want to check into this as my phone is warning that it's draining my battery slowly. ______  This app is fantastic. I use this to show coworkers what a proper ordering app should be. My only request is that the developers put pick-up times in 5 or 10 minute intervals rather than 15 because it can make the difference with the in-store set up.
Fresh Eats Kitchen,Food & Drink,5," Great app. User friendly and like how it gives you ""trending favorite"" suggestions or option to make your own custom order, and saves previous orders. Order food, walk to store and it's ready when I get there. Love it!!"
Fresh Eats Kitchen,Food & Drink,5," Very user friendly. Nice to order fresh food and just pick it up, ready to go."

App keeps crashing...won't allow me to enter the address (doesn't accept zipcode) or use PayPal without crashing. Extremely frustrating given the times and no delivery times available anyway it seems when my girlfriend tries to order on her app. Just wasted an hour putting together a cart and fighting with checkout.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2," Lots of crashing and freezing. With strong cell and wifi service, constant error message that app cannot connect. Very frustrating to use."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3, Used to be a good app but since the February 2020 update it regularly becomes unresponsive and has to be closed when prompted. I have the same experience with both my phone and tablet.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Choppy animations. Hard to make delete button appear in cart. Won't accept my address- says zip code not found, so I'm unable to complete my order and the app is useless. I'm also unable to finish adding an address on the website and this whole app feels like a prototype. Very frustrating."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Where to start....app constantly freezes (Google Pixel 3xl)...finally pushed through entering about 20 items... entering address keeps returning zio code not found over and over. Definitely entering correct zip code, they definitely deliver to my area as neighbors use them. Horrible app!!!!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Just signed up. App won't load. Can't make my first purchase. Very poor first impression.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Love fresh direct, hate the app. It is always crashing."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Regularly stops responding. This was not an issue in previous versions.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Worst app experience ...doesn't accept zipcode and what is the purpose of this app if it does not allow users to buy stuff? I go for web version which works fine.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2," Can't enter my address, for the first time. It tells me *all* NYC zip codes are unavailable and clears the field."
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Terrible app. Things always disappear from my cart prior to checkout.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Bug with identifying zip codes prevents from actually checking out with the app

FreshDirect,Shopping,1, APP works very slowly. I would highly avoid this APP based on my usage and the reviews of others. This business appears unprofessional. The Better Business Bureau should investigate.

FreshDirect,Shopping,5, Easy to use
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, None
FreshDirect,Shopping,3, The app needs an option to view all new products like you can on the website.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2," I can't remember the last time this app actually let me log in. Very

FreshDirect,Shopping,1, I tried to purchase an item with Paypal on this app and it didn't allow me to do that. Not only that but trying other payment options were not accepted.

Unfortunately their staff doesn't. For the prices they charge, they should

them for prepared foods for over 3 years but now the quality has dropped. 
Some of their food is good but it used to be restaurant quality. Not any 
more."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Last update broke the app on my Samsung Galaxy. Picking an item now takes 
10 seconds scrolling is next to impossible. Please fix"
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," FreshDirect completely botched a delivery and ruined my plans for a party 
because of their transition from boxes to bags. I'll be transitioning to a 
better delivery service."
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, This app is not allowing me to sign in anymore. Very frustrating.

FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Buggy. Not even functional
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," The app runs very poorly and gets worse with every update. It is painfully 
slow and logs you out incessantly. It's quicker to go to the store. The app 
also tends to randomly increase the number of items when you are ordering."
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, This app has so many bugs. It's really not as well made as the website. It's hard to get normal things done most of the time and logs you out so frequently.
FreshDirect,Shopping,3," The app is good but there's a bug in the quantity when you shop from past orders. I just don't understand why it's not 1 by default.

FreshDirect,Shopping,1, It doesn't work anymore. Cannot sign in.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Difficult to navigate, doesnt remember to keep you signed in, constantly asks for address even after signing in, and loading screen can take over 1 minute. I never use the app if possible and rely on the website. Clearly, the development team doesn't pay attention to reviews. Simply terrible design."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3," Maybe it's just me but I can add anything to my ""lists."" I see things I know I'll need but not yet and the only option I have is to add them to my cart. That's not a very good experience."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Create new account, then log in. ""Whoops Something went wrong"". Yeah, you lost a new customer."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3, It crashes a lot
FreshDirect,Shopping,5, I will buy Vegetables and Fruits Fresh Period. 😊
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Terrible app! I spent 30 minutes creating a shopping cart. The app then crashed and didn't retrieve my cart. Just not worth it. Uninstalled.

I'm going back to Amazon where the people who deliver aren't the best either but at least the food is not damaged."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, So many probs! Reserve a time and doesn't always stick. Open the app and it doesn't automatically load your account information. It says I'm logged in but my information such as previous orders does ss not pop up.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, App is pretty clunky but the selection and service itself are what keep getting more expensive and worse. At this point I'd recommend a competitor.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Fresh Direct is great but the app has a lot of issues. It makes it very difficult to place an order and navigate. I keep waiting for them to fix the bugs but it hasn't gotten any better.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, OLD APP WAS WAY BETTER!
FreshDirect,Shopping,4," New version takes looong time to load, but overall I have had good luck with the app and with FreshDirect in general. UPDATE 7/7/17: load time is faster, but sometimes it doesn't recognize me, as if I'm logged out. Frustrating."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Malicious! Do not download! It does not let you create an account withoutgiving them your entire contact database! This is malicious!

FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Worst app. Slow. Links don't work. Makes shopping more difficult than on the website.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Very clumsy interface but actually better regarding responsiveness to the mobile app.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Never loads, freezes, terrible app for a good sevice"
FreshDirect,Shopping,3, Clunky
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Love FD but the new version of the app is so slow - to the point I can't actually use it to buy groceries. The only redeeming feature is that I can see the final prices of items in the cart more clearly. It constantly just shuts down. Please fix!!
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Doesn't not load properly. Unable to see items in my cart and when I try to look for products it just keeps loading.  For now I will stick with the web version.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Seems like they went back time with the new version of the app.Much slower harder to get to work than the one before.Their website isn't much better.
FreshDirect,Shopping,5, Love the new app much cleaner and more responsive. Lightning fast on new s6 edge plus  but Sluggishr phone but that's more Android issue than an app problem
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, Sluggish response times and kept crashing - gave up
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," The last updated sucks! It order when I didn't press ""order""! Please fix it"
FreshDirect,Shopping,3," Version 4.0.3 seems to work OK on my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone running Android 6.0.1.  However, when I try to install on my Verizon Ellipsis 8 tablet running Android 4.4.2, I get Version 2.9.5 of FreshDirect, which does not work.

Not sure what's going on over there but you're losing business due to bad app support.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,No place to enter coupon codes! This app is a scam. It also didn't take off $50 for my 2nd order. All these apps are designed to gather your data and not for your benefit.

I use this app daily and am about ready to give up on FD if these issues aren't fixed soon.  Update 01/31/2017: 10 months later and the app crashes less often, but still often enough to be very frustrating! Also, ""past orders"" and ""saved lists"" are always empty on the app (but work on the full website). Love FD, and the full website is great, but the app is a pain sometimes... Which is a shame because it would be so much more convenient than using the computer if it actually functioned properly."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,"Shopping lists still don't work Shopping lists and past orders STILL don't work. In the app, they come up blank, even when they should not.  These two features stopped working over a year ago, and still haven't been fixed. For a grocery store that is entirely online, that's kind of embarrassing, no? Fix it."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Unreliable app Can't access shopping list or previous orders on Samsung tablet. Used to work, doesn't anymore."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,App isnt perfect You can't pull up an old shopping list and shop from a prior order on the app (although it claims it can be done.) This makes online food shopping harder and more labor intensive.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Horrible Don't bother downloading. Never connects, always crashes, no place for coupon codes."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,"Come on guys... The Quickshop features do not work anymore. I'll select either ""Past Orders"" or ""All Items Ordered"", and it tells me that no items can be found. Also, the customer service phone number is no longer available on the button in the Contact Us menu."
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,Updated terms broke the app Updated terms of service and when I press 'I agree' it gives me an error screen. It continues to give me error that I cannot connect to fresh direct I believe as a result of me not agreeing to the terms.
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,Fix past orders items page The app is not that great. It gets errors frequently causing you to have to go in and out of it too much. Also past orders are never shown. This is the biggest bug it has.

Often after I reserve a delivery time, I check out and isn't available (but is on my desktop). I tell them every week and they don't fix it. When I enter words in the search box on my S4, it suppresses the word options so I I have get the words exactly right and they also don't put spaces between the words. I can't save to my list from the mobile app."

I still use it and it is so helpful when I am physically unable to walk and stand for a long period of time. The app is so very useful, thank you! Also, customer service staff and deliverers are so professional and courteous!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,app fails on checkout FD is 5 stars in quality and service but had been devastatingly terrible upon checkout for existing reservations.  Timeslots get compromised and are lost far too often in the final step.  Why the tech team does not respond to/address the issue that has existed for years is beyond me.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Meh Love FD but this app is awful. The cart is often out of synch with my cart in my computer. It is very slow and poorly organized.... . Recent update still stinks.  Often have to force close. And loses my reserved delivery times.  Update: still the worst app on my phone. Please fix!
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,App worked great until 2 weeks ago I've been using this app on android for over a year. 2 weeks ago the app started to fail everytime I tried to check out. Can't modify an order either without the app force stopping. I sent FD an email with screenshots but I'm frustrated that they still haven't fixed the issue.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Still worse than the iPad app Freshdirect has a wonderful iPad app, but Android users have to put up with a vastly inferior experience.

It's still extraordinarily difficult to add items to an existing order without changing delivery or payment details. These issues directly affect FreshDirect's revenue so why aren't they addressed? Perhaps FD believes only iPad owners buy groceries."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Fails and freezes a lot Please update this app. I don't use the website and keeps me from ordering all the time. If rather go to the store than dream with this app's bugs.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,This app doesn't work As soon as I installed and load the app up it says that the app can not connect to fresh direct server . dev you guys need to first make sure the app actually works before putting it out there.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,No longer opens on my Nexus 6 Can no longer even use the app after last update. Running Android M preview 2 on Nexus 6. Crashes immediately after logging in or stalls for upwards of a minute on logging in and then crashes.
FreshDirect,Shopping,4,"Like it, but would love a coupon They have great deals for new customers, but for their existing customers, there is just sales on certain foods. Like can I get 20% off my order once in a while. I order there a lot, but I like to save one just as much as the next person."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Waste of a half hour App works right up until you have entered in a half hour of shopping and address data.... then it says all three of my credit cards are not correct credit card numbers. Galaxy s5

FreshDirect,Shopping,5,"Fresh in the City Being new to NYC I was not sure where to get my food.  I need value and quality in one location.  With Fresh Direct, I also found convenience.    The app is easy to use, the food is great, and the delivery service is professional and timely.  Kudos to Fresh Direct!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,Reservations I am also experiencing the app not showing my reserved delivery timeslot. I have to finish checkout on my laptop. Droid MAXX running Android 4.4.4
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Terrible app Great service, but the app is awful."
FreshDirect,Shopping,2, App doesn't recognize already reserved time slots.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Still installing?? Its been 3 hours and I still can't load the app....even restarted the phone.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Not sure Wont let me signup because I cannot enter my first and last name

FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Love the service, app sucks, and has for years Has been buggy for years. Cannot modify orders without being forced to select alternative delivery times. Have reported bugs years back and it still sucks."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Unusably crashy Not stable enough to ever complete an order. Keeps crashing, and when it does, the cart is emptied."

FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Worst App EVER How does an internet company put out such a crap app?  Every time I use it I curse it and have to go back to the website to fix whatever it screwed up with my order.  Plus it doesn't work with tablets??

Of course,  the gift card digitally vanished as a result and I still wait to use a gift given to me over a month ago. I also just tried the app which offers no info about or ability to use a gift card. FD has been around for how long now? GET IT TOGETHER."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Worthless app. No wonder Amazon ate their lunch.

The company has never seemed to value design much, but the website has always been acceptable.  The app is slow, hard to use, has poor information density, and in general looks and feels like an IOS app from when the iPhone first came out.  It's a shame. I avoid using the app whenever I can."
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,"I want to love it.... Would be fine if this were iOS, but since this is for Android it desperately needs a face lift. Also, loading images on the UI thread? That's just lazy. Look into the Picasso library and your app will run much smoother"
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,NO TABLET VERSION - WHY? Almost everyone has a tablet and the lack of this app in tablet version makes little sense.  Would like to see this happen
FreshDirect,Shopping,5,Easy. Intuitive. Pretty! Laid out just like walking the aisles. Great ease of selection. Gorgeous pictures actually depicting the actual product.
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,Chrashed ALL the time This app chrashes or freezes more or less every time I use it. Especially if adding to cart from previous orders. I don't know how many times I've lost the content in my chart.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, This app is constantly crashing or freezing.
FreshDirect,Shopping,5, I Will give it a chance to see if it works. I will make it known if it works stand by. And I Will let you know if it don't work.

FreshDirect,Shopping,4,It works Previous versions were faulty for sure. However the recent update seems to be working fine for me. It's actually a pretty decent app.

FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Cannot paste text into login fields I was unable to login because I could not cut and paste my password from my password manager into the login text fields. The 'paste' button disappears as soon as you lift your finger off the screen.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Most buggy app ever encountered Crashes constantly, expect 10+ times to place a order of 15 items. Add a few items to your cart, then it crashes and empties your cart, or sometimes just removes a few random items from it. Horrible app."
FreshDirect,Shopping,4,Works great Would get a 5star if you didn't have to log in again every time you want to order. The logon info should get saved
FreshDirect,Shopping,4,Excellent App! Easier than using the website and I NEVER say that. 5th star for adding list management.

FreshDirect,Shopping,5,"Thank you! Been waiting for this app to hit Android forever, as it was on iOS since early 2010. Does everything I need to place my grocery orders remotely"

FreshDirect,Shopping,5,Great app Finally!
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,"Drops items This app drops items from your shopping cart, even though the items are in stock. If you shop by recipe instead of by an itemized list, you can expect to check out and miss items you know you added but have been deleted from your cart. It measures me not want to shop with fresh direct."
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Fix it please! I use fresh direct for almost all my food shopping, it's so frustrating not to be able to use my nexus 7 for it. App is pretty bad on my galaxy s3 as well. Please work on it!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Doesn't work For ICS or above this app is totally useless. I use fresh direct for all my shopping and it would be nice if you actually made an app that works. Hire a new developer or something and listen to them.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Good luck even entering your address. Sat the phone down for 30 minutes meanwhile the icon to find my address kept spinning. Haha never did a damn thing
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Garbage Cannot view anything without creating an account.  Tried to create an account automatically with my g+ login and the app imploded.  Now it won't even present the login screen.  It just shows the preloader spinning 4ever.  This is junk guys.  If you need a good programmer my rate is $120/hr
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Didn't Work for me 😕 The app kept running on my Samsung Galaxy S5 acting as if it was installing but after about 3 minutes I gave up.  I'll see if the website will be a better option.  Good Luck.✌
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,"Pretty embarassing This app barely works.  Lack of tablet support is inexcusable.  All this is exasperated by the fact that their site is nearly unusable in the 3 major android browsers.  Pretty pisspoor considering there business model of convenient, premium food sold ON THE INTERNET."
FreshDirect,Shopping,4,"Need to open up app to tablets too! Easy to use app. Fast and simple. Makes it easy to order from previous orders as well. Works well on Samsung Epic 4g, but not compatible with the galaxy tab... c'mon!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,Same as everyone else Relied on the reorder function and now it's gone. Get that unable to connect thing too. Emailed them about it and they asked me for a screenshot of it. Are they not reading these comments?
FreshDirect,Shopping,3,Can't reduce quantity App doesn't allow me to reduce quantity to 0 of a previously ordered item. Very annoying. Otherwise UI pretty good.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Previous ordered items no longer works making this app close to useless for quick shopping. No caching of pages. This really is a poor excuse for an app.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1, Just shut it down and fix! Doesn't recognize my password or email. So much for convenience!
FreshDirect,Shopping,1,It's impossible to use it It's been months since the beginning of troubles...but nobody try to fix this app...it's a shame !
FreshDirect,Shopping,2,Doesn't sync with website Changes on app don't reflect online and vice versa. That goes for cart and reservations.
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Horrible. And then mobile site doesn't take some data. Boy, I wasted my golden 30 minutes until I read the reviews that confirmed it all!"
FreshDirect,Shopping,1," Like other GNex users, app crashes when I pick a product. Too bad."

Tried another email thinking I used a different one. Nope. Tried resetting password and it doesn't recognize the email. I enter my phone number and it tells me I already have an account. What the hell is going on? I'm beyond frustrated and apparently lost my points I earned. I'm pissed.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," After the update I couldn't log in. Tried every password combo imaginable. Tried password recovery and the app shows an error saying ""enter valid email"".

Tried every password combo imaginable. Tried password recovery and the app shows an error saying ""enter valid email"". Went to the spendgo site, same problem. Tried using my points in-store with my phone number and they get an error saying I ""have not completed registration""... Try to register on the spendgo site and it says my number is already registered. No contact info on the spendgo site. Idk what else to try. gg goodcents, you got me. What a rip off"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Limited options to edit selections. If you typo your card info it will not tell you so, just that there's an ambiguous error and to try again later. By the time I figured out that it was an expression date error and fixed it, the app had locked me out with no specific reason why."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Got the updated app and I was able to sign in. It there is no way to actually order food? And after trying to figure it out I now can't get back in.

And after trying to figure it out I now can't get back in. Please revert the app back or do a major update as the app has literally no purpose. I can see my profile, Points, Activity, and a description of the Penny Club but can't order delicious sandwiches. :("
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," The new update made it a little difficult. You have to reset your password in order to access your account again. It was a pop up Instruction on the app after the update. Once this is complete the app works perfectly, I was able to order online and it had all my reward points."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, I was told to reinstall the application because they switched to a new provider or something along those lines the points on my app where showing 9.44 and in the store they said I only had 160 but a quick reinstall would fix everything but now it tells me my number is taken and password recovery wil...Full ReviewI was told to reinstall the application because they switched to a new provider or something along those lines the points on my app where showing 9.44 and in the store they said I only had 160 but a quick reinstall would fix everything but now it tells me my number is taken and password recovery will not work because my email that's registered to literally everything I have is some how not registered to this app any more very bad app host/provider
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," The old app was great! Why are my points no longer showing since I updated the app. Also i noticed that the new app sells your information, WHY??? I want the old app back."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," The developers got rid of the ""pay at store"" option, so it forces you to enter your card info. No thanks"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," POS...had to uninstall my app to install new version, now I can't log in at all. Beyond frustrated!!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," I loved the app, I updated it and now I can't log in i can't do anything on the app."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Worthless app. Ever since the last update, I am unable to log in and it doesn't recognize me."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," You might want to tell your customers that they need to install the app in order to get points. I was told points were accumulating on my phone number everytime I placed an order. I've been to your store dozens of times before downloading the app, and I have zero points."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Super easy to use! Love it and Good cents food is always delicious 😋
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Not user friendly. Old app was better. The collection of personal information in the user agreement seems shady. If it wasn't for helping my father with his order I would never use this app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," By now your company has realized that the update has severely damaged the online ordering base of your customers.

I could say what everyone else is pointing out about the new app/update; however, I'll simply state that your company is about to lose a lot of loyal customers because you didn't test the update rollout and you're about to provide (sell) customers personal information to other companies. Sometimes it's better to be loyal to people who are making your business a success. Fix the App."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, There is no way to check your rewards points without starting an order. This is a bad design.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Simple functioning and it gets the job done!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Had to reinstall and now it won't let me in.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," The new app, and even online, is a big no go for me now so I wont be using the new app and I won't be signing in online.

It just sucks I can't order from an app anymore or know what rewards I could have, I guess no more free birthday sub. >_>"

I can't log in and now am unable to use the app to order sandwiches and I'm pissed because I had over $30 in my reward points. I will no longer go to goodcents because they have taken away the use of this app and it can't be updated. I guess goodcents doesn't care about losing customers! The app is now worthless....plus loosing over $30 in reward points. GOOD JOB GOODCENTS"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Always easy to navigate. Given the current circumstance it's a life saver for our house being able to order meat and bread. It's far cheaper and better quality. Thanks!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," New app is HORRIBLE! Won't allow me to log into my acct and keeps telling me my email is invalid, but won't allow me to create a new account because my#and email are already registered."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, New app has disagreable data sharing policies. I ordered my food as a guest and won't be using Mr.Goodcents nearly as often as I once did. That's a shame. I'm a big fan.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Says an update is needed, but no updates are published to Google play. Developer must have screwed up the rollout. As we do."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Trash app. No actual update available on the app store, reset password option makes you agree to personal info being pimped out to god knows who. Goodcents screwed the pooch on this one, and I've lost all my loyalty points."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, Love the app. However when it comes time to do an app up grade your completely locked out of using your points until you completely abide by the up grade.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Worked great until the update. Now i can't log in, even after resetting my password."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, App does not work. Cannot get an order in because of a big constantly asking to upgrade there version when no upgrade is available.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, New app is so much easier than the old one. Sandwiches are always good! Hi
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Doesn't work anymore. Wants me to download a new app I can't find. Has like 50+ popups telling me to do that with a link I can't click.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Will NOT use the new app. They are using a company that sells your info. No thanks. Sorry goodcents, you lost a loyal customer. Hit me up when you change it back and maybe I'll come back. Too many sub shops to use one that wants to sell my name number and address to others"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," App login no longer works. Takes you to an external website that fails to connect due to ""unknown protocol."""
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, Normally great app. Cannot find vendor currently and will not allow me to report problem. Will be a 5 star app when rectified.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Lost my reward points with newest version and it won't let me log in, say to update when I already have and have reinstalled the app. What happened?"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, No way to find rewards in the new app. Made me reset my password. Horrible migration and trash app. Uninstalling as this is useless now for me.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," It's pretty good. It does what you'd expect. I'd really like the option to select ""lite"" or ""easy"" on things like condiments. Another area for improvement is including real-time delivery alerts."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Makes you look in to different web based app. Down not make sense. Old app much better.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Keeps telling me to update the app and get the latest version but goes straight to the one I already have.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Doesn't work. Doesn't recognize the store that is less than 2 miles from my house. Have to agree to let app provider give my information to all sorts of different businesses.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," The Goodscents company is no longer a client of theirs. I had issues logging in, so I emailed them and that is what the told me. Along with you should uninstal the app because it is no longer any use to me."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," The app is good, nice and simple. BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER THE APP IS ADEQUATE AND NEEDS NOTHING Else, but it would be nice if you could start a custom sub instead of having to choose one of the options and adjusting it to your liking.

BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER THE APP IS ADEQUATE AND NEEDS NOTHING Else, but it would be nice if you could start a custom sub instead of having to choose one of the options and adjusting it to your liking. For example I get a BLT and there is no BLT option or custom option so I end up modifying the veggie one. It doesn't bother me much especially since the App saves your orders so it's easier the next time around, however it just makes sense to have a custom one."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, App keeps saying I need to upgrade n won't let me do anything. This is ever since I updated it.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," When I open the app, it says it's needs to be updated (or upgraded). I come here and there is no update option."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, The app keeps saying it's out of date but there are no updates in the Google Play Store.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, Works well for ordering but could use some work as far as accuracy of what's available at each location and convenience when it comes to getting points for what you've ordered. You should be able to scan your receipts to get points as well.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, The app was fine except when you went to put in special request every time you hit the button and it kept pushing you out and wouldn't let you make any special requests. It did let you do it at the end but not where you wanted to for each item.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, This app is fantastic. The rewards program is the simplest and most rewarding that I've ever used. I love the new Goodcents sandwiches.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," To me this is a GREAT app! I have only ever navigated the app and havent used it to order anything yet.

I love that my In-store purchases count towards my points, the convince to place an order any time makes me smile. I have no idea why people down vote this app. The food is great the, the app is easy to use. 10/10 in my book."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," I'm having problems with the app not transmitting my full order to the store yet charging me the price for the full order. my app history has all items, the store ticket they fill the order from does not. yet the total charged is the full order total on their ticket, though an item is missing."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Always have loved Goodcents over all the other sandwich shops. Prices are cheaper. Food is fresher. App is easy to navigate. You get 10% reward directly for food orders. You can also add notes about each order.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Great app to order goodcents! The response of each screen is nice, choosing your toppings and sandwich are easy, and scanning your card at checkout is helpful. Love the rewards program, too!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Fast and easy to use. Needs more detail on little things like how many ounces are in a cup vs. a bowl of soup. Overall great savings, and convenient for quick service."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Only used it a few times so far but it is simple and has a clean interface.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Always easy to use. Love how easy it is to go back and change things. Super simple makes it super user friendly. Makes placing an order very convenient!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Can't see my points anymore. Just shows that I can order after updating and logging in.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, app is great but Mr Goodcents where I live their machine didn't take my rewards nor did it do it last time they're having some type of problem with it and im sad wont let me add my birthday keeps saying I need a 10 number and my cell number is 10 digets
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Terrible app! Originally, I could place a takeout order and pay with gift card or cash when I arrived. Now the only option is a credit card which I don't use."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, The app is nice and easy to navigate. Need to have other options listed (with prices) when adding other ingredients.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, Took awhile to figure out how to delete an item in the cart. It took a process of trying different things as there was no where that it explained how to do it....you had to press down and hold on items to delete.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," The app is pretty good, the biggest issue is the lack of customization allowed when building your sandwhich if they fixed this it would be the best sandwich phone app."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," One big flaw: cannot enter gift cards for payment, and you must play through the app, so you can't use them to pay when you pick up."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, App in very slow loading. Terrible has been timrs rakes ovet a hour to load. Plus tge rewards program free birthday sub just changed from have 30 days to kt it to niw only 4 days why??
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Very slow interface! Could be more intuitive. But does the job, eventually."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Was told I had to update and change my password to order food. Why would I go through all that for something I use once every other month. Don't make it hard for me to order or I won't.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Ordered from the app and the time for it to be ready kept changing and they ran out of wheat bread before 5pm. How the freak do you run out of a main bread you serve. I wanted wheat because it's less fattening and I had to freaking settle for white bread. Never again will I be ordering from noland r...Full ReviewOrdered from the app and the time for it to be ready kept changing and they ran out of wheat bread before 5pm. How the freak do you run out of a main bread you serve. I wanted wheat because it's less fattening and I had to freaking settle for white bread. Never again will I be ordering from noland roads location again.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Like being able to order exactly what I want on the sandwiches, but I wish it would give you the choice of drink and chips OR drink and cookie before you get to the check out."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Every since the last upgrade, I can't get in to order. It is a worthless app now. Go back to what you had. Until then, I'll go elsewhere."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Very simple to use. Only complaint would be this...the store I order from has Mrs.Vickys Salt & Vinegar chips, but it's not an option to select when placing an order, so I alwyas have to remember to add a note when I order."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, The app works great after you get the initial set up completed. Save your favorite sandwich for easy ordering on the go.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Claims that it delivers to my entire town. When the delivery option is chosen, it says i am outside of the delivery zone. I'm in the middle of town so there's a glitch for sure. Bummer, goodcents is so good!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Absolutely worth it. Love there food an Love the app. Helps me save cash on food an drinks. Soo, glad I downloaded the app."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," The app should allow you to remember a ""favorite"" location so you don't always have to choose a location off of the map for pick-up."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Doesnt work since update on January 28!... why do you have to mess up a good thing!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," I love using the app to put the order in but there was no way to go back and change anything once I submitted it to the order, before checking out. That sucks!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, It's very easy and fast to place your order. You can find everything you need to make your sandwhich. If you want to remove something it's also easy to do that.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, I love the app but I wish they would put a additional button for pepperoni! you cant add pepperoni to your sandwiches! but other then that the app is amazing
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, This app sucks. I have tried numerous times to download and install.....it will not. It will not allow me to troubleshoot either.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Love it! Everything works, it's super easy and convenient."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," usually i hav trouble with your app (mostly user error, I'm sure) but it went great this time! 😃"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, I love this place! Always taste super fresh and they deliver! ANDDDD-THEY HAVE TATER TOTS!!! What else could you ask for? HAHA! Also-their app is really easy to use!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, They updated the app and the new version barely works and is literally garbage!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, love this app! Saves orders and ready to pick up in 20 minutes. rewards as well 😋
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, Don't like the way the app is set up plz go back to the old version or something similar to it it was easier to use
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," I would give it 5 stars, but not being able to use gift cards on the app is a real inconvenience."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Gets the job done, very easy to navigate through options."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, I like GC but disappointed in the app. Really wanted nutritional information but it cannot be accessed through the app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Didn't apply rewards balance to order. Can't customize a sandwich such as tomato only on half, can't use Google pay, ordering through app shouldn't be the only way to get rewards."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, good ordering app. has memory. doesnt crash. would be 5 stars if you could add points later from reciept.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Easy to customize and save order as well as rack up rewards.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Easy to use and a great way to keep track of reward points
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Usually works great. Handy to repeat orders that are favorites.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, It works. The interface is probably one of the better ones I've seen for fast food apps. Now make me a sandwich!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Favorites is hard to spot and should be easier to navigate to previous/last order
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love this app. Saves you money and easy to order.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," you have to watch the time and date that you select to pick up, it keeps changing it back to the defauled time and date"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," works good, wish I could order just a cookie and not have order a drink with it. otherwise would be 5 stars."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, It's so easy to use and my food is always ready when I get there. They are always busy but no waiting in line for me!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," It is easy to build the sandwich, but it is really hard to change your order."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, They could not have made this any easier. I just love it!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Great app. Should consider making flatbread an option.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Great app easy to use and great rewards
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Won't give me the option to update but my account says that I have to in order to access my points.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Last update broke app completely.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, app is easy to navigate.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, App is easy and quick!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, I can't use the app because it's out of date and there is no update.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Need to make it where, if you have a receipt and they didn't ask for rewards at register you can scan receipt"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, It's ok can get orders in but need a place to leave notes per item. Like light mayo or mustard.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love it
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, App needs to give delivery option not just say your address is not in range...when the store is a mile from my location :|
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, It's missing spinach on the list of add on veggies.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love the app. Simple to use. Wish that you offered diet mountain dew as a drink choice. Really love the food.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Have written 3 times re not being credited with 50.00 in points with no 
reply"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, A short review
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love this app!!!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, I love it
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works great
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Tasty McTasty
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Always super slow! I have to put my order in twice because it kicks me out. 
I try to use my rewards but it doesn't come off my bill... This app this 
the worst! DO NOT USE!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Absolutely love the app. But be warned. It does NOT include the delivery 
charge in your total when you check out. Just made an order that was $25 
and when they guy got here it was $27. So now I feel like a cheap ass only 
tipping $3."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Love their food! Love their driver's! And when I mess up my order, which 
happens often... They always are quick to call me! ❤"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Does what it's supposed to. Do wish it had an option to ""Set Home Store"" or 
something like that rather than having to search by location each time 
though. I rarely order from a different store/location."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Navigation is user friendly. The location I order from typically doesn't 
have an ASAP choice on delivery time so you have to add it in the notes, or 
else they won't deliver for about an hour. Also about half the time their

have an ASAP choice on delivery time so you have to add it in the notes, or 
else they won't deliver for about an hour. Also about half the time their 
driver doesn't show up, so you submit your order then they call about five 
minutes later telling you they cant deliver. So either you go pick it up 
yourself (already charged a delivery fee) or wait for a refund. If they 
cant deliver, take the option away before we submit the order or notify us 
before we spend our money."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," It would be a five star but you only get rewards for card purchase and 
that's not really fair"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Much easier than their website. Took me 2 minutes to order my favorite sub.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Love the ease of use as well how many details for sandwiches are available. 
I also like the ability to add my penny club points balance to my order 
total."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Chesterfield store is amazing, they are always clean, quick and precise! 
Thanks!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," I mean, it works and does what I need it to do."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love this app and so easy to use and the good is the best sandwiches in town
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Great way to order a sub
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Nice simple app to order delivery or takeout
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Awesome Possum So Far!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works well
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Very convenient. Rewards are awesome
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," I only ordered online to receive the points and the store stopped 
delivering 50 minutes before the time they said. I had to pick up the order 
which was wrong and they took my points away. Bread was soggy by the time 
they told me they were not delivering. Go to Jimmy John's. Way better."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Horrible. Every address I put in is outside of every store's delivery area. Have tried different delivery locations, have called stores to ensure my address is in their area and they assure me it is. Very disappointed."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Delivery was late and my order wrong. So i prefer to pick up to watch them prepare my food. The app is convenient for storing favorite orders and keeping track of points
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," The new app is garbage. I can't order children's drinks, i cant make notes about my sandwich, and the customization options are much more complicated than they used to be. Not a fan."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Well I have worked here and the employees of gardner Ks are still professional the food is great without a doubt on each order does not matter what my wife and I order on top of it all they have a great deal on their weekly toasted subs wonderful place crossed with excellent food and customer servic...Full ReviewWell I have worked here and the employees of gardner Ks are still professional the food is great without a doubt on each order does not matter what my wife and I order on top of it all they have a great deal on their weekly toasted subs wonderful place crossed with excellent food and customer service.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," It's an ok app overall, but the navigation is horrible. The fact that you 
have to reverse through your previous sandwich to add more than one is 
annoying."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Very rough app. Not a smooth interaction. Not user friendly and too may 
limitations. Simple option to order a cookie by itself is a basic example."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, I love mr. Goodcents so to be able that put in my order on a nap and have it delivered?! That's just gravy
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love your app so easy to use. Will never eat at another sub shop.  The store I ordered from is amazing.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Wanted to order chips and cookies no drink. App forced me to order a drink, 
and didn't get cookies because I would have had to order another drink."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Can't find a store to deliver, despite calling the store and ordering delivery just fine."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," This app is so confusing to and when trying to check out, the app keeps changing information."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works great! Only thing I would add would be estimated delivery times
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Needs a better way back to add additional items. Once you add an item the only way back is to click back repeatedly. Needs a back to menu or continue ordering etc.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, App is very easy to use. Have had no trouble with it. Love the subs!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Best samiches in town + they deliver, makes Goodsence to go to Goodcents 6 STARS"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," App won't update, I uninstalled, cleared cache, and still get error code 
after install. No other app I have does this."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Good ap, could not access kids meals while ordering and my kids will definitely not eat a while 6 in."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, App would benefit from an auto return to menu after your order is placed for multiple order input
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Me & my husband LOVE Mr.Goodcents, better than Subway."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, It works great and it never messes up my order
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, One of the easiest apps I've ever used!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, First on line order. We shall see if it works properly
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love the new look!😎

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Really good app
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Very handy
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Good food
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Great
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Haven't had any issues so far. I think it would be cool to see previous orders without having to go all the way through an order though... maybe I'm missing something.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," This AP IS Bs, i tried to use my rewards to order and it just freezes every time rendering it useless.  They only allow you to use your rewards when ordering on thia AP.  It's Useless"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," If go in to change something you have to fix times for pick up. Also of my order is 7.00 and i have 3.00 on loyalty, would be nice to have the option to use it and then pay diffrence with card."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, I love this app. Tells me how much I have in rewards and let's me choose pick up time for my order.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works great. Use it multiple times each week. No errors yet. Local store always delivers ahead of scheduled time!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, I would like it if you could find your last order and total in the app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, Great except i can't delete something I don't want so now I have to just go there anyway or order as a guest.  A delete item would be nice.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Quick and easy to order from this app location kinda iffy sometimes but so far it's great👍
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Good app, easy and functional. Kids meal has no option to add condiments to sandwich or change from rainbow bread."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, It sucks doesn't work
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works great every time. Use it to get lunch delivered to my office often
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, always concise and very quick! they have never given me a wrong order!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," App works great, just needs a method to modify an order from the cart"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Very easy to use I love it the rewards are awesome too
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, It's super simple and has everything I need.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, This app is so simple to use and very detailed.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Been there many times great service and food.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Quick, easy way to make delivery order."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, Needs a build your own sub option.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4," Quick, easy and saves a load of time!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Works exactly as you would hope.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Great app hands down!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Easy, Fast, good descriptions & pictures"

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Good sandwiches
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Great
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Dont like the new program at all. They hardly ever ask you for your info in the store so you dont get points for your purchases.  The punch cards were much better.  Com e up with a better system!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, The app is okay to redeem my points wish I could redeem my points in store instead of having to download this app on my phone and the ordering does not give you all of the options that the store inside does you do not have everything listed that the store offers inside maybe you should fix that prob...Full ReviewThe app is okay to redeem my points wish I could redeem my points in store instead of having to download this app on my phone and the ordering does not give you all of the options that the store inside does you do not have everything listed that the store offers inside maybe you should fix that problem
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Firehouse Subs lets you redeem points in-store, they usually tell me ""You have free sub, would you like to redeem?"" I have a cheap Straight Talk phone & I can't have an app for everything just not enough storage on my phone. I signed up then deleted the app."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3," Seems to have issues with delivery orders, every time I put in for delivery, it gives me the takeout menu!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Useless app, I don't order online."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Works great,  unless you put an order in & THEN sign in..  have to redo the whole order... blah. Otherwise, easy and quick."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, It's a great app. A delivery tracker would be nice
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Really like the reward points and saved pmt info feature.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Online App rewards versus in store card punch.  App is good and efficient.  Easy e-commerce transactions
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love this app and how easy it is to use!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Would like to see it have the ability to show extra/light on an item chosen.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, App works great!!! Espically when I have my hands full with the kids or do not have access to my computer!!!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Best food order app I have used.  So quick and easy
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love the app! Got a free sub today!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Better than the old ordering online!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Yummmmm.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," App defalted back to my home address even though i changed it and it placed my order twice. Paid for food to be delivered to my work, it wasnt and management told me only that id get my food when i got home."

There were minor issues - like it insisted that I enter my birthday but only offered 6 months to choose from!?? Weird. The reason I deducted a star from this otherwise perfect experience was due to the delivery time option. I was so happy to see that I could select the time for my order to be delivered (so it would arrive right before my company). However, my delivery arrived 25 minutes before my selected time - leading me to believe that they didn't even notice the order had a later delivery time. On the receipt - the requested delivery time was in HUGE bold print! If they are going to offer this option, they need to provide it. Otherwise, seriously great app and service!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Have to enter a valid credit card just to use this app, even if you have enough reward points to not require one. Slow, constantly reminds you to turn on location services that aren't required."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," I like the app overall and was easy to set up period however when I went into the Gardner Kansas store, they told me I could only used by a points online ordering.

Was very discouraging as I had plenty of points for my family and I to get a free meal and when I asked the cashier he said only on online orders even though the app says use your points at anytime.  Makes no sense!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, This app is kind of jankey. The ordering page is outdated and very basic. The real problem is that after you place an order there is not way to track it. There is no.way to even verify the order has been submitted or received by the store.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, It doesn't have all of the choices.. like the pepper bread or sea salt & vinegar chips etc...
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, App was great until this last update...WHY does it need access to my camera!  Will be deleting the app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, So Easy!  Just reordered my favorite just the way I like it and paid for it in less than 4 minutes!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, Not able to order full menu on app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, App was difficult to sign up for and use the first time today went much better
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Awesome love it best thing they've came up with better than carrying cards
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3, A bit difficult to use
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5," Works well, no issues. Usually discount of some sort available"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love the app & the worker at my store
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Great app for order ahead and pick-up.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2, Couldn't use my points at store..kinda of useless..

Why is it a rewards app when you can't redeem rewards and the employees know nothing about it?"

It would be much better if I could order in the shop and then just scan something on the app to add my points. And where's the dine in option? All my subs are wrapped to go now thanks to only being able to order take out. Also, the rate at which you earn a free sub is ridiculous compared to the cards. As a long term customer and former Goodcents employee, I'm disappointed."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3,"The good..The bad Very convenient, fast and easy. I get points here and on my punch card! App is easy to use...Except.... Please change it so you have to check everything you want don't have it checked by default."

There is no way to use points on newer menu items such as the sensible sandwiches...would get another full star for sure if the menu was kept up to date. I'm stuck ordering a sandwich I don't want or ordering through the app while in store so I can tell them what I really want before it's made; leaving then to scramble with price differences! My store is awesome btw and always make it work for us :)
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," I'm unable to use my rewards points. Every time I try to it says either balance with cash or balance with card, neither of which uses the points I've accumulated."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2," I love Mr. Goodcents but this app is so terrible and buggy. It's a real inconvenience to use, I only use it for the promotions."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," I've placed 2 orders over $40 since enrolling in the rewards program, and neither has credited to my account, despite it being a week and two weeks later. WORTHLESS"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,"Promo codes are BS I get a pop up notification with a promo code, enter my order, put in the code and an told it is not valid. Bye."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3,"Worked fine with one exception It doesn't give me the option to get just chips with my sandwich. Drink and chips, drink and cookie or drink and apples. I just wanted chips."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,Could be better The drink options on the app should include all the things they have in that huge coke fountain machine they have. Otherwise great.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Won't let me use my points. Tried contacting via email.....no response. Cant use my points. Store dosent know what's wrong. Can't use my points. Error message.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,Had to redo order several times It crashes all the time and did not see an option to remove a sub from the cart before placing order.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,"Good, could be better The app works great for sandwiches, but you can't individually add sides and drinks. You have to add Drink AND Chips, or Drink AND cookie. What if I just want a drink?"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2,Promo codes I get pop up promo codes then try to use them and they say not valid.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Preordering Is Awesome I love that I can order my sandwich ahead of time now. Makes my lunch hour less of a rush.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, What good is it... Takeout/delivery why not dine in ? Does my GC have a delivery and drive thru.....NO.   will be deleted
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Easy to use Very easy to use, glad I can easily apply reward points and save payment information. Super convienet."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,"Bad app! App doesn't update my purchases, need to go back to the punch cards!"

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Quick Order! Easy quick Order, ready when I came to pick it up :) Skip the line ;)"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,Great but... How do I add or edit my favorites? I love this app and I don't usually do these kinds of offers
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Steps are confusing as hell and the employees had a hell of a time trying to figure it out.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Points are only accrued if you order online. This is Goodcents! Most people order at the store. It won't give you points if you order at the store. Horrible app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Keeps failing, can't log in can't do anything with it!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Makes ordering simple! Easy to use, quick and saves time."

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Love the app Good food, good atmosphere, clean place. Continued customer."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,App works great I love goodcents. I like the app because I can ponder my options and nobody's waiting on me.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Best sandwiches ever.! Goodcents  is my favorite Sammie shop . Absolutely love it. !
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, It needs to be clearer when you start an order if it is delivery or carry-out. Other than that it's a great app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,The better way So much better then the punch card way to earn points
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Quick and easy Easy ordering and payment. Even easy to redeem loyalty points.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, Why does this app want access to basically everything in my phone
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,So easy! I love the app it's so easy to use and navigate!

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Super Easy Love using the app. Especially at work when our computers take forever to load. It's also a plus that their food is super good.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Doesn't get any easier Very easy to navigate app, best sandwiches in town."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Simple. It does exactly what I want it to do.  Simply and efficiently allows me to order food.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Fave Sub Shop Goodcents is the BEST and this app is fantastic...I love convince!!

Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Mr goodcents
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Fast ordering Love the app
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Awesome! Great time saver!!!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love it
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Great App The app is very straight forward and makes ordering easy.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Easy to use Great app easiest to order of any app I've used.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Great app! Love the app. Makes it easier yet to get our meals quick! Love the occasional discount we receive too!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Nice. Actually works really well. Works and looks better than any other food app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Easy to use and saves time Can't complain
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Easy ordering Very fast and convenient.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Great! Easy to use ordering app!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Very convenient Easy to use
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Nice! Works great!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Delivery Easy to engineer
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,Easy to use I used this app for the first time today. It was actually really easy to use despite a few bugs that could be worked out. Nothing significant enough to make it a negative experience though. Plus you get 50% off your first order placed through the app with code FIRSTORDER.

Nothing significant enough to make it a negative experience though. Plus you get 50% off your first order placed through the app with code FIRSTORDER. It worked for me no problem!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3,"With some help It could be better. Such as adding the ability to add an additional drink and chip to the order. Possibly using a credit card to pay for the purchase. That's the only thing Jimmy John's has on you, although their sammiches suck."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,2,"Not an intuitive app Watch the pickup or delivery option. Didn't see that mine was placed for pickup till it was placed, even though I swear I chose delivery. Hard to figure out how to delete items from cart, too. Not a fan of the app yet."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Very buggy. Randomly selected a date in the future (even though there is no option to pick a date besides today), has random error messages like ""Authentication Error"" even though I never put anything in and nothing was wrong"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," It let us order food for delivery at 3:30, but the store doesn't start delivering until 5.  We didn't know that until the store called us half an hour after we ordered."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1, I know I live in the delivery area because I order from Goodcents often but the app tells me otherwise. Useless.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"So far so good! I've only placed one order through the app, but it was just as easy as going online!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,DO NOT DOWNLOAD App constantly crashes and tries to take your whole phone with it. Awful app!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,"Gets the job done Works very well. I like that I got a discount for using it the first time! It isn't as user friendly as it could be, but it gets the job done."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,Ugh Crashes just as much as their website. Can't even login!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Love it Wonderful subs, great soup and delicious pasta."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Love it ! The other sub place nearby doesn't have an app which is just one reason why I chose Goodcents over them :)
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,"Good but... It would be nice if I can save multiple cards, but other than that easy to use and accurate delivery times"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Easy to use app The ordering process was simple. I'd like to see an order history that I can reorder from in a future update. Otherwise it's a great app.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,3,Hm. Should be some kind of incentive for ordering through the app. Like coupons released every once in a while to make you want to order goodcents.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Big time saver Use it for lunch  when I am at work.  Easy to use.  I love just walking in and getting my lunch without waiting in the long lunch line.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5, Loved it as always goodcents is still handsdown my favorite sandwich shop!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Very easy to use The app is very streamlined and easy to use. I can select exactly what I want and checkout in less than a minute.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,"It's OK but didn't get my discount Webpage said download and use for a discount,didn't get it. Otherwise the app is fine."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4, Wish you could look at an order after its been placed.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Pretty Great My order went through quickly. I'm impressed so far.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,"Great app! Easy to use, looks great, and very handy!!"
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Love this App! It is perfect for the store! It gives me all the options and it makes me want to order from here more!
Goodcents,Travel & Local,4,Decent app. Had no problems ordering using the app.  Got a discount for first time order.  Love their sandwiches.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Great! Very easy to use and I have never had an issue with it.
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Yum Love this place order from here all the time and the app is so easy
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Impressed I love Mr. Goodcents even more now. (:
Goodcents,Travel & Local,5,Makes good sense Pretty much works as it should.

Goodcents,Travel & Local,1," Put in the promo code from snapchat for this app, but the special was not reflected when I went to pick up my order. Uninstalled this app."
Goodcents,Travel & Local,1,Stores near me are never delivering And today the store closed early.

Happy + Hale,Food & Drink,5, works great and silky smooth on my Pixel 2XL
Happy + Hale,Food & Drink,2," Significant battery drain while idle. Could also use a map/pin drop feature for delivery location instead of entering a long address.   Also, it's not an app problem, but why would you stop delivering at 1:15 PM?"
Happy + Hale,Food & Drink,5, Super easy to get around and custom your food! What a game changer. The delievery drivers on bikes are super quick too. I love Happy + Hale!

Insightly CRM,Business,3," No issues with the app..but it's missing the most useful feature from the web interface - Reports. For a manager, viewing reports is essential for tracking performance of sales and projects, and you have to revert to the web interface instead as the app doesn't show them."

Insightly CRM,Business,5," I've been a power user of Salesforce, in the past. I've been using Insightly for 14 months. It has everything I relied on in Salesforce at a fraction of the cost. I love it."
Insightly CRM,Business,2," This is not intuitive. There is no way to add notes to leads, 
opportunities, or projects. There is a Related tab for each of those that 
says Notes but it is unresponsive."
Insightly CRM,Business,4," I've been using the desktop version since the beginning and am really 
loving the convenient app."
Insightly CRM,Business,3," Interface could be more useful.  I just arrived in a city where we have some customers.  Couldn't do a sort in the app of organizations by state or city, so it was useless to me while in transit to see who I needed to start setting up visits with.  Too bad, because all the data is in their system."

The app originally was pretty good and I could see it becoming great in the CRM field, but they took some wrong turns. First, how does a CRM app not allow the use of the word appointment anywhere? An appointment is the basic unit of sales. All of the previous CRM's I used allowed you to easily schedule an appointment and call it an appointment. It causes a lot of confusion, an event could be a lot of things. Next, they had custom fields you could make and use, but in an update they did away with them and you lost all data you entered into them. And speaking of losing data, as far as I can tell there is no way you can back up your data and keep it safe yourself. Now they have updated the software and it is incompatible with my device. How nice. Once again they have took away features, in this case the ability to use it. They have some things working for them, but it looks like some competitor has infiltrated their business and is sinking them (no I am not serious, but they couldn't do much better if they were) This company desperately needs to communicate with some traditional salespeople and listen..."
Insightly CRM,Business,4," Wish I could load my companies on to Google maps easily to see all accounts 
without having to use another application like Badger."
Insightly CRM,Business,4, I currently use GEOCRM which is a free crm with a web and mobile platform and has all the features and everything I need. Tried this app out after a friend recommended it. Nice UI and great design.
Insightly CRM,Business,5," Good app for keeping lead organized. You can record contact,and keep track 
of interaction so no one falls through the cracks."
Insightly CRM,Business,5, Great app. Insightly keeps us on task.
Insightly CRM,Business,5," The app has access to all project and contact information in a convenient format. Unfortunately, there is no off-line access. I've tried several other project management systems and this is the best I have found."
Insightly CRM,Business,5," Since the last updates, this is awesome. Do wish I could use it offline and then callibrate with the desktop once I'm bcak online but even so, I am in love with it"
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Nice easy to use. Would be good if voice to text notations were available.

Insightly CRM,Business,4, Pretty good mobile version of the desktop version. No complaints so far as I can use it in there after a sales call to make notes about the transaction.
Insightly CRM,Business,5, Insightly is well organized for what I do as an Appliance dealer- relationships were never easier to keep track of!

Granted, I am not a large company, so many of the improvements are not something I need.  However, it is important that they continue to try to make this app more friendly and capable.  I would recommend this to a sole practitioner who needs to keep a large number of clients and prospects in control.  I make notes of what I said and what he said.  I email through this app, or I attach the email during the process of sending the email using my gmail account.  The more I use it, the more I depend on it.  I use the mobile app to record meetings after they take place.  When I am sitting in my car, before I move to the next appt or to home, I record the most important aspects of the meeting.  Buy it."

When importing contacts search for specific contacts will be imported instead of having to scroll through an entire list. When doing a mass Imports a lot of the organization's I had attached to my contacts didn't come through. Import the contacts one at a time the companies they work for show up. If I make an update to my contacts in my address book and then we imported in, the contact duplicates instead of updates. Something in the system that could recognize duplicates, or ask to merge certain contacts would be ideal. In fact I'd rather keep my contact list on the phone I have it sync rahter having to push it up each time. The same thing with Google Calendar, I would like to keep my events on the Google side but be able to add events from the app or the website be able to see the calendar through it. Basically I'm not asking insightly to store my company data as much as help me manage and organize it."

Insightly CRM,Business,3, I could not see income through the app. No reports section I can review. Or maybe I just could not find it.

I could not save e-mails or contacts direclty to my Insightly account as it was linked to my colleague....makes it difficult to schedule tasks and like them to a client.   It just spirals out of controll from here with many little problems.  Very amature job.  Too expensive for this level of service.   The dashboard does not show enough information and too many clicks to make it a smooth workflow

My biggest objection is its inability to export and re-import data which requires major fixes, a common complaint from many users.  The web version and available apps are great, but no portability between Insightly and mobile apps.  There continues to be a rather ho-hum response to our concerns which leads me to believe the support personnel in this Organization are few in number and there are not enough resources to continue to improve the product.  I guess it ultimately comes down to you get what you pay for."

Later in the day however, they all disappeared again. The contact list just shows a list of names with no organization names. Under organizations, everything is as it should be; the problem is just with the contacts. It's still usable for my needs because most of the time I'll be using the organization list but if the contact list problem could be fixed, it'd be a 5 star app for me. I'm not using it for sales, I'm using it to keep track of inspections and I don't need a full blown, complicated CRM so I like the simple, uncluttered interface. I'll be relying on it heavily so I hope no other problems appear. Update: Just found out Contacts and Organizations can't be filtered in the mobile app. Please add that feature! It would also be nice to be able to filter using tags in the mobile app."

The search doesn't search across all categories, only the category you're viewing and  synchronization appears to be manual, so new items don't appear without refreshing first. The app doesn't appear to have security features, a real concern for me. Is it transferring information in the air without encryption? Can someone steal the phone and extract information? Still a decent app though."
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Great but...... Please link app to phone calls so that insightly prompts me for a note after a call. Base has this. Indigo has this. Insightly has a tonne of other features but this feature is a big gap.
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Needs Work Love the desktop application,  but the app is really average. Simple things like filtering opportunities by tag, which are vital when you have a lot of data,  just don't exist."
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Not very good Support for pushing native calendar and phone book seems like a given, but no.. Is this a bad port of an IOS app?"
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Totally useless No way to see the feed. All events are mixed up with no logic observed. Deleted after 10 min.
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Customer support Took more than a day to get a respond, was thinking to upgrade but with out technical support why pay"
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Awesome App indeed! Great app. Easy to use.  Love the business card scanner functionality.

Insightly CRM,Business,1, I'm moving to Base CRM. Insightly crashes everytime I click on an opportunity. There is no refund for un-used period. Downgrading is not allowed - you have to continue paying high cost even if you don't have large team. Product is not user friendly.

I've give feedback and asked questions 5 times now and nothing but automated responses so far."
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Why app does not refresh? No event? Realised that you need to manually logoff and login again to have your data refresh. This means there is a real danger of viewing and editing stale information especially in a multi-user environment.   Also, why is there no function to add or modify existing events?"
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Getting there Some good  functionalities but not yet a worthy companion of desktop/browser version. Main gripes are ergonomics that aren't obvious enough, no calendar and at this time I seem to have ""lost"" offline editing/adding...."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Frustrated My Kingdom for a CRM service that will integrate Exchange email AND calendar syncing NATIVELY as well as keep a record of phone calls made from WITHIN the app itself. Is that too much to ask for? All these CRM services and apps are half assed in their functionality. I give up. Sigh...
Insightly CRM,Business,3,New version What happened?  The version last week was so much better I could see more tasks and the days of the week. Now it just gives you the date number not day that sucks !!! Why change the format it was good the way it was!!  So much for good free apps

But it doesn't. I have to search for everything within it's own categorywhich makes it combersome and confusing because of the mental switch between app and full system- I struggle to see the value of the app when it's most basic and powerful features don't match up."
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Big improvements Insightly Android app keeps getting better and richer with functions. Its features on a phone are more than enough for me when I'm not at my desk. Great work Insightly!
Insightly CRM,Business,2,What happened? The previous release had a Refresh option in the upper left corner.  It's gone. I added new contacts on pc in desktop mode. I can not get them to show on the newer Android app.  Almost missed an appointment. Not good.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"A must-have A real life saver when it comes to keeping up with multiple tasks, projects, files, leads and so on. Much quicker learning curve than salesforce, and at a fraction of the price. Love it!"
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Great but missing features Love the app but where is my calender? Other wise its great
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Great update, great app Good app for our small workforce and even gets better with your updates. Keep up the good work!"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,not bad mobile app is missing the calendar feature. which I need if I'm going to use this CRM.  app is also missing android notifications. why??
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Awesome Only using free version, so there are limitations. Nonethelss, very effective CRM."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"No Calendar???? Hard to schedule from  drop down....where is the calendar??????...gets better..apparently does not provide ""time"" to tasks..yuck!"
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Updates The updates made all the difference  is viability.  I can now implement mobile use with confidence.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Ferramenta muito boa, mas o app! Não realiza sincronismo de dados!"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Ok It really needs a lot more functionality in the app. Like linking evernote. Could be great...
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Needs more functions Can't set an event. And can't access calendar.
Insightly CRM,Business,5, So functional!
Insightly CRM,Business,2, Buggier in new version
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Best free CRM system I love insightly!

Insightly CRM,Business,5, Good way .thanks
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Greatest app 10/10
Insightly CRM,Business,5, Great tool
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Honestly Love it Except the Price (for 4+ users) That's where it seems to get expensive. Instead of getting the first 3 free, like anyone with 3 users or less, you pay for all users. It would be nice if they'd give it us small businesses a little break like they do for the 3 and less users.  I don't know enough to comment on the actual system yet."
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Multiple Log-in Variants Confusing.... Same log-in and password, but different access to data depending on whether or not you go through google apps portal or the Insightly site directly? Why the different data access? Can it be combined?"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,No Calendar? Is there really no calendar with this app? Super bummed.
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Needs improvement You should create an app compatible to the web app. Copy function is missing as well as a place where all tasks and projects etc coexist.
Insightly CRM,Business,2,New accounts Come on guys you can't create a new account via the app... Really?
Insightly CRM,Business,3, Needs phone contact info selection and calendar
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Where is the calendar?? No calendar :(
Insightly CRM,Business,5,The best It's the best in its price Range
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Getting much better It's getting better. Easy and simple UI. If you can provide offline mode that we can download basic database like contact with all details (emails, address, phone etc,) and sure same for organization) it would be great feature when we have no data connection"
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Everything works great now Filter added to show open projects only. Superb work.... However would like to be able to sync google contacts on free account... While the current features are super nice, contact sync should be basic function"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Auto-rotate not working The app works ok, but it drives me crazy that the auto-rotate only works in certain parts of the app (on my tablet)"
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Best of all I tested for small business
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Works great and intuitive Also great support team
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Great Service good app

Insightly CRM,Business,5,Great CRM and app keeps improving This is my top pick for small business CRMs. The app has come a long way and is now an excellent complement to the full version.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Nice update! I like the changes to the task view! Very user-friendly. Would still like to sort projects by user and for the UI to be more consistent/attractive. But this update is much improved.

I obviously use the website on my laptop, but I have the apps on my Samsung Note 8.0 and my Google Nexus 5.  The free flow of data from one to the other is seamless, and the interface is straightforward and easy to figure out among the three versions of the platform.  My big gripe is that the apps lack a great deal of functionality that are offered by the desktop version.  A more complete mobile package would be great.  One feature I would love to see added would be that when I tap to email a contact from within the app, it should give me the option of which email app to send from (I prefer the GMail app, but the Samsung Email app is defaulted on my tablet.)    Also, when sending an email straight from the contact, it would be a boon if the email address that I'm supposed to CC if I want to attach that email to the contact were already populated."
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Awesome CRM App! I can't believe some of the other reviews. Complaining about not having automatic refresh. I'm sorry that you have to work a little by pressing a button. This app is free and is by far better than most CRM's. Thank you for the great software.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Great CRM This has changed the way I work.  I have been using this along with the online tool for months now and can't fault it. They even give you vids and webinars so you can get the most of it.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Very Good Very good, nice and simple to use. Would be improved if it was capable of being used offline, you can't upload tasks etc unless you have a WiFi or data connection. Will this be something that will be changed in the future?"

Insightly CRM,Business,2,Insightly is great but the app not so much Pretty lame app. Better off using the website but it's a pain on my phone.  This rating is for the app not Insightly as a whole
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Needs more work Does not update contacts or tasks by itself, you must manually hit refresh. Tasks do not sort properly. Contacts have no addresses."
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Please communicate with users No auto refresh. Some organization links only show contact role with no name and clicking on them crashes back to organization list. As others have said just overall not very usable. Insighly should be communicating with customers about progress of an updated app. Is one even in the works?

Insightly CRM,Business,2,Too bad You can view most of your data. Can't search by tags though. Spent so much time tagging and useless on a mobile or tablet!  Don't expect to actually do anything in this app. Just a glorified address book.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Great App. Very versatile, especially for a free CRM app.  I do wish the mobile android app had the calendar feature.  It's a necessity for keeping on top of appointments when you're using the app on the go."

Insightly CRM,Business,1,This company is a fraud The tool in the web has multiple errors. Don't even consider going pro because google integration is a joke. This app deserves no comments it's simply ridiculous.  A button for refresh lol conclusion: forget it!

Insightly CRM,Business,1,What the...? Install app and gui is blank. Emails dont even integrate from gmail. You dont want my money? Lol

Insightly CRM,Business,1, I was asked to open up another paid account to have my existing paid account transferred then I was told I won't be getting my $9.00 back to my visa.  Instead they credited my account.  I got ripped off.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"What a joke... I've had nothing but problems with their app on Android, and now it just crashes on my Moto X running 4.4.2. Stay away from Insightly!"
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Its alright. Need improvements Its good on comp. But doesnt seem its ready for app on phone. Could u put the calender too?? Im thinking of purchasing for companies use... but would only do it after the improvements are made.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Samsung tab3 p5200 I have been using this app on my laptop and telephone,  works perfectly but I have  downloaded it on my samsung tablet and it isnt working. Is there any way you can fix this?"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Syncing... Sucks.  This app/service could be 10 stars but syncing is terrible
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Does not work I sign in and nothing happens... Just a white screen.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Hopefull Cant see my opportunities????? Contacts and organisations load well but useless without opportunities.....help!
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Auto update The app doesn't auto update. You have to manually open each entry to fetch from the server. Can you put sync options or button at least. Thanks!
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Crashes when signing in with Google cred. Nexus 4. Cyanogenmod 11
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Not much useful No option to take reports
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Crashing at start Device htc one S
Insightly CRM,Business,1,No help with sign in Downloaded it twice and cannot login. No option for help.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,BEST APP EVER! A must have for alternative CRM. Its genius yet so simple.
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Missing a few features Needs 'pull to fresh' and the ability to toggle between multiple accounts.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Great PM Solution! Excellent program for project management. Flexible, scalable, and simple."
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Great App Best CRM app.  They are constantly updating it to make it even better.
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Time for an update? At least add a ""settings"" component."
Insightly CRM,Business,1, Tasks not showing Nexus 7
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Awesome I only wish it synchronized 0with quick books online.

Insightly CRM,Business,5,good Thanks for nice apps.
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Works well. No issues
Insightly CRM,Business,1, Simply did not work
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Easy to use.
Insightly CRM,Business,5, Great Application...
Insightly CRM,Business,1, Worthless
Insightly CRM,Business,5, Excellent
Insightly CRM,Business,3," Good for the basics, but you'll end up at the website for a few things	Very clean and well thought out app. The links feature losses a bit of its power, there is no way to edit events directly and you have to manually refresh each page.

For instance there are no filters so the app shows a long list of all opportunities including lost and abandoned ones, so the 10 active ones are mixed with hundreds of old ones!"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Good,  just fix 2 things... I would love this app if: 1. You could easily see which opportunities are open/closed. 2. You didn't have to manually refresh for updates."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"No functional organization Need to be able to filter opportunities and projects by ""open"". Just a big list of everything is NOT useful."

Sort these two out and get another star. Also sort out a reseller program."
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Nice but, I wish it would cache more on the device for instance on the sdcard, then let you choose how much space to use. Also who sorts their email newest on the bottom, but displays the top and forces you to scroll to the bottom? Really?"
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Too many crashes Like the chrome version but the android app constantly locks up so is pretty much unusable.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,No arranca En mi motorola razr i la aplicación no arranca. me solicita los datos de la cuenta y cuando trata de abrir la aplicación se cierra.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Makes Life EASIER! Makes the boring stuff a lot easier.  I am very happy with this app!!
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Good but no offline access I will give 5 stars if apps has offline access, when internet is not available."
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Helpful complement to desktop Can see all data readily although record inputs and maintenance should stay w desktop.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Great CRM, cloud enabled. Thanks for the TShirt Dimitar"
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Not bad! Great aesthetics and easy to use!
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Love it Just downloaded and loving it already!

But still... - The app does not send notifications (it needs to be manually refreshed). - It does not open when getting an email with notifications (instead of the insightly site). - I cannot see comments?  So it seems there's still a way to go to make this app useful indeed. I'd love to see this grow and add stars to my review!  Waiting... Sharon

I then went direct to the video tutorials and watched the entire presentation.  When it explained real time I was hooked.  I like the Idea of instant instruction and Chat to get help.  I have turned on 3 people to this sight and they like it also.  To bad most people dont understand the power of a CRM.  Mike
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Who the hell gives this more than 1star Hopefully this is just a place holder so they can say they've got an android app. Unwieldy, time consuming and gives little insight into your projects from the web app.  Look forward to numerous updates to get to a proper version 1.0"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,It's getting better but... Please make this app great.  Check out the new Google drive interface and work flow. I'll order a subscription when you get this more polished.

Check out the new Google drive interface and work flow. I'll order a subscription when you get this more polished. Also Google apps integrated login by enabling single sign on is confusing.  Took me awhile to figure it out -  I just enabled sso in the gapps administration panel -  I can login now but wonder if it is secure because the sso information page gives a lot of detail about third party server and host files etc.. Confusing
Insightly CRM,Business,2," I hope it will be improved. As of now not user friendly. This app doesn't have Events, Calendar."
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Improving We are big fans of the CRM. Happy that improvements are being made with the app. 3 stars until we're able to access all the linked files and emails we have within our contacts and opportunities. Keep up the good work.
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Awesome CRM, ok app Just started using the Cloud CRM and it is awesome. Very pleased with the constantly updating information we can access from anywhere. Just switched from Act and signed up for the subscription.

Very pleased with the constantly updating information we can access from anywhere. Just switched from Act and signed up for the subscription. Looking forward to more mobile app updates and Cloud updates especially a quoting / word processing option with Google apps. ( hint hint)"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Needs dashboard The app suffices. However there's one major missing piece - the dashboard. This is the quickest way to get an overview of all sales activities. Not having access to it on mobile - either Android or iOS - is disappointing.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Great app The functionality of having my office info with me on the road is terrific. We rely on Insightly to keep us connected on on task, having it mobile makes that even easier."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Cannot login I'm receiving ""we did not recognize that email address"". Although l'm sure it is correct. I can login to the web site without any problem."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,No organizations I can't get any of my organizations to show on the app. It's driving me nuts. I work on the road and have to have that! Please fix!
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Great CRM Tool! great CRM tool with simple and easy-to-use interface.
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Not bad, but needs work. Not bad for a first attempt, but not quite there yet: 1. Under Tasks, 'details' section shows HTML tags 2. No push notifications to app when you have new tasks or messages. This really defeats the purpose of having an android app. Push notifications to app > email notifications."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Data doesn't sync For some reason the app data doesn't sync with my cloud version so app is useless right now. I have a GS2, the interface looks nice an clean. Once this problem is solved it will rock."
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Call log missing Would be a five star app if it would log the call you make from it. The calls you make from the app, are not listed or recorded anywhere. Once you place a call the app closes, so it is also impossible to make notes during the call."
Insightly CRM,Business,2,Not very user friendly Got excited when saw its finally available for Tue Android platform which quickly turned out into a disappointment. Very clunky to use - a simple creation of a new company and a contact is a multi step process of creating the both records separately then manually linking them - why?  Not to.mention ...Full ReviewGot excited when saw its finally available for Tue Android platform which quickly turned out into a disappointment. Very clunky to use - a simple creation of a new company and a contact is a multi step process of creating the both records separately then manually linking them - why?  Not to.mention that its probably poorly written - my tablet is slow and the app is well below the usability speed - one of those hit the button and hold for a second to react.  As much as I love the web app this is not ready
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Promising Only just d/l it so still exploring. Some filtering would be nice (Projects view shows all projects, including completed ones, so you have to search). But a good start and nice to see Android platform being served. Facebook integration would be good too."
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Great addition to the fantastic web app Simple and powerful, just like the web version. Thank you insightly!"
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Just what I needed App works great, perfect for managing in the go. No complaints, but it would be nice to have more capabilities similar to online. No issues though."
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Much better Developer team worked with me to fix some issues A+
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Impressive I have been evaluating just about every CRM program out there. So far, it appears insightly meets the challenge. I like the tab views versus one long list of events, history and tasks. I also like Opportunities and Projects. Android app is the icing on the cake !"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"No data? Something very wrong with this app. On my Galaxy S3 it doesn't load any data, making it somewhat pointless. Hopefully fixed soon but useless as is."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Keyboard problems Not showing the keyboard for the login screen on my HTC EVO. Force close/reopen and reboot didn't help.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Works but need to improve Waited a time for this app. It works with my Galaxy Note2. But it seem to be slow & not smooth like iOS version. Looking for improvement!
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Finally It work great, no no need for laptop to know your plans, just use this amazing app.  Really great work"
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Very usefull Urgently need version for most recent android releases. Can you help?
Insightly CRM,Business,5," Fast to use, easy to understand, well thought!"
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Can't log in Cant enter my login info from my android phone. Really love insightly can't wait til the bugs are worked out with the app
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"Improving all the time! As a free user I cannot recommend Insightly highly enough. A fantastic, fully featured CRM that takes care of my customer management with ease. The app is still not 100% but getting better all of the time!"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"the worst CRM option you could choose Don't be fooled by their marketing.

Using insightly is worse that tracking all of this information on paper while getting a root canal, I think a 4 year old with smoke signals could do a better job... the terrible workflow and user interface is only made worse by their incredibly horrid customer service.  this company won't be around very long, a 1 star rating is too high."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Too rudimentary Being able to search by tags would be a huge help! Otherwise I have to remember the name! Control what app opens to (tasks, contracts, etc). Love Insightly!"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Big let down The desktop version is great, but this mobile app is a waste of time because there's so much functionality missing, and you have to manually refresh. When will a new version be launched?"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Terrible It will download to Nexus 5 but it wont open. Tried downloading and opening twice. Reviews were right, app needs work."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Couldn't create account DL and tried to use but could not create an account.  Would only take Google apps login which I refuse to use.  Make it more universal and then maybe.  NEXT
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Overall very good CRM We've been using this app for several years, it increasingly improves. The support responses whenever we've had questions or issues have been good overall.  For most small businesses thid meets the needs and integrates very well with Google apps."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Virtually Useless I can't read any current tasks, there is no calender for me to reference, my contacts are old, etc. I have uninstalled but since I absolutely need this for work I am hoping a reinstall will help. Otherwise this just takes up space on my phone. Very frustrating."
Insightly CRM,Business,5,"Needs lead management added The web application has lead management capabilities, but these are not visible on this app. View only would be better than nothing, but the ability to add new leads would be very useful, especially if the app allowed a lead to be added by scanning a business card."
Insightly CRM,Business,2,"Not as good as the desktop version I am happy with the desktop version of Insightly,  but this app needs a lot of work, from Push connectivity to integration with the mobile device."
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Brilliant! If you fancy a CRM solutions that is easy to use and learn yet filled with brilliant functionality then look no further...insightly for Android is truly stunning
Insightly CRM,Business,3,Great start to an app. I love that you finally have an app. It would be great if you can have the filters in the opportunities so you are not looking at this long list if everything you have even put in.  Also having attached files in the companies and contacts.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Ridiculous First off they make you sign up before you can even try the app. And for some reason  they want your phone number. Really!

After deciding to go ahead with it it won't except any email address saying they are invalid. Funny I've had them for years. To bad. After spending days looking for an app to manage my customers I really thought this was it. But I couldn't even get past the sign up. Crazy!
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"A great tool for small business and getting better We investigated several CRM apps for our firm and Insightly appeared to be the right fit.

Now, a year since implementation, our initial assessment has been confirmed. Integration with Google Apps has been key to its usefulness to all our employees. The customization options makes Insightly as compatible with our firms needs as any of the other ""industry specific"" options we investigated.  Great app with even more potential as features and capabilities are added."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Too slow to load Removed it immediately
Insightly CRM,Business,1, STAY AWAY! Their customer service is terrible! Their marketing is also misleading - this product does not easily integrate with Gmail.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Only for Google for Work Giving it one star because they fail to mention anywhere (app description; homepage) that it only works with Google For Work.  I just spent over an hour before I managed to dig up enough info to surmise that from the total amount of vague clues
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Crashing every time First, it does not take standard google authentication. It asks me to explicitly log in.   After signing in, the allocation crashes. I tried uninstalling and installing again...  No luck."
Insightly CRM,Business,2," The app will not let me update the status of projects or mark tasks as completed. This makes actually working from the app impossible, making it useless."
Insightly CRM,Business,3,"5 Star Potential When Insightly updates the mobile app to integrate searchable tags for filtering purposes, this will be a 5 star application. Filters and tags are a core function of CRM and for this app to not have those features, it falls short."
Insightly CRM,Business,5," Better than anything else, complete and useful tool. The perfect search 
function enables you to find in just a second the info you need to update"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Needs better filtering Show all opportunities.  Unusable.
Insightly CRM,Business,2,No reason to use it I'd rather use the full website on my phone than waste my time with this worthless app.
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"App Doesn't work Log in, 99% of data missing. Have to stick to browser version. Using LG G3"
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Good app Works fine on tablet. Animations between screens are weird, sidebar should be open on tablet in default. Rest is working as expected."
Insightly CRM,Business,2, G Suite Button does not work at all. It says click below to continue then nothing at all.
Insightly CRM,Business,1, I have Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I installed the app and it shows me app is unavailable - white screen.Why?
Insightly CRM,Business,1,"Unknown error during install Unknown error code during application install ""-24"". What does it mean? Thank you!"
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Doesn't work As soon as I try to log in the screen flashes and the app closes
Insightly CRM,Business,5,App Update The new app update bridges the gap between the original app and web application.  Great job.  Everyone in my company uses this on a daily basis.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,"Better than mobile Web interface I have been using the mobile Web interface for a while and the app seems much better. However, I would have preferred this as a HTML5 interface instead of an app."
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Unable to use Kept giving me error 500
Insightly CRM,Business,1,Couldn't add contacts Kept crashing and wouldn't upload contacts
Insightly CRM,Business,3,So far so good I am glad they have a app finally but I will like to see more of a CRM functionality
Insightly CRM,Business,3,It's OK if you want access to the database But it would be nice to have the news feed and not to have to manually refresh.
Insightly CRM,Business,1, App doesn't recognize my user
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Flexible CRM Love that we can create our own workflow processes and access all of our critical client data on the go.
Insightly CRM,Business,3,It's ok Needs to be re installed every time I use it to get my updated information
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Great to see the App Love that Insightly now has the app. It shows great on the Motorola Razr Maxx.  Great job Insightly!!
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Nice app We are diving into CRM and this app complements the website well.  Look forward to continued exploration.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Excellent Does the job! recommend.
Insightly CRM,Business,5,Great business app So easy to make the follow up and call customer from this application
Insightly CRM,Business,4, Quickly make changes and notes. Wish the task worked as good as Outlook task and sync.
Insightly CRM,Business,4,Love it! We absolutely love insightly! We would be lost without it.

Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,4," The app would be perfect if there was a way to permanently store a rewards number in your account...not have to enter it every time. plus, the human readable number on my card is now illegible, so I have no way to enter my number when I order on the app."
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,5, Always friendly and helpful. Food is always fresh and good. Lots of healthy options.
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,4, Not too bad. But when choosing a combo with a salad it does do not give you an option for a type of salad dressing.
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,5, easy ordering with delivery built in!
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,1, we placed the order and showed up at the store but they had no record of our order. the order number was no help to the staff at the restaurant. Although we have the confirmation and the charge on our credit card. unreliable garbage app.

Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,2," No rewards program, why not?"
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,1, Maybe don't list delivery as an option then let me get through the whole ordering process including delivery address before telling me delivery is not possible at this location.
Kneaders Bakery & Cafe,Lifestyle,2," Paid for extra avocado & sauce on side didn't get. Also polmagranit berry iced tea, tasted like perfume. Were out of desert I ordered (thats fine) took 10 min. to get replacement desert. First time had an issue with kneaders. Yes I will go back. No more online orders with kneaders."

I was placing an order to pick up at the drive-thru. My last item was for hot chocolate. I only asked that I have whipped cream placed on the hot chocolate. After selecting whipped cream I scrolled to the bottom of the screen, put my name in the place where it was supposed to be, and clicked on add to basket. I was then asked to select my milk in the select milk section. The problem is there is no select milk section. Therefore, I could not order my hot chocolate because of this issue. Would you please fix this. I called the restaurant and let them know about this issue. At least I will get my hot chocolate today. Unfortunately my husband will have to order & pay for it separately when he goes to pick up our order at the drive-thru."

Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,2, Downloaded the app thinking it would be better to access the rewards program and there is nothing there. Need to include that into the app.
Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,1, My local Lions Choice is not available as an option in the app. Very disappointed.

Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,3, Really easy to order and customize. Just wish it had Google Pay setup to use when you checkout. No easy way to view rewards either.
Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,1, Totally useless. Says no stores in entire State. And I'm actually in the parking lot of one. Don't bother.
Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,5," Works great, food always ready when I show up. Wish there were more coupons but can't really complain about the app."
Lion's Choice,Food & Drink,4," Very easy to use and order, however it lacks the group order sharing that the website features which I use for work. But as an individual, it does a great job.  I love Lion's Choice!"

Drawback includes limited support for actually controlling these resources. I would say use this app for checking the status of your Azure resources on the go. Hopefully future updates will add greater controlling capabilities.

Despite of successfully providing organization username and password and authenticating with Microsoft Authenticator App with code or even approve button, it simply doesn't login. Keep asking organization credentials again and then code and then again credentials and then code and again... Endless... This was never the case earlier.dont know what has changed. App is now useless since I can't login"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Microsoft Azure is the perfect platform used for many purposes including storage, database evaluation, and networking. I have had a positive experience with Azure and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't necessarily have the principal to buy the resources that Azure offers."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Good first experience so far. Easy to use and fast in speed. I move my SAP Business One to Azure from Newtek One. So much faster and economical than Newtek One.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Portal functionality is very limited. Unless you memorize the commands to create resources, this application can merely be used for tracking and monitoring your resources. Room for improvement."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Useful for alerts and see a quick status of your services. What would be really nice is too have also a cost dashboard.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Not much to do tbh. Useful for control the VMs and nothing else... I wish I had AAD, Intune, identity Protection, Azure Security Center, Sentinel dashboards minimum. At this state it's not Azure app, it's rather Azure VM list."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great app. Works very well and allows me to manage my Azure environment very quickly
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Completely pointless, I was expecting this to allow me to perform some administrative tasks on our tenantcy. It needs some serious work and features added for it to be worth installing."
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," I am very disappointed, the UI sucks, there is no darkmode, you cant add or remove resources and the information available is sparse at best."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Amazing App. I would have given it 5 stars if only it showed me my Azure Credit Balance when I open the app
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, I cant acces AZURE DEVOPS board from this app. It seems the devop service is not integrated with Azure cloud. I wish there was a mobile app for Azure Devops boarfs.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, All the extensions and add ons to gather up any and all system and file apps is amazing.I am impressed.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, I just wanted to manage work items on my project but after logging in it says i don't have an azure account.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Easy setup and connect to your account nice and smooth
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Gives you a good insight of what's happening inside your Azure account.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great App Check my Sever anytime and but I'm having challenges access my Networking Options
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, You will get 5 stars when you give us dark mode and configure* it like how the mobile-browser one looks.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Start all is needed. To select all servers.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, No bad. Yet i lost all my work for some reason. Would like to retrieve it back some how. All around it is a great app.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Would have been nice to have cost analysis also on the app
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Has simple to follow instructions.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Excellent app! Keep up the good work!
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Useless app, information are useless, just stick to web."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, This app doesn't seem to work if MFA is enabled.and device compliance is requested. The login shows Device Authentication Required - DeviceId -DeviceAltSecId claims are null Other apps such as Office 365 app seem to work with MFA and conditional access just fine
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Whats the app Actually do? As a TFS user moving to Azure i want to know what builds have failed.

If i am running out of space somewhere, if i need to trigger a house keeping job. How does my Work Items queue look. What action do i need to take. Are there any pressure points building up in any of my architectures. What can i do now and what do i have to do in the office. What SDK is there to drive this app so i am always connected. What youtube vids are there to lever this tool - none."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Combining this app with the RD Client on a DeX mounted Samsung phone eliminates the need to carry a laptop!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, I use this app to manage my web applications instead of using the web portal. It has a friendly UI and offers many useful features.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, The application is easily accessible and fast to deploy VMs.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Couldn't even add a firewall rule to a VM. Considering that Azure Portal website is buggy on mobile and cannot do it either, that is where you'd need this software."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Love it, saved my life a couple of times, was able to restart webapps while having dinner."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, A very nice and essential app offers a good look inside the vast amount of information in the Azure cloud.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, UI can be improved along with adding more features. Content refresh is a big concern with this app.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Handy for managing servers when away from computer and I find it much easier for simple tasks than full website.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, One suggestion : Recent resources section should get cleared if the resources have been terminated. I had deleted VM but still showing in recent resources....
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Easy to use on mobile devices!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great app for Azure Admin on the go!
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Shows nothing but general resource information. I'd expect at least a liitle bit of information beyond resource name and ID. I can't even see the money spent for this month.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Fingerprint unlock feature doesn't work. And the app takes frustrating long to respond even on a decent device processor and a decent network speed.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Hello microsoft . why when i go singup azure student free. And i looking for my country (cambodia ) it no has :( why you did it. Idont know what you think about my country :( but you need to know .many people of my country use your product ;(
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Excellent app. Very easy to start and stop Azure VMs on the go
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Nice app! 👍 I like that you can use cloud Shell in it. First time I've ever been able to use vim from my phone!
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Love this app. Dashboards is the only thing missing.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Great app, so useful for managing ones Azure environment from a mobile phone."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," simple navigation to resource status, and CLI access available."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Doesn't work. All it ever shows me is ""failed to load."""
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," I registered free account recently and was charged MYR5, despite Microsoft keep emphasising no upfront charge... totally dissapointed"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Great app, wish you could deploy and delete things though."
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Unable to set shutdown schedule of a VM.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Not useful Update: I expected ""Users"" and ""Groups"" Ain't this basic requirement?"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Good balance of features and quality.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, This provides practically no real usable functionality. Very limited usefulness.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Smoothest and best experience with a Microsoft product yet
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Literally just stopped working for no reason. Thoroughly underwhelmed
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Very helpful application
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Its very easy to Use and manage
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Useful app to manage azure resources on the go
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Just couldn't do a basic like logging in to the azure portal. For me the app wasn't helpful based on what i wanted, for different maybe it is or might."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Refresh Doesnt. Work at all
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Best cloud experience compare to AWS or Google
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Easy to use and works great
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," I don't understand the point of this app. I cannot control any of the metrics views, see any useful billing information, or manipulate anything. I always end up on the website. Uninstalled."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Restart App Service a real life saver!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Really simple to use.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Best service in the world
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Very good response times and latency, good integration of local tools with the cloud services."

Obviously, this app wasn't made to do everything the web interface does, nor should it, but I think something like costs is a good metric to have, and doesn't require user input so that should make the feature simpler to implement. Thank you for the great app 👍"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Useless, as most of new invetions from MS. Interface is poor, nothing interesting except starting stopping VM. When I try to run cloud shell, my device will crash. Even using Azure over desktop is pain."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," The name of the application is awfully misleading. You can't manage Azure services with it (AAD, AIP, PIM, B2C, Intune, OMS, AADC, and a lot lot more) .

I'd love to see a usable app with at least the same functionality like the basic Azure website"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," great potential, but I'd like to see some consistency on the time periods on the graphs.  why do some resources show the last hour and others 24hrs?  examples of 24hr are SQL Database or Event hubs.

Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Brilliant app. I see it ain't more and me functionality from the online Azure dashboard. Keep up the great work!!

So glad I've chosen Azure. I can remote desktop into my VM from wherever I am, and even use my the Azure's built in RDC on my android tablet when out and about and it's just as if I'm sat in front of a high end workstation. Really love it."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great app to control azure resources !
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Amazed that this works on my S9. Interface is a bit hard to move around and learn the workaround controls, but it works!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Very nice and effectively useful app to design, store and monitor all my AI apps which are working properly with Azure Web resources and Microsoft platform. Many thanks to the developer team to help researchers like us to utilize machine learning capabilities in real time functionality. Keep it up."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Doesn't work on my Samsung S7 with Oreo. I have just installed. It can't seem to start. Just shows the swirling circle like it is trying to connect. No interaction or messages. I gave up after 15 mins of waiting.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," This app was so useful, but the latest updates has broken it on my OnePlus6. It just sits on its opening loading screen and refuses to proceed. No settings or options, just useless no. Please fix it quick!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," This app might be good for some basic monitoring, but that's about it. I wasn't even able to change the time span for monitoring. It's basically next to worthless for doing anything other than that."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Incredibly limited. There is no access to logs, no monitoring of containers, no access to cost information, no ability to create new resources - it's pretty much just a read-only view of your subscription (and a very limited subset at that)"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," No longer works since Android 9 update. Can't even sign in!! Update.... Yep, now works!! Thanks. Frustrated as i use the mobile app quite a bit over multiple subscriptions."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," I like the app. However, it doesn't let me to have two accounts with same email: microsoft account and corporate login. Please, add this feature!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Not able properly do the copy and paste activities . Also very bad terminal management for Azure CLI and powershell
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," the latest updates doest allow me to davr my credentials, everytime i have to enter them again. it doent makw this app worthy as it should be for a quick action. batter tobuse browse than."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Almost no functionality. Even no billing information.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Very basic, can't even scale up/down an app service. It's only good for monitoring and start/stop of services."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," The shear convenience and smooth operation of the mobile app, in some ways, makes it more enjoyable than the full website experience!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Awesome application, you can view all of your resources health and status from Azure. In other words, Azure in your hands."
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Azure Active Directory Premium 2 can't be administered through here. If you are going to advertise on Azure Active Directory's portal, and recommend the install of the app, prpvide admin services for AAD, especially AAD connect health agent"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, cannot log in. keeps telling me login failed. I can log in using browser with no problem. but not in this app.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Is there no option to actually see the costs for your subscription within the app? I believe this might be useful for a mobile admin who needa to check things quickly
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, One of my favorite by Microsoft.. Learn a lot.. Take care of their users. Provide knowledge without paying.. Quite different from all others app.. Very satisfied.. Ana Nikolic
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," If Microsoft want to provide a truly useful tool for Azurr Cloud, they definitely have a lot of work to do."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Not able log in. It says 'your account doesn't exist' or something like that. And i am easily able to login to my Microsoft Azure account on my PC.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, I have an honor9 and I wanted to use it to metrics but the charts on insight are empty. The servicbus provides no info on queues and topics. But the liveinsight is cool
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Great app, would be great if Just in Time JIT rules can be activated though as still need portal access."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Can't login if fingerprint verification is done via screen tap, it closes the login modal. Impossible to login using Huawei MATE20 Pro. Please fix."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Unable to use because I have a personal account tied to a work account. It won't let you choose which account to use.

Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Excellent tool for supporting Azure resources on the go. Glad to see this latest update resolves some MFA login issues. Great job Microsoft...
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," You cant access your remote VM if you have JIT enabled because the mobile app doesn't have the ""Request Access"" feature. Brilliant idea leaving that feature out!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," In the web portal, everything is ok. But when I sign in the app. It shows have no subscription to Azure service. Can you help me?"
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Need more information from developer perspective. Couldn't dig deep in failed request, Dependency failures. As a developer I should know each and every failed request and what is the reason behind."

Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great app
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Well done.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, ห่วย ไม่รองรับ android ที่เป็นภาษาไทย ต้องแก้เป็นอังกฤษถึง ล็อกออนได้
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Very nice app but still very limited in functionality. Would love yo be able to perform some more tasks through the UI. Also it crashed veeeery often on startup, but maybe the latest update has resolved that, let's see."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Very nice app. The issue with classic VMs was my problem
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Let you add, control and monitor ressources you have in Azure"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Super cool:-)
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Doesn't show VMs. Other esouces are visible, but not my VMs. This may be related to account types, but the Azure experience is inconsistent between platforms."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Crashes on open useless!
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, We cannot set sql server fiewall rules
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, More betterment can be done in commands intellisense
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Please add Runcommand option for VM to make it more interactive.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Nice app but would benefit to be able to drill into resources such as storage accounts and backup vault contents. Also how much these are costing us
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," I'd love to see billing info, such as pay-as-you-go account consumption to 
date."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Keep crashing at startup app. I'am S8 user.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Need to have a small check box to allow me to check all vms and start/stop 
them once."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Hand on to watch my resources
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," It's a good start, but many features are not implemented."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Keeps crashing at startup!
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Should have more control as we have in portal
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Very good app
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Simply put: WOW!! Clean, fast and well designed app that does everything I 
need to manage and monitor my Azure resources, and more! The Cloud Shell 
integration is AMAZING!!! Seriously, how cool is it to have a bash console 
on your phone WITH the power of Azure included with it?!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," This is app that you can't actually do anything. I feel that the only thing 
I can do is to follow the metrics, but for example most important thing I 
would like to do is to see logs but as it can't be done so this is pretty 
useless."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Would be nice to be able to select multiple virtual machines and apply an 
action such as start, restart or stop."
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Keeps crashing on S8+
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Keeps crashing. Please fix it.

Azure apps, but this gives me almost complete access to everything I have

open/switch to the app."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," WHERE ARE MY NOTEBOOKS? It shows nothing under ""all resources"". I have a 
whole bunch of iPython notebooks in my azure notebooks account. How do I 
access them on mobile??"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, App must have capabilities to create resources too
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," It would be great if I could see cost tracking for my resources and with 
that the ability to drill down from all resources to resource group to 
individual resources. Additionally, ability to browse into storage accounts 
would be a nice to have."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Great to be able to monitor stuff on the go, and do simple tasks. Looking 
forward to more graphs and stats"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Love the mobile app, it allows me to monitor Azure resources and take 
crucial actions on them!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Not much to do, other than check the status and restart VMs & services."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Excelente, ojalá vaya ganando nuevas características rapidamente"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," It will be great if able to view the resources categorized by their 
resource groups."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Very less functionalities
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, うーん・・・リソースが一つも表示されない・・・
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Needs a lot of work. Doesn't find much in my accounts and what it does find 
you really cannot do anything with."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Can't login if fingerprint is unavailable. App takes forever to load. App 
isn't open source. App doesn't support widgets. App doesn't use the Android 
login/account system. It's a Xamarin app and it shows."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Perfect mobile tool!
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Fails to stop DevTest Lab VMs. Can start them just fine. Please look into 
this. Confirmed behaviour with other users."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," no doubts, a nice tool"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Finally! Awesome
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Such an amazing app to get quick insight of your Azure Resources!
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," After signing in, the page is just keep on loading even with good 
internet.. thought it will be useful but full waste.. not sure why 
Microsoft has such faulty apps"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Can't even sigh in, seeing some flipping g screens and the loading screen"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," What this app for? It just shows my subscriptions. I cannot manage anything 
or do anything."
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, This app not stable
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Flipping screens it is not working plz help me out
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," This is a great effort from Microsoft, although it is very far from the full functionality of the Azure Portal, but it is work in progress. I use it mainly to restart web apps when needed. A must have if you use Azure."
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Please add cost and billing features or the dashboard as a rendered view, otherwise ok."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Well done...!!!
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," I can't figure out the purpose of this app. I can't even see a snapshot of the available backups, or settings or anything."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, This is a great win for Azure users... And having the command line as well is great!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Thanks
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Content can not be downloaded.... being able to actually watch shows seems 
kind of important. Installed the app to watch ""Adam Ruins Everything"". 
Apparently he ruined this app because it doesn't work. Back to youtube."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, You can do almost everything you can in the web portal.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, App is good for quick look at the status of your apps. But search and filter functionality needs to added at every level for now filter is only given to Resource Group level. Better use it on WiFi If you have lots of apps then it eats your data brutally.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Nice app for viewing basic things. Wish the online portal supported mobile better or this app did everything the web does. Can't see billing as far as I can tell so that's disappointing.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Overall app is good but i don't know why i cant open cloud shell on my device it says oops with some very long number type id and closes??
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great app for quick overview!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Wonderful! Together with Microsoft RDS I'm capable of managing remote machines with easy!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, very nice to have powershell web cli on android.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Love the ability to use Cloud Shell within the app. Really useful
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Awesome application
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Perfect for monitoring status of Azure services while on the road... Not as full featured as web based interface but handy and usefully none the less.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great for a mobile version. Nice to be able to turn IaaS on and of on the go.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Needs Copy function for cloud shell
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, This app provides very little utility for backup customers
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, cloud shell 是否可以添加命令联想功能？
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, ARM VM and portal in not present
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Can't login. I get a 404.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Helps me monitor and occasionally manage my Azure infrastructure through mobile. I am really happy about the cloud PowerShell integration with the app. Hope the developers would add a mighty TAB button somewhere near the keyboard to make it more user friendly.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Outstanding, except notifications arent working for me.  If you have things hosted in Azure, install this app now.  You need it."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Why not include a widget to shut down and start  a VM
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Not very Rich app. It's just a monitoring app. You cant create anything.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Have to hit back when trying to sign in, to get the sign in screen. It seems pretty decent, would be a ton better if I could make changes in the GUI.

Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Very useful to check vm status start/stop etc
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Cannot sign in. Getting error.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, The app is amazing
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Very nice  👌

I would like to customize the metrics to show me info for the past hour (not just the past 24 hours or whatever the default is) also, like the website I can add additional measurements to the metrics such as CPU, memory, IO on top of DTUs."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Excellent app, that would be nice if we can see billing also."
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, So limited it's almost useless
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Webpage not available always.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Pleased to see some significant improvements. Looks to be very useful for monitoring the basic health of my Azure installations. Still has some interesting bugs and issues, but it's reassuring to see that the development team is responsive."
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," the app is good, but REALLY needs the ability to edit services, also, attempting to manage a custom image classic vm made with azure powershell crashes the app for me. please fix that bug"
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Can't even show basic information such as database quota usage etc
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," Due to some reason it won't launch cloud shell from app, I am able to access shell from laptop browser."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Latest update sorted the issue changing directory tenant... makes it a really useful app to have to hand now!
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, This app is great! All that's needed is the ability to switch tenants if the identity has access to multiple just like in the web portal.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, The new version is crashing when you scroll fast in a huge list.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," New version does not allow to surf between suscriptions, huge step back with this version"
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Works well for virtual machine management.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Azure on my phone! So useful!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great for working with Azure VMs
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great stuff
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Love it
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Does not meet the expectations. Helpful only to deallocate vms and to start the existing vms. This App can't even create or delete resource groups. UI sometimes stuck and not user friendly.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Great app to review resources but needs more control of resources built in
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Cloud shell doesn't work
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Nice app.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1," Unable to login when MFA is enabled. Please supply a fix.  Thanks,"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Please add cost, subscription credit graph"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Excellent I love it.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Pls add schedule feature in runbook automation account
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Good start. It would be nice to be able to manage multiple accounts though (I.e work and personal)
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Awesome app - though I should of course be able to request just-in-time access to my VM's though the app!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, I switched from Windows phone just for this after watching Azure Friday.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Wow best app ever can it get any better
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Not great yet, but making itself useful"
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Great work Microsoft!
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, After the update I need to log in.. again. Same as with the MS Teams app. That's getting annoying real quick..
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Great start but looking for news features like blob storage navigation.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Very nice!  Having billing information would be nice though.
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Great start but looking forward to more features.  Billing would be great to see.  Cloud Shell is not working for me.  I get an ""Internal Server Error, Unknown Error"" when I start up the Cloud Shell screen."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4," Great app, but still missing vital stuff, like billing (cost analysis), performance monitoring and dashboards."
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Lot of things to be added, main thing is scheduling and monitoring the pipeline."
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Nice to see you Azure on my Phone
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Need any beta testers? I like everything Azure look forward to seeing new features get added to this
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Now we're talking! Finally! 👍 Hell yeah, Cloud Shell!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Installed to see if I could review output or job status of Azure Automation accounts and runbooks but doesn't have the feature yet. For now I use an Instant App (Add to Home Screen in Chrome) and that does the job fine.
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Abusive permissions. Was working fine before now wants access to identity. Unacceptable
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Love it. Love being able to check status of machines and drives on the go. Wish there was a quick view mode to get an overview of all resources' statuses without ha ing to click around.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2, Can't see billing. Needs work on general
Microsoft Azure,Business,1, Doesn't show current billing estimate. What's the point of it then?
Microsoft Azure,Business,3," Sadly, one must log in upon every use. Understandably this should be a highly secure app, so I'm looking forward to seeing better ways to authenticate (fingerprint?). Also looking for multiple accounts/identities support. Otherwise it's fairly useful so far!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Great work! App is fast and responsive. Has the common info in place which is all good. One enhancement would be to filter by powered on VMs. Or be able to see VM status from the list.
Microsoft Azure,Business,2," After logging in, the app is sluggish and ring to open a resource it just hangs and crashes. Using a Nexus 5x"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Installed, authenticated, checked out my Azure storage account metrics : took less than a minute :)"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Aws doesnt have powerfull app like dis
Microsoft Azure,Business,3, Nice app but needs to support multiple azure accounts.  Would also like to see my current billing usage.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Awesome. It took some time but was worth the wait :)

Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Nice app. Happy I can manage azure resources from my phone when on the move.
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Where is the source?
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Finally a most awaited thing, please create an app for visual studio online as well or make its web ui itself mobile adaptable like GitHub"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Finally a great, simple to use app to manage all my resources on the go. The wait was worth it"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, We finally have mobile app to manage and monitor your Azure resources!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," All the azure resources in your hand, Cloud Shell coming soon, fantastic !"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Finally we have an application and can control everything with one small tap :D
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Love it! I can now manage and monitor my azure services on the go!!
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Finally one can manage all resources by smartphone, splendid!"
Microsoft Azure,Business,5," Loving the UI; clean, functional, and looks great."
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, Its about time. Powerful tools for Azure management.
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Feature to pause/start a data warehouse resource is required
Microsoft Azure,Business,4, Great to have a tool to manage azure resources
Microsoft Azure,Business,5, A great initiative by Microsoft team .

Dark mode is my favorite and it is so elegantly incorporated to this app across the platforms it's available on. If you're a Microsoft fan or just looking to detox from the televised news, you have to see the news through this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Installed a minute back it seems good I want to comment on just one thing at this moment.

Please add a system default mode along with Light, Dark modes so that it will change automatically based on time (Day/Night). And please make good looking dark colour instead of pure black colour for night mode. Will change rating as I use the app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," The headlines that appear in the ""top story"" notifications on my phone do not correspond with the stories that appear in any of the sections when I open the app. There is also a lot of gossipy trash mixed in with few ways of opting out."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," App worked great before the upgrade recently. Now crashes every time try to open an article to read. Do you not beta test this trash before you push it out the door to meet some quota? The software technicians that create ""upgrades"" need to take a long vacation or retire."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Like many other users, the app keeps crashing when an article is selected and is very slow to load. I've tried the beta and the stable versions they both do the same. The app worked fine on my note 10+ but not on my new S20 ultra. Uninstall/reinstalled but no joy!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I have used many news app and still using them but thing I liked the most is ""one-tap search"" of word. This helps to get meanings of new words. This feature can be seen on crome browser."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love this app for I've been with Microsoft for along time for many years. Also they provide great details about what is going on especially in the midst of Covid 19.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Best news app in these times. It gives you quality and unbiased journalism from the News Agencies across the globe and it is Ad free and its UI is fluid and smooth to the benchmark. Great! Kudos to the developers and the team behind.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Home page take too much time to load on android. Sometimes even it does not load. Please fix this. Moreover, app is not well smooth and responsive. Please take a look onto it. Rating will updated if these issues are fixed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, It gives a fairly diverse spread of news from around the world but where is the option to choose your sources? Frustrated by it still offering me stories from publications I have never and would never click on. Some of the categories such as columnists are simply not updated.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Best news app I've found! It's literally everything I've been wanting. I keep it in dark mode and compact mode. Wish I could upgrade to get rid of the ads! Either way it's still awesome!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Very good news selection, but extremely slow to open each article... Crash often, especially when opening from recent app... Google news is working perfectly fine, and my phone is an OnePlus 7 pro..."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very good layout, style and design. Works great for me. I am now using it as my only and continue source for reading News online. Good job Microsoft. Thanks."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, The new format which now has each section contain endless stories is a complete mess. Why have repeats of items over and over. App is no longer worth the time to try to plow thru. Moving to other apps for reporting info.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Thought I would try to replace google news but this just locks up. The second time I opened it I was able to click an article and then just lockex up again, so disappointing!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Fantastic news app! I really like the gloss black dark mode too. I would however change the logo to something more eye catching and more large pics versus small ones..
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The excellent: MSN gives you the stories where they have negotiated licensing. No paywall nags/blocking. Not so much: you can't follow a link to a new story and return to the story you were in.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, It was a good app but an update this morning makes it crash when trying to bring up a story. Update: It was updated on 4/7 and seems to work as it did before.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Looks okay (could be significantly more compact with a 3xN grid view) but it's just unbelievably SLOW to load or open news stories - so slow it's unusable!

Have learned to avoid any ""Sponsored"" segment, as it's just an annoying avalanche of ads. No content is worth that!!! This was my go-to news source since I got my first smartphone, but I recently uninstalled it. My eyes just don't enjoy reading small white print on a stark black background. What were they thinking??"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Worked great for years. Now it crashes as soon as I click on a story. I have Uninstalled the app and rebooted after each time, then reinstalled the app 3 times. No good. Please fix this. It WAS the best news app out there."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The best news aggregator app I've found so far. Nice intuitive interface, easy to customize the feed, not too heavy with ads."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," No paywalls. Excellent, customizable app. Get only what you want, or browse all news articles. Updated constantly. My #1 news source for many years."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, After several attempts at installing and reinstalling the app keeps crashing. It loads articles but when you try to open them. The app shuts down
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I gave this news app 5 stars for two reasons: 1. Almost no advertisements (unlike the MSN homepage) 2. Seems to be more balanced in how it aggregates its stories.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Too much advertising made to look like content. Diverse news content, not indexed. Some stories stay far too many days. UNINSTALLING"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, To many repeats of same article. Articles stay for long periods of time. Pretty much garbage.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love this app and it's my go to all day every day. I do have other news apps but I use this one most!! Thank you🌞
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, A lot better than most other news apps I've tried. And content isn't biased as most major news outfit are.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Quite good, but lacks the ability to sort articles by date /time, so you have to scroll through everything to find the new articles"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Overall good app, but needs a way to personalize actual articles that are in your feed. Like Google news app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Excellent app! Does what it's supposed to do: gives me the news, a couple of formatting options, and doesn't crash!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Ads are so high, doesn't let users to choose, which media they want to follow and which they don't ......below average, lag in smoothness 👎"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," One of the main sources I use to keep informed about the news. I have seen many people on here complaining about the paid ads.

I have seen many people on here complaining about the paid ads. People this is what keeps it free, much like commercials on free TV. If you don't like the ads then find a premium(NOT FREE) news app, also the ads are easily identifiable, contrary to what others are saying. Best of all, it contains information from a lot of unbiased websites but also has a good mix of biased websites as one can compare the content."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The best of all news app. All types of news from different sources at one place. Sing this app since I started using Lumia device. Now using this app in laptop, tablet and android mobile... :-) Good work for this team !"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Guys, the new update is not allowing me to open any story. Only the Headline are visible. As soon as you tap on a story the app shuts down."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Three updates in the past week has gotten the app operating buttery smooth final, efforts deeply appreciated, cannot recommend this app enough!!!"

However it is funded by ads that are hidden misleadingly among the regular news items. Some are blatant clickbait titles. (Example: ""People who retire comfortably avoid these financial mistakes"" goes straight to a product pitch.) Others are true articles that open as a web page absolutely smothered with banner ads. I would happily pay a small monthly fee to eliminate this jarring and dishonest user experience."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Embedded ads into the text of the article and ruins the speed read function of instapaper. No thanks.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I enjoy Microsoft news. Keeps me current with top stories world wide. Look forward to hearing the latest news on covid-19.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is an easy and effective app for staying current with important news stories.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Has become very slow post recent update. Also the news feed is not getting updated often

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," The app in itself is very solid, but I definitely need more granular interest tuning, akin to Google news."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Too many ads to scroll through while trying to continue reading a story. Too complicated
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Cannot expand widget to full screen whidth and widget does not show news unless refreshed. News algorithm for content is very good.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I have installed but keep getting popups to view in app when thats what I an already doing. Very annoying.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," great news app, good breaking alerts. still like app content, don't like new logo."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," If you want all left wing news that bashes Trump 24/7/365 this is the best place to find news. I have NEVER found even ONE story that tells a positive angle on any Republican, unless you think Mitt Romney is a Republican."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Local news in Bangladesh is not available. This is my only one problem. I want to get Bangladeshi news in English.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great coverage of the news and I love that I'm able to pick and choose what most interest me👍
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Comprehensive coverage - often a different slant on news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Better than the Google News reader since they discontinued their old news app. Too many adds but at least it is usable.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The white wording against a black background makes reading a breeze - not available in other news sites.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, 1. Cannot like a source 2. Search results are irrelevant 3. Difficult to find blogs about atypical topics

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great ! I found it very useful for reliable source of news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Ads are a problem. Apart from that it's an OK app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Slow app. When opening an article it buffers for 10+ seconds
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, App grew unstable after a while and I had to reinstall it. Works OK now.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I like the dark theme on/off switch, smaller/larger size font and the gesture way to move the pages back and forth or close it.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Timely news delivered in timely way. Good journalism. Thanks.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Actual app will not even open. Downloaded, clkd open, a privacy/sign in page is shown. Goes NO further. No matter what you do. Didn't know you had to sign in for a NEWS app, whose bright idea was that. The same one that f'd up the code that makes the sign in button work? Duuuh🎶... Epic FAIL."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," occasional, not too frequent, important news; good coverage; good sources"

The vast amount of deception with the ads makes the whole experience very unpleasant. Advertising pays the wages but it gives me the gutz ache the way its done in Microsoft News. It seriously pisses me off.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, When select a world in news and copy then app crash and re_opens everytime and after that select and copy option disappeared. 😈😔😫
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Lost ability to access personalized news. No option for help. TRASH.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, All non subscription news articles so all that you see and click on works. Not like Google news that always list news from subscription only news providers which is pointless if you don't subscribe or run out of the free reads per month limits.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This app is great it keeps you up to date on what's going on in the world.. and Corona virus up dates!

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very informative and impartial reporting. I just love it. Brilliant.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Garbage... Since installing this, when Google Now or Assistant is finding my personalized news feed, any click on a MSN story doesn't work. Really? It's a hyperlink? Opens MSN, then... Nothing. Nbc/Universal hire the Iowa Caucus Software company? ROFL"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, A reasonable cross section of news items of different sources
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good application. Functional and easy to use.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Superb app , working like native app, no major problems detected"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Smooth and beautiful app..filled with good selection of news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Best news app on Android. There are so many sources that you can spend endless hours reading about a host of topics. If you are a news buff, this app is a must have."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, All Media is biased. You have to sift through a lot of news to get a real grip and understanding for what's really going on.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," UI of the widget is not good enough, Google news had a better one. Please look into it..."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, MSN News features the most important articles of the web on a daily basis.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great app. But what about news edition for Ukraine?

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Nice Graphics Make for Easy Reading. However, it would be nice to be able to remove categories to make for easier navigation."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Every time I click on a notification on my Note 9, the app opens to a blank page with a loading animation but never never opens the article and just hangs there. Very irritating."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Fair enough. I thought that suddenly I see much more ads than I used to. It's still good enough so that I can read some news but I'm not sure what's going to happen with the next upgrade.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It is a wonderful news app from Microsoft , I really get the most what I miss always in the other news apps. Well done!"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Up to date news, not many boring commercials,"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, very inforrmative and reliable! And its somewhat addictive.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," News stories tend to be rather superficial. I wish there were more in-depth articles offering better analysis and insight. Technology section is focused too much on consumer technology, no real insights or articles of real interest."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Outstanding coverage with an excellent selection of sources. Be smart to look at the source so you don't click on the ads.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I realy enjoy choice of good news to read selections are great,"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great app from microsoft for news. It gives updated news. However it stopped giving push notifications. I hope next update will improve it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Good news aggregation..but you can't see other articles of that particular site unlike google news..which in a way curtails your information to the specific topic appearing..
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice interface, easy to read or save stories for later, get all your news per personally configured Categories!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Extremely slow. When fire up the app it freezes on Microsoft logo for a minute then shows the home page. Then I click on a top story it crashes.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Stories are way too long. Paragraph after paragraph just repeats itself over and over.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The selection of news is not based on my search history, which is good. I don't need news about a local restaurant."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I am retired person. Previously I was using Nokia phone supported by Microsoft . From that time I am reading news . Regarding app no issues. Thank you.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Just began using yesterday; so far very good. I will say, you should sign in or create an account to maintain any personal settings."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Very good app except there doesn't seem to be an easy way to make the font size larger.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love the access this app provides to news articles in real time and opinion pieces penned by very solid writers and journalists.

The app seems to get the content from the sites and shows it nearly on the app. It's free, there's a share function, good amount of topics, and dark mode. Biggest issue though, is the sponsored articles. The thumbnail and app layout makes the article look exactly like the rest of the actual news stuff. But the sponsored articles just open your default browser and sends you to a click bait article."

I can get a good amount of important and useful information, save/bookmark articles and share. It does not get so rough with advertisement or showing me my own searches in other apps like other news apps do. My only complaint is that most times, articles repeat down the 'timeline'(I don't know what to call it) or list of articles. You read or see the link to an article, scroll down, and there it is listed again, sometimes several times."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A Superb Tool. No glitches.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," It's one of the best app to read news. I like the feature that allows to save an article to see later. It has some good and important features like the Dark Mode, watch news videos inside the app and the Read Mode."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Does not display the news content!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great layout. Informat8.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Not very good! A bit cumbersome. Really getting annoyed with this app. News stories stay on for weeks, you have to flick through page after page to find latest news. Dominated by Guardian, Independent and Metro news, so very left wing biased. Would love an archive or hide function."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Clear news at the touch of a button
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Couldn't get the news feed to work without installing Microsofts official launcher. Otherwise it looks like non bias news which is hard to find nowadays.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A pleasant surprise in catching up with the news!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, News is ok but would like to get rid of the start up banner that cycles through a bunch of languages I can't read. Don't see the point of it and adds absolutely no value... just slows app startup time. Edit... they got rid of the annoying start up animation. Much better now.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," For the past couple days, all articles are broken when you click them, says tap to retry... Fail. Seems to only affect editions other than US."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Msn has always been a great source of information for me. I've used it on my old computer. I made it my home page. A Brilliant website.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Most of the news, as one would expect from the mainstream media, tilts sharply left. I like MSN because I like getting out of my little echo chamber, and they do a great job of compiling dozens of relevant stories each day. It's good to see things from both points of view."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Getting error message. No news can be read in detail. Only home page appears
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Love the different news headings.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Best GUI of any Android news app that I've tried, but unfortunately still unusable. It needs the ability to hide untrustworthy sources, or maybe just opinion pieces all together. Also tries to disguise advertisements as articles with ""sponsered"" printed small above the click bait headlines."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Too many articles open up while I'm trying to scan through looking for what I want to read and once done flipping through the open article most of the headlines I have already seen are back again. It makes me feel like I am wasting my time sometimes.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I like the fact that it keeps me up the news, rather it is politics, entertainment, finances or just day by dad. I enjoy it"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Some duplicate copies of articles
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Adaptable to my interests and always updated!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, No in your face ads.. Clearly set out
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Uninstalling this due to surreptitious ads. Ads that appear where you are going to click ""Next"" in multi page stories. This is in addition of panicky ads that are ""sponsored"" but not clearly marked out. Did not expect this from Microsoft."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very usable and diverse news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, This is good one News app.usefull and I gives four stars happily
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very factual in news delivery
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very nice info and also up-to-info , keepit up !"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Accurate and keeps you up to date.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent source for daily news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, i have tried various news aps over past 15 years and choose this one as most favored. i also use fox ap and others just to remain in touch with the extreme right-wing bias. this ap provides best overall coverage and ease of use. especially enjoy the 'dark theme' as opposed to dark outlook on life.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good notifications on important news topics
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It is not working on mobile data.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The best news feed I've used in terms of range of content and personalization settings. (DISCLAIMER: Written by a long-time veteran of Microsoft Support, but hey, in the latest version of MSN News on the New Edge Browser, IMHO it's TRUE!)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Useless App. Close to 70% of the news stories down open when one tries to read the story or update.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I can obtain current important information in a timely manner.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A truly wonderful source of daily news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Bad. MS, your ads blend too much with the stories. I have to guard myself. Yes it says sponsor but you need to color it or do something. Update Jan 2020 - Ads still blend too closely with news story. Shows devs dont care."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The app is very informative! It primarily focuses on my chosen topics. My only suggestion is that the content should be updated. It is frequently presenting topics over a week old or older.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Seems left leaning and lots of fake news that is not the truth. I don't really use it for actual news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Nice app. Shows Trusted news only.

If my review is here for long, I'll be amazed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, The app use to work great bit since the update on Dec 2nd 2019 ot won't work at all. App shuts itself down seconds after being started. Even after reinstalling the app and restarting the phone it still won't work. Update completely broke it
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Microsoft News provides a wide variety of news from many sources. I enjoy that the news is not all from one source; instead the news comes from outlets with different opinions. I turn to Microsoft News for a quick update of current events in a central location.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, It has ads. Google news is better.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A very good app overall.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Good news app, but the news on the international edition (english) are not showing up on my phone."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I have to search the entire list of countries to get to the UK version of MSN. The software should remember my favourites
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A quick tour through interesting news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Concise news coverage well done.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Slow, selective, accurate"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, For the time being I am very excited with the news so far. It grves me an option to chose the news items I am interested in. I have been following the news as it breaks. The most interesting aspect is the daily update on Trump's impeachment inquiry.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great diversity of news and the application is well designed.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love the variety of articles
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Crashes since latest update
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I like it .its very informing.i read this every day i would give this to my family and friends
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good but needs option to disable opinion articles. It is misleading mixing opinion articles in with the actual news. Also please put greater focus on the higher quality sources over others like Reuters and Associated Press.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," 4 crashes before initial login, then app just hangs. Should have know better using Microsoft stuff ie if it's really slow and hanging is probably as close to working s you are going to get. If it does anything quickly, worry, is probably fell over and doesn't know it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, App is ok. Content could improve but it is friendly for general reading. Content improvement would take it to a four but do not think there is a five star amywhere.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Interesting articles. Well presented.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, have bin using this for a long time it just keeps getting better
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Updated and Spot On !
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Best news app out there. More reliable sources and I don't feel that garbage news is not being pushed to me. I wish there was one subscription fee for all the sources similar to prime or Netflix. I won't mind paying $5-7/mo to get reliable good news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, To many stoys that drag out go to next page and then the next page and si on and so. Somthing like this remake. Nope not for me.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Not able to login and sync
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, this app lets you modify it for the information you want. But it shows a lot of old news for weeks and weeks. You cannot sort news articles by date
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good news aggregator drawing from multiple sources. Upgrading to 5 stars since synching across platforms is seamless and I like the user interface alot. It's clean and uncluttered. Great job Microsoft!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," No matter what time or what I'm involved with at the time, the app interrupts to push anything I've previously looked at (and usually ALREADY bought) to push product.I don't feel like an app user as much as I feel like a target.."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Please Minimize and organize the political content
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Easy to use app, but there needs to be more serious content and less click bait, especially in the news section. I do like that there's a wide variety of content from many sources."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Nice interface and custom options, but I'd like to be able to choose to ignore individual sources, and sponsored links are annoying."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Horrible dark mode. Dark blue hypertext on a black background, and a glaring white navigation bar. The Samsung browser makes you guys look sick in comparison. Great news feed, horrible presentation!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," This app is very nicely done. The screen will flip when the device is turned. Nice! If you have sound on, as you scroll down the page, each video will begin to play. The app is very well designed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Very good. I'm just learning. Need more exploration.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," This is quite a good app. It is let down some what by content in categories in which an item does not belong. By and large, it is quite good"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," It's nice, but I'm currently in Singapore and when I try to get international news, it won't work"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Easy format to keep everything organized. Current stories and decent writing make it an ideal news source.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I opted out for horoscope but even I did it, it still appears on the Latest News tab. I could not understand the logic behind it"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Simple and fast.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I always use it with no problems.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It's is a nice resource that pulls news from several different sites offering a well rounded perspective. I like the timely news updates and alerts.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," My go-to news agregator, easy to organize, very good layout that makes it easy to read, very little annoyance from adds, they appear as sponsored stories, just don't click'em!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Seems like it could be adequate but nagged me for a review within a few minutes of use. Regularly fails to load content. Widget fails to load content even more frequently.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, This news app is good at keeping up with current news. Just a few too many adds. But tolerable with the adds.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Awesome! Exactly what I have been looking for in a full featured news app. Collection of relevant stories and feature articles. Cheers!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," This app is increasingly abusing the ""breaking news"" feature to issue notifications for opinion pieces and other things that aren't of immediate/critical importance"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Old news still linger on as top stories.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, So far so far so good. The app is very nice. I have not had it long but it dekiveres the news and breaking news. it's not intrusive with ads.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Crashes since update
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very true and update. No false News
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The app works well. No complaints.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, So good and user friendly
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I appreciate the different areas this app sources its stories from. The app is quick and well laid out.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," No Lithuanian edition, and even Google News has Lithuanian edition. Make Microsoft News support Lithuanian news and it will be popular in every single household. But sadly, as it doesn't, it is pointless to use it. Love it for Irish news, but further languages integration is must."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Very helpful to have upto date news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Helps to keep me abreast. Regarding current events. The info given is very relevent.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, App is good but not as good as the Windows Phone version.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," The only issue is .... failing to logon using authenicator... Other, like news feed, is better than google honestly, especially the local and chinese news when the system language is english"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very good and informative
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good but sometimes slow
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great news app for the person that likes to keep up.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," What's the point, news is all about American irrelevance, what about news I want to read, no point having this app, it reminds me of google news and that's just boring."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very useful when away from home.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, A bit delayed of local contents

News should be fair, true and non polarized. MSN have all these qualities, have sound news resources. It categories news well too. MSN should also explore news related to health topics, new science inventions , electric gadgets and automobile too. I have been a reader of MSN for a long time. Its emphasize on political issues more than others. Thanks."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, When it comes to unbiased reportage of international Microsoft News has no rival Keep it up
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Slow to load and hangs
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Used to be a great news app. Unfortunately the recent update has made it very slow. It still loads the headlines fine, but it takes 30 seconds to load stories when tapped on a headline. It used to load the story in a couple of seconds. Come on MS, sort this out."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, I tried it for a full news cycle. Every single article which dealt with Trump was negative. Not one positive or even nuetral news or opinion piece. Way too left to be taken seriously.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Love your opinion section and photos.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Prefer the msn news site that comes up on Google search. Better layout, easier to navigate and read, as well as possessing a more attractive appearance."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I appreciate being informed and feel this app does so.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Coherent and new update info everyday

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Let's me choose the news I want, not forcing me to pay, not forcing some news either, easy to use and easy to recommend to others"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Excellent news app with a good balance of articles. It has one serious flaw: in dark mode, a dark blue font is used for hyper links. The links are unreadable against the black background when the screen is dimmed for night reading. Easy fix would be to make the hyper link color selectable."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," The latest, greatest version does NOT work! Asks me to accept terms and conditions and proceeds to disappear!"

If I wanted Trump tabloids I would go download CNN or Fox.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good news app giving world regional & local news for your area.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Not great. Useless ads in ""news"" feed. No options to choose providers; I have no interest in articles from the mail online but they are front and centre with no way of removing from list.

When playing a video in the the app, the video will freeze up at any given point. The audio will continue to play, but I will have to slide backwards in the video to get it to work again. That doesn't guarantee it will continue to work after doing that though. Another thing that is annoying is while watching a video, if you change the orientation from upright to landscape, the video starts over from the beginning. And vise versa. Landscape to upright. I am currently running this app on a J7 Prime, but I've seen this happen on other devices too."

If you're interested in the big topics of the day, you're pretty well covered here. If you're more interested in niche stuff, it is not always so consistent. I have also found an annoying bug, where my Xbox interest (Bing powered) no longer updates. It was stuck with the same articles for a month. I switched to the Xbox one interest, which worked for a few days before also getting stuck on articles. When I tested the Xbox interest again, which I had entirely removed, I was getting the same articles that it had been stuck on from a month ago. Not sure if this is just my copy or what, but it's kinda antithetical to the whole mission here. I'll reinstall and see if it fixes. (again, the main news works just fine.)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Yep takes too long to load new news material it does good at a basing its good at using your likes and things you search to make you keep flipping. Keeps news on too long. Like the Netflix of news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Very well thought out and easy to use

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The app is awsome to read on down time
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Best, balanced current secular-news app I have found. Nevertheless since the perspective of current news is hopeless, faithless, and without answers, so I'm uninstalling. Living disconnected from a constant stream of traumatic news stories is going to do me good."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Always tell the news without being arbitrary
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, My Topic categories won't save; random categories appear daily. Frustrating as they once did save. Issue has been going for about a week. **UPDATE** Same 'ole BS as categories reset after update; changed but won't save.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It's provide good and appreciable to read enjoy
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, the news seems trying to influence the readers.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Looks and feels like another famous News app but you can't setup anything in the feed. For example which sites to read, the language of the sites, the tabs above and so on. Pretty limited features for expert users."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice that I can read premium content from sources (WallStreet Journal, other big news outlets) without having to register or get bombarded to subscribe."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Doesn't load and force close on me. I suspect it is because I'm on Android Oreo. I will not update my OS for a News app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Usally pretty timely!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Disseminating news globally and continentally to an extent above human reasoning and imagination. What an outstanding broadcaster reserving best valuable note with outstanding remarks. Impressed.

This is the closest I've found with regards to the news function. It's fast, responsive, has a good selection of news feeds (daily mail readers probably won't like their selection) and supports the concept of a local news feed as well. I have only given 4 stars because their news feed widget only displays the top news item without allowing you to move onto the next one, it also wastes space saying it's a Microsoft news feed. There are also placed articles in the news feed rather than ads that popup (so not too bad) but I would pay for ad free. Hopefully this will grow from strength to strength and not shoot themselves in the foot like Google or Feedly have done (their new RSS reader is now unresponsive with you try to use it)."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Still makes it tricky to work with other news apps. It doesn't. I'm just learning, so I may be FOS. Been accused of same, although my ex puts it more graphically. Trying the beta next."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Just News as it should be
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Well thought out, structured and presented making it easy to find and access the contents. News content can be tailored, though limited. It will be great if there are more categories (a-la ""Flipboard"") to choose from."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The app is very useful for advance info
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Nice app! Great info!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Not a bad app. But updates to news can be lagging current events.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Does a decent job of finding articles, and from time to time some great pieces. However the sponsored clickbait that shows up inbetween is annoying. Also the more specialized filters end up presenting the same articles over and over (I'm assuming due to lack of content)"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good app nice that windows and google have collaborated
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I can't get internet access where I live, so I don't know about the Google thing.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I've only had this app for a short period of time. however that said thus far I like the way that it is organized and how Canadian news is prioritized before other matters. I'll continue to use this app and will return to adjust my rating if my perception of this app changes.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Pretty good, if quite left wing, and doesn't update as much as you would think. However, it gives a fairly broad range of news, and isn't too overloaded with adds. My go-to news service. Some videos don't size properly - hopefully they fix this in a future update."

Plus this is just the best designed app of all the news apps, content notwithstanding. It's great for reading on OLED phones at night. Disable the news alerts and you'll be good to go."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I just deleted this app after getting constant liberal-biased news notifications. There's no effort at all to be fair and simply report the news. It's totally a liberal news source.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The best free news app I've found.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I wanted an alternative news aggregator to Google News. This app shows potential in that realm, but the inability to filter out specific sources kills it for me. If the app can filter by content type, surely it can filter by source, too. Add source filtering, and I'm back on board."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Real time up to date news. Love this app!!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, (I had to go back and see what app this actually is before I could comment on it.) I love this app and ALL the info it gives so far 😊 .
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," No way to block media outlets that you don't want to see. This basic feature should have been in the very first release of this app, yet as of today (09/21/2019) there is no mention of it being added. Until then Google's built in news feature for Google Now is the best option."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice way to stay informed from a good list of news sources. Most content is free, but a few ask for sign-ups or subscription. There is no overt political bias as the sources are from a very wide range and can be customized. I prefer a broad perspective and this app makes it easy to get in one place."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good app, nice content and better than Google definitely! Need a few more options like viewing articles as a list instead of a hybrid box and list that is a bit confusing, a scrollable widget needs and automatic night mode.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I love the look and feel of this app, and I really like that MS put out another useful everyday app. My one nitpick so far is that the notifications don't expand, so you only see tiny segments of headlines. All my other news apps meet Pie design and expand and such."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Informative and helpful app
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I really like that you can add your own topics to follow. These topics either appear in your ""My News"" section, or you can view just stories from the topic. I wish there was a way to up vote or down vote a story so that Microsoft News learns more about my preferences."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, The format and overall layout is good. My issue with the app is I can filter the content. Not only source but type. I say I do not want political news and some how it ends up front and center. Google news handles this much better.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," smartnews layout is better, but this one allows me to adjust the font and has dark mode so my eyeballs are burning out of their sockets. I wish the layout was better. too many font sizes. images not necessary. go look at smartnews and just copy what they're doing."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Great news app. I fell however as though the news is heavily filtered to display ""non fake news"" which in a Sense is good, but who decides whether it's true or not? Also display and design wise, it could be prettier. Kind of feels like a MS DOS program. Please Microsoft, get a better design!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is a great app if you want to have an overview of the articles across multiple publications. Very nice UI and easy to personalise the type of content you wish to receive. Many articles also come with an extensive picture gallery which is a nice touch. My 'go to' app for news now

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The app is great . There are a ton of interesting stories from wide range of sources, including a lot that would normally be behind a pay wall .

You need to meet with the designer of this ill designed app. I could spec out something far better with a migraine! Keep improving it!

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Perpetual beta quality app. This app ALWAYS is slow to load content, if it loads at all. Sometimes doesn't log into my MS account (spinning arrow forever). MS did finally allow for ajusting font size. Now they just need to get the app to consistently work!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The selection of news articles is good, focusing on the issues that are the most current. This app provides a bipartisan view of the issues without bias allowing the reader to form their own opinions, which I appreciate . While there are quite a few ads, they are not bothersome."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, This news app is great and covers different areas comprehensively. I enjoy reading news here.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Awesome App. Simply one of the best...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great informative app
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice selection of numerous sources of content. I can't discern any ideological/political skewing of what gets posted. I check it at least once a day, and I find it to be informative and worthwhile."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I like the format, but there are way too many junk headlines and stories. Too many repeat stories too. Today under the ""U.S."" tab there were 4 or 5 headlines saying the same thing about measles. I would like to be able to choose the news sources too."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Its a good app overall , news content updated timely and very similar to MSN homepage . But please let pictures download over mobile data as well. They dont seem to load on mobile data. :( mostly working over Wi-Fi. I'd give five starts if u guys work on that. Good work team microsoft"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Generally the layout is good. There is too much old news that is kept on for weeks. The articals are usually extremely bias. We want the news facts - not some idiots oppinion. We are quite capable of forming our own oppinions thankyou. Please fix this.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Pro: Looks great, easy to navigate and customize. Con: Unable to save a reading list of articles. Original source sometimes not prominent enough. Feature request: I like to skim the big picture and mark headlines into a reading list, then read the stories."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," What a tremendous struggle to get through an entire story by having to click next after each small paragraph to further read. Furthermore, half way through article mandatory click bait will start ya back from the beginning! Frustrating!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A good source for interesting content.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I didn't opt for cricket But you keep sending notifications about cricket. Any reason behind tbus. So irritated
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like the dark mode. Easy on the eye. Only selected news outlets populate the feeds. That's all I need. Ads are not intrusive either. I clicked once in a while. My go to news app now other than flipboard.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," the app is one of the best for news, due to the variety of feeds you can configure, so you get a more rounded view on events happening in the world. only issue is it crashes occasionally."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Intrusive and bold ads break reading and disrup focus. Usually love Microsoft products but not this one the way it is set up. Like there could be an option or incentive for people who actually sign in and office365 subscribers to have less intrusive ads... Come on...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is a great app for your daily update on news. It has categories that you can setup to your liking. I use it with Dex mostly on a Samsung phone so I have a full screen experience with touch. Its great on the phone screen too. Enjoy.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Most of the time this app will take 5 minutes to load on my android tablet. It never used to be so stubborn, but the last couple of months have been terrible. I like the format, but I seldom get a chance to read it. Yes, I did clear the cache, etc."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Updates 24/7.!

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great source for news!!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," A diverse news feed, all presented in a consistent format. Select articles available from paywalled news sources, supported by occasional ads in the form of 'sponsored content', clearly marked as such. Would recommend to anyone that knows better than to click on ads."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The only reason stopping me from giving 5 stars is the font size, which goes from tiny to tiniest. There is no large font making it hard to read unless held close. I've even uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. Please fix the font size. A good example is WAPO'S."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent app for news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Doesn't even load. It just sits at the opening screen and does nothing. Great app. Smh.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," This app has varied sources for news and is updated up to the minute. Its great for getting the news without hitting pay walls at the newspapers. And yes, they do include Fox and sources like them."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Great concept, UI, bundle of information. However, have experienced lag and not definitely there are some bugs still there as the App sometimes doesn't responds, disappears and difficult while sharing certain articles"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Since the latest update (which apparently 'fixed bugs') it seems worse than before, crashing every time I open it. It was fine before! Mind you, could do with fewer 'advertorials' too!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Articles mirror my interests quite well. This app is a good place to stay abreast with news that have interest to me. Good job. Now I have to flit about less looking for articles on my subjects. Thanks for that.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Most news apps are showing photos that are too large and taking up too much space to scroll thru. Wish there's a ""list mode"" showing only headlines or with small thumb pics. When I do, that will probably be my daily diver for news"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It has the dark background option and won my heart! I just installed it,but so far so good.. except some of the pages are weirdly labeled after my tailored interests, I'm not sure what that's about yet."

My father passed away a few months ago and I did use my android phone to search when arranging his funeral. Since then I have had deeply insensitive adverts on this app about funeral and cremation. I literally get these ads every time I use the app. There seems to be no way of deleting cookies or setting ads to not use my personal information. I've even deleted and downloaded the app. Please answer why you think this is ok?
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Easy to use. Good to spend time and keep yourself updated on news. I feel a certain bias in the news selection so make sure you have more than one source. ( Should always be the case anyway. ) Thus why I took away one star. Otherwise, great app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," unstable and unreliable. frequently stops. too bad, it was good for a while."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I want to give 5 stars but,... I love the app except for 1 issue. The news categories I chose will be defaulted when i open the app. Closing/reopening app sonetimes helps, other times I have to log out and in to get my preferences reinstated. Fix this issue and i will rate 5 stars."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Super laggy. Click on an article and it just sits there with the loading spinner.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," another liberal news agenda, first install, main news resources, ny time, Washington Post, cnn, nbc, etc etc etc, designed all for brain wash, fake news and less popular news providers.. that's why this app is so unpopular. not for me, i don't like lies, manipulation or brain washers."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I love the diversity of sources which is purely based on your interests. Unlike Google News, this app offers a wide range of sources for full coverage of topics. I'd love the possibility to choose multilingual content."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very easy to use! The main reason why this is my favorite News app is because you get all news in one place, no need to download other apps or go to their websites."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good sources and good layout, but every other time I open it the entire interface becomes jumbled and unreadable. I'll keep using the app but it gets annoying to have to open it twice almost every time I want to read something."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I appreciate the text only mode. The interface is easy to understand and navigate. However, the story categories seem to be cluttered with content that is not relevant to my needs or interest choices."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good news curating app. My one complaint is that it does not support copying portions of viewed content. I presume that is some valid reason for this but it is still a feature that I miss.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Mostly a descent app but I really hate that if you disable notifications they continue to show up like you did not disable them. Classic Microsoft move to just disregard the user. One of these days I'll just delete the app n just use Google News app which is sad coz I've been using your app for long
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," i like it when it works, but the last couple of""upgrades"" have resulted in lots of crashes and failures to initialize. Also, the number of sponsored articles (advertisements) seems to be increasing over time."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Pretty good, but some of the news has a very subtle left wing flavour to in that there are many bad news stories about the current administration, but, It seems hard to find a bad news story about the left wing."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, great app. love the layout and ease of use. love getting fresh news. the flow of the app makes it easy for me to find stories of interest and share them as well. thank you Microsoft
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, In looking for broad and deep coverage from top rated.. extensive top rated news reporting organizations..this app draws from many to ensure the broadest sources.

Balance on topics can be found again from a variety of top quality news organizations...national and global. The organization of different news types is also exceptional.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great news resource compilation service. I especially enjoy the syncing with the News app on Windows 10. Great way to curate the news sources you want to read from, although I prefer the Top News tab to keep a more balanced approach. Never have a problem!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Easy to navigate
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, No better news App than this... Just the way it should be...!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, The video playback lags on my phone. I have samsung j 7 prime
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Far too many ""sponcered"" stories. The app seemed to be very nicely laid out but the ""sponcered stories"" aka fake news, click bait, and ads sneakily embedded within the legitimate news feeds just got to be too much for me to handle."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, This used to be good. And it still is. However it no longer allows me to get a global feed of my area. The location function simply fails to fire.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, This app is very aesthetically pleasing and keep stories Relevant and up to date. I don't have any problems except the lack of an offline mode. Four Stars
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Very nice. To me though (or to any other Microsoft launcher user with the same news feed build-in) it's ultimately usless... unless you want to read your world news (can choose 'international' as a region) or to have a dark UI, that's only available in the app so far."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great news app. Informative and good features. You can added categories liked entertainment, technology, sports, world news and more. Would recommend it. Thanks."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," This app has developed a fault for me recently, every time you click on a news article and then try and go back, the Microsoft News app resets and loads back up so you lose where you were. It's infuriating!!! Hoping for a fix soon before I look elsewhere for my news.."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," My problem with this app and Microsoft generally is localization. I don't know why it's difficult for you to add local content to this news app, you have an office here in Nigeria, but there's never news from here. Why should I be reading only news from other countries? Please localize this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great app. You get all of the current news from all the reputable news channels such as, the New York Times, AP, Washington Post, Fox news etc. Plus it gives you notifications when their is breaking news. All for free"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is the best news app I downloaded . It has all I want plus more. The other news app can't compare with app. I love it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Timely, detailed, interesting."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Clean design, bold news. The one I have liked the best after other ones I have tried."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," it's excellent news source. I have this Microsoft news on my HP laptop. I watch there, also. But I use my phones more often than my computers, except when writing.

I have this Microsoft news on my HP laptop. I watch there, also. But I use my phones more often than my computers, except when writing. Every time I look at MicroSnews, I come away with facts I can trust & Movie info (loved movies since toddler). Microsoft News is my favourite. I use Google news; it's located on Google page. Both MicroS & Google (news) are my #1s, in tandem, like troika. My HDTV is permanently on NHK, but I watch TYT & Randy Rainbow on YouTube."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I like this app. It's simply a digest of generally available news items, but I like the way you can swipe from one article to the next. It is a bit US orientated, but I can cope with that. I thinks it's one of the best news apps around."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," It's probably been my favorite app besides Google News and Flipboard. These two do offer more topics to follow but Microsoft News is up there. Microsoft if you're listening, you could diversify your news sources more to include right or conservative views..."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The topics displayed are what I am interested in reading. Thank You.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent news and very fast.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Broad detailed coverage of wide variety of topics.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, horrible because you cannot control the content in any way apart from gross categories (sport or news) content aggregators (such as Daily Mail) are promoted over original sources which is poor form. uninstalled it and went back to Google News.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," fantastic information app, but you have restricted copy paste option, 1. it would be much better if you keep content page without loader option. Because it's getting confused when we scroll the news down. 2. There is no technology page option in the menu tiles."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Your app doesn't refresh news periodically, nor are new news available when refreshed manually. So about 90% of news are stuck for days. It drains away the charm of reading news everyday. I am uninstalling the app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Worst news app ever! It's better on Windows 10 than on Android. Notifications are not expandable, data layout is so odd. Even the font used is ugly facing. Learn from Google News or Apple News, u r too far from their apps."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Occasionally slow to load and the ads are mixed with regular news articles which can get confusing thus only 4 stars. I use this almost every day to stay informed, and I still think it's the best news app available."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Enjoying the pre-defined categories as well as being able to create my own. Like that there's a Windows 10 version that works with the same categories, so I can follow the news I think important throughout the day."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I enjoyed the alerts that keep me on top of what's happening in the moment, but sometimes feel the content delivered doesn't always hit the mark with my interests. But, that is the news after all right?"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I like it because it is on top of the news. It allows opinions from the national papers such as the NYTimes the Washington Post and others to comment. That is what is what I like and the political comics 🤸🏿‍♀️
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I missed this app when my company moved away from Windows phones and back to Android. The Android version seemed less well laid out IMO but with the new compact view, it feels like the app I used on my old Nokia(s)."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Used to work, but the last update killed the app on my Galaxy S7. Uninstalled and reinstalled, but the app doesn't open- just sits there with the splash screen cycling through the languages. Needs a fix ASAP!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, The app has a major flaw in that one cannot return to position in string of stories After reading one story. Hitting or selecting 'back on a tablet takes one back to forest story. It does have built in return but users habits are to use device return.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Overall, it's a great app. The only thing that's a little frustrating is that the stories you may see on a computer are not the same stories that come up when you open the app (even immediately). Fix this and I'd give it 5 stars!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, App keeps up with the latest in whatever interests someone. Choosing through an array of categories allowed me to customize the content I want to keep up on. I only wish the app offered the ability to comment on articles.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Best app. We enjoying & following this apps
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Cute animated splash screen. Never loaded any content. I uninstalled, reinstalled, no change. So, the News is, use a different aggregater for your news. This one is without merit"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," App is buggy & finicky, Content is close to pathetic; a mix of news feeds from sites with paywalls (inaccessible) and clickbait masquerading as ""news"". Legitimate stories can for days without refresh, and other real/vital news never gets picked up by MS News."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Slick app ruined by far too much 'sponsored' content and limited range of sources with no way to add new sources or filter what I'm presented. Like Google News and Apple News, they show you what they want you see and nothing more. Disappointed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Much improved after the recent updates. News aggregation is all about choosing the right sources and Microsoft News is doing that now. It would be ideal if it also allowed subscription to magazines or newspapers from the same app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," In the new advent it looks like leader as it includes almost every topics of one's interest and also provision for Local news ,smoothly! But one thing, don't think I, necessary to keep the old news for days."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Too many of the same report under different categories. You might find one or two new stories mixed in. Seems reports are recycled appearing between current reports. No new reports on Saturday and Sunday as if the app takes the weekend off
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, awesome app. after using for 3 days I can say I am extremely satisfied. also the app doesn't show annoying ad pop-ups like other news app. it shows the advertisement as a card. great.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I've been using MN for several months now without any major issues and really enjoy it. I have 8 categories/tabs that interest me yet everytime i exit the app, ''Tomorrow's Cars'' adds itself back as the 9th category no matter how many times i manually remove it from the list..."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice News alerts lately, and very much when on the go."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good App. I like it because I can tailor what I want to see and what I'm interested in. As with any news app nowadays you have to take some of the articles with a grain of salt and make your on decisions. Overall great!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great for getting first hand up to date information about the happenings around the world!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," No Bulgarian localisation, and no option for custom news feed. How difficult is to update the source?"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The app is nice and useful but it has less political news Wish more politics news would be there.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Didn't work on OnePlus 7t pro. It crashes and makes my phone unusable every time I try and open the app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love Microsoft news on a daily basis.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very very entertaining.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Probably not exactly ""fair and balanced"" when it comes to news... leans to the left pretty far. I find it odd when I go to an alternate news sight and can't even find the story MSN has in the headlines. Lots of bashing President Trump... most of which is not even newsworthy!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," When the app first opens up, it asks you for your interests. I purposely left Sports and celebrity news unchecked, because I am not interested in that. However, strolling through my feet, news about sports and celebrities still came up. So what the heck is the point? I uninstalled the app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," been broken for me for awhile now. just displays opening animation. clearing cache and data, and reinstalling doesnt help. update: full wipe, factory reset, and it still wont work. just sits on the loading screen with no activity"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," This is a brilliant piece of work. beyond measure, hands down, I absolutely love this app. Thank you Microsoft and thank you to the writers :)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," You get a wide variety of news on many different topics quickly. It keeps me more updated with whats going on in more areas from sports to weather to entertainment to government, very helpful."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, I read daily MS News.News from all sources should be given. News from NDTV sources seems pretty biased towards some agenda.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Love it; it's easy to use, good amount of News & World News for news junkies like myself, 😉 and it's not as jumbled as other news sites!!!! it's Great."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great news aggregator with a dark theme and smooth UI. My only complaint is that you can't select/copy text from the articles.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Partisan mainstream media sources. Getting ""loading"" notifications randomly since the last couple updates."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," When I open this app, screen remains blank. Doesn't load anything. It's my favourite news app on desktop, so on mobile. Please fix this issue as soon as possible."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Super slow to load and poorly updating articles for business news. Preferred the old app interfaces..too much gossip and celeb news. Does appear to do stock and graphs as the old one did
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I have abandoned printed news, as well as TV newscast. The news on Microsoft News app is comprehensive and unbiased in its coverage of international, national, local, sports and business news."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good way read news and sports
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good but few issues
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great news reporting not bias
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Microsoft News app would be better if the app loads without a ""Oops, something went wrong. Try again""message. There are bugs that need a fix."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Balanced news, good app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Up to date stories, good selection - though some of the contributions are a bit tacky and over blown - think tabloid outlets 🙄 Even when you pick/limit your choices, it seems to revert to dross and 'popular' stories."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," same old news, same fake news, even the news is written like a third grader wrote it. you have to look for the news in an article because of the intros in most stories. same articles over and over. Nothing is orignal, its all rehashed news from other news sourses. nobbody edits stories for correctne...Full Reviewsame old news, same fake news, even the news is written like a third grader wrote it. you have to look for the news in an article because of the intros in most stories. same articles over and over.

They get paid tp repersent the pople not the"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I have found breaking news to be pretty timely. I like that I am able to select my preferences. And if my news priorities change, I can update on the fly."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I've been using this since windows phone lumia 640 2 years ago and now I moved on to android. I love how simple the page shown and the dark mode! Love it so much!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Great app after finding that i could reorganize my interests in the order i wanted. i really really dislike ads though. i mean this world really is becoming like Blade Runner, ridiculous. The ads don't obscure the experience but its kinda ridiculous nowadays days."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, When I try to open a news article it just spins as it tries without success to actually open article. Microsoft drops the ball once again. Was a great app once upon a time.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is the best news app by far. It has so much news that most of the time you'll never finish reading the articles there are so many. It is constantly updating its news articles. Good going Microsoft!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I get most of my headlines from this app. I have not been disappointed.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, One of my favorite news apps. The custom feed aspects set the bar for how news apps should function. The way it pulls from multiple sources helps keep you honest rather than living in the completely biased world of a single source.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I read this daily. i like it because it has catagories that make it quick to scan through, you can customize it, and the newest stories are on top."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent News source app. It is quickly becoming my go-to daily news feed. It provides a lot of category choices depending on your taste. Highly recommended for news junkies.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," unfortunately microsoft's phone OS is not a thing, so a perfect world of my phone and laptop being connected are probably all but gone. thankfully this app exist and you can at least get your media feeds linked on both platform in an almost seemless way!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, One problem that I have with this app is that when I open notification for breaking news it just takes me to empty page with just headline written and a photo saying breaking news. That's it nothing else. What am I supposed to do with just headline and a photo just saying breaking news?
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Good sources, few paywalls, better results."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," This news app provides fairly good updates of news throughout the day. I've learned to avoid the ""sponsored"" content, which are basically ads disguised as ""newsworthy info"", or tabloid quality filler."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good collection of the current news harvested from other original news sources. When you connect to the story you may have to accept cookies or advertising emails from them.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great app for getting articles from a bunch of news sources. The only feature that would be nice is the ability to bookmark articles or save them offline
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Used to be decent, light and handy app. Them it changed completely about 6 months ago into a bloated 500mb mess. My search continues for a multi outlet news app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Great collection and very high quality. Select the topics onelikes. Concise and not many ads to cover the screen. Miscrosoft products are great and so are apps. Most are free, the laucher is really good too. Worth a tryvto see for yourselves."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Stale news don't disappear even after a month. Advertisements are sewn in between news articles very skillfully- but are such timewastes. This app is better than TOI on relevance of content but fairs very poor in quantity. I need to start looking for an alternative soon.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Selection of news sources is not an user option....... I use many great products from Microsoft. However, this app does not let the user select or influence the selection of news sources (unlike Google News)...... Uninstalled."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The stories are many in this app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very good app that provides all the news - - without a pay-wall that Flipboard has. This is my go-to app for all the news, including Washington Post and New York Times. Most important: no pay-walls!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love this app. It is well layed out and functional never had a problem with crashing and it keeps me updated on world events well ahead of any TV or radio news programs.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Used app for years as main news source, but it hasn't worked on my Samsung s9 since the update so I'm now searching for a new news app. Very disappointed as it was great before then but now it either doesn't load or I get a blank screen..."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Great news app, but it needs the ability to better adjust the fonts for people like me who can't see the screen on-the-go al that well. Otherwise, it's a solid news app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It's simplicity and fact that it's news is compiled from multiple and reputable news sources makes this a great choice and my number one on both pc and mobile .
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Habitual reading, variety of sources, and it's free."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent source of news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," like most legitimate news from other sources this news coverage has been very refreshing to read, there's a lot of variables in the coverage that make it interesting."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," lots of news aggregators out there. Microsoft news is fairly good, nice interface but I haven't figured out how to tune it for my interests yet. local, finance and politics tuning needed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I really like getting an overview from a range of different news viewpoints. It's much more balanced than just one feed.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," displays same news for weeks, no frequent update of news, no auto refresh by msn. last version was good, this version needs to be verified thoroughly."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, One sided political articles without a straight forward point of view. Same as Google. I was hoping this would be more balanced - It's not. Removing the app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," the app itself is fine, nice having everything consolidated however the notifications are broken. im still getting random story notifications despite the fact i have it set to only give me breaking news. sorry microsoft but news about love island is not what id consider important breaking news...."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I really appreciate that the news stories directly connected to don't have pay-wall issues, but the two annoying things are the repetition in the list of stories and the sorting order doesn't appear to always be chronological."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," The news presented in a liberal/socialist light, like 95% of the media outlets. Tech and science coverage is decent, but sometimes politicized too. Shame on Microsoft for not being able to stay impartial. App's functionality is great."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The latest Interests updates have become wacky in how my Top News section is now polluted with ""news"" sites and wonderwall photo click bait type ""stories"". Hard to find the actual real news from established outlets like WPO WSJ and NYT in this sea of other junk news sites."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," The customization levels are nice. However, they stuffed with so much clickbait that it's essentially like the MSN page. I intentionally did not sign up for sports but they found their way to my page regardless because, well, clickbait."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, I enjoy this news coverage. I read it each morning. I like the different selections.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Concise and plenty of information and index for speed of reading.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Lots of news good coverage
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very informative well laid out and an excellent selection of news and infotainment!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Thank you Google for forcing me to look for another news app after you dumbed down yours. :D Thank you Microsoft for a mature, attractive and tailorable news app! 4 stars because there should always be room to improve."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, it's OK but I've asked not to see opinion and it still shows. Also needs an option to dismiss an article and not show it again. I've been seeing the same few headlines for weeks now.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Only used this app once. Opened 3 articles that were just clickbait and from websites with unrecognizable website names. That was convincing enough for me to immediately delete it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love this app Provides all the current news. Works great. I've had no phone problems since installed. Recommend it highly to stay up to date on the news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Why the category ""entertainment"" is always selected by default? Even after i remove, if i close the app and reopen, it comes with entertainment pre-selected. Need the ability to remove it. Please fix this."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, When it was MSN it was a decent news app. Now it runs constantly in the background using battery and crashes all the time. Also the adverts disguised as articles are really annoying.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Best news aggregator period. Countless sources like AP, ,Routers, NYT, Fox, CNN etc. Text only option, breaking news alerts. Night or Day and font size options. Hope this app is here to stay. Thanks developer!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," The ""sponsored"" articles are spam. They trick you by looking like a news article but direct you to spam sites. Outrageous. Sort it out. The news sources are also often opinion pieces, which hardly classes as news. Shocking."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It is fine but there is no way to copy a word. I think it is important to add copy options for the learners. That's why learners will get the meaning of a word easily and will help them to study better.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Every ball and Cricket score is pushed as notification on my mobile as BREAKING NEWS, even though i have not enabled any cricket news. Request the app developer to take some lessons on what should be categorize as breaking news and what shouldn't. if this continues i will have to uninstall this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, They come up when using Edge. Not Good
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Just the right amount of news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Always keeps me updated all the time. I love it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Timely and informative
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Slow, made my Android One device hang. Poor selection of topics."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very good at getting updated news. Nicely organised into sections, wouldn't be without it. Also like the 'night mode', makes it great for reading on tablet."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very handy, useful and elegant news app. It's very fast too. Thanks to Microsoft, we have it on all platforms"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Lots of options to customize your feed. I use this app for keeping up with USA news while abroad. Widget and notifications for only breaking news (usually less than once a day) cater to my news consumption.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Easy, good-looking app. Stable work. Local is only for big ones 😁. Still interesting for a big view in the case of bearing with some English."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Coming from Windows 10 Mobile, this app is not as good. Can we have the option of more widget sizes/customisation and the ability to scroll through news pages from left to right?"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Microsoft News used to be a very fine app, but they have made some changes in it recently which makes it so difficult to load that it's almost impossible to wait for the news to come up"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I am very happy with this app. News updates are very quick. And it include numbers of renowned newspaper article. Dhanyawad.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," good diversity of news. easy to navigate. I use it a lot. maybe a few more focused feeds but all in all, I probably use it more than Flipboard."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A great way to get news from a variety of sources! Easy to navigate and easier to share on different social media platforms.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Pretty good news app, which I default to. It gets one star for prompting me to review it. I don't need an app asking me if it looks pretty each morning."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Each tab seems about the same as the previous. If an article is seen in one tab, remove it from next. Video often hangs with audio continuing. I see commercials twice on vidio feeds if I change screen orientation."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I like the way I can quickly jump to what type of news I want to see whether it be my interests, Australian or worldwide. I like that I don't have to see sports results if I don't want to know yet."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Best mix of news of any app, well organized into categories. Not a lot of click bait like other news apps. You can customize it to your favorite categories and what news providers you like. I have it on Android and on Windows"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Better on windows phone but what the hell just use it anyway
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Cant keep track of where you are in app. After you read a article and go back to read more it starts you over.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Overall a good news app. It has a general overview on news. Any more depth would make it inconvenient.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," It's ok but why, when I'm reading from the app itself,do I get a ""Download the all new Microsoft News app "" message? It's irritating and makes no sense. I may aswell uninstall the app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Wow it seems like Microsoft is back. News, To Do (which is by far the best i have used), Edge, Launcher. Next improve the system stability in Windows 10 and launch a small sized phone at a competitive price.. you are good to go."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It's exellent app and very fast, it works flawless, it does for what is designed to do, great job guys, keep up the good work."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," no pop-ups or overlays. just sponsored articles, which open inside the app, not in my browser. Decent spread of sources so sometimes I see content from the other side politically."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Mostly a good experience. However it crashes from time to time and I am unable to remove an ""interest"" that I have decided I am not interested in: I remove it and it comes back a little later."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very impressed so far! Love that you can customize and save items easily. Clean interface, decent news sources. Would be great if we could customize which sources in addition to topics."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like the apps very much because it feeds me the right news at the right time.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It is quite responsive
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Better than Google news and other many news apps. Great job. Love the way I can get news in English and Spanish from US and South America 😎 nice work 💪
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Lots of clickbait and ""alternative news"". Wonderwall, Medical Daily, Parentz Talk, Dollar Freedom..those are all ""news sources"" from this app. Not sure who this app is for. Try the AP or UPI apps"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Like the stories offered...the format is well organized, makes it easy to find interesting topics and follow-up."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," it's okay But drop Taboola Ads, end the feed rather than repeat headlines. i have zero interest in some topics and should be able to deselect them. i like more regional feeds and i also like to see gobal non mainstream news with both left and right views so i can see whats really happening"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good app, but has some update issues. Doesn't always have the most up to date stories and there are some stories which just never vanish?!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I enjoy having the news @ a moment's notice. Knowing the important news as it unfolds is helpful and thought provoking.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," the news portion works great, but i give it very few stars because the inital set up is a pain the ass. just give me the news, i can remove sections after the app displays something."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Quick way to keep abreast of recent news. Dint look for highly curated content. However the app provided easy to use interface and wide enough variety of content to keep using on a regular basis
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I just switched from apple and was bummed that I didn't have apple news anymore because I liked fine tuning what I see and read in the morning while I drink my coffee and this is just like it I can pick things that I like or news I want to see you can basically pick anything or any topic to follow a...Full ReviewI just switched from apple and was bummed that I didn't have apple news anymore because I liked fine tuning what I see and read in the morning while I drink my coffee and this is just like it I can pick things that I like or news I want to see you can basically pick anything or any topic to follow and there will be articles on it this app is amazing and I use it every day
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Works great. Easy to use. I like the presentations of multiple points of view in the opinion section.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Microsoft News is another winner app from Microsoft. It is highly intuitive, easy to use, and comprehensive in contents. I really enjoy using this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Pure junk......I thought I could get some unbiased news from this and I sorta did but 50% or more of the ""articles"" that come up are those POS click bait ads. They have no true stories but start Slideshows loaded with ads instead of an actual story. PATHETIC to say the least. This is NO news app but...Full ReviewPure junk......I thought I could get some unbiased news from this and I sorta did but 50% or more of the ""articles"" that come up are those POS click bait ads. They have no true stories but start Slideshows loaded with ads instead of an actual story. PATHETIC to say the least. This is NO news app but another microsoft money grab. Junk at its best and worse."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Surprising that the news served here is much better than Google news. relevant and informational rather than click bare nonsense. it would be great to choose and save news sources otherwise this apps great. highly recommended
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, soccer news hasn't been updated in almost a week -- primary reason I liked this app was the latest news -- I'm not sure how to give less than one star rating
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, this app literally only opens half of the time. it will sit there for hours loading. I close and exit it through android and reopen it like 5 times before it decides to work. please fix
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," easy to follow stories without changing pages. I hate stories that has a little on the page, then it's next or continue to keep following the story."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," always been good, but newest version slow to open. sometimes it refuses to do it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Super news app! Way better than otherd that always too much oriented by the fata they gather from the device. This one is more like a real paper but with plenty of sources .
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," You choose the articles of news you want to read, from the platform you choose. Constantly updating and very user-friendly."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Don't rewrite how Android does orientation. How I hold my device is not yours to dictate. When you do, you force me to hold it weirdly. Android does 360 rotation and so should this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Works well for what it is. Nothing special, but I have been using the automatic Google articles and they are all random trash now. A feast I know that this app will actually display my interests."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I keep turning off the notifications and as soon as I re-boot my phone they are back on again. It is extremely annoying. That is why I am deleting the program I am tired of Micro Soft trying to control my life.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, It's ok but they mix the news with junk. They do label it but they throw in ads and opinions. And when you're searching through headlines you don't always notice that an interesting article is actually junk.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Microsoft news better UI than Google news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very good news app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Excellent News Reports!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great app with up to date news. Easy to operate. Adds are not intrusive.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Works well but take a very long time to load when switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," So far ok. The stories appear better balanced than many other news apps. It takes a very long time to load, though."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," sometimes hangs, sometimes very slow, not connection, shame otherwise good. app. local news no longer working so dropped one star. I may uninstall it's just not up to the task."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," It works when it wants to, but mostly doesn't get past the start screen and just stalls. Its not a new problem so I'm not sure why it hasn't been fixed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Updated 30Mar2019 and app no longer works. Doesn't display any articles. update: will work, but not on wifi. also this newer version inserts fake news articles and click bait ads disguised as articles."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," just don't like the ""sponsored"" ads that never go away. good app with good news coverage. easy to use and tailor to what you want to read about."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I use google news and wanted to branch out to other services. Too many of the articles in this app are filled with click-bait websites and so many ads that ita almost impossible to even read the article. Too bad another Microsoft product sucks.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Excellent app! This is my favorite news and information app. Very clean, concise user-interface, and easy to navigate/configure. Good work!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Layout is awkward. Sponsored stories not easily distguishable from news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Giving information that are reliable.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Still lopsided reports
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Thanks you Microsoft not putting annoying ads in this app. Reading experience is very good. Language change options are very helpful and easy. Overall best news app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," good selection, not too biased in choices, new compact design is big improvement... especially when reception is poor."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, the app has a hard time playing any video. the videos should be in a different format because there is a lot of lag and freezing.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Microsoft News reports accurately on all levels of society. It is a comprehensive media with credible news sources. I like the clarity of the reports. Experience it for yourself!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great app that gets a number of articles across multiple major and local news outlets. Helps expand my reading sources and keeps me from falling into the pitfalls of single source, single sided news outlets."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Good News app, nice UI also but at times the news feed don't refresh for a while"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love Miicrosoft News. Its easily to taylor the news feed to match your preferences.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very good news app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is the best news app. I enjoyed it alot on Windows Phone. It's so much better than Google News. As a matter of fact almoat all Microsoft products are better than Google.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," It would be great if one could filter out news that are not relevant to personal interest, eg. Filter out anything that contains so and so in the title."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, What the hell is wrong with Microsoft? Are you serious? You are inserting ads to download your app when we already have it. What's happening Microsoft...lost your sense???
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good selection of news. Neat layout. But rating only 4 because it does not send alerts regularly. I expect at least one every hour.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Tried it. Microsoft news app does not allow you to remove news sources you find distasteful. Until it does it will remain uninstalled and I will go back to flipboard even though I dislike how flipboard does not moderate itself at all.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Does the job well 👍 I personally do not like the page presentation of local news as mixes the same name location of various countries on one page hence the 3 stars.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I like the way the news articles are arranged. It's easy to find what you want. Also, all articles are contained in the app, it doesn't open up a website."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Simple, it consists of a compilation of free articles on a vast variety of Newspapers. There are a range of topics, with my focus being on Money, Personal Finance and Careers."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Indeed Microsoft News it's a worldwide news more than 90% and I am in love with it, because when I go through it, just like I have been traveling a round the world in no time wow :)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, U can share the wonderful moments with courageous adventurers
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Shame on you Microsoft for joining fake news media! Very bias anti-Trump oriented application that is not only discasting, but also poltisized and very left oriented. News media should be reporting facts and be neutral, Microsoft News become nothing more than fake propoganda. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I've tried different news app, including the supposedly oh so great Google News. But I always come back to this app. Clean interface, neat categories really help me fins the kind of news I want to read on a day."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Easy to use, extremely packed with very interesting information on a wide variety of features and topics,love it!!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I like the app. MS could improve the ability to select, copy, and paste from the articles to other apps like Facebook."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great news aggregator. Always updated and gets the news from the main sources. Definitely would recommend.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love this app because it has everything I need. I love the topics I love that you can add topics I love the notification in the morning. Great job!!!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, News not updating for some topics. Also the startup animation takes a lot if time. It needs to be fixed.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This app is everything I've been looking for in a news app. Easy to use and I like the way I can place my interests in the fore. Plus I like the fact it has a dark background mode. Thks guys.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," FATAL FLAW- any interruption in connectivity dumps everything, 100's of headlines and pictures, which then must be reloaded. It's almost 2019, old MS."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I am giving this 3 stars. While I love Microsoft, and MS News, the clickbait has to go and the wonky off the wall news outlets. let's get back to real actual news ;-)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," sponsored ads disguised as stories is annoying, by you learn to easily recognize them. Overall, got news aggregator with good options for sources and topics."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, the app is good for educational news and non political news... whereas it seems it has certain left-wing bias in projection of news... hence only 3 stars for devs. but bias seems to remain in app...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Worked well for a few days, now can't sign in, apparently 'An Error Has Occurred'. You'd think Microsoft could design a stable app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I like the news on this app , you can choose your preferred topics ."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, News without paywall. Sometimes not updated often.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Broad ranging News coverage
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Has dark mode, is very stable and loads instantly unlike Google's version. However, has limited topics of interests for selection."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, The formatting of articles is bad and random text in the middle of articles about downloading the Microsoft News app when you're already using the Microsoft News app is just sloppy.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Installed it and under top Hollywood news all the news were outdated by months even years.. For eg MI6 to be shot in India, Venom gets a release date... Too significant to be overlooked in a news publishing app.. Uninstalled it after seeing 10 or so outdated articles"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," It's ok. I dislike all the ""sponsored content"". It used to have less adverts, which made it much nicer."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great news app with a broad range of sources. Shame about the ad asking you to download the app you are using disrupting the flow of every article.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, good detail for each news item but breaking news needs to be more slick. (Old Review) I am surprised to see the suggestion being implemented. (New Review) So 5* now
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Most of the news app allows to copy the text, by selecting it, so I can instant translate to another language, for e.g. MSN would allow it"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Nicely laid out and representatively selected prominent news from trusted channels in my country. The presentation is neat and easy to read.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Can't download app to.get news. Had the app, but it wouldn't oen any news. Usual fix was to uninstall from Android and install again. Can't even gind same app"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Awful. Much worse than the windows version. Difficult to read. No ability to add own sources. Font is poor. Too many ads. Yuk.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," It only needs to add Bulgaria and Bulgarian news into the feed, as the USA are not center of the universe. Thanks"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I have used MSN all the time, and it is Great!!!!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I cannot remove unwanted news sources
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Impartial and extensive news coverage. A must among real news apps!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Why do all Microsoft apps have a huge ugly white background and a tiny app icon? Cant they just make a full color icon? This is ugly and trash.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great app. Clear, concise stories on current issues. Easy to navigate."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Dunno why I haven't used this before, probably because the old Google was so good. This app is top class, default on my PC and now on my Android. Thanks Microsoft."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Excellent, it collects and updates you with news from multiple third party sources, e.g. Telegraph, Mail, Mirror, Hello, etc."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, new version is very nice. I'd like to choose more than one country news to read news at the same time or maybe using a filter
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Nice, clean coverage. Good sprinkling of topics. I am happy I installed this App on my phone."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, the app contains a mixture of news providers and also good analysis particularly around financial and technology issues. It does have also items which are interesting such paradoxes
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great app, provide great native app experience. This is what I was looking for a long time in news apps. Kudos to devs"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," It's got a dark theme, so it's immediately 1000 times better than Google's new news app with eyeball incineration as the only choice."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I really like how it's broken into subject areas and top stories is feature for each. Easy on the eyes and very appealing.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," its good, brings many sources into one place, but lacks real customisation on what you see plus, has many sponsors with fakes news stories. Its a good idea but needs work."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I can get instant breaking news from the app and they divide each topic on the headline - world, canada, finance, health etc. The content of each news is informative and clear."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great news application. Fits my needs for news on the go and with the added benefit of dark mode. Prefer it over the competitors like Flipboard, The Guardian and Euronews."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Good coverage of news.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good to read news on phone
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Awesome. It's got all the important news, updated as news breaks, from both the major and minor newspapers."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Enjoy checking during the day to check breaking news and technology news. It makes checking the news easy when on the go.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Seems to be really slow. In changing stories. Sometimes the same ones come up for weeks at a time.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," If this app worked consistantly it would get 5 stars, but sometimes it freezes, never getting past the opening screen. Probably 1 out of 5 times."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, very good new app with some great customisations for your own personal interests. seems to have got tue blend between good new content and not to many ads about right.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It just works. Doesn't hog resources, and there aren't too many sponsored articles."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, News app it's great and I use it from old days with Windows Mobile. Please remove add for app what we actually using. Download Microsoft news app. It it's pathetic. You are software gigant and you can't write code to skip that app when it's detected? Come on.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, App is ok but the developer should create a unique branded sound alert for breaking news notifications. Just using the device default notification sound is lazy.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Really strange assortment of news categories from which to choose. Customization was lacking for certain topics.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," News apps, especially from a large corporation like Microsoft should never incorporate advertising. News is a place for news, and nothing else. This app displays advertisements in news lists and articles. That is gross."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Better than Google News. All the articles are opened in dark mode if you enable it in the settings. Comfortable reading at night.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," always new news, wide variety of sources, good balanced views, a rarity these days! I keep wondering why I still buy newspapers"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Very nice App, smooth sleek and interesting stuff. However, it would be much more better if it try to reduce the overcrowding stuff in one page. 😊"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Widget showing no content available
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, So far I have enjoyed the app and have been able to read the articles without a glitch!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Good Coverage but at times news items are stale. Need to update frequently, otherwise it is boring to read the same item for a week."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," So far, so good. I like the format. First the fake news, then the facts, then the summary."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Very good application, but, it is REALLY slow to load and run."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great independent news channel, has all the main news stories together with video footage for most of them."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Loved this app because it gives me a cross section from right to left of the news of the day. Continue to love it. First thing I read each day still.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Local news feeds are broken. Despite repeated feedback messages, there has been no change to this for months since I first began trying out the app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Very engaging app. Gives the latest news updates. Love using it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," this news is awesome but i'll give 5 star if had notification just like ""news republic"" which has notification. because i used Tommy 3 plus had swept left but only news republic which has notification, please fix it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like having the same app on PC as well as phone. I can read an article on the phone and get interupted & finish reading it on PC.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I like the news and stories, especially the diversity of sources. The adds are annoying."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, After the update it can't keep my preferences about topics and it desperately needs the ability to hide news from specific sources. Overall is a good app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, It's okay so far although it's peppered with ridiculous advertisements and it appears that the news stories lack any kind of fact filter.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," A bit of a faff to open up, but easy to navigate and find what you're interested in."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great news app. Would love to see offline capabilities though. Bit annoying seeing articles saying download the new Microsoft news app within the app
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Hate the new update. Slow, and much fewer stories visible unless you scroll down. I liked seeing 5 or 6 headlines on one screen."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Good App. I use it to see tips about money and how to improve my personal finances
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, It would be great to add text selection. I learn English and it will be helpful to translate some words.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like it. It's well made and the quality of news is high. Less ads than Google News
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Some of the Stories kept dragging on. You get tired of having to change pages. Finally I just quit because I lost interest.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I have probably tried 2 dozen news apps over the past 10 years and I always come back to this. It has the clearest layout and least ads. GREAT APP!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I appreciate if you can stop publishing silly stuffs like the apparel a celebrity was wearing and focus on more real issues. Apart from that, its a worthy needed and recommended app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Best of it's kind. Better and more frequent and fresh updates than Google news. Even for Greek news, it's better than Greek apps. Good job Microsoft."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Much better but still needs to be more user friendly, like being able to navigate with one hand on a tablet"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, it is very good app and user friendly. It works most of the time fine without a problem.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Great, other than that it's splattered with 'sponsored' links that take you outside the app to time wasting click through nonsense."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, App keeps crashing. Have to close it completely and reopen it for it to work. The content is great but the crashing is annoying.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, The daily brief is a good introduction to the day; it is well positioned amongst the plethora of stories.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Its very easy to read and understand important concepts.Very intetactive and well organized app by my side.one must install this app in order to stay updated.Go for it blindly if you want to be well updated.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Like the design e the news ;) i suggest it
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Well organized neutral reporting.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Instant updates on all affairs
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Stable, doesn't update constantly while reading (like the other one), info is reasonably fresh."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Well designed layout with good content and a variety of news. Way better than many other news apps around.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great app but text is very small on my device (Lg G6). Needs option to increase text size.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, this is always my go to app . I read or watch videos from every category. Interesting and not biased. Keep it up 👍
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I love it, but I can't log in even after changing the password so many times. Please reply and fix"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, All the news I'm interested on are ready for me to check. I receive valid notifications based on the news I follow. Easy to navigate format.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," the best in news, accurate, friendly, fast, nice design, dark mode, love it!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I love all types of different news stories and this app has great, informative and breaking, new stories and is VERY EASY to use!!!!!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Easy to use. Up-to-date information. Doesn't unexpectedly close on you like other news apps
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, ome of the best news aggregator apps. flexible on topics and sources and since it is cross-platform you can configure once for all devices supported.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like how this formats all articles the same and cuts out excessive adds. Dark mode is also great! The category themes for the different types of news works well for me.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great experience so far.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Amazing app that keeps you updated on the latest. Easy to use and it separates the news according to categories
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Used it as a widget for a few weeks, but ended up uninstalling it because it tends to freeze up on my HTC."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Good variety of content, nice configurability and reliable sources. Customized news feed doesn't get polluted with every petty search I perform."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," So far, an OK app. At least I can choose the country to get news from, I wish I could add more. But the widget is pretty bad."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," works fine for me, i have it on both phone and laptop, for many years now."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very customizable, so you get fewer articles that aren't interesting to you."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Very good news app. However there is need for more localized content for non us regions and support for more regions... .
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Good reliable, solid and regular alerted but nothing overwhelming and it has all the sources you could want...and then some"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It's very nice application, I love it, Keep it up and if possible give translate in Hindi option in same page... 😊"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Uneditable sources and excessive ""sponsored"" content make this app less than it could be, but it is still one of the better news apps available."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," excellent, takes a few seconds to load, but also covers all topics by subjects. great app!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Configurable to your taste, somewhat addictive and a sprinkling of content from subscription only providers like NYT and WaPo (not even sure how they do that...)"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Horrible app with a horrible UI. Don't worry, no telemetry was gathered as my firewall tends to block viruses from having internet access."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, When it works it is great. It is just that lately it is very slow if it works at all.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Better than Google news by far. Clean easy reading without being peppered with annoying ads.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," really like this app, I wish the news stories in the widget where of a larger font, not easy to take a quick glance at."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," great app for all the news hungry readers ..... keeps on updating them instantly.... also it gives all national & international news in detail, unlike other apps......."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Grates app for news
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, I just installed this yesterday. Some of the pop up notifications seem to be random! Might get better when I find out how to customise the notification settings.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Really good App. multiple sources, immediate, and up tp the minute news. never crashes and little memory used."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Why isn't it possilble to select text from the app? I need to copy text from an article to search on the web or lookup in a dictionary which is not possible that is a shame and makes the app useless for me
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Great info BUT does not contain info on what can be done to minimise acceleration of the onset of dementia. Thanks once again for sharing.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, I find that after the last update the app in not responding about 80% of the time. Need to fix soon or will look for a better app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great compact news experience. I actually like the non-customised feed; with Google News it gets boring to see the same kind of articles all the time.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love it. Best for breaking news

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," This is a great, customizable app that has a broad selection of media outlets. Love it."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Wide range of news coverage, constant updates. I watch throughout the day."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Easy and convenient to get all news in one place. Seems to tailor based on sources I generally read but its not restricted to exclusively those sources.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great news App, it's up to date but the minute in some cases."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," More garbage clickbait, just like the desktop version. If you love never ending slide shows packed with advertising this is for you."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, A good app but the letters are small for me to read and hopefully can change the font size

I get local news from google but not from you guys. It is Racism plain and simple. And by the way, the star is just so i can comment, you don't deserve it"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," App is a piece of junk, videos wont play and tons of errors when loading."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Keeps telling me to download this app in the middle of every news item, I obviously already have it! Also no way to filter news sources such as the Leftian.... sorry I mean Guardian"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Mainstream news but also some great links to items you'd normally miss. Well worth space on your device
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Wish I could rate the sources. Some of these blogs and propaganda machines are clearly not news and need a mechanism to be reported or at least removed from my feed

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love this app. I like the aggregation of various news outlets in one app.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It is easy to organize what you want to read & see. Works quickly as long as there is a solid connection.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Love the fact that the app doesn't personalize the news too much giving me exposure to news I wouldn't see with Google News which tends to be over fitted.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Need ability to remove sources I distrust, and add sources I do trust. I generally don't trust Microsoft's judgement when it comes to curating news sources and would prefer to do it myself. This app lacks even the most basic of source configuration options."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Great app, good way to stay up to date on US news and world events."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, No problems but doesn't seem quite as good as the windows version for some reason.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Muddled mess that is not easily customized. Lots of repetition with little ability to manage it.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Really enjoying this app, it's informative, easy to use with little problems."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Microsoft's attempt to monetize the news filled with those annoying click through websites so common on Facebook. Constant repition of annoying material totally unrelated to Real news. A total money grab.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, good spread of the things i like. however infuriatingky slow to get beyond the start-up screen.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, really like this app and the night mode.the news is current and from a variety of sources. recommended!!

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Love this news app. Lets you get news from curated sources, search, and organize your reading by category."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, This app has gone way down hill. News articles are over a month old which defeats the purpose of the app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Works well, and I was able to choose what categories of news I wanted to see."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The only proper editable news feed app, most news app force unwanted garbage at you with no way to completely block it, Microsoft news lets select which subjects i want and cut out the rest"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Good design but news updates are slow and most of the sources have similar biases.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," App gathers news from a lot of sources. it is annoying that it Carrie's ""sponsored"" pieces designed to look like news stories."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, A lot of video to view without a lot of ads along with great news selection. Local coverage could be a lot better
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, It wont remember my saved news catagories . It constantly resets them. Annoying. I prefer the windows 10 version. It is superior.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The app broadcasts news and other issues that keep me up to date with current affairs.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Can't remove topics I'm not interested in. Also specifically did not click on sports when I was setting up except soccer yet I'm getting baseball stories. And other random BS I don't want. Not what I had in mind. Guess it's back to crappy Google News.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Very slow app startup is a negative. Please allow user to turn off the long list of languages.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great App !!! The quickest news updates I get amongst a host of other stuff.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," great app for news, but sometimes slow to load on Wi-Fi. switch to cell data corrects this."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, app doesent work
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, it is enjoyble 🤭
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, The widget hardly refreshes anymore after thr latest update.. Isn't much useful!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good but too many ""Ad"" and""Sponsored"" articles mixed in with actual articles. Very frustrating when not realizing and clicking on them to read. And there are a lot. Else good selection of news and topics."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Doesn't seem to search topics from as many sources or quite as up to date as a few other top news apps but still a great news app. Getting better as they work on it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," This app has gone downhill. Constantly pushing stories by The Guardian which is the most one-sided and dishonest newspaper in the UK. Allow us to choose the sources we trust, please."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great way to in touch with news local and around the world. Great idea by tapping on an article you can change the front size. It the bottom of the scene. Why can't this app be interactive.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, 750 Mb!! (Vejam só...) para notícias de fraca qualidade e sem interesse algum...Se pudesse apagava esta app...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Topics at the top does not feel intuitive. Somehow layout and personalization both needs to be better
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Good news app, slightly annoying placement of ads in the news feed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Nural read aloud is missing, you already have it on edge"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Updated news before the world knows so far.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, The app is completely unusable on my OnePlus 7 Pro. It hangs every time I change a setting. And it won't let me read any articles I try to click through. Absolute garbage app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," The ""sponsored"" articles are fake news most of the time. It even uses my location to change the article headline"

Core functionality seems identical, but I can't swipe to my custom topics, only choose them from the hamburger. The options menu may as well not exist for all the functionality it exposes. I do like the app, but the UWP is just so much nicer to use. I would like to see the ability to ban or add sources from the feed. The British Daily Mail is not a trusted source and needs to go."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I thought I'd update my review, it now syncs across my devices which is a massive bonus, few too many ads / clickbait now though. All in all though a much better app from December 2018"

Broken down to what's important to me, don't have to browse I'm not interested in. As a follow-up to this review, my opinion has not lessoned but only grown in support of this app. It went away for awhile so once I realized I refreshed it and all again was good 👌‼️. This app never seems to go stale and always stays fresh‼️👍 Keep on with what your doing keeping this enjoyable for all 😀👍‼️"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," The last update was all bells and whistles but it really suffers in terms 
of functionality. It sometimes scrolls or jumps without reason while trying 
to read an article, crashes more often than the previous version and is 
also slower."

The satire and/or humor provides a little relief from the intensity of the topic, more if one actually laughs aloud. Perhaps those who are suspicious of factual information can be persuaded to grasp the truth as revealed in political cartoons. The rest of the app offers newd and opinion from varied sources: AP, Reuters, Washington Post, NYTimes, Fox, Nationalist, The Hill, Slate, and some city newspapers."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, A good and informative app for news easy to navigate I particularly like the ease of changing the font lettering size that's good and the contents of news stories are good and editorially well balanced keep up the good work Microsoft 10 out of 10
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Gives me the news I want several times a day, keeps me up to date on top news and makes following top news easy to find. The app is very easy to use."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is the BEST APP FOR NEWS! KEEP GOING! AND FINALLY ICON CHANGED COLOR and great to have all news everyday...thank you!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, i choose this msn ap over others due to ease of use and broad perspective. i enjoy the 'dark theme' and would give 5 stars if could increase font size even larger.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Lots of old news. Often tabs don't work and have no news in it.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Easy to navigate, I can get the top stories of the day quickly."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I love t keeps me up to date with what's happening
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, تطبيق جيد، ولكن أتمنى أضافة نسخة خاصة باللغة العربية ليكون تطبيق متكامل 💙 وشكرا لكم.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, It would be 5 stars but every time I am asked to rate this app I drop it one star.

'My News' section is a misnomer as you have no choice of what it contains. No ability to delete topics of news you don't want.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Slow, clunky, unpleasant, much worse user-experience than MSN News."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Nothing here outside of conventional US media. Too much WashPost and NYT with paywalls. Feels limited and rather like a mental trap.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," awesome, kamu harus menginstall ini di hp kamu, aplikasi ini merupakan portal berita lengkap yg akan membantu kita mengetahui perkembangan nasional dan global."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Reading the news is a great way to start the day! I use this app several times a day to keep with the news. This app is a keeper.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I can use Dark Mode theme with this app much like in Windows 10. It is much easier on my eyes and my preffered reading settings for my phone screen. It also suits my LCARS launcher very well. Could use a widget

Very annoying. Sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes to load the news. Lots of problems loading even when using multiple devices. Tried uninstalling and re-nstalling but it still takes a long time to load. There are much better programs than this out there.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, It is very identical to what we get on windows 10 but crashes and lags all the time for some reason. Also I think it would be better to scrap all msn apps (as none of them works well right now) and combine them in one.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," A great news app. Keeps us well informed from a variety of trusted sources and we just ignore the few others, such as Faux ""entertainment"" as they originally called themselves.

While fonts are adjustable, they are like egg sizes: large is barely medium, medium is really small and small is forget about it. Clearly, they don't care about visually impaired readers. May have to uninstall, soon. If you are vision challenged, keep looking. Microsoft -- just barely three stars, using a Samsung tablet."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Wish the app was able to display embedded tweets and Instagram posts included in the articles. Often have to move back to browser version to see all content. Should have been addressed by now as an issue.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I tried other news viewers but came back to Microsoft News because it simply works the way I expect. It has learned the sources and topics I like and shows me what I want to see--effortlessly.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I'm wedded to this as a Windows 10 News user because it allows me to follow my news interests on my my PC, laptop, and phone. I love the dark mode. It could really use a good widget though."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Stories from the gutter press and advertising online gambling so children can become addicts too .. Disgusting company
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like it better than most of the other news apps it's not perfect but it's very good. I read generally about 50 gigs of news every month MSN is always included
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," algumas notícias tem um segundo link e são propaganda, mas fora isso adoro o app"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Needs to remove old news - many articles weeks old.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I liked the original app a lot more, but I'm getting used to this one. I like it more now."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Great app...excellent user interface great design.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Semua berita ada disini. Politik, ekonomi, olahraga semua ada"

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," The latest version takes a long time (at least 10 seconds) to load. There is no cache of data so you must be online in order to read news. Yet, once it loads and you are online, this is the best news app around."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Video player is not good. it restarts itself. One cannot go forward it backward. It automatically starts over...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Junk news sources in English, mostly from the Daily mail! If what you want is fake news and click bait go for this app. Also the topics update very rarely."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Used to be a good app. The quality of Microsoft apps are average at best. The news app crashes often. Now Android flagging news and outlook as power draining, unstable apps. Either you have awful developers or Google's Android going after competitor. But figure it out."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, I see way too many stores by the Daily Mail appearing at the top of my list. This publication is known for their rampant plagiarism and should not be promoted. App is good otherwise.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I liked this app before they updated it. Now it's hard to navigate plus too 
many ""sponsored"" ads hiding as real news. Each tabs had better organized 
stories and more news. This app seems like an entirely different one. Hate 
it!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Feedback on new design just ignored. Months on, it's now being uninstalled."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," O app. seleciona importantes notícias de vários jornais e revistas, inclusive de jornais estrangeiros. É rápido e tem boa aparência."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, estaría bien que se pudieran leer las noticias offline
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Jika bisa memutar berita dalam bentuk radio akan jadi lebih baik
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Bom, mas poderia ter maior controle de fontes e menor repetição de notícias."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Muito bom! Me mantém atualizada com as notícias a nível mundial.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," MSN news was much, better, easier to navigate and a lot less sponsored rubbish"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, This is a very good news app
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, The app is excellent. Should cover world news better.

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," i tried to like this app, but it's impossible to tell it not to feature ""news"" from trash fake news sites like the daily caller. pretty unbelievable."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," A work in progress but easily the best news app around. Much better than Google's, which doesn't even list relevant news for me."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, Ads are designed to look exactly like featured stories and are clicked on accidentally. The old version was clear in its differentiation between the two. Is ad revenue so important that you must rely on tricking the reader?
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," I use it for news in german (im from germany) but for my added tabs in English (games, reviews, twitch, nasa, spacex, elon musk). I wish I could set each personal tab to another langauge/location."

After much investigation, I determined that newer versions rely on a stable ipv6 internet connection through my home router attached to a cable modem. Now all is well. My only complaint is that I can't block content from certain highly unreliable 'news' sources, but, overall, it is the best news aggregation app around."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I like news from varied sources. The presentation of this app is nice and uncluttered.

It's 7Feb15 and I am uninstalling app because I have not been able to use it all week and just uninstalled, installed."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, It was my go to app for news but since last few updates it does not automatically refresh and takes ages to load. The splash screen should not be there as it's animation causes the app to slow
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Paid content mixed in with news stories cheapens the experience and feels sleazy and deceptive. Topics and story selection feels limiting. I expected better. Uninstalled.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Links in articles are hard to read. Light blue text on a white background really doesn't work well. Edit: There's a dark mode that fixes that problem.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," It's a great news source, and it's customizeable for the categories of news that you prefer. You can spend as much time here as you want, either scanning the headlines or reading the articles."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Its keep crashing , when you are logged in and trying to open my topics"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, Really nice looking news app. I wish it would have rss support though.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, My go-to news app. Used every day Thanks for a great app. Like the variety of issues and views.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good app, good UI. Would like to see article date of publish."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," ""Could not load news. Try again"" Uses too much background battery during the night when screen is off. Shows links to news articles that doesn't appear."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," It keeps crashing, even when running in the background. It keeps trying to push news notifications even though I turned them off and thus it sends me ""Microsoft News has stopped working"" pop-ups. I'm fed up"

Even on high profile news days at least half the feed would be about a Kardashian or Real Housewife. Uninstalling for good. Years ago it was better, even the desktop version is better. Don't download unless you have a hankering for reading about silicon and saline filled women doing pilates."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Most of the reviews for this app are probably fake. You cannot set the default font in 2018! Nuff said? You cannot save articles for reading later. Clearly, Microsoft needs to rethink whether the current product manager for this app is doing his/her job."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," I do not like the new News app. Scrolling behavior is very odd. If I stop my finger or lift and put it down, the screen will keep scrolling. It also does not contain financial information like the Microsoft Money app, but it's being pushed as a replacement in that app. Why are you trying to get me t...Full ReviewI do not like the new News app. Scrolling behavior is very odd. If I stop my finger or lift and put it down, the screen will keep scrolling. It also does not contain financial information like the Microsoft Money app, but it's being pushed as a replacement in that app. Why are you trying to get me to stop using the Money app and switch to this one, which is a very poor replacement?"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Its a good aggregator. BUT they tilt liberal. AND certain stories stay on the news page for weeks, sometimes months. Usually anti-Trump fact checks that have long since left the news cycle. WHY? Only MS knows."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Overall it's a solid app that suffers from several issues. Every so often 
the app fails to open properly with only one category properly loading up. 
The other major issue is that the categories keep resetting back to what I 
selected for the first time multiple times within a week."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," The app no longer goes past the splash screen that shows the word ""news"" in 
multiple languages. I've tried rebooting, uninstalling and reinstalling. I 
really like the aggregated content and wish I could see it again."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, It's a really great app for catching up on all the latest news around the world. It also aggregates news across various geographical boundaries and varied topics. If you are voracious reader then this is a must have app.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Loads and updates quickly, lots of topics to choose and refuse. Hundred of news articles from different news sources making it unbiased. You can also swipe up our down to browse and it has a dark light feature 10/10"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, Keep up to date with details of the latest and greatest political soap opera ever! Every day there's a new nauseating twist to the plot. Ladies and gentlemen step right...get your peanuts...popcorn...candy...
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," A reasonably good app but doesn't seem to catch latest news stories as effectively, or perhaps not in the way I'm used to with up to the minute news services. Easy to use."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Articles should be organized by groups. It's too disorganized. Sometimes I 
only have a little time to read & want to focus on one type."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," It has the makings of being a great app there just is not enough content on

the platform itself. There is content but if I wanted a well rounded view 
of everything I am concerned about in the world, the options are very 
limited. People like to scroll. They like a great distraction. On a news 
platform, I expect nothing less. However it does have the workings of a 
great app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Interesting and informative news from around the world. Works well on my Android phone (Galaxy S5 neo, so not leading edge) and very quick to load stories. Scrolling is very smooth. It's a nice app to use."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The app is good but i have got one major issue with the widget. The latter 
shows the same headline for hours together. It looks boring and shluld get 
refresh frequently."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2, For the last several days the images in the news feeds are not showing. About 90% of the images are showing a gray box where the picture should be. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still see the same problem. Samsung Galaxy S8.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, As a former Lumia user I still enjoy this news application compared to other. MSN and now Microsoft is unique with easy to access your desired contents. Great job team Microsoft (And if you guys reading this please bring back Lumia!)
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," With the most recent update the splash screen appears to be in a constant 
loop and the app ceases to function. Have been using it for awhile and I am 
disappointed in the recent update. Fix the problem and this review will be 
irrelevant."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Biased news program that only shows news from one political spectrum or view, no balance, no alternatives and only one viewpoint. You'll only see CNN, MSNBC, WAPO, NYT and Huffington. So if you want lack of balance and suppression of independent news organizations then this is for you."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," There is a whole lot of click-bait items mixed in with poorly done news 
articles. not worth cluttering a device with this app."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Good, seems to not like switching between WiFi and 4g - scrolls through 
news in multiple languages endlessly. Which the content was not so heavily 
based on tabloid sources in the UK - the sun, mirror etc"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," They've ruined this app. It used to be a tight layout with impartial news, 
now it's slow, oversized and pushing an agenda. Uninstalled."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It's the best news app around but the breaking news needs work it only 
shows half of the news you need to log in to see the rest other then that 
it's very easy to use"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," This app use to work great but since the update, it only flashes through 
the languages trying to open but never does... Please fix this! I have 
Kyocera Dura Force Pro."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," It's just far left liberal news. Politics from CNN, weather news from Fox. That's what faking it is all about. Pretending to have multiple sources but very biased in reality."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," This app doesn't show the latest news.. believe me it showed the same 
sports news for two days though so much things were happening around the 
world ."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," Stopped working. ""Network error"" on wifi and carrier network. If it loads at all, only det black screen. Way to screw up one of my ""go to"" apps!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I enjoy the ""Cliff Notes"" version of the news this app offers. It delivers just the right amount of information early on with the ability to investigate more deeply if I'm interested."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," The app works fine on my tablet device, I like it that when I click on the icon the app opens in the orientation that I am holding my tablet in. I would give the app 5* if I could customise it so I could see how my shares are doing."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," It would be nice if I can hide a news or topic or publisher. Toilet paper 
of India as usual showing anti national news and I can't even hide it. 
Though will surely report it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4, This app has evolved to being a very useful source of catch up news. The format is now easy to navigate and stable and works well for quick scanning.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I've been using more Microsoft services lately so I can better sync stuff with my PC and this is definitely a good app. Clean, sleek, easy to use."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," 'My News' includes some clap trap lie from the Daily Mail. Who filters this 
rubbish! Uninstall."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Rarely updates any news items compared to other apps unless its ""top stories"" many stories are not readablee as sources want subscriptions."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Great app all around but lacks on home ground local news . can't find where 
to delite history sites .All in one 5 star"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, Could be the best but too many sponsored stories and click bait make this just OK... Hopefully a multi billion dollar company someday starts thinking about the user experience over fleecing folks and misleading readers
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," This app is purely Liberal propaganda, highlighting only negative articles about President Trump."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Seems to have a small number of news sources - the same articles appear 
repeatedly."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Far too many advertiment related notifications so have switched off the 
alerts."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," I loved this News app! Its very Clean simple and so organized. Section to 
sections. Topic to topic. You get what I mean to say."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Microsoft News has much of what you want. Ads (Sponsored) are easy to identitfy. Items are presented simply. Customize what you want to see for the most part. As for left or right views, you decide."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Works well, could load a bit faster. Several iterations to get the content right"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Only 2 stars because it doesn't has bangla religion or bangla news... add my country Bangladesh as an edition so that i can get my country's news... Thank you. 😊
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Aside from my browser, this is my main news app and that is saying everything."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, news stories are good but i would like to see a live scrollable widget instead of having a stagnant one show the same stories for days
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I trust it because it features stories from many diverse news outlets so I feel I am getting many viewpoints.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," It's just amazing. Very clean design with no lag at all. You should 
definitely download it!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Very useful apps, love it... But I'm not getting news notifications... 
please fix it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3, It keeps pestering me to download it when I'm already using it. Dumb or what!
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, News stories are cleverly mixed in with clickbait and ads. Old format was so much easier to use. Will be uninstalling in favorr of a legit News site.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Nicely laid out. I enjoy the opportunity to select topics and sources. I 
like that this app syncs with Microsoft News on Windows 10"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Works well. Hasn't crashed, frozen or done anything worthy of deleting it."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1," No longer works. So it's less than an app. Can't give it more than one star, wish I could give it less."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," Thankful for what is available at present, but more country specific, well 
updated news as frequently as possible would be appreciated"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,2," Too many adds, not customizable enough. You'll be scrolling for days."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, This thing is a mess of clutter. Uninstalling and going back to the website.
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5, I use this app everyday to check out random news i like to see. So far no problems and fun to use
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,1, Malicious ads. Sorry MS. You just keep getting it wrong.

different languages. Fix it please."

Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice layout, and mutiple sources. So far, doesn't seem to be biased, one way or the other."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,3," Good start, but needs a very persistent promotional effort for it to gain traction."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Nice dark theme, can set region to wherever and add interests tied to bing search. Works pretty well. Could do with an option to open articles in an external browser."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Was looking for a broad based news feed app, from world news and business to politics and entertainment with customizeable interests for sports teams, etc. Highly recommend!"
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,4," One of the better apps for sourcing tailored news from multiple sources. A 
good layout with updates that actually interest you."
Microsoft News,News & Magazines,5," Comprehensive news app with the option of ""night shade"" to make it easier on the eyes. The best news app."

verry happy with this app."

I simply want to see who's playing on the new Jones Park main stage. I click on venues, Jones Park and it gives me info about the park. Nothing about who's playing there. Really?"
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,4," Worked great to see when,where, who and what kind of music the groups played. Wish thw pop up schedule was on it though."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,3," Good features, but print overlap is hard to read."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1, Not good on my brand new phone. Text over laps. I'll use a paper schedule instead.
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,5, yay!
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,4," Nice app and very helpful. Few minor things to improve on. Music stops when 
screen locks or not on app. When you heart an artist I had to back out and 
reload page for hearts to be shown next to their name."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,5," Perfect combination of features that are straight forward and easy to use. 
Multiple search options and ability to build your own schedule are my 
favorite."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,5," Came together nicely, this app works great!"
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,4," Great, but the shuffle playlist of artist does not work...no sound"
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,5," Nice, straightforward app to help me navigate the festival. And it's 
beautiful!"

I didn't spend much time listening to the songs on the app, so I can't comment on that. I also enjoyed their updated social tab. All in all, I think it was incredibly useful for the festival, and I look forward to improvements to it in the future."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,2, Junk. Doesn't work.  Tried installing 2x on my Android phone.  Not cool ! Please fix ASAP
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,4, App is essential for planning your day.  But white text on a sometimes lighter background is frequently hard to read.
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,3," As others have stated, samples don't work. Also, it would be handy to have addresses for venues and maybe a downtown map."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,2,App crashes It crashes more than it works.  I only got the first music demo to play. Then none of them worked. The idea is good and it could be useful if bugs were worked out.
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,2,"Great concept poor execution Constantly crashes.  Song samples don't play, other than the first one you try after installing."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,3, Where is the link to the my mile acct that is on the website? Could also use a search feature in the artists & venues please...
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,4,Seems to be working now Thanks!
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1, Liked last year's better cuz It worked not this year. S7 Edge
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1, Not very useful...

Mile of Music,Music & Audio,5,Excellent This is a great app for a great festival
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,2,"Needs search by genre Not familiar with all the artists. Would enjoy discovering new favs that play music I like, but I don't have time to run all over the Ave."
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1,crashing upon opening worked great last year. crashes upon opening this year. I reinstalled it several times
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1,"NOT for an older version! It crashes, freezes up, and generally doesn't deliver what it promises. Maybe next year?"
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1,Crash test dummies built this app Crashed every time I tried anything
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,2,Crashed! Looks like it will be a cool app after they fix the problem of it crashing when you try to play song samples
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1,Crashes I loved using this last year. This year it keeps crashing. I do hope it works soon.
Mile of Music,Music & Audio,1, Crashes on Opening app. Unusable.

Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,3," It's straightforward but when I try to switch it to delivery, it won't let me. I have to do a work around to get it to work. The work around causes me to have to pay more instead of having for what I I could call a combo. The option just doesn't switch out when I try to change it."
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,3, It just isn't very user friendly. Jumps around and could be more streamlined.
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,3, milios sandwiches are great but this is a somewhat confusing and poorly designed app. I couldnt switch frim pickup to delivery? Ordering food should be easier.
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, Easy to use and the repeat order functionality is great!
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,4, Glad to finally find the app. It makes things a lot easier.
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5," Easy to use, speedy service, great food!"
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, Service is always excellent. Sandwiches are fresh & so tasty.
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,1," I can't place an order for this company to make when they open. I want to tell them to bring me a sandwich when they decide to start business today, but I keep getting this location is not delivering right now. So instead I'm going to try to find a closed sandwich deliverer that gets me."
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, Simple and easy to use
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, The drivers are all great here!
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, Only down fall is you can't use regular coupon in the app
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5," Super easy to use, convenient, love it!!"
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,1," It doesn't notify you that the location you're trying to order from is 
closed. It says that either they don't deliver or they're closed. If you 
try to change from delivery to pickup it says you can't because the ""menus 
aren't compatible."" Very poorly made app."
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,3," It's good, but it doesn't allow you to pay with cash. That's a pretty big 
flaw. Save for that though, the app is pretty much perfect."
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, Love it
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,3, Milios should have a rewards program!!
Milio's Sandwiches,Food & Drink,5, love it
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,1," I live in Lady Lake, less than a mile from a Miller's Ale House. The app has set my restaurant to Ocala, a good 40 miles away. And yes location was on; and no, it wouldn't let me change it. If this isn't fixed I would never use the app because it's useless to me."
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,3, The app seems pretty good but you should have an option to see the menu before you start an order.
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5," Simple and straight. Order, pick up, enjoy"
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,2," As soon as you choose to pick up order later (instead of ASAP), the app closes. There's no way to pick up at a later time on the app."
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5," Easy, lots of selections available"
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5, Great service and perfect order
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,1, Only for ordering takeout. Cannot add yourself to the wait list. Don't need another app to order food. Can use GrubHub for that. The app should focus on getting you to your table!
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5, Easy to order on the app!
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,3," Overall a well designed, user friendly app. It would be nice if you could add a way to cancel an order, in case of a mistake. I.E. Order is placed for pickup, but customer needs delivery. Mistakes happen folks."
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5," If I'm rating the app then sure it's like any other app. the food however is very good so far I've had the prime rib sandwich but they forgot the au jus sauce, I've also had the bacon cheeseburger which was very very good and tonight I ordered some zingers so we'll find out.

All is to go, never ate in."
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5," You WILL love this place. We have tried wings, big red, salads, pasta and it has all been of very high quality. Delivery is efficient and food temperature has always been on point. Pick up service is great as well."
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5," Not sure why i would ever use the app since I'd rather just stop by the Florida Mall location and see all the lovely people while getting good food, but love the idea!"
Miller's Ale House ,Food & Drink,5, Awesome service at this location. Friendly staff and great customer service 😊 I love the fact that online ordering and delivery is now available.

I try it a month later and now I can't be delivered to? The best part about this app was that I could get it delivered. And we always spend more than $30. Real disappointment. It has very little use if I have to drive there myself. I'd rather watch them make it if I had to go there. So this place is back on the ""eat there only if we are on that side of town"". It's only 12 miles at most from me. Widen the delivery range for more stars."
Piada,Food & Drink,5, App works great and piada is the best!
Piada,Food & Drink,1, App is trash. It's web based and not fully functional. (some things you can only do on a browser) Navigation is clunky. Took me a while to even find where to create the account in-app once I installed. Not worth it.
Piada,Food & Drink,1, Gives error when placing order under all circumstances. Very dissatisfied.
Piada,Food & Drink,1, Wouldn't let me access my rewards. Keeps saying the queue is full
Piada,Food & Drink,1, App wouldn't apply the $5 advertised discount and is very buggy. Not worth your time.
Piada,Food & Drink,5, It is a great app. i can order on my phone and then pick up.
Piada,Food & Drink,5," Easy to use, makes for fast pick up and go!"
Piada,Food & Drink,1," Never registers my meal purchases, and therefore gives no ""Piada points"" for future use"
Piada,Food & Drink,1, App would not apply the new guest $5 coupon. I uninstalled immediately.
Piada,Food & Drink,3," Doesn't let me reorder past orders nor save as favorite. Just prompts that I'll be asked for size of the order, then I click ok then nothing happens."
Piada,Food & Drink,5," Easy to order, accurate at pickup."

Piada,Food & Drink,1," Good food, unfortunately stores are only open about 6 months, then close-up"
Piada,Food & Drink,2," placed an order, app said it was ready. I go there 5 minutes after the ""ready by"" time and was made to wait for another 15 minutes. Would just go there and order it myself going forward."
Piada,Food & Drink,5, app works great.
Piada,Food & Drink,5, 👌👌👌
Piada,Food & Drink,5, delicious!
Piada,Food & Drink,4," I think that the app needs pictures like on the website Other than that Its

If you need to order ahead then stick to the website. It was atleast programmed by a team of competent people. Unlike this app"
Piada,Food & Drink,1, Can't use the app. If the time right now is 10 am and I place a lunch order for 1pm I keep getting an error message asking me to pick a time in the future. Gotta use the website.
Piada,Food & Drink,3, Unable to ask for extra of a topping and same issue as others stating to select a future time ... when ordering online
Piada,Food & Drink,5," Great app, easy to use!"
Piada,Food & Drink,5, Been using the app with no issues just place an order 2 mins ago.

Piada,Food & Drink,5, It works great
Piada,Food & Drink,2," Very glitchy. Needs work on almost every major function, but especially the two separate location finders."
Piada,Food & Drink,2, Very buggy. Rewards and saved credit card features don't work. Difficult to use. Website is easier.
Piada,Food & Drink,1, Store claimed to never get my order just deleting app

Robeks Mobile Ordering,Food & Drink,4, I love how easy it is to use the app to order and even list what time you will be picking up I just wish there was pictures of the items so you can have an idea of what you might want to try!
Robeks Mobile Ordering,Food & Drink,1," Robeks app was great until latest update. I can no longer substitute an ingredient, such as whey protein for pea protein without having to pay extra. The last app iteration allowed this. i can do this in store without getting charged extra. Are you squeezing us for extra cash now?"

ruff,Productivity,5, Excellent design and distraction free writing! Syncing to something that's accessible on a desktop would be a nice to have option in the future. I am not sure there are note taking apps out there with an API to import the ruff notes.
ruff,Productivity,5, Love the app and note-taking concept! Made the purchase to enjoy the additional features! Would love to see a few more font options. I enjoy monospace fonts a lot. Keep it up 🙂
ruff,Productivity,5," The Best note taking app I've used. Simple, reliable, with a super clean interface. Actually quite adorable! Responsive developer to feedback and support. Easily worth the upgrade!"
ruff,Productivity,3," Going in the app, going to another app, than back in ALWAYS crashes it, I have 6gb of ram on my phone (OnePlus 6), so for my purposes it makes the app unusable. I love the design and the stashing mechanic it's just that it can't stay in memory."

Having a grammar checker feature will also be amazing, if it can be added."

ruff,Productivity,4, Can you decrease the price of the pro version. Also add a quick launch button on notification area. I want a button in notification area that can quickly launch ruff to take quick notes.

ruff,Productivity,5," I absolutely love this app. The clean simplicity is an immensely welcoming environment to write ANYTHING, be it a short blurb or longer copy. Its like digital scribble pad for those that have the writing bug. The ability to stash pieces for retrieval and editing is GREAT to have."
ruff,Productivity,1," It is a free app but if you want more than a page you have to pay. Not a bad thing but that is very unclear here. To repeat stashing isn't a thing until you pay, one page as a free app."
ruff,Productivity,5," Great app for writing without distractions on my phone. The user interface is modern and gets out of my way. As a long time user of Appy Text on Windows Mobile 10 and Windows 10, this one's a no-brainer!"
ruff,Productivity,5, Writing a book and needed something to jot down ideas. This is absolutely perfect. Opened it up and it took just a few minutes to realize I was gonna be getting the pro version. Thanks for this.
ruff,Productivity,5, very clean ui. gets the job done when i need to write something quickly down for later. because there arent any buttons and things in the way i can think clearly before i jot something down.
ruff,Productivity,5," Grabbed the premium pretty much up front, support developers! Love the layout and functionality. I'm currently using as a quick daily journal in addition to not taking."
ruff,Productivity,3, After the recent update the app is not opening at all. I had some important data but not able to use. Update : After a day I received another update which fixed the earlier issue of aap not opening.
ruff,Productivity,5," Beautiful app. The update works beautiful on my OnePlus 7 Pro. Deleted every other similar app, this is all I need. Shout out to the developer for putting in work to give us this genius product."
ruff,Productivity,5," Can't view settings. Edit: Sorry, to be more specific, swiping right opens the settings page, but it is a blank white screen. Store, FAQ, About, etc. are also blank."
ruff,Productivity,5, I just love the App ❤️ How clean & How functional it is and I brought full version now I am happy. 👨‍💻 Expecting some feature like: 1. Ruled Page 2. Highlight some text
ruff,Productivity,4," Nice UI, except I don't understand the 1x 2x 3x notation which I think means jump to next word, next line, end of page."
ruff,Productivity,4, One of the best writing app. Just need password protection and multiple account/ folder feature to be perfect.
ruff,Productivity,5, Been looking for something like this for a while and whilst I rarely pay for an app it's practically free at the price it's listed at. Check it out
ruff,Productivity,5, Cool concept! A no frills note taking app that lets you focus on the text. The latest update feels faster! 😉
ruff,Productivity,3," Good features, good idea, but if a 6GB ram phone cant operate it for half an hour without the app crashing something is wrong."
ruff,Productivity,5, Nice and lightweight and easy to use. Great for sharing notes.
ruff,Productivity,5," Simple, clean, easy to use, very well designed. Pro upgrade is worth it."
ruff,Productivity,5, Works exactly as advertised. Also works nicely on my Pixelbook.
ruff,Productivity,5, Nice app. Clean interface. Just what I was looking for. One question: is there an option to search through the stashed notes? I couldn't find it.

STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,1, Doesnt log in through facebook like my web site does
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,2, So I can't seem to find a way to link/show the Family Rewards? What's the point of having your account on your phone if you can't use your rewards? Am I doing something wrong?
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,3, GR8 Food and Service always!!! How do I connect my Stonefire Grill Loyalty Card to the App.?
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,2, What happened to map tracking of delivery?
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,1, horrible. can't log in
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5, Who cares about the app it is simple and works as designed. Stonefire.. NomNom!!
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,1, Confusing instruction
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,4, Great Place
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5, EXCELLENT!!!!
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,1, Unable to place an order. Disappointed.
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5," Love the app. So many ways to customize your order; I don't have to worry 
they will misunderstand my requests! Sometimes our local restaurant is 
slower, but that happens with all fresh, cooked to order, good restaurants."
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,3," The app is ok. I would order more if I didn't have to wait at least 10 
minutes more than it says most of the time and they don't offer any 
discounts or rewards. Staff takes walk-in to go orders before online orders."
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,1," App doesn't work. Error message every time information is trying to be 
processed."
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,3," Easy app for ordering food, but disappointed the rewards account can't be 
linked."
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5," Great food, Great service, Great value!!!"
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,4, I like that it has pictures and very detailed. I like to know that i have other options within the options like size. I also like that it describes the portion. I'm always afraid I will order too little.
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,4, Generally a good app. I just wish there was a way to write a note if you want to give a specific instruction. For instance I ordered the cauliflower salad but in the options I could only say if I wanted the dressing or not. Could not say put it on the side.
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5," Easy to order and a family favorite, especially the tri tip and lemon garlic. Have not had any issues and have ordered dozens of times and food has been ready on time, every time."
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5," My favourite place to eat! The food is always fresh and amazing, with so many options that makes everyone happy.  The service is lovely and caring.

STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,2, It doesn't work
STONEFIRE Grill,Lifestyle,5, Love this place
storyo,Photography,5, Please give the option to add short videos to the project too. Rest everything is great.
storyo,Photography,2, Missing features. The app doesn't access pictures from other folders.
storyo,Photography,5, First impression... It's an excellent app and does what it says. Edit : Would love to have following three options that will go a long way in making this a top app: 1. Ability to crop or adjust photos 2. Ability to add videos 3. Some more filters please
storyo,Photography,5, How to remove watermark? I love the work it does but I don't like advertising as my final credits.. Make it paid to remove watermark! I am sure it will be a big hit! The app is smart and makes great videos!
storyo,Photography,5, really easy and creative stories!
storyo,Photography,5, plz add new filters and also the option to add videos into story
storyo,Photography,5, nice and fast
storyo,Photography,3, The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is I cannot uncrop photos. Some of my photos crop it in the worse way.
storyo,Photography,3," It crops the photos in videos which really not good. Need to have 
repositioning option for photos"

developer from within the app but they never responded so one star off for 
that too"
storyo,Photography,5, Please let us to replace date with custom text we can write it app will be amazing and grow like fire
storyo,Photography,4, This app should have a syncing ability..so that whenever I open Google photos ...I can actually select photos from there to make a story from storyo. :) Great job!
storyo,Photography,5, It made me emotional after I saw my experiences I am proud of it . So good
storyo,Photography,5, Ammazing video making app. Works very smartly.

storyo,Photography,4,Unable to create video Unable to create video. Error Message : check internet connection.
storyo,Photography,4," Its lack is some pics get ""cropped"", though originally they were not."
storyo,Photography,5, Very good app for creating videos with your photos! I've never used an app like this before. Great job
storyo,Photography,5,Amazing It just brought my happy days memories
storyo,Photography,5,Great Downloaded quite a few ones recently to make a movie with pics of my wifes bday. Must say the results are great
storyo,Photography,5,Wow! Best video making tool ever.
storyo,Photography,5, Excellent
storyo,Photography,3, Exporting video is too slow and the amount of character that each picture label take is too small and not okay for story telling. From a journalist's perspective
storyo,Photography,5,"Great app! Elegant and easy to use interface, and the videos it creates are really cool!"
storyo,Photography,5, excellent
storyo,Photography,5, brilliant
storyo,Photography,5, Love this app.

Until you need to edit your profile to change your residence address or phone number or email address, then a nightmare! UPS and MyChoice UPS are separate accounts.

Original - I use this app quite often on two devices, a OnePlus 7 Pro and a Moto G7. It is virtually unusable as of late. Will not open, just gets hung up on the UPS splash screen and when it finally does open after a few minutes, it won't allow me to log in using biometrics that I have set up. When I enter my log in info, it hangs for a few minutes then comes back with a log in error. Uninstalled and reistalled the app and nothing changes."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This one is really annoying. I don't know what is worse, the app or the UPS themselves. The app let's you login just to show you exactly the same info you saw prior to logging in. Online it is the same story so I think it has something to do with the whole setup, which is really stupid."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Easy to use, not 5 starts because not used to automatically detect new tracking numbers and it doesn't any more, now I have to go find the tracking number from the sender and paste it to the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I have never had such a hassle trying to change my password, after almost 35 minutes I finally complete this and then they tell me that my email address still needs to be verified! I had just been using my email with them for 35 minutes 🤪"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is so user friendly. I downloaded the app then used my Facebook profile to login and just like that.....It had all my packages listed with the location and dates for delivery. I didnt have to put in any tracking numbers or anything.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Just downloaded the app today. It isn't populating the addresses in my UPS address book. The names are coming up in the drop down but once a name is selected the drop down disappears and the shipping details remain blank. Please fix. Thank you!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," It's always great to be able to track my UPS shipments in this app, as well as to be proactively notified of all incoming shipments, as soon as they are scheduled. This is a VERY useful tool."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The UPS app is quite useful. It makes tracking multiple packages simple and recently has started showing the truck's actual location for some deliveries. Notes to the driver are possible, as well as lock box codes."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app automatically lets me know when UPS has picked up a package addressed to me and gives me both estimated delivery date/time as well as options to change delivery. It's very handy!

This was before all of this covid-19 craziness, I can't imagine it's any easier to get in touch with them now. Still an excellent app, if tracking your package is the majority of what you plan on using it for."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app has some very useful functions such as being able to show the progress of the delivery on a map. This allows you to plan for the delivery. The only issue I've seen is that from time to time it says it can't display.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like getting the up-to-date notifications on delivery day with the added bonus of being about to follow the delivery truck on the map to see when it's close-by. Very handy for apartment living.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very helpful app. Easy to use. If I copy a tracking number to enter in the app, it automatically asks if I want to add the number when I open it."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Pretty good. Not perfect, but very effective at tracking packages, deliveries, exceptions, etc. Very stable. Very useful."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Everything seems technically accurate, I can keep track of all my shipments easily and everything seems up to date and organized, very nice work!!"

UPS Mobile,Business,1, IMO this Android app is garbage. Constantly logging me out every other time I check it. Tells me it can connect to the internet when I have 4 bars of lte and on WiFi and all my other apps are working fine
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use! Love being able to track my packages with such quickness and can pretty much rely on the updates being accurate.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Able to accurately track and control delivery of packages. Can easily have an individual package sent to a different address, or held (if I am not available). I can also upgrade UPS postal delivery to regular delivery, since I upgraded to UPS's higher option. Great app., easy to use, very intuitive."

UPS Mobile,Business,1, The score provided flatters this app. Do not bother with it if you want to track a parcel. It will waste hours of you time repeatedly filling in the same info and sending you in loops returning you to the same screen. Better to wait until the office is open and phone them instead.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app! Tracking is current and notifications give you an expected date of delivery. On the day your package is out for delivery, a time window is provided and you can follow the progress of selected shipped packages on a live map in real time."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," It's great! Ups gives you step by step knowledge on where your package is and what's happening to it at that moment!

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Loved watching the truck icon. Wish i could have spent more time. The last time i went back to the email & a box opened to tell me that feature was not available, i had just enough time to get my gloves on and meet the driver partway. Time saving, no contact. SAFE"
UPS Mobile,Business,3," Doesn't always let me know when I have packages arriving; like today, I have one coming but app says none expected. Also only 1 in six or so times can I track live in maps, like today one is coming but can't track."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Its always nice to be able to track any package you may be expecting! The tracking information screen is a little hard to read as the information looks crowded. The application itself works fresh and my complaint is strictly based on esthetic effects.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love this app. Tracks every aspect of delivery from pick up to destination to my door all with time, date and map."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Complete waste of time, on the ups tracking sites ""ups quantum view"" says for additional information and delivery window times download app and sign up for account..it took forever for various reasons and at the end of it all it told me the exact same thing as the website which was way quicker.. and...Full ReviewComplete waste of time, on the ups tracking sites ""ups quantum view"" says for additional information and delivery window times download app and sign up for account..it took forever for various reasons and at the end of it all it told me the exact same thing as the website which was way quicker.. and after all of that it just said information unavailable completely useless"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Was able to see the tracking from ""on the truck"", to ""my front door"". Very efficient!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app ,, it makes things so easy and I always know where my packages are and when they are going to get here and it makes traveling easier knowing what can be here when we get home or use the option to have them hold it until i do get home .."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Accurate, easy to use. Can edit delivery options. Love the real time map."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Absolutely HORRENDOUS! Try to setup a shipment, and it warns you that you're leaving the app, and then hangs. Was this thing even QA'ed?"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Super Easy to Track and Schedule Packages!! My only suggestion for improvement is to show the NAME of the companysending the items. When receiving multiple items from various companies, it's easier to track by the company name as opposed to the tracking number."

UPS Mobile,Business,1," Nice when it works, but every time I reopen the app, it says I have no internet connection or that my request couldn't be made and I have to log myself out manually and log back in every time. Not worth the effort to track a package"

Each time I sign onto the application it has been updated and I must relearn, even update my information. And now I've received an email indicating that I may have bought a service in all my confusion.😳"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Get's the job done, quite useful. To delete completed trackings, you have to press & hold each entry, but no highlight prompt, then hit ""delete"" individually, which is hard to see. Multiple selection functionality would also help."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, What a great idea: Track your delivery! Problem: it says 'This map updates automatically' but it does not. It's even impossible to update the map manually without going 3 steps back. Really bad implementation of a good idea.

Customer Support is via a virtual assistant which offers very little as it's automated and I've had to call to then be told my package is trapped. This is contrary to the previous updates on both the app and website. I'm ordering something as a necessity and the communication here has been very poor compared to every other firm."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I absolutely love this app! It keeps me informed precisely where my package is and helps me keep track of my package as it's being shipped. I thank you for your expert experience UPS. I wouldn't change a thing. I'm very thankful for your services.🙂.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to download and login is the same as the web site it only took about a minute to download and login great
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I have been using this App for years. It is always kept current updates on all of my packages

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I appreciate the thoroughness of this app, from being able to track packages, being able to set delivery instructions, to receiving delivery notifications. It's easy to navigate and simple to use."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Although I don't ship very frequently, I enjoy being able to track my package to/from sender to destination. The app allows me to know where my package is and when it was delivered. This has been reassuring when having to ship time sensitive items."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Makes planning for deliveries so easy! Love the status updates and the ease of use. I appreciate the automatic alerts, UPS recognizes a package is shipping to me and oftentimes provides an alert that the package is in transit sooner than the shipper."

It really causes problems when it automatically goes to the old address first. Other than that its a great app and I like it better than the other package delivery app I have. Its easier to use and less confusing.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent app for tracking my gun shipments. My vendors all use UPS and its a must for me to have this app. It is fast accurate and automatic by just clicking on the routing number. I've also used it for Amazon returns and regular shipping. Its great.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very easy to use and understand. I've only used it to track my packages because I like to have an idea of when my packages are arriving and because of porch pirates, and it's been super helpful. It's pretty up to date. I can get my package off my porch within minutes of drop off. Just love this app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. Love knowing when my packages are being delivered and then when they got delivered. If I am at work I can ask a neighbor to watch the package or pick it up for me. I can also request the delivery be held if I know I won't be home until the next day...very convenient!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Works great for our family and small business. When packages need a signature - can sign online. Packages in transit, delivery changes, delivery confirmation, all of this is available and do-able via the app. Terrific."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the app and map showing the driver route at the time when they notify you.

You can actually see the driver moving in live motion down the sreets so you can literally meet him the second he arrives."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I can't lock into my account because the app wants me to change the language of my keyboard so I could use a specific character for my password. Doesn't work if I change it either. Besides it is all about a common character present in the English language anyway.
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Frustrating, it constantly logs me out and says my internet connection isn't adequate despite being on LTE. The app freezes up a lot as well. Besides that, it does a good job of letting me know tracking info and giving me the ability to manage my packages"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love the App! It's been fun with the follow your package option. It's pretty accurate, except the truck gets here before the map updates. Keep up the good work! 😃"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Can watch past addresses and make sure nothing is headed there in our name... can reschedule or allow re-delivery of packages, some packages can even be tracked to a map... the app has grown and developed, very useful, few failings"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I like this app! When I buy things on Amazon that are shipped UPS, they are tracked better and faster! I know the item's location and time of delivery on the UPS App before Amazon tells me! Go service, thanks!"
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Its like it logs you out and/or freezes up and can't get back into it. So I need to reboot my phone to get it working again. I have no other problems with other apps. Just this one.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," It's awesome. I always know where my packages are, when I'll receive them and then I even get notified when they drop the packages off. So convenient and easy to use."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is easy to use and it responds quickly. Love it!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is great. IT litterly knows when your getting shipped something BEFORE YOU DO!! You have to be logged on And it takes over and it just knows... You can change the shipping date and time on the app.Very convenient.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very easy to navigate , and I am always more than satisfied with United parcel service for instance this currently placed order , looks like it will be two days early and I could not be happier"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Useful and easy to use for keeping track of my UPS packages and where they are in the tracking history. Helps to also have an account with them to set up preferences.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," App is simple enough, however in ""delivery instructions"" should have more viable ""places"" in instructions, or allow you to specifically put in instructions for a specific delivery place. Other than that app is great"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Awful, I make an account and once I close the app, it logs me out... Go to sign in and apparently my password is wrong...so I change the password and try again, it's wrong again..... What the hell is wrong with this app?"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Very annoying, won't let me add or update my address in my profile!!! Keeps directing me to sign up, but then says an account with that name is already created. How am I supposed to update? I have moved"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It is nice to know the progress of the package delivery and priceless to know when it is delivered so it does not sit on my porch. You can redirect delivery(for a fee) or have it left with a neighbor.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app allows me to track the progress of my expected delivery. It provides updated information regarding any changes.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Good to be notified when deliveries are coming and when they have been delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Well advanced App..easy too use and that you can follow the package right to its destination.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, I have to keep putting the tracking number in each time I open the app to check the shipment progress. What's the point of having the app then? It's easier to have a page in chrome with the tracking and just refreshing the page. I'm going to uninstall.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Good app. Gives very accurate delivery notification. I honestly love the UPS van logo on my phone when I have a push notification....what can I say... it's the little things. :)

UPS Mobile,Business,1," Does not properly track packages. Have a package delivered over 30 days ago that still shows in transit, and it won't let you delete! Phone support system is garbage, it will hang up on you."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great feature to know if packages are coming. Great for people who might not be home for delivery and can arrange for a neighbor to get it, or look for it when you get home."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app is easy to manage and it gives you option for how you want your package delivered. The app also gives accurate information about your package and when it will arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great to be alerted that you have a package being shipped by va vendor and also to track the progress right to your door.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I really like having the UPS app. I have several items that I have delivered about once a month. And I never have to worry about my delivery. I can always track them on the app. Or give my track number and UPS sends me emails for each stop along the way. Right up to delivery

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very pleased with the app. It's kind of like a security blanket of information.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, This app has been very helpful; I really like it. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that there needs to be more informative communication about packages that appear to be lost in transit.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Pretty easy to use and fast at finding your package to track.... In fact the app recognized my tracking number from my phone before I typed it in which was pretty cool. A little wierd but it makes it easier so I guess I'm ok with ups snooping around inside my phone, lol"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, The UPS Mobile app is a wonderful app to have because it allows me to know exactly where my mail or packages which is a relief for me by taking one less stress of my plate.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I get the error that my sign in cannot be processed every time I open the app and have to sign in again. Very frustrating.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Standard tracking information. I really wish I could follow my packages on the map without using the more expensive services. It shouldn't be very difficult for them to do this for all packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent tool for checking the status and progress of my shipments. It would be nice if billing and invoice management were also available for MyChoice accounts in the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Extremely useful. However, I'd like it to detect deliveries based in my address, rather than my entering that long string every time."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, This app is a major step up from not having one at all & is improving steadily. It could be more interactive. Would like to be able to leave comments about current attempts to deliver. Overall I'm happy to have and use this ever improving app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This is horrible for tracking packages. It logs out after every closing of the app without allowing to save login info. Links are broken and buggy. FedEx app is much more accessible and has ease of use.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," A great and useful app. Let's me easily track my packages, and make some changes. Very easy to use and much eaiser than using the website. If you don't use it, you should really give it a try."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Nice app for tracking packages. I love the updates allows me freedom to be able to do stuff and not worry about missing the delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use. Just copy the tracking# and open the app. It does the rest for you. Very accurate about projected delivery times.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent app. Keeps me informed at all times, so I can make plans, appointments, and keep them."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," It's the only app I have that routinely fails to verify my fingerprint. It works well for tracking packages, but only the 1/5 times I can get in."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Always a breeze to use. If you have a UPS shipping number copied to your clipboard when you open it, the app will say I see you have a tracking number in your clipboard would you like to check its status? I think that is great"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Awesome app, gives you up to date arrival times for packages being delivered to you, let's you adjust arrival times, let's you tell the driver where to leave your package if your not gonna be home. Very useful all around awesome."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very handy app. I am a frequent Amazon buyer and they use UPS almost exclusively. UPS sends alerts on delivery days. I can check the weight of the package, too. Thank you!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, This is a good way to keep track of your immediate ups shipments. If it gave a longer range view i would have given it the full 5 stars.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy way to keep track of all your packages through UPS. Also a lot of other options to suit your needs. Overall great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Easy to use, accurate tracking time & place. I wish the company of origin was included in the information."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Luv this app. I get text messages with the status of my packages. I can request my package to be put in a special place on my property.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app, it allows you to actually see your mail before it arrives! Also lets you kniw what packages are in process to be delivered!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the GPS feature since i live in an apartment complex and we're in the middle of COVID19. THANK YOU AND STAY SAFE!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Pile of junk. Rarely works. Recently started demanding fingerprint even tho that feature is not supported. Can't login normaly most of the time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This App is so easy to use. I haven't had one bit of a problem. I recommend it.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Easy to use. Very helpful with tracking.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Helps me manage my deliveries from my smart phone. I use this app for all UPS deliveries. It allows me to selectively direct certain deliveries to my nearby UPS store counter so a package doesn't sit on my porch or to have it held for signature at a convenient time. Very convenient.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I like the UPS app, it is helpful when you are tracking a package and it even allows you to see where the truck that has your package is located in proximity to your house. Great app..."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love it. Only thing I wish they did was give an estimated time frame and/or location where they are in delivery status like Amazon. Make it easier to know when to home for the package especially right now during the epidemic going on.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Having previously installed the app it was a nice surprise when I automatically began getting delivery updates on a package sent to me. No tracking #, it was just as simple as tapping on the notification."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is great in case you have to leave unexpectedly when you have a package scheduled to be delivered. Go UPS!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Sometimes up to the minute status is great. Good overall heads up. I have a lockbox on the porch. Driver uses code to lock items inside. Like it!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's so convenient. It runs smooth and let's me know all the info I could ever need and more for any package comming your way.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always get a heads up when a package is coming and that is very helpful so that I am aware when to be on the lookout for it. Great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Installed and deleted within 5 minutes. I foolishly thought that the app that UPS created would read the barcode at the bottom of a UPS store receipt after shipping something through UPS. What was I thinking.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Unfortunately my package was ""miss scanned"" but the app has kept me informed of this and where its at. Without the app i would be in the dark right now. Great app!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, So far so good. Would be nice to chat with a real person when your package does not arrive on time or is possibly lost. Going through that as I review this app. I am not given the option to call somebody which really does irritate me.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Quick access for information on shipments. Great information available with accurate updates and notifications. Never a problem with my use of the App...saves alot of time!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very convenient. I know when my package will be delivered and I know when they have delivered it so I can go down and get it immediately. Living in a elderly apartment down town. I need this knowledge. Sometimes we have sticky hands in my neighbors.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Have Never had any problems. Everything is there and easy to use. Especially being able to Track your delivery in Real Time...
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use. Easy to track packages I'm receiving or sending. Upgrading options are a plus.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Everything one needs in a shopping app. Track, schedule, and receive updates on shipments. Find store and dropoff locations."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Extremely informative..... would be better if there was a ""true time"" tracking. Amazon delivery has true time tracking and it's a great help."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This is literally the dumbest app I've ever seen. Only to be matched by their equally dumb website . Whoever designed MyChoice needs to be fired. Utterly useless.

Utterly useless. All they do is redirect you back and forth from the app to the site, or to having to sign back in. Seriously every single option besides tracking does not work. I've sat down and shown people and no one can make sense of it . The most frustrating thing I've ever dealt with. How are yall still in business?"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," App is great. Tracking number is easily found, due to color making it standout. Ability to open app with fingerprint is fast and never failed. No need to remember password."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app ups mobile is great to use it tell you went your packages leave the places and get to your house safe so they won't rob. Your packages any more! Need someone to watch went they get there time and everything in this app. Thank you ups mobile service app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easiest way to track my package. I just copy the tracking number, open the app, and it automatically gets the info. You don't even have to paste it in the search box. Then all the info is at your fingertips."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Useful app for tracking UPS incoming and outgoing packages. I like when it lets me know a package is about to be delivered. Times could be a little tighter though.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app is amazing. You can teach your package at every facility it stops at. I just wish it had live tracking but overall it's an amazing app
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Good app. It wants me to login/re-authenticate WAY TO MUCH. 1-2x per day is fine, but every 5-10 min is excessive."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, You can be information in real time accuracy is awesome. We had a lot of packages delivered and it's great to be able keep track of them.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very easy to use and keeps you updated with your delivery! Have not had any issues with glitches
UPS Mobile,Business,2, I loved this app until the upgrade. Now it wont keep me logged in and asks me to sign up everytime and there is a popup for fingerprint login but no place to add a fingerprint. Please fix.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Good app. I really love the UPS app. I live in the country and it's vital to know when my packages are coming.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This is the first thing I check every morning. It's very helpful...I get notifications of deliveries, etc. Love it."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Pointless. Don't quite see the point of this app. You can't track a parcel. Just gives you a date and time, with no updates at all!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app for tracking package in detail. Lacks a means to communicate with UPS about the problems with missing packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This app is worthless. You have to register with your email to track a package. It's hard to understand. Even USPS app is better then this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I love being able to look at when my packages will be delivered. Its always right when they say it will... Never had any issues.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app......detailed information on your package(s).
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I love the ability to track a package because most of my packages are very time sensitive due to them being LIVE FRESHWATER AQUARIUM FISH.

BUT, not to happy with the care given to each package. Something needs to be done about the way the workers handle each package. I say and know this because I myself use to work for UPS loading trucks in White house Tn. Last shipment I lost $1000 worth of fish due to IDIOT DRIVER/DELIVERY PERSON."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app! Very handy! I love the truck tracker.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I love the app because I can give real time instructions to the driver before my package shows up. I only did a 4 star because 4 and a half wasn't available and there always room for improvement so no 5
UPS Mobile,Business,4," As a consumer, I appreciate being able to easily access information about a pending delivery and getting notifications from the app instead of email or text. Also, the delivery management is very easy. Thanks, UPS!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I really like being notified when my package is on it's way. You provide the tracking # so I am able to follow the journey it makes. Best of all I have a delivery date so I am able to make arrangements, etc. Thanks UPS!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to understand and simple to use. Great app, I know right where my package is and can get updates if I want"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Very useful app especially with increased number of deliveries due to ""stay-at-home"" directives."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the app but sometimes the drivers really piss me off I'm disabled and have a really hard time getting around they have literally driven right past my home and stuck a notice in my mailbox to go pick my package up in a locker in town
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Unusable, have to login every time I open the app. If I even seitch to another app I get logged off and my tracking info is unavailable."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app use it all the time to track my packages or to send to a pick up locaton like the lockers when unable to pick up at home. The app is great resource of info!!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love knowing the time of day that my package will arrive. Been having trouble with packages being taken off of the porch. This app let's me know the time frame tbat I need to be available. Love it!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I use this app only to see my deliveries. From other sections on it, I can easily ship and manage shipments just as easily. Looks useful for both individuals and business alike."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Lets me track and manage my packages to see their progress as well as add any instructions if necessary. I find this an invaluable tool in making certain I know when packages will arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I use this app several times a week and never have any issues. Always have great success. Great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Works as described. Get updates of package, approximate delivery time, notification when delivered. Works great."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I know when I have a package coming almost before it's sent out. I love this app. And UPS.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Good App to use to quickly find out about deliveies to my home. I can receive notifications, make changes and name them so I know what it is, just to name a few."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," Good app. But since I've moved recently, it keeps telling me my residential home is a buisness, and won't let me change my corrected address! Have sent them this same info. No response!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,3, The menu options can't be read because the text is too big and they scrunch up into each other.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, If I could rate this app a 10 I would. I was in route to a destination when this app notified me of an impending delivery. Because it was real time I turned around and saw the UPS truck coming down the street. Amazing.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love the app, tracks packages and helps me manage my time better so that I don't miss deliveries."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works great. Opens without glitches. Doesn't update the location of the delivery truck enough.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Super sucks ass!! Try to update your info on this app? Hahaha good luck. It updates as it sees convenient. Freakin bastards. I will pay extra to never use upsucks again!!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, There should be a way to fix address errors easily. Either there is not or it is difficult to find. Either way its frustrating
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The app is incredibly easy to use, and very user friendly. I especially like being able to label each shipment so that I know what I'm tracking, if I have multiple packages on the way."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Since this update I have not been receiving regular notifications like I had been getting. I have gone back into the website and read and my preferences for notifications and nothing has changed I still don't get any!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," You can easily track your packages with this app. It's simple, no ads or pop ups to annoy me. I recommend it if you need or want to keep an eye on your UPS packages."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Excellent functionality but still unable to remove old addresses. Not a big deal, just an extra unnecessary step."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Need to be able to add any text in delivery instructions, otherwise a pretty good app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love it! It has made my life much easier and organized. I can track my orders and stay informed with ease.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, App. Is messed up fonts are huge. Unable to reduce on my phone. Erratic as hell. Manage options says no delivery for today. The tracking option says delivery scheduled today I really expect much more from UPS than the dinky dink app. I have installed
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great App, I receive notifications of any updates changes to my delivery schedule, very helpful of the timeframe when orders will be delivered."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Love this app! The follow the truck map is a lil glitchy but I love the delivery accuracy, thank you!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works great keeps informed of deliveries and I can track the progress.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The service is great so expected the app to be very reliable as well. It does not disappoint and like that u can view ur driver on the map! Easy to navigate as well.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Thank you all for your great service! On the app, I wanted to allow drop off at front porch without a signature but did not find that option."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Keeps me up to date on where my package is and when it's going to be delivered and allows me to notify the driver as to which door I would like my package delivered or to place it on the back porch if I'm not home.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, This app would be great if I didn't have to sign in every time I opened it. I'll give 5 stars when that's fixed.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," App tells me I'm not signed up. When I fill out the form to sign up, app tells me I'm already signed up. Circular problem prevents me from using the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It makes it so much easier to track your packages and gives you alerts on when you should expect your delivery I love the new app
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app has been extremely helpful in helping me track my UPS packages on my phone. Even letting me know when the driver is nearby.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, So easy to use. I love that I can track my packages so easily. I also recieve notification once they are delivered. I highly recommend this app!!
UPS Mobile,Business,1," If i could give less then 1 star, I would.

HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SIGN UP?????? Once in it life should let me do what to do with the app. I am trying trying to setup alert. PLEASE FIX IT."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Cant leave feedback. Some of your drivers still cant tell the front door from the back. That is fine except for the dog food. Don't like dragging it all through the house.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very convenient and provides me with peace of mind with statuses of my shipments in the palm of my hand. Love it
UPS Mobile,Business,5, No complaints here. Very accurate with delivery updates and easy to use.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app!! I am always receiving parcels and packages and this app let's me coordinate times location and e.t.a's!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Wonderful. It shows you where you package is every step of the way. You can also set up for alerts. I love the alerts.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Not the simplest app to use Not logical and often badly worded. Keeps asking me to sign up when I already am.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Clean, clear, intuitive, easy to use and lots of features. Thanks, UPS!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Awesome! This app is very convenient for me to track my packages and know the second they are delivered!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Neat app, convenient for tracking my packages. Even auto added a package before I ever tracked it! To fully edit your profile ya also have to go online, the app only let's ya access a few things."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very helpful. It's so neat to know where your package is and when it's been delivered!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app is good but it's not accurate time wise. Also you should be able to track all your packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Basically useless, since no info seems to get through to UPS, like phone number or door codes, not to mention hoped delivery times. Tracking is simpler through web site."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Track packages easily, recognizes if you've copied a tracking number to the clipboard, can change and customize notifications... Love it!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Pretty easy to use and it is cool that you can manage your delivery from the app instead of having to call customer service!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is very convenient, easy to use and saves time. Can use it for all your UPS needs."

These drivers work hard & don't want to be wasting their time trying to make contact with the resident for a signature. Also should be more specific options for deliveries when a signature is required."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Too hard to use! I cant even get logged in because I keep getting a verify email error when logging in. I've verified my email and even reset my password via email...
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great notification system, including a Google Map of where the truck is en route! Really good, well designed, reliable app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the fact that UPS alerts me about packages coming. It allows me to plan my day around when the package will arrive. Awesome app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works great. Easy to track packages when I'm not at home!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to navigate and great for keeping track of packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, It keeps redirecting me to my ID and my password it's so frustrating I can't even find where my packages are help!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I had email notifications and it always went to spam folder. Not UPSs fault but I usually didn't see it until after PKG arrived so this is super because it's instant!
UPS Mobile,Business,3, This app is useful to get tracking information on a package but when I used it to reschedule a package delivery for another day the delivery was put on hold.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app that's easy to use and provides detailed information about my packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent and easy to use app that provides me all the info I need in a timely manner!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Simple and easy to use. Makes tracking packages simple.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Always says check internet connection. Internet is fine. Issue with the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, It won't even let me log in! It's so not user-friendly. Keeps giving me the runaround!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Since i travel quite a bit, i love getting notifications the day before my shipment will arrive, the time frame on the day if, and the delivery notice when it's been delivered!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Awesome app! This allows me to know when packages are on the way, as well as when they have been delivered. Great app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, User interface is well laid out and easy to navigate. I can't think of any other options needed that are not included.
UPS Mobile,Business,3," All the sudden font is huge, only in this app! Can't even see everything. So weird"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, So helpful and informative. Does what you want and need it for. You can watch the delivery truck as it gets closer to you! Excellent.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very useful for managing and tracking my personal shipments and deliveries. Everything in one logical place.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app works as I need it to however it has carriers request forward though I didn't wish it to do so.

Bottom line, dont promote what you cant sell. Its that simple."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Pretty easy to navigate. Most information available. Appreciate being able to give instructions for package.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Super helpful for knowing when to expect packages. I also like the option to pick up at UPS store.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is always on time almost perfect with its delivery notices the alerts and follow my delivery is great keep up the good work

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I can track the progress of my packages, change delivery address and know when they are delivered. This is a great resource and would recommend the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app! Lots of features that keep you informed of all your logistics needs.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, I should not have to LOG IN to this app on my own phone every single time I check package progress. Let me turn that off. Sick of it! Otherwise app is good.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app. Able to change delivery dates and preferences with ease.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, So easy to use! Much much more user friendly than FedEx's app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love being notified when package is scheduled for delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the fact it tells when my packages will arrive and delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app does what it's supposed to do. Tracking is updated regularly. But if you want more features you have to pay for them.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Accurately updates the status of package progress and affords me delivery options. Very useful.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Don't bother. I created an account. And it immediately wouldn't let me in! Tried to reregistet and it would only select USA as location. Ive got better things to do with my time. Uninstall!
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Can't use the mobile app to create an account. The pop-up blocks all view to the entry for id and password, rendering it useless for me."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app has made it easy to track my packages and all things UPS. No complaints, works as advertised."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great for tracking packages. Allows me skip copying tracking #s in to find out where packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is very helpful in knowing when my packages will arrive and when they have been delivered.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, Does the job pretty well. Responsive and generally easy to navigate.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use and I love the map/ tracking feature for delivery to my house.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very good. Just a little slow in updating position of delivery vehicle.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Too hard to log in or change password Since they require both to reset your password and most companies just send a temporary passcode number to your phone or email of your choice!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Inconveniently the app interface allows you to delete only one tracking number at a time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Of the big three (UPS, FedEx, USPS) this is the most user friendly. Notifications are timely, just wish there was a way to incorporate deliveries automatically into my calendar."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app. I love the fact that I'm able to track multiple packages at one time without having to keep going back and forth between email and app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App. I love knowing when my packages are in transit and when they've been delivered.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," So far, so good! Kinda fun to track your shipment especially when you're staying home as advised!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy way to track and manage packages on phone without searching on site, handy!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Fairly easy to use and has many user friendly features. Better than using UPS thru your browser

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Pretty handy app. Keeps you updated on where your packages are and when they'll show up.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Always on time and up to date tracking info, shipping and receiving! Highly recommend this app to anyone that ships often!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love getting updates for when I have a package coming my way and I really like the feature that I can have it delivered to my local UPS store if I know I'm not going to be at home on a particular day. Keeps the porch thieves away!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Have to manually enter tracking info for packages, app doesnt track them automaically like the post office app does."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Nice app except it won't let me delete an old now non-existent address which it defaults to.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very helpful and reliable. Most useful tool for my deliveries. Recommended tool for sending and receiving packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I like the ability to locally track my shipment. How far, how near, how far.... Then the doorbell rings. And the package is here 😎."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Good app. It's hard for me to remember my user name though. You can't change your user name once you have it. I misspelled mine & now I can't remember it due to the spelling. Wish you had a remember user name on it & it did...
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Quick, easy, and very accurate. It lets you know exactly when your package has arrived!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I like the app when notifications alert me but there are times when I have to get my tracking # and paste it into app before it gives info.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, From time to time there are long lags in updates. Seems much more accurate than one of your major competitors.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app makes it so easy to keep up with when I can expect my packages!

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use & I love the new map feature to show package whereabouts on day of delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I only use it to track packages as a guest and it works fine for that. I don't use any other feature of the app so I can't tell anymore
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It works, but the delivery time estimates are a bit antiquated. A 3 hour window is fine at the beginning of the day, but shouldn't the estimate become more accurate as it approaches?"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great except it gets confused when I turn off the screen with this app running.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, The app keeps freezing and becomes unresponsive. UPS needs to update the app to remove the bugs.

UPS Mobile,Business,2," This more a review of the service than the app. The app works for what it's intended, but UPS's truck pathing system sucks. The truck drove past my street 3 times and didn't turn down it (according to the 'follow my delivery' feature), my street is only a quarter mile long. They give windows of time...Full ReviewThis more a review of the service than the app. The app works for what it's intended, but UPS's truck pathing system sucks. The truck drove past my street 3 times and didn't turn down it (according to the 'follow my delivery' feature), my street is only a quarter mile long.

UPS Mobile,Business,3, Most of the functions work but when I try to make my own account (through Amazon or Facebook) they tell me to confirm my email address. Then it just tells me my account doesn't exist. So this app is really only good for checking on your package. That's about it.

It pulls up Google maps and you can watch everywhere the truck goes till it delivers your package! Pretty cool! That way if you need to go somewhere you can easily see how long before they arrive. Definitely recommend using this app.

Lastly, I get notified when it's been delivered! Which is the best part for me because I live on a 2nd floor & I am disabled."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very good app. Notifies when packages will be delivered well in advance of date and allows you to make changes. Only reason I did not give a 5 is because delivery day notices indicating changes in delivery time can be very inaccurate.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, There's no better way to know where your UPS Shipped package is than a click away anywhere there's cell or wifi service. A 5 star for sure but! maybe just 4 stars soon unless the delivery person can add a photo of my package in-place where it was left when delivered to an unattended door-etc.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It's good for tracking. At first I couldn't see the sender info, but I can now. Love being able to track my package on delivery day. It takes the guesswork out of knowing when to expect my package."

Then you just open the app and it's right there to monitor. Love it!!!! It works great!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very Helpful!! This app is so great. I love how it detects UPS tracking numbers that you receive by email and through other mobile apps. Plus you can scan in your own tracking numbers to track packages that you send out. I definitely recommend this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It's pretty good about keeping you updated about tracking, the USPS app is better, but this app is as close to a close second to that app as it comes."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," One of the BEST apps that I regularly use! It keeps posted on the transitions of my shipments, and allows me to dictate when and where my deliveries are made."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the UPS app!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the map!

They let me know if there has been a change in delivery or time. They always deliver during the time and date promised. I have never had a problem with a delivery. I cannot lift heavy items and the drivers will always set the package inside the house for me so the package is not left outside for a long period of time. I applaud all the drivers for their kindness and courtesy in delivering items to me. Thank you so much UPS!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," This app is so helpful. I can easily track packages, actually track the delivery truck on deliver day and more. I highly recommend this app. Also, the option of receiving updates on package progress is a great hit with me. Love it! Besides, UPS is by far the best."

The second package happened on January 3, 2020. The first time a neighbor saw it and took it to the apartment office and I got it 5 days later."

Not to mention that I have wasted hour of my time which I will never get back. The developer needs to go back to the drawing board on this
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is very helpful. It lets you see at a glance when your stuff will arrive. There are ootions you can do like have things delivered to a UPS store or other locations and I think you can adjust dates later also. I just use it to keep an eye on shipments. Highly recommend if dealing with UPS.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This app is worthless. They tell you a time frame, they miss the time frame, but the app will still say it's on time.

UPS Mobile,Business,4," 90% good. I have had some problems redirecting packages to my acces point. Other than that, it works quite well."
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Can't access my choice after update
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Accurate delivery information
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love being able to see where my stuff is in a timely manner. Thanks UPS for all you do!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Very slow and no better than website. I simply switch back to the app to look at the tracking information that was just loaded and... wait... for... it... oh there is the data that was just there. It really shouldn't take this long to do something so basic.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I really appreciate this app. I live in a very small town, and my address is a bit tricky, (unmarked dead end street, looks like a driveway). With the app I know when to watch for the truck so I can go outside and ""help"" them find me."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app as far as the tracking goes which is all I use it for. My only critique is that it would be nice to be able to set the default delivery location if you have multiple locations. Currently you can set it but it defaults back to the first address numerically.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Intuitive, and totally immersive game. A. I. Boss levels need more development. Leviathans are convincingly terrifying. NPCs could be fleshed out better. More attention needed to optimize and streamline system resource utilization to improve gamer immersion and enhance totality of VR experience."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I absolutely love this app! So nice to know when your package will be there and when they are delivered. It lets you know everything. Thank you UPS!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Tracks and keeps me up to date on the progress of my packages better than any other mail service app.

Then the only day that I actually need to change my package from signature only over to no authorization needed (means that they will just leave it at the door), the app won't work at all and I missed my delivery and must wait 2 more days?"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The UPS app works well. It is especially good since I have been using my Note-8. The app is easy to use and offers good accessibility to the features UPS offers such as almost real time tracking once I packages are a few stops away. Keep improving! One Love

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Wonderful, I like being notified each step along the way for my packages .. I like being able to make delivery adjustments at the tip of my finger ... Never an issue with this app! Would recommend if you're some one like me who gets deliveries all the time ."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app. I use it all the time to track the UPS truck when i'm expecting a delivery, so I can bring my dog in when the truck gets close to my house."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, App is alright. I like the fact that you can see where the truck is now on a map. Downside is the effectiveness of the drivers. Map showed the driver right across the road then 15 minutes later the truck was no where in the relative area. The measuring feature is nice though.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to track your package, not confusing and very convenient. Thumbs up from me. I used to work for UPS and I wish this was out when I did. People used to call me all the time to ask if their package was in or on the way. This is so much easier"

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Let's you know when a package is in Transit. Great app to have. Love when my package is close, shows down to the stops prior to you."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app if you mail things you buy online to your home. It tells you when it will be delivered and after it is delivered it tells you that too.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Dreadful in the extreme. Doesn't remember your parcel tracking details even when you are logged in??? Keeps asking you to sign up... when you are already logged in. Utterly pointless app. Deleted and use a 3rd party one. If this is designed to p1ss you off then it is 100% successful
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very impressed. From Quebec to Owen Sound ON in 2 days during BF/CM deals. 5/5 app. UPS blows CP out of the water when it comes to ordering parcels. Accurate, detailed updates while your order makes it way to you. Custom Delivery options are available through the app, quick updates/ notifications."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use and great for watching my packages locations. The only thing, they need to make it to where I can edit my addresses in the app. I have two old addresses that I can't seem to delete in the app. Not a big issue, but would make it even easier."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Really helpful in showing when packages are coming and tracking their progress. It can be used for multiple addresses. On delivery day it is sometimes useful to have the real time progress on a map. I like the option of making a custom label.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the app. Also if you register with UPS any time a delivery is made to your address you get notified about it via email or text. My wife doesn't know that and is always shocked to see how I know that her packages are delivered
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Its better than nothing but it has a few glitches. Generally it helps keep track of things but it is not consistent with respect to automatically tracking items coming to and from. If you know the tracking and manually add it it does ok.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very easy to navigate and saves a lot of time when needing to make quick changes
UPS Mobile,Business,5, With the UPS Mobile app I always know the status of a delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Must have optional Space 2 have driver instructions on where to leave packages not just general areas such as must be left with resident not left anywhere else. Also on the survey it popped over and I could not clear particular answer so I'm not sure if it's correct I can't move backwards thank you
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Can't edit the HUGE FONTS. The Tracking no. takes up more than a third of the page. I spent hours looking for a link to edit the fonts unsuccessfully. Why did you change your App. I used to love it.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, App works very well!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like the app because you don't heave to keep going online & typing your tracking number. The app tells you when it's shipped & updates you on its location. And you never have to worry about the tracking number. I wish it had more options but perhaps they will eventually.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app! UPS does a fantastic job! Only wish I could easily remove item's from tracking after they're delivered, like USPS and FedEx do."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. It lets me know when UPS is close so i am able to get it. We live in a rural area so this works fantastic!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, UPS is almost always accurate. It's reassuring to be able to confirm detailed info about deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Pretty good communication 👍
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Favorite part of this app for me is that it automatically saves tracking number. I can open a tracking number from email, Ebay, amazon, wherever.... and all are in my UPS app when I open it. Also, you can rename the number to what the package is for easy identification."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the app! Everything works like it should and it's nice getting delivery updates via text or push notifications. It's w way easier with an app versus going on line logging in and all that. But the online method was never a problem either.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Nice looking app. It is really annoying that you have to sign in every. single. time. It's a pain that it doesnt just keep you signed in. Otherwise no other complaints.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," This app still has a few bugs when using a samsung galaxy s8. But overall, it is a great app which can track all shipments sent or received. You can file claims, upload documents and modify deliveries when necessary."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I have great experiences with this delivery app. The push messages are a great part of the app letting you know when and where your delivery is or left in mail box ( size must be of letter type) when package has been delivered. A great App for Tracking your shipments.

Easy to use, to track, to get details, and uses the same account as the computer interface. Only 4 stars because I haven't used the app more than once. if I find it's better or more comprehensive than the little part I've seen, I'll increase the rating. Gotta be doing something right since it is in the top 10 apps. Samsung Galaxy S8+"

I'm very happy with the app, it's easy to use, and enables me to control delivery of my UPS packages. I highly recommend this app to anyone who receives items shipped by UPS."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It really helps plan for deliveries. It also helps when I realize the driver had rerouted my package to the post office and shouldn't have! I have found this app very useful! No problems or annoying ad's.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Like another recent review (Nov 2019), this app is currently broken. Constant error message -- tracking service currently unavailable. Until they fix it, try another solution."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," For 6 days it has always said ""Tracking not currently available. Please try again later."". If a package tracking app won't track packages, what good is it? I would give zero stars, but it makes give at least one."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app. I can track my packages, notifies me of any changes in regards to its delivery. I can also designate where it can dropped off(ie.: Front gate, front door, side door, etc.)."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," When it works, it's functional and efficient! Unfortunately, every time I open the app, without fail, I have to log back into my account. Frustrating when I try to check it daily."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent App. I have regular deliveries, and this app is my go to. I can't always be home to collect packages. This gives me real time delivery information. It's perfect."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app, super convenient. The only thing I would say is that it would be great if they were to add more and similar features like the ones one the website, other than that I give it an AA++++!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," It was prompting me to sign up when I already signed up several times, I just wanted to track a package"

I had to figure out to touch the number to get my keyboard to open up to click the search button from there. Fix that for 5 stars.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app was helpful since 3 deliveries have taken instead of 2 days from Amazon 5 days for 1 and 6 days for the other and they have 20 different entries for their journey to get here. The snowstorm wasn't that bad and truck was less than 1/2 mile away 3 of those days. Sorry had to vent.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," The app let's you track your driver's progress, but provides no alerts regarding likelihood of early or late delivery. Such features would be helpful to people who plan their days around the delivery window."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Lame app. They send the date to expect delivery & usually an approximate timeframe (1pm to 5:50pm) they will deliver, but they are chronically late.

I waited until almost 11am before it finally arrived."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Spent over an hour trying to sign up, verify, etc.. All complete. It continually asks me to ""sign up"" so I can sign for my incoming package. Save yourself the time and just wait for it to arrive. Garbage customer experience."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Tracking some important documents, keeps me updated every step of the way!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Updated version sucks even on you description says things this app does but it doesnt! At all no opt OP ns like before to track al your incoming packages. Gic it like it was before!!!!!

Being disabled gives me plenty of time to get to the door before he drops the package and runs!! Most times I am not able to pick up the packages delivered. I require a signature for my meds so that he doesn't leave before I get to the door. I need a few minutes at least!! Drop and run is not a good way to get packages for me being disabled. My normal driver is good.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love knowing when any packages to my address have been delivered regardless of which resident they are for. And tracking and making changes to the delivery is quick and easy. The app is extremely user friendly.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, This app use to work really well and track items ! It does not work anymore after last update . I have been in contact with the support team and they fixed the problem . Excellent work guys it works again. Thanks
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app gives me great security, by advising me step by step of where my package(s) is/are in the pipeline & by notifying me when it/they is/are delivered, so that I can intercept it before a package thief gets to it/them."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app! Easy to navigate through the app and is very accurate! I love that i get text messages and email alerts throughout the transit and when my package is delivered! Thank you
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love it! The UPS Mobile app keeps me updated on where my packages are and when they are delivered. This is especially helpful during holiday shopping season. (Nov - Dec)
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Nice, simple, quick to load, App. That gives you just the facts you need to know about when and where you package is, (no long drawn out explanations or multiple screens to wade through)."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love it ,always lets me know when my package is about to arrive and you can adjust how you want to receive your package under settings, give it a try you won't be disappointed."

If you are waiting on a delivery and you need to be there to get the package and you are given a several hour window, you could decide if you have time to go make a run or not before your package arrives. Most times its fine to sit at your home for several hours, BUT if you live in a bad neighborhood where 'things' seem to disappear without a trace, this feature could be handy. I believe when your package is scanned just before it's delivered, that scanner is connected via satellite to the internet so it could be possible."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This is a great app because once my delivery went to the wrong address and it said that the driver had somebody signed for my package and none of that was true, but because of the app I few what it was deliveredthat and was able to contact the UPS and find my package."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I've signed in...but can't access UPS My Choice. It goes straight to sign up, where gives me error that my profile is already enrolled. Attempted again, logging back in, same loop of going to new Sign Up page. Frustrated."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I absolutely love this app! It alerts me to when my packages are scheduled to be delivered and it is pretty accurate. So many are having their packages stolen and I think this app helps in deterring them.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Awkward to use. The UPS web site was straight forward. The app...not so much. Too easy to hit the wrong button lose all the info you've entered. On the plus side...it does allow you to create shipping labels.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Overall this is a great app that makes the wait for packages much easier, the only flaw is that in my experience you have to relogin every time you open it which can get tiresome."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," App very user friendly. You can Look up Many things. For me, it is necessary to know where my package is. I am pretty impatient, and love the convenience of this site. Have a great day and God bless."

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I appreciate the clear and informative location of my packages. I had one package in transit for a few days however due to the accurate recording of my package, it was easily found and returned to me. Will continue to use UPS . Thanks"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app functions well for us. Has several excellent features, some of which are hugely convenient. Keep up the good work, I learn a lot about technology using it as well."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Great App., That Actually wrks every time I need to use it, unlike lots of apps I've used! I love being able to track my package and know exactly when I can pick it up!😎"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Used the tracking feature on several packages. Works as expected. Was cool that it recognized the tracking number was just cooed to my clipboard and I didn't even have to paste it. The app simply asked me if I wanted it tracked. Nice!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Easy to use. Easy to read. I like being able to give a name to pkg. Also if I copy the tracking number from another site, it will automatically pick it up and fisplay in the app. Great feature"

In order to see any of that, you have to create an account. When creating a new account, they ask for a large amount of personal information and are picky with passwords. And after spending a good 15 minutes setting up an account to see the information, it said the package would ""arrive by end of day"" and it never showed how close the truck was."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," It keeps giving ""the tracking service is temporarily unavailable"" message for over a week. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled it and it keeps giving the same message."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," It's great knowing when packages will arrive. If it happens to be a gift, I can arrange for intercepting the package before a family member finds it. It is nice being able to change the delivery if necessary."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I Keep having to change user ID and make new account. It sends me my ID for forgot ID and then still tells me they are invalid. Defeats the purpose of ease of use if my account never works. I decided easier to not use the app the create 3rd ID.

UPS Mobile,Business,4," I don't always receive periodic updates before the package is dropped off, but I sm usually notified when they are delivered. It would be nice to know before a package is delivered-especially if it requires a signature."
UPS Mobile,Business,2, App needs some improvement... 1.) Add option to leave note for delivery instructions. Right now it simply has preprogrammed general locations. I need to tell them to NEVER leave packages at my front door and instead put them in the secured lockers at my apt bldg.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Started using the UPS app about 2 years ago and I am still as satisfied with it today as I was then. It is fantastic to be able to control your delivery. Thanks again.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, I'm very pleased with this app! It definitely makes waiting for a package a lot easier with all the updates it gives you!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I really appreciate this app. It's wonderful to know where my packages are, both coming and going. And when they've been received, arrived and picked up. Great job 👍 everyone!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. Can't go wrong. Follow your packages and delivery arrivals without being troubled wondering where your packages are or when they will be delivered 👍

I couldn't have guessed that at noon my delivery scheduled today would arrive ""before the end of the day"". This is outrageous. I don't care if you can't predict a delivery but don't bait me into downloading an app and ending up telling me that water is wet. Best of luck to the drivers if they have to deal with the same schmucks handling UPS IT."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Helpful in so many ways, very Happy to know that have total control over Tracking my Packages, whether I am Sending or Receiving. Now only if I can locate the App for following my Packages once loaded on UPS Delivery Truck?"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Good app no problem
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Better than sliced bread but falls short of beer. The only conceivable improvement would be real-time location data. We won't see that because it is a potential security threat to drivers and property, but it would be nice. I prefer the mobile app to the MyChoice web page."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app has made my life much easier! I know when my packages are arriving and where they were left when delivered. There is also an option to get a 2 hour window for delivery for a small fee. Other settings you can customize are there too. great job!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The app contains information from shipping to receiving. You can order supplies, get shipping forms, up to date information on shipping regulations & more. In the app you can also choose how you want to receive updates on your incoming or outgoing packages."

UPS Mobile,Business,1," App barely works, try to track a package it keeps telling you an error has occurred try again later. Just other few other problems as well."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app and very info driven. Would like to see map of where package is currently and be able to contact driver by text message or similar.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like this app . It let's me know when I have a delivery & approximate arrival . Also informs me that my package has been delivered. Thank you !
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. Just knowing that I have a package being delivered shortly or one that has just been delivered I think is fantastic!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app for tracking and getting delivery notification. Been using it for years. Love it!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is quick to load. It has a very succinct list, and easy tracking."

UPS Mobile,Business,1, This app is a perfect example of why we need zero stars. Installed the app and signed for MyChoice to manage deliveries. Clicked manage deliveries and it tells me to sign up.

Any of the requests I made to modify the delivery did not actually register in their system, but the app showed that they did. So while I expected to pick up my parcel from a UPS Access point in the afternoon, I instead recieves a notification that they tried to deliver it to my home address, IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING IN THE DELIVERY, JUST CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE APP IS HORRIBLE. Clunky, impractical.. just the perfect example of piss poor coding."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. You're always informed when your package is scheduled for delivery and when it is actually out for delivery. You can now actually track the UPS truck and see how close to your house it is. Great information at your fingertips.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app! I can choose notifications of where my orders are at every step along the way. I have grandkids half a continent away, so this app comes in super handy for tracking all the birthday & Christmas presents that I send to them. Super easy to use app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app. I can easily track packages and even see where the truck is on day of delivery. I'm able to give instructions on where a package should be left and can change it easily. Love this app, very simple, very convenient!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I like this app its easy to track packages but, (I don't know if this is UPS or not) but, when a package isn't in transit you can't track it until it's in transit. Then you forget that you have to track a package so fix this and I'll make it 5 stars"

I get the motion sensor already that someone drove up then the ups delivered notification followed by my motion sensor detecting the driver leaving. Thanks to this quick turnaround I know that a real delivery was made and that all.my delivery preferences have been addressed. It's nice to have peace of mind and exact knowledge of delivery or pickups.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," I registered online and validated the email address. But you have to register again to get access to the service and the registration page requires your membership id. And if you say that you don't have id number, you are redirected to the same page! Maybe app is good... But not for the newcomers."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," So easy to use and great for tracking my packages, i love tgat if i copy the tracking code it automatically ask if i want to track that number!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Latest version is easier to navigate. Tracks automatically without input from user.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Kudos to the app designers. Works extremely well. Tracking and manage are the features I like most.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," What happened to the live tracking of the local delivery vehicle? That was very useful. Other than that, I love it!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love being able to track the vehicle to see where he is in the neighborhood. WHAT AN EXCELLENT IDEA. THANKS
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use! I love being able to put my own Nickname/Reference info that the other guys don't offer. Aids in knowing what's arriving... 👍👍😊
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use. Let's you customize your pick ups and deliveries, plus gives you updates on your packages progress."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very good for notifying you have a package coming and tracking its progress. I just wish it could allow tracking in real time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is very beneficial. It alerts me when I have a package coming. UPS is so much better than Fed Ex. I wish every company used UPS for shipping.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App! Always helpful when checking my delivery status.

I wanted to grow in the company, a good company. But they used that to make an opportunity to play a joke on me for there interest. The employees I worked with always judged me and lied, also they never stopped. So I took the layoff instead of a transfer to the new Goodyear location. They still think wrong of me. So as an ex-employee, I would rather be with FedEx for real reasons."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very Helpful! Love that I can see where my packages are, when they're expected to be delivered, updates on any delays, and when they're finally delivered -- especially with the increase in package theft in our area."

First it does its own different coding of checking for WiFi or Data connection. When the phone itself already has that ability but the stupid app claims I have no internet service when I am using 4G LTE with full bars.   Then after refreshing the screen several times, it tells me where my package is and there are options available for shipping. But in order to do that, I have to register and sign into a separate service to manage that. Then after doing all that, it tells me, ""Service unavailable"".    Of the other three carriers, Canada Post, DHL, and Purolator, we have options without the need for signing in to two separate services of which both wanted unusual access to my phone including my contacts list, location and hardware control.  That last part is really stupid because even with hardware control, it could not tell I was connected to anything when I clearly was. A really stupid app. I bet all that permission they require is a way to mine our data for 3rd party purposes."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Other than being slow the app seems fine. I can track a package or view future deliveries. There seems to be some UPS quirks. Sometimes a package will be out for delivery and then will say date tentative. For no apparent reason a package out for delivery will not get delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Works great for giving updates on your packages and allowing some changes such as delivery location. Sometimes it works best for me to have packages delivered to my local UPS store. The app loads slowly for me, but that's my only complaint."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," always know where your shipment is, I love it. I know when the label is created and every scan between that point of origin and my door! No need to miss a delivery now. I can even leave instructions for the delivery driver, if need be. Really love the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, the app works good . just wish the tracking information was easyer to flow or to use . keep asking you to sign up for text and E-mail notification when you're already signed in . hard to get help with setting up the text messaging for tracking the package .
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Outstanding app as well as service. I was kept updated via e-mail, my packages were delivered where I asked them to be, I was notified by the driver the delivery had been made and my purchases were right on time. Keep up the amazing work. Thank You"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the app due to the fact I can track my online purchases and have an idea regarding the time of the delivery by UPS.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app! Much easier and smoother than just the internet.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, An app that provides useful information! UPS provides consistently great service & this app is one of the tools used to implement that service. Thanks UPS for the service you provide.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," So incredibley slow it's basically unusable. It takes multiple MINUTES to login and load, and then minutes between each screen. This is amazingly bad, and UPS should be ashamed of themselves."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," App SUX!!! Forget your password, and you get run around in circles between the app and the website! One hand does not know what the other hand is doing!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It just an app that does what it supposed to do. It let you know where your package at at all time and you can pick the day you want your package delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Awesome app , lets you know ; where its at , when it will be delivered and delivery instructions can be provided.."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The UPS Mobile app gives me real time delivery information which helps for scheduling and planning purposes. It is a definite plus in my life!

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Loved that i could get updates anytime and my package was delivered a day earlier. With the app I was able to know my package was coming early.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love it, it let's know in advance when something is being delivered, so agrangements can be made well in advance. Plus it let me know if there is a problem and when it is delivered. Awesome! Just wish there was a way to delete old trackings."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, AWESOME. . . . . . . .I LOVE to be able to track my packages anywhere & everywhere ALL the time. Day or night I can find out exactly where anything I'm either expecting or sending. And I can see exactly when it'll be at my door. YOU CAN NOT BEAT IT !!!!!!!!

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app! Keeps me updated and allows me to send messages in case I need to change delivery times..
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Nice to be able to track your packages and even see where your driver is at. Keeps you aware of when things get to your home.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app so simple to use. So far I love this app. And of course UPS rocks as usual. Thank's
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is truly the easiest app to use. Love that I can tap it and get up to date info on my package.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love having access to all my expected deliveries for the day! Also love when it gives the option of seeing where the driver (only shows sometimes).
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Rubbish app. Doesn't allow you to change delivery date (as far as I can tell) and it only allows you to select from a list of places to leave the parcel - none of which are relevant to my property - and you can't write your own instructions.

I can't access the address to see if it's being delivered correctly and have had 0 help from 1800 number or store associates. Definitely will NEVER be using UPS service again."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I like this app except it doesn't allow you to make custom delivery options like the FedEx app. In the FedEx app I can indicate exactly where to leave my package via the custom option. This app has preset options that I can't change. I do like the fact I can reschedule and track my package.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," It takes 19 seconds to actually get into the app.  19 seconds to load on an octacore phone with excessive amounts of ram, and nothing else running on it.  I'm going to just say it as it needs to be said: This app is garbage."

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app. I get notified when my packages are on the way, if there is a delay, and when they get delivered if it is to an address where I am not. It makes tracking your packages a no- brainer. Wish I had it years ago. Thanks UPS!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app gives you expected delivery dates, times and who the package is from. I always receive my packages on or before the scheduled delivery dates. This app seldom has issues, and if there is one it's usually fixed quickly. Love UPS, love the app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Every time this app updates, it loses all login information. Not to mention on initial startup after updating, it gets stuck on the UPS splash screen. I have to clear both caches to get it to work. That work around doesn't always succeed."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. Trying to guess when and if your package is going to be delivered can be stressful. With this app you get notifications the day before that you have a package being delivered. Then notifications when it is. I use it all the time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love the fact I can be notified when a package is being delivered to my residence. Not that I have the problem, but I've heard other people experiencing and seems videos of packages being stolen on my Ring and Nextdoor apps. Thank you UPS for adding this app as an upgrade to your services"

I already have."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Don't use it professionally, but definitely nice option for tracking and getting updates on packages I'm expecting! Like a lot of people, I order a good deal from Amazon, so this app is very helpful in tracking"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Isn't letting me sign up for my choice with my apartment building address and apartment number because someone signed up for it before, so I had to use my post office box. Maybe my roommate signed up, maybe a previous tenant, maybe the whole apartment building counts?"

Every time I log it it acts like it doesn't know who I am or have any packages tracked for me, even though I followed the link THEY sent to me about packages on the way. My profile has the cell phone they texted and my street address. Am I doing something wrong, or does this app just suck super bad?"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app has always worked well for me. I use it frequently and it saves the tracking number so I only have to put it in once. If I click on a tracking number in an email or text, it will open in the app so I don't even have to put it in manually."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, How come I can not see all packages sent to my address regardless to the name of sender or receiver as in the case of wedding gifts. Shouldn't have to have to match packages with names or phone numbers. A name can not be added if a person already has an ups account.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Would give it no stars if I could. This app won't let me log in half the time and when it does it won't let me see estimated times of delivery nor arrange alternate times/locations like it claims to do! So what is the point of this app if it doesn't do that?
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I Love this app I'm in a Hospital bed in my living room and I can't walk and I would like to have my stuff put on my front porch steps and not in my yard I have cameras and the driver can open my gate and please put on my steps CAN YOU AT LEAST DO THAT PLEASE 🙏 Thank You very much and GOD BLESS YOU...Full ReviewI Love this app I'm in a Hospital bed in my living room and I can't walk and I would like to have my stuff put on my front porch steps and not in my yard I have cameras and the driver can open my gate and please put on my steps CAN YOU AT LEAST DO THAT PLEASE 🙏 Thank You very much and GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY 🙏.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Not very user friendly. Too confusing to use. Every time I put in my information it would tell me I was missing information but I wasn't. My tracking number was invalid somehow and it is the one left by the driver on my door. I had to delete the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Good app for tracking but trying to update your address is dumb when you try to add your address after you sign in it makes you sign up fix it
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This App is Very Helpful. It's good to know exactly where my packages are at all times.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I've had no problems at all the tracking of my package has been wonderful and l like knowing where it's at and when it will be delivered
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use and keeps me up to date with my deliveries and shipping is easy and convenient. Love it👍👍👍
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very easy to use and gives me all the information I need, to know where I package is and when to expect it."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app has lots of features and I have used quite a few... Nothing wrong with any of it I am glad to tell you about it.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Helps me keep track of all my packages. With my ups my choice any package I purchase and use ups it automatically tracks and sends email updates
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very useful app. I love that I can track my pkgs & reschedule delivery or redirect them if need be.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app just wish they would have a tracker so I can see when they are about to deliver. I only currently see by end of day???
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This app NEVER recognizes me. It always asks for login, then says there's already an account with my info. Duh. I can't schedule anything."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, App is easy to use and keeps me informed on where my packages are!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app helps so much in knowing when your orders have been shipped and will be delivered.

If UPS prices were better, or if the workers were always good enough to match the higher prices, this app would put the whole service over the top. They used to be more careful about hiring only the best people, but lately we've had some duds. Last month, a driver brought us a torn open box with broken stuff in it so we refused it. Then he redelivered the same box the next day. But hey, my app told me it was there. 😁"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," l love this app, it's very easy to use and so convenient. I especially like that I'll get updates on where my delivery is and when to expect it and when it has arrived. I've had no issues at all great app."

I do not have to worry about my packages being stolen because I immediately know when my packages arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Completely useless. After signing into my account, the only option I'm allowed, is to sign up for an account. I decided to go ahead and sign up again, only to be informed that an account already exists with that name and address. What good is this app if it can't be used?"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It's a good App I just wish you could leave more explicit direction as to where you are to leave a package...all I could say was ""deck"". that's difficult when it's a multi-apartment house"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I like this app very much, its very helpful to know about when a package will be delivered. however, it would still be even nice if the delivery person would push the door bell button that is within inches of the door."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, UPS website is really easy to get around in. Things are made really simple to understand and loaded with information. I especially like the way that you can get on time updates about your packages. The appearance is neat and simple to use.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is so darn easy.... especially for folks that are up in age!!! I still look forward to seeing a human being when the deliveries are made though..lol
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Fantastic... do alot of purchases on EBay and the app helps keep track of them all.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App! I always accurate with the tracking of my package and always on time with their deliveries
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It was a great app easy to use you can add orders to you account easily. For me being a kid it was very easy
UPS Mobile,Business,3, The app allows you to save a nickname for the delivery but when you exit and come back the nickname is gone.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I live in a bad part of town so with this app I can always tell when my packages are coming and be here or redirect them to the office or a drop point.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent package tracking! The updates are always accurate and on time!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I was able to reroute a package in transit, at no additional cost. This worked great."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I have been very satisfied with the tracking and knowing where my package is. And also when it gets delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very convenient. Shipping/tracking info updates are very fast and accurate.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the app very useful
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app. When I copy a tracking number from my purchase receipt this UPS app, when I opened it, asked if I wanted to track that number detected. Time saver, peace of mind, and I can give additional where to leave a package instructions."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Works for me, I like it! And if you need to change the drop off location, not a problem it's simple to do that and you can sign for the delivery too and even give special needs to be taken care of! GREAT Job !"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Buggy, cannot customize anything under ""my choice"" due to redirection problems where you are redirected to ""signup"" instead of (and after) ""login"". With severe translation errors in german to the degree of unusability."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I like the app because it tells me basics ahead of time, like when a delivery is coming and where it's at and it's eta. I like that I can get a shipping quote and send a package even though I don't ever use those options, it's nice that they're available."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Solid tracking app. Only tracks UPS packages, but it will show them live on the truck when they're out for delivery, which is pretty cool. Does what it needs to do, notifies about deliveries, and otherwise stays out of the way."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love using this app because I get notified throughout the delivery process eith all the updates and information of where it as at all times and if anything happens for it to be delayed it lets me know right away. I would definitely recommend using this app if you have UPS deliveries!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I love the mobile app! I would give it five stars, but when USPS delivers for them, I get the notification of delivery several hours or a day later. However, UPS is great with immediate notification!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I Love UPS! Your App features, delivery services, and tracking text updates are Awesome!! I have never had a problem with this app, no ads, nothing but Excellence! Thank You. Keep up the Great Work!"

UPS Mobile,Business,4," Good app! Takes a bit to learn how to use, but overall great app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Absolutely useless. If you received an delivery scheduled email you don't need this app. Doesn't give any more information.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Tracking packages is easy and efficient. Notifications are very handy.

UPS Mobile,Business,2, Sadly can't seem be able to change the pick up location with this app. The default pick up location is very bad for me. Only thing you can do with this is track the package and that can be done also without this app or making an account.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," A very useful app! Accurate, too. I know when my packages are due to arrive, within a comfortable window, and can plan around that knowledge. The status updates are wonderful."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this App, it's a step by step guide to watch your shipping from the store to your home."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," This app is definitely worth 5 stars if they just add one more thing. A place where we can request the package to be dropped at the door. For example, a hiding place that is on your front porch. Super happy having AUP S mobile app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I love the app. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star rating is because in the tracking section it says my package will be delivered today but in the manage section it says no deliveries scheduled for today. Other than that, the app works great."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great and useful app! I always know exactly where my packages are and when they'll be delivered. I use a medication that has to be refrigerated so this app is very much needed so I can refridgerate it as soon as it's delivered. Thanks for making suxh a great app UPS!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Is a great app...only issue is that if I instruct to put things in garage, there put outside in driveway...not even on the porch :-("
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works great! I always know when my packages are arriving.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Awful, force logs you out, and adds no value why do I want an app to tell me the package is in transit? I can check that on the site. It would be great if you could give estimated delivery times via push notifications."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the way that I can track my packages. Ups has a great system and it's very accurate also.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Solid for tracking and planning for arrival of packages, helps avoid leaving unattended and avoid tempting theft."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It's very handy. I love that it notifies me of delivery plans, without having to look for it."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The FedEx app is very good and helpful. The tracking the delivery portion could be improved but overall I'm satisfied.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Absolute worst. After setting a password it tells me to confirm my email address in the email sent. HEY! Heres a great idea morons, how about sending the email so i can verify? What a POS."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, UPS is accurate & on time. I like the tracking feature & on time deliveries. Notifications come in handy.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," I don't know if the app actually works it works for tracking package but the delivery preference doesn't I guess I set my preference for all packages to be left at the front door and no signature required, and they still don't do it, and it is annoying."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I think this app is awesome. It's very nice to get immediate alerts when packages are coming. And it's also nice to know when packages have arrived with the immediate text alert that package has been delivered
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love that I get such accurate updates on tracking my orders. I know when it will be delivered, can change the day it's delivered if I want to be there when it arrives or I can choose to pick it up at the UPS Customer Service Center or Access Point!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very useful and accurate. Updates in real time and offers a great way to remotely use all of UPS' best features. However- an option to toggle back to the dark display would be much easier on my eyes.
UPS Mobile,Business,3," The display is good and easy to use. Should add ""leave message for driver"" function, the delivery instruction is not enough. I need space that I can write how I want my package to be shipped."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app for tracking deliveries. You can find out where your parcel is and changes. Delivery windows are tight and you can redirect your parcels as needed. I can't imagine the Christmas season without it!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great way to track packages quickly. This app gives great updates on where your package is and if there are delays and the reasons why, if they are delays. Very informative!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," The only thing I don't like is that it takes a long time to start up. Otherwise, it is nice that my UPS automatically sees packages that are being delivered to your address that are addressed to you, before you give it the tracking number. UPS is good at service."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Doesn't tell me anything more than the email notifications I got. This lazy excuse for an app even redirects to their normal site if you want detailed GPS tracking of vehicle. You may as well just use a web browser (for their site) instead of using this. Uninstalled.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," App is useless compared to browser. It kept wanting me to sign up for UPS MyShip after I already signed in with the account I use just fine for it in the mobile browser. Somehow, the app just can't reconcile one half of my profile info with the other."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent app, a great way to manage and track your outgoing and incoming packages. Great Way to schedule pickups, figure out shipping cost, and ease of use to manage all your UPS needs."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, A great way to keep track of packages to be delivered. especially in this time of package thefts. You can reset the day of delivery if you will not be home or you can be on the lookout around the posted scheduled time for delivery. A wonderful advantage.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," My first time using the App , very easy to navigate and control according to my schedule and yours, so far it has kept me right on track with the estimated time of arrival, great so far."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I signed up for this app as suggested in email which said it was a free app.  Then I was asked to enter my credit card information.  If it is a free app, why do you need my credit card information?  The app will not let me submit without that information.  Why?"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app as I can track when my packages will arrive. UPS MyChoice is particularity nice as I can track in real time where my driver is and when they are in my neighborhood. It is so accurate that I've been able to meet my driver at the door. Definitely 5 stars!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I run a business and the app does wonders. Keeps me informed on a minute to minute basis of where the items are, when they will be delivered or any exceptions so my customers can be kept informed."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Keeps me up to date with my deliveries. Notifies me so I don't miss the driver at the door, usually withing 30 seconds after they arrive. Love that about the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app! So easy to use and notifications on packages are so helpful.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great overall - would be nice if you could actually put a hold on packages when needed.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Good info! App sometimes is slow and logs me out before I am done with a request!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easier to use than the website when you're on the go. Really like it!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Much more convenient than the full website. It's very easy to navigate and it's simple to use and understand.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love this App, it makes my deliveries easy to set up if a signature is needed."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, UPS App very convenient for tracking incoming packages. I have not used any of the other features.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's a really great convenience to know exactly when your packages are being delivered and to follow it before it gets to your door.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great way to track and manage package delivery on the receiving end.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Saves so much time, very useful!! Love receiving delivery alerts so I can keep watch for packages"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app. Love the ability to track my packages on my phone.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App that allows you to do anything you want more easily than does their website.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Horrible app. Notifications, delivery planning do not work. We have had like 5 packages returned to the sender"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like the capability of tracking anticipated deliveries and the updates from ship date to package arrival.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Since it's my 1st time using the mobile app, my opinion is limited. I have always used UPS on my computer & I find that useful (except when UPDATES aren't applied in a timely manner). It's a busy season now & UPS is probably getting overwhelmed. U Re forgiven."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is reliable. It is awesome!! I can trust this app to help me track my package with current accuracy. I don't have to worry or stress myself and I am grateful that my package is on its way.

If its sent next day you can see where truck is in and how many stops before it arrives to u. Simple to set up, took me 5 minutes. That's with creating profile and all. Dont understand why people have trouble with tracking even ground packages. Its simple. The negative comments are odd. U have to be simple to not get it. You can even just google ups tracking, put # n will show where package is. Guess some peeps are not to BRIGHT OR JUST DUMB!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, i like it. the main part I do like about the app is it gives you live tracking of the vehicle your package is on. It also automatically updates an alert you when you do have packages arriving.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Good application overall. I have pick up pending, but the application shows 'Reaft for UPS' which is confusing. The same message is displayed on the website, so I don't think it is application's fault."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I sign I to My Choice and when I try to do anything at all, like track my package, it makes me sign up again andvthen tells me I already have an ID and password. It's an infinite loop leading to nowhere."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love the UPS delivery app. I use it every time I make an online purchase, to follow my packages from the time they leave the shipper until they are delivered.

I can even see where the truck is on the day of delivery - in my town, in my neighborhood or on my street. The app also sends delivery notices. The best feature, in my opinion, is the fact that your tracking number is included in every text; you don't have to find it every time you want to check on the status of your package. Robin, MD"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is easy to work around. You type in your tracking number and it manages it all for you. You can keep track very easily. Looks of it is easy and what i love is an easy way to get from point A to the end of the alphabet.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Tracking packages made even easier. The app is so easy to navigate. I like that you can see upcoming deliveries in one screen and have the option to change deliveries if need be. Great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Until this morning, I would have given this app a solid 5 stars, but suddenly it consistantly has trouble ""finding my network"", even though I'm already connected, and wants me to setup a new account."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great to to track your packages. Easy to use if you need to reschedule deliveries or have a delivery held for pickup.

My personal experience was I was expecting a delivery on a Friday when something came up and I had to leave town on Thursday for 4 days. Typically my driver leaves my parcels at the front door. Since I did not want the box sitting out front tempting the local nare-do-wells I opened the app and rescheduled for will call at the local UPS terminal.when I returned.Quick and easy.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Tracking no longer works since the last update. Up until recently i would have rated the app much better
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The option to pull tracking numbers off your device's clipboard makes it a time saver.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app has really improved. Love the way it lets you know of any changes in your delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, When you want to track a package this app is great. I only use UPS over other carriers.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great delivery notifications, I always know when packages are coming and when they've arrived."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, When I went to log in it said I had to sign up. When I tried to sign up it said I was already signed up and I kept going back and forth with no resolve.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Its a bit slow loading but I am ok with it, probably because of the security purposes. Thanks"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very simple to use all of your deliveries in one place signup was simple and account management is a breeze.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," App is easy & quick to use, saves time looking up tracking numbers the old."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very helpful. Was able to track my package all the way to my front door!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, REALLY needs a way to delete invalid tracking and managing data for labels not used or delivered and stock in the in transit mode. It does track the trackable.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Helpful, accurate app. Great if you're on the road and expecting a delivery."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Would not allow me to log on and a vague explanation left me frustrated. You can do better.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Absolutely Hate UPS. I paid for the 2 day air shipping and they told me it would be delivered by the end of the day Monday March 2nd.

On top of all that they don't notify you a package arrives until almost 2 hours later."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," It showed my package delivery changed to today and that it was loaded up and out for delivery by 8pm.

Since it requires a signature, I had to cancel all of my family's plans, to spend time with family that was here form out of state, and instead we sat here waiting....and waiting.....and waiting..... and then at 8:23pm It updated back to delivery on MONDAY! I called customer service and was given a non-sense answer. UPS has really declined in reliability, lately and it's only getting worse."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very useful, app works well for tracking packages, which is all I use it for. Love the notifications, UPS My Choice is a good program, you can sign up in app."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, The one thing anyone gets this app for is to track a package. When it fails to do that the whole app is useless. My package was delivered 6 days ago but the app still says it's in transit. Uninstalling. Will never use the app or the service again.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app! I been using this app for about 4yrs now. Love the new feature follow my delivery. Like everything else in life there's a few glitches at times but overall great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Very easy to use if you have your tracking number! However, they use to show you exactly what area the UPS truck is in on MAPS(which was awesome, I loved it) but then they must have disabled that feature."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," It's great, definitely faster than having to go to the website all the time to check shipping status and tracking, especially if youre always shipping and receiving."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," There are so many things wrong with your sign up/sign in processes. I've entered my user id, password and email addresses about 6 different times in different screens and still can't access my ups"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is great it told me exactly when my package would arrive. Plus I had a second package due the next day but they notified me to let me know it would be delivered with the other. Very happy with this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very useful app. Once you are registered, you are done and you will receive all upto date notifications on the packages that would arrive and the ones you send. Options to hold your packages and for reschedules.."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," I have been signed up for MY Choice UPS and whenever I attempt to manage my deliveries, it continues to revert back to a sign-up page. This app is useless and I refuse to waste any more time on it! I would rate it - 10"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app for those that person perform daily shipments or receive orders via UPS. It allows you to keep track of deliveries to update your customers and keep track of expected daily deliveries. Great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," very happy with the app like being able to give additional info to drivers such as access code r leave at neighbors, just to mention 2 of several options. has left my life and home business with one less thing to deal with."

I've answered the security questions correctly it does nothing, I keep having to fill out the application over and over so I can't get an estimated time of arrival of my package. That was very frustrating"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Verry convenient. Don't need to remember or coppy tracking numbers, even with multiple orders from different venders I just open the app and it tells me what pakages i have and where they are. I love being able to e-sign so i dont have to listen for the truck."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This site just has pushed me around and won't let me get to signature or use the ups choice site because of some sign in error I can't fix. Used to be so easy to use. Not now. Instructions are slim to none leaving me hours lost sleep trying to figure out to no avail. Good luck everyone.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, My experience with this app has been good- no complaints. I appreciate getting told when I have packages that have been delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Timely, informative, just what you need to stay on top of your stuff."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is easy to use. I like knowing when my packages are being delivered so I can plan to be home.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Everyone needs this app it never has issues and tells you when your orders are showing up if it's been delivered where it's at everything you need.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is great with finding out when packages are coming. Also rescheduling deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Use this all the time, very accurate relative to delivery time. Like it a bunch!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Up is wonderfull update is always current and it tells me exactly when my package is going to arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. You always know where your package is and when its delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very resourceful app! No need to go through the UPS website.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love that I can get tracking notification. The app is very simple and easy to use.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very helpful information at no cost. Also enables various options to manage your expected delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," You can track packages, authorize drop on signature needed deliveries, set up pickup, very convenient."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app will show when your UPS deliveries are scheduled to occur. It also shows tracking info.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, It doesn't work any longer. Keeps telling me service unavailable. Sigh...
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use. When they say it will be delivered on this date,""IT'S THERE,OR EARLIER!!!"" GREAT SERVICE..."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works every time and easy to use for tracking and sending delivery instructions.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I am just starting with this new version of the app, so will better be able to score & give a clearer rating after I have used this new version for a while."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It's been very helpful while planning receipt of deliveries. I just wish it would show the location of the package car.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use if you have my choice through UPS you get much information and can track your package in app. The app gives you the choice to see delivery times window.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. My packages are left right where I ask and they even sent me a picture to show it was delivered!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works well and very helpful for knowing when to expect pkgs
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I like the app just wish I could give a little more details on where to leave my deliveries
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Load of tripe just a data gathering app doesn't tell you anything only that the parcel will be delivered by end of day what ever time that is. Not very useful at all. No tracking or estimated delivery time just a day. Don't bother.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Took me 20 minutes to find out (after having to create multiple logins) that I can't actually redirect my parcel. Totally useless, information skimming waste of time. Also gives me conflicting information about when my parcel is being delivered."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Easy to use and fairly accurate! I really like. It is helpful especially when you have a delivery that requires someone to sign. You can change the date and/or time so you will not miss the delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," this app does what you expect it to, you can manage your deliveries and be notified about incoming packages. I would like to see them make the app a little more responsive, as it feels a little android 5.0, but that's kinda nitpicky"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I'm a local traveling rep. It's important that I know when a delivery is coming to my home. Thanks to this app, I can fenagle my schedule to be able to get back home to receive the parcel, especially if a signature is required. The following of the driver's route is awesome!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love it. It's let me know every moves the packages makes, and it also let you know when, and the time your packages will arrive. It also let you know that your packages has been delivered."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Awesome app! I use it to track my packages and leave simple instructions for the driver if I'm going to be away from home. It's been very helpful and supportive with my deliveries. I'm very happy with this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, This is a good app but has one flaw. It is very hard to add your tracking number. You almost have to wait for ups to add but other than that I would recommend using the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, When I would try to login it would tell me to verify email first. So then I would go to my email and verify email listed. And still did the same thing over and over and over. So I finally just decided to delete the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I appreciate how accurately this app tracks packages and how quickly I'm notified when the package has been delivered. I recommend using it if you don't want your packages sitting on your step all day.
UPS Mobile,Business,2," It used to be a great app until the latest update. Now it just freezes when I try to get my tracking info. Uninstalled then reinstalled and still the same, it keeps freezing. Please fix"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, love being able to just click on the app and all your stuff is right there instead of opening my email. finding the email im looking for. open that then click on this and click on that. just awesome.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app! I love knowing when to expect packages & having the option to redirect them or change the delivery date. They keep you informed every step of the way. Love UPS app!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I find it so convenient as well as helpful to be able to check on the progression of my packages and to know when they will be delivered! This is a perfect tool to beat back the porch Pirates!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I rely on this app so much! It's so easy to navigate and if I need to schedule or reschedule a pick up or delivery, there's no hassle. Great app! Thank you UPS for making my life so much easier!🥰❤"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Utterly useless. Makes you sign up to see when your package will arrive - the only company to do so, then promptly sends you round in circles asking you to sign up again. Simply doesn't work, this isn't the 90s"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Found the app to be dependable. Realize that info is only as good as the person who inputs the data but so far that has been great. Like knowing the status of packages as it happens.
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I thought maybe this app would give a more detailed delivery time, other than 'anytime today', which frankly, compared to other courier companies (who provide you with texts and emails saying where their drivers are), is almost completely useless information."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," The app works great and the UPS drivers work really hard especially during the holidays, but I REALLY WISH they would not just leave the PKG out on the porch without ringing the doorbell!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It's slow to update. It's hard to set optional delivery instructions.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Lets you know where your package is located and when it was delivered. Updates if there is a schedule change. Great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the up to date info and tracking this app is amazing and easily navigatable!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very convenient for keeping track of packages and deliveries. Great app to have
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Tracking I love being able to track my packages to know not only the day they'll be delivered, but the approximate time as well."

UPS Mobile,Business,5," So easy to use, you know exactly when your package is being delivered I wish the FedEx app worked as good"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love being informed of a package Delivery...even more so you got to love the benefit of being able to track that package...5+ stars to UPS MOBILE APP. !!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very easy to use and allows one to stay up to date on shipment progress.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I have had this app for a couple of years, I always know when a package is coming. It's a awesome app. I love it."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Downloaded this application and it sucks!!!!! I get logged in or at least it says I am but won't let me go anywhere in their site!!!!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Good experience can change your delivery date if needed too, it just a good app..glad I have this app"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very reliable. Always updated accordingly.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the app! Very useful and very self explanatory

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I use the app two or three times a week.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to navigate and very useful app!
UPS Mobile,Business,3," First experience was bad but the next on point. This is great, would recommend. I don't expect perfection everytime. I order, i mean....I ORDER. This is good to have if YOU ORDER."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, One of the few apps that does what I need without a bunch of extra stuff. I love that miraculously the app picks up almost any UPS order without me having to track the order down; many times even before I hear from the merchant.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, works great and tracking is on point just wish was a little more detailed with times of packages bein dropped off so a person could properly schdule a time to be home to recieve there package if a signature was required so work and pakages where not missed between the 2 other than that this app is v...Full Reviewworks great and tracking is on point just wish was a little more detailed with times of packages bein dropped off so a person could properly schdule a time to be home to recieve there package if a signature was required so work and pakages where not missed between the 2 other than that this app is very helpful
UPS Mobile,Business,4," My directions have been followed about 30 times with this app, and 1 not having been followed. That's a good record. I am able to track, check, and control my deliveries."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Pretty cool, I get notifications about when my package will arrive. I can see where it came from and the stops it makes. I can pick a place at my home to have it placed. I recommend this app."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Waste of time. All the trouble of signing up for up to date alerts and you get no more info than you would just tracking online via website. Just seems like a way to get your email address amd send spam.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I frequently order online. This app not only let's me know when packages will be arriving but also let's me change the drop off point if I'm not going to be home. I can also ""nickname"" the arriving packages so I know at a glance what will be in the box. A great service, I love it!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love this app! I can keep track of all my Ups packages! Once you have an account, you don't have to manually add in your tracking numbers. It's great, especially for those of us who shop online a lot!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I don't use it often and only to track incoming packages. it seems to change a lot and my main use is to release the signature which can be difficult to get to somtimes,"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I can say that ups is not a bad way to go when receiving packages from online orders. it may take a while if your not paying more for fast shipping or ups ground but overall its great, I haven't had one package that was damaged and that's what keeps me coming back! thanks UPS"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love all the control over my in coming packages! The app is easy to use, and there are a lot of options for managing shipments, and getting notifications. This is a great app!"

I really wish more companies would ship with USPS."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It keeps displaying at 1st and old address that I haven't lived at for 5 years. It would be nice if that would fall off because I wonder if the system at some point is going to accidentally default back to that.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love to be able to track packages from various merchants all in one place!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Knew where my package was and ready to receive... Simple to use and provide preferences for delivery, monitor progress and delays if any"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love the app, as it helps me keep track of my deliveries."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Being able to see when something is sent is good. Only thing is it wasn't placed in the right place
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent communication tool, so I know when to expect my packages."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app make managing and tracking my packages so easy. I am very happy it exists.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, People that are having issues probably have issues with every app they use .it does what it needs to do
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the tracking updates and the notifications. Great APP.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works and linked to emailed tracking nu.bers which expedites updates!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Like knowing when things will get here. Very user friendly!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, App works awesome.Was easy to navigate threw and very helpful.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app because it tells you where your package is and it gives you an estimated time of arrival on the day that your package is supposed to be delivered it's amazing And you can keep track of every single package through UPS right here on this app😁😁😁😁😁😁
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Absolutely appalled. Only AFTER the lengthy sign-up proccess did I have the option to check if the tracking service was even avaliable in my area and turns out it isn't. So now they have my personal data for nothing. Waste of time and pointless invasion of privacy.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Great app. I thought I would have to enter tracking numbers for my 2 package manually, but as soon as I opened the app all the information was right there."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Jumped through all the hoops to register, only to find it only allows you to have a parcel redirected to one of their access points. Disappointing and a total waste of time installing. Other company's app allow redirection to a local address."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Good solid app. I would like them to improve driver instruction text a little more than this door and PIN. Drivers for some reason don't ring doorbells or read notes then leave doortags that I must not be home.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app and the information it provides; however, I get two exact emails every day to my same address...Only one is sufficient as they are identical. Thank you."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," For some reason they limit the amount of characters in an email for login, and my ups email has more characters than is allowed, so the app is completely worthless. Bizarre."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," So easy to manage any delivery coming to your house! Copy and paste your tracking number into your clipboard, then paste it into the app, give it a nickname, and set up what alerts you want. SO SIMPLE!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The ability to track and manage packages with this app is excellent. I can see where the packages last location and can determine if I can still pick it up at a customer center.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, cannot get the app to work. reset pw several times and keeps saying I need to confirm with email that is sent but yet I am not getting the email. so it says request another but you can't and makes you go through everything again and again. frustrated!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Absolutely HORRIBLE! The login sucks ridiculously. programmer needs to be replaced. Take the app down until the wrinkles are ironed out. Don't waste your time on it.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," not thought through. Takes you through to sign up to do anything, but if you are already signed up it won't let you log in which means you are stuck doing anything. I always groan when somebody is sending me a parcel via ups"
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I think some lazy coding is present on this app when it shouldnt be.

I have a package coming today and the web shows in transit as the driver hasnt left yet, but the app says its out for delivery. Seems like the app just says that because its scheduled for today. The app also shows the note from yesterday morning when the package was picked up, but not the 3 statuses that have happened since. Only benefit is i can see tracking numbers way faster than via email to know somethings coming."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Its fantastic... I have advance notice of my packages and where they're coming from. I can make delivery changes and I can see their progress. I love it when my senders use UPS! They make other shippers look 50 years behind when it comes to logistics.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," An excellent way to keep up with ALL your packages, going and coming!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Worst app ever keeps glitching wont let you edit and put the right address keeps saying not found and keep making you sign up again with you are already sign in
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is easy to navigate find what we need as soon possible.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the app. It informs me when my packages are on the way & when its been delivered!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Easy to install easy to use until you have an exception.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the push notifications and can teach without having to remember tracking numbers!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Never have had an issue , the app is well structured work very well.easy to use."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," In this day of 'porch pirates', so glad to have this available to track our packages. We really like using UPS!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, It's always someone else's problem. I've called 5 times telling them something is wrong and no one can help you have to wait we can't do anything.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Good for tracking when your packages are going to arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," For some reason I can't make an account, I've tried the desktop website, the mobile website and now the app (which just links to the mobile website). Please fix this 🙏"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Does what it is supposed to do. The app is well behaved. I like being able to nickname trackings. That makes it easier to monitor multiple shippings in progress.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love, love that it automatically sends notifications whenever my address is selected to receive a package. I also LOVE the real time tracking of a package on the truck to my home."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I really like this app. When I receive a tracking number from a retailer and I copy it, this app recognizes the number before I paste, and it asks if I want to use this new copied tracking number for my search 👍😀"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," They keep updating the Terms and Conditions agreement ! I usually know nothing about a package being delivered until AFTER it arrives. I then open up the app, and sure enough - it is waiting for me to click to agree, to their Terms and Conditions. I guess UPS values keeping their attorneys happy, ov...Full ReviewThey keep updating the Terms and Conditions agreement ! I usually know nothing about a package being delivered until AFTER it arrives. I then open up the app, and sure enough - it is waiting for me to click to agree, to their Terms and Conditions. I guess UPS values keeping their attorneys happy, over the public being able to use the app we pay $50 to use."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," App works well but it's slow to load, it does what it's supposed to tho so no complaints"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," very good app. I love the fact that I can copy a tracking number in my email, open the app and it will say we see you copied a tracking number would you like to track it now."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always get the most up-to-date information. I recommend this App for all to have a great experience with UPS
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Makes it so easy to track and control my package deliveries. Love the fact that I dont have to copy and paste tracking numbers any more, the UPS app does it automatically."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," excellent app! I always know when my packages are on their way, when to expect them and when, and if they have been delivered.. it's very user friendly and practical."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," My favorite feature is when I have a tracking number copied into the clipboard, then open the app, it will recognize the tracking number and ask if I want information on it."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," It's ok, though for the information it provides you might as well just use the website. Kind of slow too, and the UI is kind of confusing sometimes."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," I like the app but I continue to lose notifications for packages because every time the app upgrades, all notifications cease until I open and agree to the terms and conditions. Please either stop modifying the app or stop changing terms and conditions."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent app.Very accurate&up to date. Keeps me informed in""real""time as to where my packages are&when they'll be delivered.Then gives me the exact time& precise location of my delivery!EXCELLENT!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love this app, fedex and usps need to catch up. You can see exactly where the truck is on a map, very helpful if you don't want your package sitting outside your door."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," app is nice when it works, but regularly will drop all of my saved packages, display nothing, then when I try to reload them will say tracking information unavailable. I dont see the point in using it if it only works maybe 30% of the time."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Sometimes gotta click to bring keyboard up to select ""done"" in order to continue. Would be better if they had a continue button, but app is generally fast and reliable once you learn the quirk of this feature. Easy to understand interface otherwise."
UPS Mobile,Business,3, I always have issues when I click on tracking # when in a app where i purchased product that's being delivered. It doesn't show up in my ups app under my sign in
UPS Mobile,Business,1, No way to know what time package will arrive tried to enter password will not work app is nothing but a waste of time unless you're a rocket scientist
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Alerts me of my package coming without having to input tracking number on website. Works great.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Always on time, did leave a package uncovered one day when it was raining but I was home and went and got it immediately."
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Difficult. Gives error stating I already have ID tried to recover ID then tried to recover password. Sucks!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Gives you more details about your packages then just looking up a tracking # does. Makes it more convenient when you're expecting deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I use it a lot and love when it tells me I have a package coming that I didn't even know about
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Worst delivery service in the world! I had an order scheduled for today with UPS PREMIUM, next day UPS service. At 12.30h I went to check the tracking site and it was saying that the package couldn't be delivered, but I was home and nobody knocked...

At 12.30h I went to check the tracking site and it was saying that the package couldn't be delivered, but I was home and nobody knocked... Its the 3° time that I've ordered online using UPS services and 2/3 UPS failed to deliver it. The first time it happened the I gave them the benefit of doubt, but again its unacceptable. When I found the Infonotice, I gave UPS a call, although I was"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always reliable. And let's me know where my shipment is.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Useful app for tracking packages. Only issue is that it doesn't let you delete old addresses. Moved over 3 years ago but it still defaults to my old address.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This is a fine app and keeps up on tracking in real time. Love it. Very easy to work with and very user friendly. The app actually does all the work.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Really good App. Easy to use. i do a lot of shopping online and i love to be able to track my packages and this App helps me do just that. Thank You.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very handy app. Visibility into all shipments - coming and going. In today's world of online shopping this functionality is a must have.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Slow and no better than its online equivalent. Takes ages to retrieve any information. While UPS continues not to offer estimated 1 or 2 hour delivery windows like most of its competitors then the app has little additional benefit.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Really the only thing I don't like about it is that there isn't a dark mode any more. I'm really not into everything having a white background. Just give a choice, white or black background."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent app for fitting daily scheduling of deliveries. Able to set instructions for leaving packages, even sign ahead of time. Easy to use. Overall highly recommended."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I just started using this app and so far it is working very well. I evaluate this app on 3 criteria, ease of use, on point, and the ability to alter the outcome. It does all 3."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Generally useful, I always get the info I'm looking for regarding status of a shipped package. The navigation when tracking multiple packages is cumbersome. The PC based AP is easier to use"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Nice app. Tracks packages usually. At times they show a package arrived somewhere and then days later it updates to out for delivery. I suppose the app can only work on the data given.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy-to-use way to track my packages. I do miss the ""live tracking"" where I could see where the truck was located in my area to get a better idea of when my package would be delivered rather than just a 5 hour window that it now shows."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, it is a (little) difficult to navigate the application needs improvement for how to get a delivery person on the phone or online. not easily accessible very frustrating application to maneuver around...made me very upset!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," by far,this is the MOST DEPENDABLE APP IN ITS FIELD when it comes to everything from customer services to tracking.....its almost as if YOUR riding alone with the Driver...to be HONEST...UPS IS LEAPS & BOUNDS OVER ALL IN ITS FIELD..I LOVE IT.......Mr.Chester B. Jefferson Sr."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love the UPS Mobile app. I love being able to follow the truck and see when it is close to my house. We received a lot of packages, so it is very nice to be able to track the packages and actually follow the driver."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," When I click on Track, it will say I don't have a package on the way...even though I just saw it in route on the truck under Manage! Other than that i like the app!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," App is ok for the most part. Now actual delivery can be hit and miss, but most services are the same. Online UPS gives same info, but app is somewhat easier to use."
UPS Mobile,Business,3," App works OK when logged in. Problem is, when using a linked Google account to log in, it becomes logged out every time you close the app and you have to re-log in every time app is opened."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Sign in required constantly, screen after screen, again and again!!! The email address verification link is HIDDEN in the email as normal black text! So pissed off I cannot recommend this app at all!"
UPS Mobile,Business,2," very difficult to setup account. the AI just could NOT recognize an apartment number. after multiple attempts, it finally got it. I'm not impressed with this app at all."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I really like this app. The new Follow my shipment feature is a really nice addition. I also like that I can manage delivery and shipping instructions. Very well done.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," It is not possible to set the preference for UPS pickup point, after first delivery attempt. After selecting the pickup point, it tells me I am trying to leave the screen without saving my preference. Doesn't work like related 'skip my house and deliver directly to pickup point option'."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," App works good, for a while it showed a real time map, but not any more"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is easy to navigate through plus this app keep you updated on your deliveries very well.this app is worth having.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. you can do everything from changing the delivery option to shipping a package
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very happy with this app, extremely accurate. Highly recommend!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Up to date daily tracking. Very happy with all of UPS's services and communications!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I love how this AP dings to let me know I have a package coming. I order books in advance of publish and it's fun to know when it's been shipped and on way!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I always get my package on time unless there's a problem and they notify me and we go from there THANK YOU !
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I really like the notifications as well as real time tracking for certain shipping services!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very good at tracking. Only wish would incorporate sender info to help distinguish pkgs.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Useless app that is difficult and inconvenient to use. Representative of the company's customer service as a whole. Not recommended.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This is a great tool for checking the delivery times of packages. It is very easy to use.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. It is so easy to track my packages every step of the way.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works as described. Can follow packages been set so there not missed.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I do a lot of desktop computer work. I like the UPS app because it is not always convenient to get to my computer to check the status of my inbound packages. This app lets me check status on my phone wherever I am
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App! I use it all the time to track my packages and know if my item has been delivered. So far Ive never had s problem with it.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I'm really enjoying the app you get text notifications and you also have the ability to send updates to the driver like where you want your package dropped I would like additional options like behind screen door etc.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is very accurate & it's so mych better to interact w/ UPS directly when expecting a delivery as opposed to a vendor. it makes receiving packages alot easier when U know exactly when to expect it. Just try it if U get deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy, simple installation, app does most of the heavy lifting, shows exactly what criteria are required at each step. Nice."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app. Give's you all the information you need to assist in a safe and secure package delivery. If you have ever had a delivery from UPS or may in the future, you should have this app."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, UPS is the way to go and knowing about your deliveries is very helpful to prevent lost packages. I don't often see it but showing a photo of the delivered package is fantastic! It only appears when sending to GA so hope this expands.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use. Allows tracking of delivery vehicle so that I can be home, if I want, when it arrives. Drivers are careful in following any directions I add on the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Convenient control of deliveries or shipments. Easy to understand and navigate, set preferences, and be kept up to date about all shipments coming or going."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," when away, the ability to control your package(s) en route to its destination is cool, would have given it 5 stars, some changes cant be done unless an delivery attempt is made. still a good app tho."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, this is a very convenient app and lets me know location of my shipments and almost the exact time that it's going to arrive. I am very pleased with the app and makes it so much easier.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app to keep track of all my incoming packages being delivered . Also to track them from shipper to being delivered to me.I always know where they are and when they will be delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Hey your web site's Schedule a Pickup has been down for more than 48 hours now, beginning Sept 22 or earlier. Would it be faster for you to add that missing feature to this app than restart/fix what's broken over there?"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Definitely room for improvement within the app itself. Still beats FedEx hands down. The two are going in total opposite directions. My choice is UPS for quality of services and management skills.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easier to use than the website. starts and retrieves data quickly.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to keep up with pkgs, great way to plan your day if you worry about pkgs being left unattended."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very on point with delivery time. Very pleased with the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. Very timely and accurate on package delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I really like the app, but my package the box was all busted up when I received it. I did not appreciate that at all."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great heads up information about the status of deliveries, so that one may adjust the delivery schedule."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Helpful n convenient
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Definitely would recommend these app for anyone who does online shopping especially from Amazon.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This is a great app. Love the fact that it notifies me any time that package is coming to my address. Even if Im not expecting a package. Love it. 😍
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Comes in handy, let's you know approximately when to expect deliveries. Normally gives you a 2-4 hour window and updates through the day. Has more features I haven't used yet."

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very helpful, so you know when you will receive your medicine. Especially when you are a diabetic like me and your medications are life supporting."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Good app. For some reason, it still has my previous address in addition to my current one. Not sure how to delete it. But overall, very helpful!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app keeping me up to date on my shipments. I have never never met a rude UPS driver!! Great company. I especially thank you for your deliveries, even in this harsh winter weather. Thanks for an app that works!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use with helpful, almost realtime tracking status info. The app detects if you have a tracking number copied into memory, which saves some time."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love being able to see where the delivery driver is on a map so I can gauge when to provide a signature
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very intuitive and very easy to use. Navigation is a breeze. Tracking shipments with customized notifications is a virtue. Thanks UPS!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is awesome. I get an email each time a package is shipped with the day it will be delivered. Also, sending a package is easy and they will pick it up. Thanks UPS"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app is quite good. It's better than the last delivery I had yesterday. I guess he was just filling in for my regular carrier. Luckily nothing was damaged. He didn't even see me standing in the doorway. Anyways I am happy with the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,3," Ok, but could be better. I shouldn't have to add tracking numbers. FedEx and USPS apps automatically include packages coming to me. But now, the app isn't responding even after update."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," why is your app impossible to use. Same as your website. ""Log in"" ""incorrect email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"" ""forgot password"" ""invalid email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"". What the F***"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very useful tool. Lets you reroute or upgrade your package among other things. What's not to love? Has ads, but not in your face.."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I appreciate that you don't have to copy and paste the tracking number. Everything is just a click away. I just wish there was a more accurate delivery time.

I don't always have the time to wait around for the delivery and my neighborhood is notorious for five fingered discounts (theft)but overall this is a great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,3, I like the app I find it convenient for tracking packages. I dislike the fact I cant delete an address I no longer live at. Plus it keeps defaulting to it everytime I open the app. Very Annoying.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Doesn't keep you logged in. Everytime I go to check my packages or to track a package I have to log into my account, and it is a pain to do that everytime I want to go on the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Fantastic, plenty of details in the tracking selection. Easy to use app, once on a selection the flow is pretty swift, just sometimes there are delays before it initiates the task."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app has proven invaluable to me on numerous occasions as I work and am never home to receive packages. This app let's you keep track of your packages and make arrangements to get your stuff.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Needs the ability to store multiple addresses. I still do receive packages at other locations, but it's nice to be able to Store them- unless I'm missing domething."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, A nice idea only it would not accept my tracking number (It worked with my PC).
UPS Mobile,Business,1, UPS app doesn't fully complete sign-in process if you attempt to log in via a Google account.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," It is hard to tell which package it is or where it is from, from what we get to read on the label.

Sometimes the name is something we have never heard of, so it still doesn't help us. I wish there was a place where we have the tracking number and we could see what is in this package , especially when we have so many boxes from the same place. I would like to tap the tracking number and be able to see what is in the order I are receiving."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I'm able to see when and if my package has been delivered. I'm able to select where I want the package left.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great app but just a bit slow. Very convenient.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Just started using the app, very impressed by it's updating my package progress, I hlad I did this now I really know where my package is and when I will get it"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app has never let me down, it is a well built and maintained hub of information."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Live this App. So convenient and easy to use. Keeps me well informed of the status of my deliveries!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It's great to just open up the app and you tracking just appears.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app to secure details on incoming shipments with options to delivery in the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great, timely information. A great tool to prevent front porch theft by forward planning."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use app.sends updates to your email,so you know where your package is."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love real time map

UPS Mobile,Business,5," AWESOME APP! As an Avon Representative, I have many packages sent by UPS. I can always trust the info on this app as to when my packages will arrive -always true and up to date info. I love this app!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I cannot log in with my already established log in as it does not provide enough character spaces. Frustrating as I only needed one more character.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, I'm logged in but I can't even manage my packages since it will only give me a sign up option and not a sign in for that part. Doesn't help me much anymore if I can't do anything besides see that something is coming.
UPS Mobile,Business,2," the app doesn't keep me signed in. it signs me out and sometimes won't even let me sign in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to see if that would help, but it doesn't. please fix this!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I can't log in anymore because the username field is limited to 26 characters on Android (my email address has 28). Please fix.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app. When I order something that is shipped via UPS, I automatically get a notification letting me know when my order ships and the expected delivery date."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I use the app consistently when I have online orders and it is always precise. I am always aware of where my package is and when I can expect delivery. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app! I've always had a hard time tracking my orders until now. If you need anything tracked that is shipping with UPS, download the UPS Mobile App NOW!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is great. You are able to track your package almost real-time. My package was on the porch, I received an update, and the driver was getting in the truck. Excellent!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Why should I have to sign and fill so many pages to simply track my parcel! It would have been quicker to drive to Glasgow and pick the package up in person!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, So very easy to understand and use . It is convienant . I enjoy the service it provides and it's accuracy. I wish every app was this well done .
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. I can see where my package is and leave delivery instructions if I'm not home. The information is almost always 100% accurate.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great! Easy to use. As someone who does a lot of shopping online, it helps having the app to keep track of packages instead of using the browser everytime."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," App works very well 99% of the time. Easy to upgrade deliveries. Regularly upgrade SurePost method... It's cheaper to upgrade the SurePost ""free delivery"" from merchant than to pay merchant more for UPS ground delivery."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app. This is better than getting an email notification about package delivery as I can get immediate notifications by the app instead of having to check email!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, A very good and smart app. I like the way when I have a package coming I just open the app and the tracking number is already there.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I desperately needed to have a package held at UPS until I get back from vacation and this app made it so simple. It took me a few minutes of my time and I was all set up for pick up when I get home at my closest UPS Store.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Just downloaded it. Appears to be very user friendly if I could do it and has some exciting features that I'm really looking forward to like customizing my deliver if needed. Should make life so much easier.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Even automatically detects new shipments to my address and tracks them with 1 tap to confirm! MUCH BETTER THAN THE WEBSITE!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works as advertised. I use it to easily track my UPS packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The ease and being as precise, is well worth having the UPS Mobile App on your phone."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app let's me know when my package is come and when it was delivered. It is very helpful.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Wonderful with delivery on time and keeping green notified if there is something wrong and they do everything they can to remedy all situations
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app. I can keep track of all my packages in one place.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I only use it to track packages but I have had no issues.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Doesn't update often enough, dont always tell where our packages are at, sometimes don't know at all"
UPS Mobile,Business,3," Great for tracking packages. But I don't think they read where to put my package. I have rear door for my preference, but it almost always gets left on my front porch. I don't understand this. Why have an option if it gets ignored."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Excellent, only one thing Please ring bell or knock hard when package/s arrive! Thank you."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use, easy to follow pkg from sale to stops along the way"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It's easy to use and it gives you updates and delivery notifications
UPS Mobile,Business,5, 💙 this! I know when my packages are coming and the reminders by email and text really help me out. I like the follow your package feature with the map also. Highly reccomend!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, The app never recognizes when I'm connected to wifi and won't work until I disconnect and use my data. Seriously this app sucks. I never have wifi problems with any other app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," *update: Love having this app/service. It helps when I know approximately what time my package is coming, in case I need to run errands at last minute. Haven't used it much but so far it is great."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Website is not very mobile friendly both in layout and updates to phone number information fields. This app seems to be the best way to get mobile updates.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, They are lucky they got one star. The Worst app I have had to use in ages. Extremely counter-intuitive. Extremely hard to sign up and understand. Will not use it again.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love being text letting me know an estimated time my package will be delivered or has been delivered. Now it shows you on a map about where the truck is in respect to my home. Love this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, useful app...I like knowing when my packages are going to be delivered. Sends me text to keep me up to date. its definitely worth it if you use Amazon or other ecommerce deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Total garbage you cannot even enter your address without telling you everything is wrong. Once you spent 3 hours registering and close the app once you open it again it ask you to register again. I want my 3 hours back, what a disappointment"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," very happy. when a shipment to my address is recognized, the app automatically notifies me. no need to enter tracking number. very real time updates. delivery notifications within minutes."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It is really handy locating and keeping track of my packages. with so much crime and theft it's helpful knowing when my package is due to arrive so I can plan on either being home or make different arrangements!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use app, clear and simple functionality. Nothing fancy but gets it right with everything you need to know about your parcel."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, App is very convenient only thing I don't like is when you have to sometime put in your password information after your phone sometimes updates but it is very good to have all the features work from my experience
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Keeps logging me out, and when i drop things off using my email, the package never shows up in the app"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Awful...to say that this app is a heaping pile of steamy garbage would be generous. Horrible functionality and UI. UPS makes simple things asinineically hard with this app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," very poor with delivery, app and online tracking, nothing works! still not receive package and tracking doesnt work!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love ups even have a few shares. Always on time! The app makes shipping and tracking so easy.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Got a Notice on the way & approximate Delivery time, and here. Great Feature."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. I alway know where my packages are and when to expect them delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Easy to understand. Great app with many uses and features.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app works great except for I usually get noticed that my orders have been delivered a couple hours after I receive them. 🤣
UPS Mobile,Business,1, The app doesn't tell me when packages have been delivered even though I set it to text me at all stages of delivery. And you're supposed to be able to redirect a package but there's no obvious way to do it. I don't know what its good for.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Not sure what the questions have in relevance to the app, but found the app relatively easy to use. I like the app and will use it every time I use UPS for my package needs. Recommend it!!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Not bad at all. Can do most of the things I would like. If possible a chat function would be great. Also, if there was a way to re-route packages that would also be beneficial."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, love the app. it's very convenient to know where your packages are and when they will be delivered with the enabled notifications.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very helpful in tracking packages and changing delivery instructions.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This helps manage my purchases for delivery. Constantly upgrading their app for ease of use.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Helpful, nice service for free. Could use more detailed instructions to make use of all that's available. Overall helpful tool for your customers. Thanks Walt"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App! I know when my packs are on their way at all the times. It also tell me when i missed them where i can pick them at the nearest UPS Store. Love it! Thanks UPS!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," UPS !! So youre not forced to use the horribly ran US postal service. Never have had an issue with UPS. The app is easy to use. I love the"" follow your package "" feature. Actually follows the trucks progress of your delivery. A++++"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Tried to make a free account, but the app wouldn't work without a promo code. I don't have one or know why a ""free"" app requires one, waste of time!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, i have used this app to track shipments that i have needed to get to a destination within a certain time frame. i have also used it to track packages i was expecting so i knew to look for them when they arrived.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app, I don't know why but I love knowing where my package is and this does the trick. The vaca holds and leaving notes for your driver make things easy too."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Don't waste your time. Absolute rubbish. Continually asking for acknowledgement of email address, sends you to Web page, doesn't see a scheduled delivery despite inputting the scheduled package number. Its not an app. Uninstalled it."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, S*** app and sign up process to try and change delivery options. Created an account but keeps looping with a signing up process for ups mychoice when I've already done it!! Really infuriating as it doesnt seem to linknthe mychoice sign uo with the account created???????
UPS Mobile,Business,1," I just used the app backed out, went back in and get locked out. Pain in the ass, was still connected and now none my passwords will work. When i get my package ill never use the app again, nor will it be recommended to abyone i know."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Tracking is not available. I spent my whole morning waiting for the UPS truck because it kept saying the driver will arrive soon. That was 3 hours ago. Have to change my schedule just to wait for my package because it needed my signature. App not use full at all.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Asking me to sign up to ups my choice when I already am. I seem to be in an eternal loop where I sign in, am then asked to sign up, I put my details in and it tells me I'm already signed up. Can't proceed beyond this point at the moment."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It works but could use some more choices like for multiple orders.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, So helpful in my line of work. I receive so much that is needed for execution on a daily basis. Being able to have an accurate and dependable source for scheduling when I need to keep up with my deliveries!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is amazing,leaves no questions about where when who and how your delivery is made, justamazing"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Really good. A couple more details would make it perfect
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent app with complete tracking updates and delivery truck route maps.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's a good app.It has many options for managing the delivery of packages.Thank you
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Can easily track package and what I really like is the live follow my package feed on delivery day so you can follow its location
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I can't even install the app. It just keeps waiting for download which has now taken over 40 minutes. This is the 4th time I've tried to install the app with the same results. What a waste of time. Maybe you should hire some Americans to write your software.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love the ability to change my delivery date, address or whatever I need to change and also to be able to see any updates/changes to my deliveries. Great app, Bo ads either"
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Don't know what happened. Since latest update app wants me to log in, but WILL NOT do anything when I click the login button after entering login info. It used to be a very useful app. Now it is useless junk"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love this app amd the fact that not only does it send push notifications but it also sends text alerts. I can't help but to visit repeatedly though.. The delivery guy is really cool. Thanks Rockledge, Fl UPS"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love being able to track my orders, it shows where the truck is and how many stops it has before reaching you. It's cool!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I use it all the time to check the status of my shipments and receive updates on the progress and delivery date.....its a great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love it . I work full time and now I do not have to worry if my package is getting delivered because I am not home in other words I do not have to worry about missing my package so I think this app is wonderful
UPS Mobile,Business,5," What a pleasure to track items in transit and adjust delivery details, if needed. Easy to use and very helpful."

The app will still reads package delivered as if its been delivered but it's taken to my Local USPS & worry it's stolen Ppl.in my bldg complains of this alot PLEASE change this Policy That's why 4 stars
UPS Mobile,Business,2," It's craptastic! stuck in the loop of signing up for My Choice to do anything, but when I try to manage my shipment it tells me to sign up for My Choice. Uninstall time."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Basically excellent service. The app can get confusing at times. Cannot always get tracking data.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Although it can be difficult @ times, it's better than most apps I've used. This is from a very nontechnical perspective."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," you don't need to access my contacts for logging in with Google if i deny that permission i can't log in. on your mobile website, i log in with Google but when i try to get updates it tells me to sign up...while I'm logged in."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This App is very helpful with notifying me of any of my packages being shipped via UPS. It also shows the current location as well as constant updates on Delivery Date Changes.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Seems to work as expected. For packages that require a signature, the ""delivery window"" alert is great."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great experience with this app. Keeps you posted on everywhere your package is and whenever it leaves or arrives at other areas or cities. Very user- fliendly and accurate.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Convenient and accurate. I also like the estimated time of delivery and maping as well. I highly recommend this app. (:
UPS Mobile,Business,2," The app is fine however, I continue to have an ongoing problem with drivers not following the simple instructions where to leave packages!!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I found this app to be very helpful and I really appreciate the level of professionalism and customer support. The information regarding my shipment is always updated with the estimated date and time of delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Great app, useful, helpful. I always deduct a star from apps that ask for ratings. I prefer to rate after some experience using it."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," love being able to easily track my packages! Also, the ability to get emails about my packages with SurePost is awesome! I highly recommend this app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love being able open the app and check the status of my packages right at my fingertips!! The app works perfectly every time!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, this is a Excellent app for those who are new fill out the ups form then you can tell the driver were you want your packages or leave them with your next door neighbor when you are not at home. or the post office.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very helpful to know when to expect my package(s). The app is always accurate and the optional updates by text is a great feature!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Essential I know when delivery will take place. Great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, A much needed app to keep us informed on our UPS deliveries - hard to live without it!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, New to it so learning more each time. Like the timing of info!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Outstanding! Notifications of upcoming deliveries, delivered packages, tracking, etc. UPS is the carrier to beat. American ingenuity, never ending drive for excellence and forward looking strategy."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is easy to use and you can track your packages and set up a time and place for them to be delivered if you're not home.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Helps keep track of all my UPS packages, rather than going from email to email for different tracking numbers"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very easy to keep track of my orders. Great easy app.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, The company and the app are useless both. You actually can't track anything after it's out for the first delivery. Customer service lied to me two times and I was sitting 10 hours at home waiting for nothing. No compensation offered so far. Disgusting.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Works very well for knowing where your package is.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Really nice to be notified of when my packages will arrive.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like it because it is good service
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Useless app. I received 8 emails in less than 12 hours to sign for a package and the app would make me enter all my info but wouldn't let me sign for the package. 1/10 don't recommend.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Personally I consider this app a must! The delivery schedule updates have been accurate to the minute. I recommend this app to every 1.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's a great app to keep up with shipments quickly without having to dig for the info. It's also good for quick options on delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love the app. I can change my day or and location anytime. This app makes it so easy for me to be in control of how and when I get my packages.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Much better than logging in online to track multiple packages. This app shows all expected UPS pkgs chronologically by their delivery date...& its super fast. Love it!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, great app. only complaint is I wish I could leave a message for Driver!. Other than that great app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, amazing! love the detailed view of your delivery! my parents sent the kiddos some gifts and because i was registered with UPS I got an update before i even knew they were mailing a package! i love it!
UPS Mobile,Business,4," On the email notification, I wish the letters and numbers could be a little larger to read at a quick glance with out having to zoom in. All in all it's a good APP."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," At first you feel assured that your package will be delivered within the time frame where you can monitor the location of the truck but by the end of the time frame the map suddenly disappear and the status of your package is changed from ""out for delivery"" to ""in transit"".

When you call customer service you are told to wait by the end of the day. This happened several times already. The mode of shipping is UPS Next Day Air. Enough! This time I will urge the shipper to use FedEx."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It does everything I need it to do. I makes tracking my packages easy and convenient. Remembering my tracking number is a huge plus.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, love this app. I was able to know when my pkg wad going to be delivered.It helped me track a package yesterday. Saw carrier misdeliver my pkg to neighbors house. I did ask neighbor for my package when she returned home. Her kids did open it. but fid get my stuff.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," great service with this app, always gives me updates on my deliveries so I know exactly when they arrive. Also can click on the tracking # any time I want to check on them also."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Excellent app! I had to re-deliver a package that I did not pick up on time. It tracked the package all the way to the day it came to my place! Cheers!
UPS Mobile,Business,2, ask you to re-regiater for ups my choice to get features but when you do says that there is an account already existing but offers no way to a solution to solve the issue. Tracking has very little info.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, i love this app! mainly use it for things being delivered to me it lets me know very accurately when they will be delivered. also love that i can have something delivered to a neighbor if i won't be home!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This app SUCKS! I signed up so I could track my packages and it keeps asking me to sign up. useless in my opinion. why have an app that doesn't do anything different then using Google to see my packages? I've uninstalled it 😡
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I really like being able to track my packages no matter where I am. You can also schedule a pickup if you're shipping a package or packages. The UPS app makes it super convenient.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, get notifiedthe dsy before package is delivered. estimated time of arrival. then i get a delivery has been made . love the app couldn't be more simple. easy to sign up for. Go ahead and try if you haven't already....

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app. User interface is easy to understand and use. Very helpful to track and reschedule my packages
UPS Mobile,Business,1," GARBAGE! forced me to make an account, and the prompted me to sign up for an account every time I tried to do something.... while I was already logged in. what a joke."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," i am always informed of the status of my deliveries & given a date & approx time as well. Then, a delivery confirmation is given. Very easy to look up tracking info as well!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Accurate and easy to use. Love the follow my package feature, shows you where on the road the truck with your package is located."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Slow, unreliable, crashes often when it doesn't freeze. This app is so bad I am dissapointed the Play store doesn't offer the possibility for negative star ratings."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," easy to use, wish it had a notification or alert to let you know that your package has arrived. But otherwise I really like it"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like that this app tells me the exact day my packages will arrive. It's also very convenient because I can choose to change the shipping address if I'm not home to receive them!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This app is great for Tracking and Managing your packages, and it's great for getting estimates if you plan on shipping a package."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app! I never had to worry about not getting my packages when I know that their on the way to me. They even alert you when the delivery time is changed or rescheduled.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Can always keep track of shipping process, leave delivery instructions, & choose other options like delayed delivery in case i may not be home on expected delivery date.This is a app no one should be with out, 5 stars UPS !!! Keep up the good work!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The time frame window that was provided was very helpful. Made sure someone was here to accept. The window saves alot of stress for both your customer service staff and customer looking for items out for delivery
UPS Mobile,Business,2, very clumsy interface. keeps asking you to login in and redirects you to there web page .no live updates no estimated delivery window.needs work .dpd have a much better app ups take note.
UPS Mobile,Business,3," Tracks the package, and works great when there are no delivery issues. Has no ability to report failures or to give any type of feedback."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Very dependable, keeps up-to-date on changes, describes who, what and when. I trust using this easy app. It's great!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like being able to check on shipments and when they will be or have been delivered. It allows me to schedule my time so that I can be there to accept delivery. I can even reschedule it or have it left at a neighbor's house. I love it!

Its sending me round in circles and keeps telling me to sign up for UPS My Choice despite the fact Im already logged in. It keeps telling me Im already signed up at this address! This is really irritating as I need to change a delivery option for a parcel arriving tomorrow.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The ability to track your package on the day of delivery is awesome!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, App is worthless to me. You basically only can track a package. I rather delete and just website if I wanna track a package. You can't even change delivery address before the item is out for delivery.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," UPS Mobile app works as it should, I'm an occasional user and happy to have the app."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love tha fact that it detects copied tracking numbers in your clipboard.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Usually get packages as instructed. Occasionally, a substitute driver fails to leave the packages and has to bring them back later!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, They do a great job!

UPS Mobile,Business,5," easy to use, I love to get the push notifications that tells me my package is coming. Nice tool to track your packages."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, An app I've had no issues with. I love the delivery alerts as it allows you to know exactly when something was delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, The app is great. i can see more in the appthan the text message link. just wish it had that little buble notification that appears on the app when you have shipments coming.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Welcome to and endless cycle of you must verify your email via the message we never send. Shame appears to have potential if the verification processes weren't so broken.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Really nice app, now that you can track your delivery on a map, and get a notification when delivery is getting close."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app 👍. Get notifications and know when you're package is coming. You can have them leave it with a neighbor or whatever.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, The tutorial video is cute and delivery is changed with a couple of unseen screen touches. It doesn't work at all that way.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love the convenience of this app. It makes it so easy to track and manage your packages plus it's to the minute notification of a package being delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Really enjoy being notified of what's coming in my mailbox each day. Also,when I'm to expect package delivery. This app is very convenient for me."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," Says I'm already a member when I try to make an account for the delivery estimate feature, but it doesn't have the option to log in instead of making an entirely new account. I used the same address, but now it says I have no scheduled deliveries when I have two active ones."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app it is very helpful I always know when my package is coming thank you UPS.

UPS Mobile,Business,1," This is a joke. In good company you don't have to make an account to change date of delivery... App work really bad, page too. I will never use it again."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, It fine but sometimes it's not updated so I have no clue where my package is.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app, great service. Thank you so much!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Really useful app however one suggestion would be to add a delete package option from the MANAGE section. Sort of annoying seeing something delivered still there clogging the line.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I've used this app all the time and I like that I can give my delivery a ""name"" so I can remember where it's coming from. I also like that I can add drivers instructions as well."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is awesome. Extremely easy to use and navigate. No need to be super tech savvy to use. This is 1 app which is a pleasure to use.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Works for what I need it to and keeps me up-to-date with my package. Really straight forward and I haven't seen any ads which is a plus

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Its a great app. i love keeping up with my purchases. Ups is on time too. I applaud the drivers for their hard work. Thank u
UPS Mobile,Business,5," generally great. If a package is scheduled while you are away and you need to have it delivered several days later because of a trip or delivered to a neighbor, you can do that. It has worked every time."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's a very convenient app to receive shipment / information. Many other options available. Great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This app doesn't work. I am scheduled to receive a package today so I downloaded this app to make tracking easier.

The app says that I do not have any packages scheduled for delivery today. ? But the UPS website tracking says my package is out for delivery & I will receive it today. So I'm deleting this app since it is useless.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Does not work! All it does is go in a circle and tell me to sign up when I'm already signed up. I've uninstalled, reinstalled but nothing works. Totally useless."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I love this app, especially the ability to sign in advance online for packages that I won't be home to sign for. It makes my life so much easier."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The UPS app is very user friendly! Easy to track your packages. Easy to manage all your packages all your packages going thru UPS! And, all thru your phone!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5," gives alot of necessary information, great format! easy to use. I wish I'd been using it sooner, due to shopping alot online."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," The worst. It won't let me sign in or access, only to sign up. then, when I try to sign up, it tells me I already have an account I can do NOTHING on this app. If I try to use it in internet browser, it just spins. UPS stinks."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I use this for my business. it is great to know exactly when my orders are going to be delivered so I can let my customers know ahead of time, so they can get excited about their orders coming in!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Wow! This app was very easy and so convenient to use. I did not have to call and waste my time on an robotic phone tree. Great app!
UPS Mobile,Business,3, must be a lot of things this app has to sort through... because it is very slow whenever it opens..... giving you opened it just a minute ago then closed it. what's up with that?
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Much easier and faster to use than the website for tracking packages. Great app, really like it!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I have only used this app once thus far keeping track of a live turtle I ordered online. its a great feeling to beable to use this ups app and know exactly where my package is and the moment its delivered 😊
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app works well for me. It gives me some sense of security in knowing when packages are going to be delivered and I'm able to have someone available to bring them in upon arrival.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," The user interface is a little clunky, but the app is useful for tracking shipments and the push notifications are handy."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," I was unable to register on UPS as the app wouldn't accept any user ID I chose. Gave up after about 10 goes, so it's obviously buggy so not worth bothering with. I got a rough idea when my item is coming - but I had that anyway via email!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Really like that the app notifies me and let me know when or if the packages need a signature or not and most importantly when the package will be delivered. Thank you and have a great day!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It works and l have an option to tell them where to leave the items which is nice especially if you have broken your ankle. Definitely a must.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Easy to use, and keeps on top of delivery dates"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This is the most convenient app ever, if I'm not home, the truck tracker allows me to get an estimated time of when my delivery will be here..by far the best way to prevent loss or theft"
UPS Mobile,Business,4, This app does a very good job of informing you when something is on its way to be delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Im missing a pkg that said it was delivered and I'm not sure what is going on with my situation. I haven't had this happen before with UPS so its probably lost somewhere. Its being handled so i have no worries. UPS has always been good to me :)

UPS Mobile,Business,1, Keeps asking me to sign up even though I have. No detailed tracking available. Uninstalling
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always pretty accurate on package arrival time. Easy to use
UPS Mobile,Business,4, very quick and very good.. need to work on knocking on doors more often and making sure residents get their packages and not dropped off somewhere else.. if experienced this a few times but other than that extent work from UPS. and their drivers/delivery drivers

The only info I get is from last Friday when it was first shipped. So I guess my package is just sitting in a warehouse in Washington state. Don't bother with this app. It's a waste of time."

UPS Mobile,Business,1," very confusing app. all i want is to change my delivery date. the app requires you to sign in, and fill in more forms for UPS choice, and there will be log in clash or detail clash etc. so frustrating!!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I like the app, but for what you pay to upgrade your account you would expect more than just 2 confirmed deliveries and 2 upgrades from sure post to ground every year"
UPS Mobile,Business,2," This app sucks! I am already signed up for UPS My Choice and the app keeps sending me back to sign up again, only to then tell me that I'm already signed up! Whack app!!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I can see my package every step of the way. I can change delivery, I can sign for my package in advance. This app is great!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, By using the app I am able to actually see where the truck is and it lets you know when the driver is close to my home and eventually when he is at my home. I think it's so neat to watch the little truck and exactly where he is.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is the best..always know when I will get my pkgs...if u get a chance thank the delivery driver ..they deserve a smile n a thank you!!
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Can never delete an old deliveryaddress. Always says temp out of service .

With this app I am able to keep up with what is going on with my shipments and I am now able to track my orders and I am getting everything I order on time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I find this app to very useful. Let's you know ahead of time when to expect your package, where package was left, after delivery , let's you know what time."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great App!!! The only negative is there is a charge for several of the services that should be free!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Only had one problem with one package that went to the storage locker and never got no alert that it was there.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, It's so confusing to reset and confirm your email. The link it sends you to confirm the change of password doesn't even allow you to confirm anything

UPS Mobile,Business,2," Had to modify my review from Love It to Mediocre. Suddenly the Follow My Delivery map is ""no longer available"" without any explanation. Is this feature no longer available? Again, no explanation. Very unhappy about this.🙁"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Does not allow logging in with Google credentials without giving app access to phone contacts. With the awful experience I've had with UPS I denied thr access and removed the app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Able to track pkgs and easily reroute to UPS access point. Able to set up text updates. Faster and easier than a phone call.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is great for managing deliveries. I can determine when I need to be home for more expensive deliveries and get updated information about packages headed my way.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like that it automatically detects the tracking number in my clipboard. That speeds things up.

UPS Mobile,Business,4," Almost time the app works properly. Once or twice it has shut down, therefore the 4 star rating, not 5 star."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Would like to be able to describe a particular place about where to put a package, et al a swing or chair, etc. Other than that, great app!!"
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Worst tracking app I've ever come across. It Doesn't understand how to login. Why you need to register just to get parcel info I don't know. Also waiving all your rights data wise just to get notifications is a disgusting part of your T&Cs and is illegal in the UK
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great app! It lets u know when your packages are shipped, u can track them and it will also let u know an estimated delivery date! It will also let u upgrade your delivery! I recommend downloading this app!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is great. It notifies me about the status of my shipments as well as giving me the option to make changes to delivery details and instructions.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Why can't the app give you a time slot like DHlL? Why can't users be allowed to add an alternative address if no one is in? The appears to give no more help than the email that gets sent to me. Where's the value add guys?
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I like the app it's very easy to use. Helps me keep track of my deliveries and when need to be home to get them!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, A bit slow loading that gives the sensation that there may be a problem but then it kicks in and tells you what you need to know.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great App!! Can track a package from point of origin to destination with just a tap of the finger.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, But it doesn't associate the address to every delivery
UPS Mobile,Business,5, In thisday and time it's good to have this app so that you know what's coming and when it's coming and you can keep an eye out for it and if you don't receive it and your UPS Mobile tells you it's been delivered and then you know this notify someone that you didn't receive your package .
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. The fact that you can track your shipments and even see the GPS location of them makes it way better than using the FedEx app

UPS Mobile,Business,1, The map tracking works sporadically. It is unavailable more often than it is available. Not reliable at all.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Needs more alert options. There's no way to disable the vibrate option and it's woken me up a few times. Silent option please!
UPS Mobile,Business,1," i log in to my acount to "" customize"" my delivery and it keeps asking me to sign up again but when i do says i cant cause my info is in the system allready......well you dont say after going around in circles like 10 i gave up pointles app even the website does tue same thing pointless"

UPS Mobile,Business,1," downloaded to change delivery preferences but spent 30 mins going around in circles logging in, connecting to external accounts and verifying email addresses. Frustrating to say the least. Will call customer services in the morning to arrange drop off."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great for tracking UPS packages and interacting with the company without the Hassel of calling. Plus the peace of mind knowing where your packages are exactly!!! Awesome!!
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Unbelievably broken signup experience. Shockingly bad for a major company. Spent 15 mins trying to do it, and every method is completely broken. Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in UPS."

Also, I appreciate the notification that the package was delivered, because again, due to our rural location, occasionally a package mistakenly gets delivered to a neighbor. With the notification, I know to start texting my neighbors if the package wasn't delivered to me."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Completely useless. Not only is there less information available in this app then on the UPS website itself, it is buggy, crashy, and slow."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Don't use the app much so I don't know how well it really works. that's why only 4stars. No problems that I know of.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love this app makes it easy to track my packages. Made easy to read and understand. Thank you so much Merry Christmas🎄🎄 to you all And have a safe and a Happy New Year.🥂🍾🎊🎉
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Its a very useful app. Now I can track my packages without a worry. Although it would be better if we got to see on a map where our package is.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, No more notification of packages being delivered TODAY and no packages scheduled even though I just tracked a number for a package that is being delivered TODAY!!!

Second time this has happened recently and no response from UPS support. Also notice that every review is a 5 star review and practically worded the same. I guess the way to fix the app is to just hire a bunch of people to do fake reviews ??????
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app! Always keeps me up to date on incoming packages and delivery times.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," This does exactly what I look for in app. Shows me everything I want to know, simple to understand, and is straight to the point."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Quite simply this app let's me know where my order is and when I'll be getting it. The app also updates info on my orders if the shipping activity changes. I really like that.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, The mobile app wants me to create a new my choice account but that is impossible because my name and address are already associated with an account. There see.s to be no way to fix this.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Truly enjoy the ability to change deliver options with UPS mobile., especially this time of season.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Nice to check delivery dates and progress. I can save tracking numbers for easy reference. Wish it showed estimated delivery time.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Cool app but setting up text messages was kind of glitchy. Ended up making it work by responding yes before I clicked confirm on the app the second time
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This keep showing on the screen ""Oops! We can't find your network."" please fix it."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, I was trying to reschedule the delivery. Not only I couldnt log in with an existence media account but also the attempt with an alternative email was impossible .

UPS Mobile,Business,5," works great, easy to track packages, shipped or shipping back. Also alerts when package has been delivered."
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Used to be really good but for the past month or so it literally doesn't update tracking info... And I know it doesn't because Amazon will have updates and UPS will still be stuck on days earlier smh. App needs an update BAD.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This alerts me to my delivery so I can get it right away. I would appreciate a proximity feature where I can know how many stops away it is.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love using the app on my phone. Very easy to find what I'm looking for and tracking packages is a breeze.
UPS Mobile,Business,3, Stopped working. Won't let me log in. Keeps saying that it cannot find network. Strange. Worked very well until now.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, It's great that you can use app to see where your packages are.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Utterly pointless. Simply does nothing. Offers you the option of getting a delivery window time but then asks you to sign in to another service which then just takes you back to the beginning. No way to contact ups to change a delivery option or leave instructions. It literally does nothing.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I'm not big on technology but this app is TOO easy. Even I can use it, which is great for me."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I've have always enjoyed the experience and I really enjoy that they knock or ring the bell and the fact that I can track my packages.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always reliable and speedy delivery.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," I UPS gifts to friends/ family, the UPS app texts me when delivered to their homes ... I have on-line purchases UPS'd to my home, UPS app emails me there's a package on its way and who shipped it, and text when delivered to my home. UPS alert app is the best, I love it!"
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Only bad is I can't make a permanent change. Like always deliver to front door. Outside of that this app is fantastic.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, 4 stars for now until my package has been delivered but awesome so far. My friend gave me the wrong address and i was able to call and correct it 2 days later with not much hassle. When delivered i will give 5 stars because it was without much difficulty.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, the app is very helpful and alerting me when their delivery is nearby. Wish there was a way to communicate real time with the driver.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The UPS app is easy to use and very helpful. It's great to be able to authorize delivery of some shipments and to be to hold some orders so I can pick them up.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great to know the progress of a shipment. Able to have packages picked up if not at home. Can't delete delivered packages only drawback
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Terrible app. Won't change preference won't send notification when access point can't accept package. Terrible customer service on the tech side. Been waiting for Amazon prime shipment for two weeks
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I love this app. I feel I know where my package is snd when it's being delivered. It really helps me receive all my goods.😀

UPS Mobile,Business,4," Very convenient, I always know where my package is and when to expect it to be at my door...no more surprises!"

UPS Mobile,Business,1," everytime i open the app it gives an error about being unable to login, so to make it useful you have to enter your credentials everytime!"
UPS Mobile,Business,4," nice app. too many notifications. if I have 3 packages arriving, it will send 3 notifications. 1 per day would be better."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, I use this app as it helps me know when to expect my packages. It helps to know when to expect them as some of my items are for medical reasons and need to be brought in as soon as possible.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," too confusing. Too hard to create password and then when you do, it says it is the wrong ID when you try to long in. I gave up and uninstalled the app"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Works well. Like the notifications about package delivery, etc. Also nice not to have to look up all the tracking numbers separately."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," The app doesn't recognise a .UK email address (it let me sign up, but can't add it to the track matching). Fix it for an increase in stars."
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Hopeless. There seems to no way to retrieve my Id or password. Also no way for me to get an Australian number to call. I need a prompt reply but an email form wad my only option for assistance. Every interaction with UPS was undatsfactory.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, I know my premium membership will be expired next month. You don't need to harassing me to renew it every single time when I click a tracking.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Rubbish put my details in and signed up. I then Tried logging in and would not recognise my details ....POINTLESS uninstalled. Probably won't be home now to received the parcel cos of this useless app.
UPS Mobile,Business,2, This app is just not good. it misses the mark on most UX best practices and is hardly better than their moble site which is also pretty terrible. I expect so much better in 2019.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," says sign up to manage your packages. sign up, ""package doesn't have the option"" to manage a package being sent to me. theyre just data mining."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, great app to have when dealing with alot of package sending and receiving. very helpful.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I have had no problems with this app. I track all my packages through the carriers to my home.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Fortunately for me I had this app. After 2 days of speaking with several people, I was told that my package would be delivered after 4pm- when someone would be at home.

Of course that did not take place. Had it not been for this app I would not have known that my package was delivered before 2pm- while no one was home. I, once again, had to miss time at work because the people at UPS do not communicate properly and essentially just lied to me. So yes the app is great and accurate, but UPS, will not ever be my first choice to use for any deliveries I need processed going forward. App ☆☆☆☆☆ UPS👎👎👎👎👎"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," use the app very often, very convenient & accurate..saves me from headaches & bundles of wasted time. keep up the great work...deliveries r like clockwork"

This site says: est. arrival time; end of day."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like being notified where the package is and when it will arrive. Very helpful.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use setup and track.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I always have package updates at my fingertips. It's way more advanced than just tracking on a computer browser for me.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, App lets me track and sometimes modify delivery schedules for packages shipped via UPS. It can make it easier to fit my busy schedule with UPS deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Great!! I am not a heavy user of this app.However, UPS app has never let me down when I do use or need it."
UPS Mobile,Business,2," This app sucks never saves the information for long and often is inaccurate, please fix! No wonder amazon is the best in the shipping business!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, convenient and user friendly. Just wish delivery was on the porch and not over the fence and on the drive way. 😞😞😞

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use and very helpful to track and keep an eye on packages and deliveries!😎
UPS Mobile,Business,1, This app is useless. I have a user name and password but every time I try to use the app it just keeps asking me to sign up. I can't access any of the services.
UPS Mobile,Business,4," little bit slow to connect , & updates are not 24/7 for all shipments. But still better than many others. I have Choice, so I bypass the USPO and get my delivery a day or two faster & in better condition,worth the yearly nominal fee."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This app is useful and reliable. I like knowing that my package is on the way and approximate arrival time.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great to know when a package is due and when it has been delivered (so someone can go out and bring it in).
UPS Mobile,Business,1," This App FAILS to inform the recipient of Import payments. When tracking status online UPS automatically redirects you to the App (if you have it installed), hence the recipient expecting delivery would never know if any import payments are due."
UPS Mobile,Business,4," Need to adjust your payment info screens. If you use Google wallet to autofill the payment details, your activity refreshes and kicks you back to a different screen."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like that I can track packages.. But it seems that a lot of times packages just sit somewhere and magically appear at door step before it has showed it moved at all... Y is this?
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Nice app! Gives you many options to manage your package deliveries, track packages, and make delivery adjustments."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Highly accurate. Delivery person is a pleasure. App is easy.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Very good. Near five stars if only it would tell where shipments originated.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Convenient and easy to get updated info on delivery
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great app! Fast and easy to navigate!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The simplest shipping mail a packaging app out there and it just so happens to be UPS. The way it should be only goes to show the reasons of why they have been around and currently very much so are around and most definitely will always be around. U guys Rock! Team UPS!!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, I really love the fact that I can get online and check my shipments so easily. Thank you UPS!
UPS Mobile,Business,4, Deliveries always come when scheduled. My only problem is that I requested deliveries to left on my back porch and they are left on the front porch. I have had to put up yellow caution tape to block the front door and signs saying to deliver to the rear of the house.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Very handy tool. I love the UPS app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, This is a good app.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Great! Love the ability to follow where and how far away driver is from delivery destination.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, 0 if possible the app didnt run properly it just kept making me confirm my email only to not sign me in.. garbage

I know that the drivers are suppose to ""knock"" when dropping off. It's not a big deal that they do because of the App and modern technology notifying me of my packages arrival. And it probably was an Amazon driver in their personal or company car. So I didn't notice. Anyway, the app works like it is suppose to. Only a few times I didn't get tracking info until the package was almost in my state or city. And that was the company failing to provide it. I'm sure it was NOT UPS fault. Happy with the App. Download it today and track a package for Christmas!!! Now it sounds like I'm a promoter or someone pushing the App!! LoL!!! I'm not. The App works. I'm suprized anyone continued this far in reading my non sense! Sorry! ;-)"

Packages are always in good shape, they arrive quickly, and once you have a tracking number you can pretty much plan when to expect them.

UPS Mobile,Business,5," Just installed the App, so it is a bit premature to grade it; like when a waiter/waitress that was slow to serve comes back as soon as the first forkful of the dish enters the mouth. Will get back with an informed review."
UPS Mobile,Business,2, Shipments for me have to be manually added and very limited options to make changes. No security code is required for all apartment buildings.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, It would be better if it could scan tracking numbers directly (like ones on a receipt) instead of just barcodes.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, My package came in before I could even get the app to work. Won't even let you register because the app itself is broken. Then my package was late anyway. UPS is a huge disappointment.

I appreciate the delivery drivers in that they respect my property & make the effort trying to conceal the package if they can; as in setting it to the side out of sight from street view.

Thanks UPS for great service."

It is all day from perhaps 0700 till whenever the driver feels like calling it a day. In my case it was not delivered on the date specified. No updates what so ever. When the updates start to appear they are hours late. So you check at 0700 to 1200. There is now an update from 0630?? Best thing about it was they did not even deliver it. They dropped it off at a collection point miles away."

Doesn't allow you to contact UPS especially when they say they attempted to deliver a parcel using the excuse that the wrong house number was on the address. But surely they'd actually need to go to the address on the parcel. They also had my phone number. Driver just wanted to go home. I'll never use UPS they lie. The truth I can live with. Lies I can not. Also app uninstalled as it gives you less information than their website.

Confusing with address partitioning (I'm interested in ALL my pending and previous deliveries to whatever address) it seemed to have no idea of future dates even though I'd been emailed an hour previously that delivery was ""tomorrow"". The auto phone answering system was to kill for and an expensive way to waste my time with a deadline approaching. Who was the idiot who decided to put the tracking id as a URL only? In the end I was able to use a laptop and notepad to extract the id from the URL and figure my way through the change dialog (that was obscure!) and reschedule my deliveries. Really feeling bad about UPS now."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always informs me of deliveries and easy to send packages

UPS Mobile,Business,3, No ability to mark a package you claim is delivered as not received so you can follow up to resolve such issues.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, The app is great I've experienced no problems
UPS Mobile,Business,5, UPS gives the right amount of data for you to manage your deliveries. I can't say the same for other delivery services that leave me wondering what i am receiving.

UPS Mobile,Business,2, I got this app for my business but I have not used yet because I was just getting started. Well I got a letter saying I owed money. Well you see I did not owe money. Someone has hacked into this app my business thing and was using my account to charge stuff. I never used this yet. So WARNING BE CARE...Full ReviewI got this app for my business but I have not used yet because I was just getting started. Well I got a letter saying I owed money. Well you see I did not owe money. Someone has hacked into this app my business thing and was using my account to charge stuff. I never used this yet. So WARNING BE CAREFUL. SCAMMERS ARE SO RUNNING RAMPANT. But you know what they did got rid of my app without out consulting me first. Not sure if I will use this app now. To RISKY. I get penalized for something I did not do. This makes me mad. Very mad. Shame on you people that SCAM. One day you will have to answer to the Lord about what you did.

Delivery driver left notice that I needed to sign for the package three days in a row. First off, I was in the house in the very next room over at the times he supposedly knocked (my dog flips out at any knock, so I have my doubts he even knocked). I signed the back of the info notice he left saying he could leave the package. The driver ignored my signature and left the final info notice saying I can go pick it up across town. I order things online for convenience, so driving across town to pick up a package that was supposed to be delivered is frustrating. Ultimately, the most frustration came from not being able to easily submit feedback about this instance. I'd love if UPS had an easier way (or any way?) to get customer service and give feedback about drivers or situations."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," UPS lets me no as soon as a label has been created where package is at every day there's a update, and when it will be delivered. I signed up for text messages, but you don't have too."

UPS Mobile,Business,1," Disgraceful service. This app will only allow you to track your delivery if your supplier has paid for better than standard delivery.

This app will only allow you to track your delivery if your supplier has paid for better than standard delivery. All it would tell me is ""by the end of the day"". Having already signed up it invited me to sign up again for UPS Choice which it said would give me a delivery window. Choice told me I was in a multi occupation property - I'm not we've owned this house for 20 years - and would not give me the delivery time. Had to stay in all day. Waste of my time. Will delete."

I downloaded this app so i could schedule to have my package delivered to a UPS store, because that's the first place the truck stops in the morning. I needed my package ASAP.

UPS Mobile,Business,4, it's a good app but I dont understand why UPS charges $5 to change the date of a delivery. I want to change it because I wont be here. it will also keep the driver from attempting delivery.....maybe multiple times. however I'm not paying $5 for it. let them come 3 times

UPS Mobile,Business,4, Great. Keeps me up to date on deliveries.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Maybe would work better if UPS could deliver. I have a package that was due for delivery yesterday and app still says expected end of day for yesterday. Not really something that updates or where can actively track parcel unless day or 2 in arrears which seems pointless

Unfortunately both of them ask me to sign up even I already logged in. The worst thing is the sign up totally does not work even I followed the steps because it say my name/address already in their database. It does not tell you how to solve the issue.

UPS Mobile,Business,2, problem logging in.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, Horrible customer service. They don't like taking responsibility for a package that was never delivered. They're goal is to keep you on hold for over 30 minutes and transfer you to several people hoping you just give up so they don't have to take responsibility. Never using ups again.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, Useless company and worse app. Just deliver the packages I have paid you for.

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Everything that I ordered and was delivered by ups came in wonderful condition nothing was ever damaged. I was pleased that I get a delivery time if I'm not home and can get my nextdoor to get it for me.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Love it. Works great
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Keeps me informed of deliveries and when they are delivered.
UPS Mobile,Business,1, No map so no idea when a delivery is due on a given day.
UPS Mobile,Business,4, slow to load
UPS Mobile,Business,4," I receive excellent service. Just wondering if you could provide us the opportunity to add more detail (ie, specific comment) about exactly where we would like UPS to leave a delivered package at our home?"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I know exactly when and where my packages are. With package theft occurring regularly, I have NEVER suffered package theft since I began using UPS app. I or a neighbor have our hands on packages from UPS driver. Invaluable to my peace of mind."

UPS Mobile,Business,5, UPS App has made the holiday shopping online and delivery extremely stress free.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, As we're away so often it helps make us aware when we're receiving a package and we can also change the delivery date to a date we're going to be home.

UPS Mobile,Business,1, UPS is going downhill. Drivers think dropping off a package at the foot of our rural driveway; and or putting it in front of the garage door or delivering a wet and creased box. FEDEX can deliver to the door on the provided table. Been to the UPS Hub to report the problems. Yet to see any change.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Tells me what I need to know Good format. Option ability.

UPS Mobile,Business,3, Sure hope it's better than its predecessor !!!
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Always showed the location of my order until delivery

UPS Mobile,Business,4, I have never had a bad experience with the brown. They tend to be the same as the last time you got a delivery so you get to feel comfortable with the help that they give. Then they hop back into the truck and away they go. Man are they fast!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," UPS contacts me each month when a parcel is sent to me, as well as updates on it's route. UPS holds my parcels for pickup as they are non replacable. You just have to LOVE UPS and their fantastic, wonderful, and NICE Employes. THANK YOU UPS!"

UPS Mobile,Business,5, I like the idea of having a time frame so that I am not waiting all day for a delivery. With the time frame I have the time to get other business taken care of.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, they are very informative about where my package is

UPS Mobile,Business,5, For what I need to know this app works great

UPS Mobile,Business,5, Does exactly as it is supposed to do.
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Wonderful app to use
UPS Mobile,Business,1, The worst ever delivery service. This app won't help you.
UPS Mobile,Business,1," Never use the UPS Store location on Broadview Road in Parma, Ohio."
UPS Mobile,Business,1," So, basically to see when YOUR package that YOU PAID to be delivered by UPS arrives (if you're lucky), you have to sign a monster long agreement (visible only through a tiny window) where you waive many of your consumer rights. Sounds legit."
UPS Mobile,Business,5," The UPS app allows me total control of when, where, and how my UPS packages get delivered. In my opinion, that's all you/I/or any reasonable person should expect. Does what it promises."
UPS Mobile,Business,4, it's the great app since apple pie just love it
UPS Mobile,Business,5," I use UPS a great deal and they are professional, courteous, kind and they are always, always on time!! Thank you UPS for doing your very best to make my business easier."
UPS Mobile,Business,5, Easy to use !!
UPS Mobile,Business,5," very useful, I love it"
UPS Mobile,Business,5," Love UPS!!! My deliver guy is awesome. Always lets me know he is here. And very sweet guy, very polite. Thank you UPS your awesome"

It is easy to use, works every time I go to use it, and makes the ordering process quick and easy. It's very nice being able to walk in past the long line that is generally present at all locations and pick up my food usually with very little to no wait."
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Fantastic concept all the way through delivery. Great food and help.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,1, First order was good but orders last night and today cannot be placed because of Error Validating Basket.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,1, Store in Chicago is marked as closed in observance of Cinco de Mayo but its packed to the rafters in person.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, UNREAL!!!
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, I love Velvet Taco but the new location near me on Greenville in Dallas is SUPER slow. The mobile order pickup/drive-thru is supposed to be more convenient but it is not. It might as well be an actual drive-thru because the wait is just as long.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,3, I like the app and it works quickly...but it doesn't save my card information even though I select that option. Please fix!
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,3," Great app for ordering, but it does not save the CC information, you have 
to reenter your information each time."
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, I run Favor and Uber orders from here. I decided to try to eat here now. Seems popular and customers are very friendly.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5," Amazing tacos. Love the new location on Greenville. Drive through pick up 
is super convenient."
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Love app except can't figure out how to delete previous orders!
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5," Best tacos around! Super friendly, and app is very convenient!"
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Easy app. Put a velvet 🌮 in South Grand Prairie Tx.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5," Very useful app, saves so much time!"
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Was able to order using the app...best idea ever
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Fast. Easy. You don't have to talk to a person.
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Freakin awesome tacos
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Very nice app
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Bravo
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5, Awesome experience
Velvet Taco,Food & Drink,5," This app works great. Downloaded it at the door and stood in line with friends. By the time they ordered, my tacos were ready."
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,1," Pick up works fine, delivery is forwarded to Postmate or another delivery service, no return number.. driver marked delivery as delivered when it was not.. Zoup store has NO access to the delivery person... no accountability at all..not the apps fault but this is a very poor set up.. period.."
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,1, Order came wrong. No obvious way within the app to let them know so they can refund the items that were missing. (I'll update the review when/if this is taken care of).
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,1, Can't verify email with spendgo so can't use crashes too
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,1," App submitted my order twice, ending up in a double charge."
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,5, My favourite soup at Zoup is North Indian Lentil.
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,5, Lobster Bisque?!?! #Bruh!
Zoup! Eatery,Food & Drink,5," a superb soupy time, brethren"
