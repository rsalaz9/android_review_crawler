0,Erin Berghold,"March 14, 2020",2, Downloaded the app thinking it would be better to access the rewards program and there is nothing there. Need to include that into the app.

3,Kenneth Cavin,"July 16, 2019",1," Constantly says ""error validating basket"" when trying to check out. The app has never worked for me. I always forget about it until I attempt to place an order. Uninstalling this time..."

7,Chad Dierkes,"April 5, 2020",3, Really easy to order and customize. Just wish it had Google Pay setup to use when you checkout. No easy way to view rewards either.
8,USA,"April 25, 2020",1, Totally useless. Says no stores in entire State. And I'm actually in the parking lot of one. Don't bother.
9,Sea Lily,"September 7, 2018",5," Works great, food always ready when I show up. Wish there were more coupons but can't really complain about the app."
10,Brian Lewis,"February 21, 2018",4," Very easy to use and order, however it lacks the group order sharing that the website features which I use for work. But as an individual, it does a great job.  I love Lion's Choice!"
11,FoodService Medic,"May 8, 2018",5," I was able to download and use the app right away with no trouble. 
Everything was intuitive and the app is very nice looking. Great job Lion's
