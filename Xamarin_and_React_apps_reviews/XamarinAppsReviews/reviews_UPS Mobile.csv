Until you need to edit your profile to change your residence address or phone number or email address, then a nightmare! UPS and MyChoice UPS are separate accounts. You cannot edit your residence address, email or phone number in profile on UPS or MyUPS. You must email or call UPS and have them make the change to your profile. Changing one does not change both UPS and MyUPS. This is not explained on UPS website."

Original - I use this app quite often on two devices, a OnePlus 7 Pro and a Moto G7. It is virtually unusable as of late. Will not open, just gets hung up on the UPS splash screen and when it finally does open after a few minutes, it won't allow me to log in using biometrics that I have set up. When I enter my log in info, it hangs for a few minutes then comes back with a log in error. Uninstalled and reistalled the app and nothing changes."
2,! tomekyo,"April 22, 2020",1," This one is really annoying. I don't know what is worse, the app or the UPS themselves. The app let's you login just to show you exactly the same info you saw prior to logging in. Online it is the same story so I think it has something to do with the whole setup, which is really stupid."
3,Paola Maravilla,"April 22, 2020",4," Easy to use, not 5 starts because not used to automatically detect new tracking numbers and it doesn't any more, now I have to go find the tracking number from the sender and paste it to the app."
4,Peggy Torres,"April 20, 2020",2," I have never had such a hassle trying to change my password, after almost 35 minutes I finally complete this and then they tell me that my email address still needs to be verified! I had just been using my email with them for 35 minutes 🤪"
5,Dre Hardy,"April 22, 2020",5, This app is so user friendly. I downloaded the app then used my Facebook profile to login and just like that.....It had all my packages listed with the location and dates for delivery. I didnt have to put in any tracking numbers or anything.
6,ariana monforte,"April 24, 2020",3, Just downloaded the app today. It isn't populating the addresses in my UPS address book. The names are coming up in the drop down but once a name is selected the drop down disappears and the shipping details remain blank. Please fix. Thank you!
7,Alan Bliss,"April 22, 2020",5," It's always great to be able to track my UPS shipments in this app, as well as to be proactively notified of all incoming shipments, as soon as they are scheduled. This is a VERY useful tool."
8,Leroy Petersen,"April 21, 2020",5," The UPS app is quite useful. It makes tracking multiple packages simple and recently has started showing the truck's actual location for some deliveries. Notes to the driver are possible, as well as lock box codes."
9,Debra Gates,"April 21, 2020",5, This app automatically lets me know when UPS has picked up a package addressed to me and gives me both estimated delivery date/time as well as options to change delivery. It's very handy!
10,John Hutchins,"April 20, 2020",5," Very intuitive and easy to use. The app detects the new tracking number on your phone! Essentially all you have to to is open the app .

Essentially all you have to to is open the app . It is still hard to actually contact someone about an issue though. This was before all of this covid-19 craziness, I can't imagine it's any easier to get in touch with them now. Still an excellent app, if tracking your package is the majority of what you plan on using it for."
11,Jim Markus,"April 23, 2020",4, The app has some very useful functions such as being able to show the progress of the delivery on a map. This allows you to plan for the delivery. The only issue I've seen is that from time to time it says it can't display.
12,Alli Garand,"April 21, 2020",5, I like getting the up-to-date notifications on delivery day with the added bonus of being about to follow the delivery truck on the map to see when it's close-by. Very handy for apartment living.
13,Elizabeth Murphy,"April 21, 2020",5," Very helpful app. Easy to use. If I copy a tracking number to enter in the app, it automatically asks if I want to add the number when I open it."
14,Geoff Parker,"April 21, 2020",4," Pretty good. Not perfect, but very effective at tracking packages, deliveries, exceptions, etc. Very stable. Very useful."
15,Cristian Styles,"April 21, 2020",5," Everything seems technically accurate, I can keep track of all my shipments easily and everything seems up to date and organized, very nice work!!"
16,Sue Howell,"April 21, 2020",5," So handy & with me all the time no matter where I am. Can track packages, put them on hold or delay their delivery and follow their delivery on a map the day they do arrive. No more guessing!"

I use the Sign in with Google feature, which redirects me to a web page for me to login to my Google account.  I can successfully login using this, however, I am frequently logged out and have to repeat this process over and over again since I do not stay logged in to my Google account on my default browser app (which is not Chrome). Please implement the proper Android APIs to better support Google login without relying on the browser for account sign-in."
18,Brandon Evans,"April 22, 2020",1, IMO this Android app is garbage. Constantly logging me out every other time I check it. Tells me it can connect to the internet when I have 4 bars of lte and on WiFi and all my other apps are working fine
19,Jessica Simpson,"April 23, 2020",5, Easy to use! Love being able to track my packages with such quickness and can pretty much rely on the updates being accurate.

One thing that could be improved is the price of the upgrade. I enjoy getting my packages as soon as possible, but when you order from a store and they put your order in 3 or 4 different packages it gets expensive when you upgrade to have all of them come a day earlier."

It does the job and presents your parcel information in a suitable manner. However it could be more helpful. For example : I would like to see driver tracking, when your parcel is out for delivery, with the delivery number (ie Delivery 42 of 75) and an estimated delivery time so your not sat in all day worrying about leaving the house or nipping to the loo."
22,David Handler,"April 15, 2020",5," Able to accurately track and control delivery of packages. Can easily have an individual package sent to a different address, or held (if I am not available). I can also upgrade UPS postal delivery to regular delivery, since I upgraded to UPS's higher option. Great app., easy to use, very intuitive."
23,Jackie Hull,"April 24, 2020",5, This app does what it says and more. I especially like the Follow My Delivery because you can see where the driver is and know when they will stop.

The app doesn't always immediately let me know that it's been delivered, And I wish the delivery guy would put the packages where I've stated them on the app.. I want them on my Front Porch, NOT my Carport. Just discovered the ""Follow My Delivery"". So cool. I can follow where the UPS truck is, and how close it is to my house."
25,Jami Hushbeck,"April 23, 2020",5, I really like having the ability to check where & when my package is & when it should be delivered. Thank you!

27,Jackie Tomkins,"April 6, 2020",4, I like the app. I like to be able to follow the driver but that's not available on all things that I wish it was. I don't like Surepost.

When I get notifications of something that's going to arrive Shore Post it gave me the option of upgrading in which I did. However it still wound up going surepost. This has happening to me on more than one occasion and nobody offers the money back.

Took me 2 days to change password and credentials. :) they are still not changed as I'm waiting for the next in a row confirm email from UPS. Instead of looking for an update on my delivery I am receiving emails wasting my time. I will possibly receive the delivery before I will be able to use the app. Huge disappointment."

Great job! Although the app tracked a shipment once I entered the tracking number, the portion of the app that was intended to manage ""any"" deliveries to my address did not reflect the shipment that was ""out for delivery"". Not sure about this inconsistency, but will check address label upon receipt to try to understand issue."

However I wish they would stop shoving my boxes and my mailbox. The way my parents mailbox is someone could easily ride or walk by and take my packages. I would much rather them live package on porch or simply just ring doorbell someone is always normally home. Other than that great service.

Other issues that make it unusable: On every startup it fails to log in on its own. Terribly confusing with several overlapping registrations. Due to design faults, only one option can be selected (wait for snail mail letter with PIN) because the other options are covered up by text elements."

I went through the registration process and installed the app but the option to get an estimate on time wasn't available. Plus I didn't get any notification that my package had arrived until several hours after I had already received it. Deleted my profile and uninstalled the app. No thank you.
34,Shane Lemaire,"April 23, 2020",5, Works great. I like the live delivery feature. Where you can see where the truck is on its route
35,jeremy davis,"April 24, 2020",5, I think that this app is very useful if you are a person who has allot of packages to keep track of both incoming and out going.

37,James Tipton,"April 13, 2020",3," This app used to be a great app to track ur shipments, however for some reason the app isn't updating any of the shipment information as of 4/13/2020. U can see the shipment but everything seems to have frozen in place where they landed on the 11th of April. No movement of any package since then."
38,William Wyatt,"April 1, 2020",5," This app is excellent! Tracking is superb, and lets you know the appropriate time when to expect your package, and if it's a surepost item, it tells you that it is in your mailbox, which is great when your mail is received in a kiosk down the street."

40,Aureja A,"April 21, 2020",1, It just doesn't work... How to agree with rules and conditions? The check box doesn't work!
41,Douglas Greninger,"April 21, 2020",1," Unusable. Always logs me out of My Choice, says there is ""no connection"" when I'm connected to WiFi and cellular. Basically resets itself every time I start the app and REFUSES to load anything. It's a paperweight at this point. Sticking with the website from now on."
42,Joseph Storm Jr.,"April 20, 2020",5, Update*** they resolved the Google sign in issue.*** Review changed Great app for package tracking. Wished Google sign in option stayed. I have to sign in Everytime inopen the app.
43,Keith O'Connor,"April 1, 2020",4," Good Tracking App. Tracks packages nicely. They added a way to add a note, which displays in the list. This way you can add an Amazon or eBay order number so you know what is being tracked. Cannot schedule a UPS pickup or find out how much a shipment will cost."
44,Nick Woodall,"April 4, 2020",1, The score provided flatters this app. Do not bother with it if you want to track a parcel. It will waste hours of you time repeatedly filling in the same info and sending you in loops returning you to the same screen. Better to wait until the office is open and phone them instead.

46,Steve Pringle,"April 17, 2020",4," If I copy a tracking number, it detects it. Not sure if it reads my emails but when a package us coming to me, the app already has the tracking number entered. Would give 5 stars but I have to drop 1 for the ads. They are not annoying (yet) but I know that they are using up resources to display."

50,Magdalena Ortega,"April 14, 2020",5," Great app! Tracking is current and notifications give you an expected date of delivery. On the day your package is out for delivery, a time window is provided and you can follow the progress of selected shipped packages on a live map in real time."

52,Polly Miller,"April 2, 2020",5," Loved watching the truck icon. Wish i could have spent more time. The last time i went back to the email & a box opened to tell me that feature was not available, i had just enough time to get my gloves on and meet the driver partway. Time saving, no contact. SAFE"

54,Beth Ann,"April 18, 2020",4, Its always nice to be able to track any package you may be expecting! The tracking information screen is a little hard to read as the information looks crowded. The application itself works fresh and my complaint is strictly based on esthetic effects.

61,Dee Flannery,"April 10, 2020",5," Super Easy to Track and Schedule Packages!! My only suggestion for improvement is to show the NAME of the companysending the items. When receiving multiple items from various companies, it's easier to track by the company name as opposed to the tracking number."

Customer Support is via a virtual assistant which offers very little as it's automated and I've had to call to then be told my package is trapped. This is contrary to the previous updates on both the app and website. I'm ordering something as a necessity and the communication here has been very poor compared to every other firm."
73,Angela Goldman,"April 8, 2020",5, I absolutely love this app! It keeps me informed precisely where my package is and helps me keep track of my package as it's being shipped. I thank you for your expert experience UPS. I wouldn't change a thing. I'm very thankful for your services.🙂.

77,Deena Stevens,"March 31, 2020",5," I appreciate the thoroughness of this app, from being able to track packages, being able to set delivery instructions, to receiving delivery notifications. It's easy to navigate and simple to use."
78,Thomas Etchberger,"April 13, 2020",4," Although I don't ship very frequently, I enjoy being able to track my package to/from sender to destination. The app allows me to know where my package is and when it was delivered. This has been reassuring when having to ship time sensitive items."
79,Krystal Johnson,"April 21, 2020",5," Makes planning for deliveries so easy! Love the status updates and the ease of use. I appreciate the automatic alerts, UPS recognizes a package is shipping to me and oftentimes provides an alert that the package is in transit sooner than the shipper."

82,kevin shaughnessy,"April 22, 2020",5, Excellent app for tracking my gun shipments. My vendors all use UPS and its a must for me to have this app. It is fast accurate and automatic by just clicking on the routing number. I've also used it for Amazon returns and regular shipping. Its great.
83,April O,"March 13, 2020",5," Very easy to use and understand. I've only used it to track my packages because I like to have an idea of when my packages are arriving and because of porch pirates, and it's been super helpful. It's pretty up to date. I can get my package off my porch within minutes of drop off. Just love this app."
84,Dana D,"March 25, 2020",5, Love this app. Love knowing when my packages are being delivered and then when they got delivered. If I am at work I can ask a neighbor to watch the package or pick it up for me. I can also request the delivery be held if I know I won't be home until the next day...very convenient!
85,Valtitude,"March 29, 2020",5," Works great for our family and small business. When packages need a signature - can sign online. Packages in transit, delivery changes, delivery confirmation, all of this is available and do-able via the app. Terrific."

94,SatanicSexGod,"March 17, 2020",1, I can't lock into my account because the app wants me to change the language of my keyboard so I could use a specific character for my password. Doesn't work if I change it either. Besides it is all about a common character present in the English language anyway.
95,Jake Harrison,"March 22, 2020",2," Frustrating, it constantly logs me out and says my internet connection isn't adequate despite being on LTE. The app freezes up a lot as well. Besides that, it does a good job of letting me know tracking info and giving me the ability to manage my packages"
96,Kelli Wright,"April 23, 2020",5," Love the App! It's been fun with the follow your package option. It's pretty accurate, except the truck gets here before the map updates. Keep up the good work! 😃"
97,Traveling Kat,"March 26, 2020",4," Can watch past addresses and make sure nothing is headed there in our name... can reschedule or allow re-delivery of packages, some packages can even be tracked to a map... the app has grown and developed, very useful, few failings"
98,George Richards,"March 26, 2020",4," I like this app! When I buy things on Amazon that are shipped UPS, they are tracked better and faster! I know the item's location and time of delivery on the UPS App before Amazon tells me! Go service, thanks!"
99,Robert Linder,"April 10, 2020",3, Its like it logs you out and/or freezes up and can't get back into it. So I need to reboot my phone to get it working again. I have no other problems with other apps. Just this one.

109,Andrea Bedard,"April 14, 2020",4, It is nice to know the progress of the package delivery and priceless to know when it is delivered so it does not sit on my porch. You can redirect delivery(for a fee) or have it left with a neighbor.

It allows me to selectively direct certain deliveries to my nearby UPS store counter so a package doesn't sit on my porch or to have it held for signature at a convenient time. Very convenient.
180,Michael McClure,"March 13, 2020",4," I like the UPS app, it is helpful when you are tracking a package and it even allows you to see where the truck that has your package is located in proximity to your house. Great app..."
181,Rebecca Swope,"March 21, 2020",5, I love it. Only thing I wish they did was give an estimated time frame and/or location where they are in delivery status like Amazon. Make it easier to know when to home for the package especially right now during the epidemic going on.
182,Greg Porter,"March 21, 2020",5," Having previously installed the app it was a nice surprise when I automatically began getting delivery updates on a package sent to me. No tracking #, it was just as simple as tapping on the notification."
183,Patricia Galindo,"March 26, 2020",5, This app is great in case you have to leave unexpectedly when you have a package scheduled to be delivered. Go UPS!!!
184,Bill Ament,"March 26, 2020",5, Sometimes up to the minute status is great. Good overall heads up. I have a lockbox on the porch. Driver uses code to lock items inside. Like it!
185,Justis McCann,"March 30, 2020",5, It's so convenient. It runs smooth and let's me know all the info I could ever need and more for any package comming your way.
186,Mattie Woods,"April 4, 2020",5, Always get a heads up when a package is coming and that is very helpful so that I am aware when to be on the lookout for it. Great app.
187,R Jones,"April 7, 2020",1, Installed and deleted within 5 minutes. I foolishly thought that the app that UPS created would read the barcode at the bottom of a UPS store receipt after shipping something through UPS. What was I thinking.
188,Larry Mullins Jr,"April 18, 2020",5," Unfortunately my package was ""miss scanned"" but the app has kept me informed of this and where its at. Without the app i would be in the dark right now. Great app!!!"
189,Michael Broadhead,"March 17, 2020",4, So far so good. Would be nice to chat with a real person when your package does not arrive on time or is possibly lost. Going through that as I review this app. I am not given the option to call somebody which really does irritate me.
190,William Meyer,"March 20, 2020",5, Quick access for information on shipments. Great information available with accurate updates and notifications. Never a problem with my use of the App...saves alot of time!
191,Sharon Daley,"March 26, 2020",5, Very convenient. I know when my package will be delivered and I know when they have delivered it so I can go down and get it immediately. Living in a elderly apartment down town. I need this knowledge. Sometimes we have sticky hands in my neighbors.
192,Rick Guenther,"April 2, 2020",5, Have Never had any problems. Everything is there and easy to use. Especially being able to Track your delivery in Real Time...
193,Michelle McClellan,"April 13, 2020",5, Easy to use. Easy to track packages I'm receiving or sending. Upgrading options are a plus.
194,Frank Twilleager,"April 18, 2020",5," Everything one needs in a shopping app. Track, schedule, and receive updates on shipments. Find store and dropoff locations."
195,Richard Simmons,"April 4, 2020",5," Extremely informative..... would be better if there was a ""true time"" tracking. Amazon delivery has true time tracking and it's a great help."

Utterly useless. All they do is redirect you back and forth from the app to the site, or to having to sign back in. Seriously every single option besides tracking does not work. I've sat down and shown people and no one can make sense of it . The most frustrating thing I've ever dealt with. How are yall still in business?"
197,Paul B.,"March 14, 2020",5," App is great. Tracking number is easily found, due to color making it standout. Ability to open app with fingerprint is fast and never failed. No need to remember password."
198,Lucy Sanabria,"March 17, 2020",5, This app ups mobile is great to use it tell you went your packages leave the places and get to your house safe so they won't rob. Your packages any more! Need someone to watch went they get there time and everything in this app. Thank you ups mobile service app.
199,Dan Reeves,"March 13, 2020",5," Easiest way to track my package. I just copy the tracking number, open the app, and it automatically gets the info. You don't even have to paste it in the search box. Then all the info is at your fingertips."
200,Craig Prall,"March 25, 2020",4, Useful app for tracking UPS incoming and outgoing packages. I like when it lets me know a package is about to be delivered. Times could be a little tighter though.
201,Kevin Wheeler,"April 1, 2020",4, The app is amazing. You can teach your package at every facility it stops at. I just wish it had live tracking but overall it's an amazing app
202,Jeff Luce,"April 3, 2020",4," Good app. It wants me to login/re-authenticate WAY TO MUCH. 1-2x per day is fine, but every 5-10 min is excessive."
203,Steven DIB,"April 15, 2020",5, You can be information in real time accuracy is awesome. We had a lot of packages delivered and it's great to be able keep track of them.
204,Caroline Brown,"April 1, 2020",5, Very easy to use and keeps you updated with your delivery! Have not had any issues with glitches
205,Ellen Flottman,"February 14, 2020",2, I loved this app until the upgrade. Now it wont keep me logged in and asks me to sign up everytime and there is a popup for fingerprint login but no place to add a fingerprint. Please fix.
206,Adele K,"April 14, 2020",5, Good app. I really love the UPS app. I live in the country and it's vital to know when my packages are coming.
207,Holly Cicalo,"March 30, 2020",5," This is the first thing I check every morning. It's very helpful...I get notifications of deliveries, etc. Love it."
208,Andrew Williams,"March 31, 2020",2," Pointless. Don't quite see the point of this app. You can't track a parcel. Just gives you a date and time, with no updates at all!"
209,Tom Monaghan,"April 4, 2020",4, Great app for tracking package in detail. Lacks a means to communicate with UPS about the problems with missing packages.
210,John Tate,"April 14, 2020",1, This app is worthless. You have to register with your email to track a package. It's hard to understand. Even USPS app is better then this app.
211,Jonna Herbele,"April 18, 2020",4, I love being able to look at when my packages will be delivered. Its always right when they say it will... Never had any issues.
212,Brickcity NJ,"April 23, 2020",5, Great app......detailed information on your package(s).

BUT, not to happy with the care given to each package. Something needs to be done about the way the workers handle each package. I say and know this because I myself use to work for UPS loading trucks in White house Tn. Last shipment I lost $1000 worth of fish due to IDIOT DRIVER/DELIVERY PERSON."
214,Adam Allen,"April 21, 2020",4, Great app! Very handy! I love the truck tracker.
215,Skraps,"March 10, 2020",4, I love the app because I can give real time instructions to the driver before my package shows up. I only did a 4 star because 4 and a half wasn't available and there always room for improvement so no 5
216,Angela,"March 11, 2020",4," As a consumer, I appreciate being able to easily access information about a pending delivery and getting notifications from the app instead of email or text. Also, the delivery management is very easy. Thanks, UPS!"
217,Bonnie Knight,"March 23, 2020",5," I really like being notified when my package is on it's way. You provide the tracking # so I am able to follow the journey it makes. Best of all I have a delivery date so I am able to make arrangements, etc. Thanks UPS!"
218,Tina M.,"March 28, 2020",5," Easy to understand and simple to use. Great app, I know right where my package is and can get updates if I want"
219,Terry Graham,"April 7, 2020",4," Very useful app especially with increased number of deliveries due to ""stay-at-home"" directives."
220,Sandy Beuer,"April 7, 2020",5, Love the app but sometimes the drivers really piss me off I'm disabled and have a really hard time getting around they have literally driven right past my home and stuck a notice in my mailbox to go pick my package up in a locker in town
221,Josue Cazanga,"April 10, 2020",1," Unusable, have to login every time I open the app. If I even seitch to another app I get logged off and my tracking info is unavailable."
222,John James,"March 12, 2020",5, Great app use it all the time to track my packages or to send to a pick up locaton like the lockers when unable to pick up at home. The app is great resource of info!!!!
223,Rhonda Johnson,"March 24, 2020",5, Love knowing the time of day that my package will arrive. Been having trouble with packages being taken off of the porch. This app let's me know the time frame tbat I need to be available. Love it!
224,beatrix buetow,"April 4, 2020",5," I use this app only to see my deliveries. From other sections on it, I can easily ship and manage shipments just as easily. Looks useful for both individuals and business alike."
225,Jeff Rogers,"April 13, 2020",5, Lets me track and manage my packages to see their progress as well as add any instructions if necessary. I find this an invaluable tool in making certain I know when packages will arrive.

229,Denise Johnson,"April 19, 2020",5," Good App to use to quickly find out about deliveies to my home. I can receive notifications, make changes and name them so I know what it is, just to name a few."
230,Sean Fantone,"March 21, 2020",3," Good app. But since I've moved recently, it keeps telling me my residential home is a buisness, and won't let me change my corrected address! Have sent them this same info. No response!!"
231,Christina Waters,"March 29, 2020",3, The menu options can't be read because the text is too big and they scrunch up into each other.
232,Maurice Mcclain,"April 3, 2020",5, If I could rate this app a 10 I would. I was in route to a destination when this app notified me of an impending delivery. Because it was real time I turned around and saw the UPS truck coming down the street. Amazing.
233,Jean Klimczyk,"April 7, 2020",5," Love the app, tracks packages and helps me manage my time better so that I don't miss deliveries."
234,Mary Lloyd,"April 9, 2020",5, Works great. Opens without glitches. Doesn't update the location of the delivery truck enough.
235,Eric Quick,"April 19, 2020",1, Super sucks ass!! Try to update your info on this app? Hahaha good luck. It updates as it sees convenient. Freakin bastards. I will pay extra to never use upsucks again!!
236,Capt Kerry,"March 18, 2020",4, There should be a way to fix address errors easily. Either there is not or it is difficult to find. Either way its frustrating
237,Ruben Ramirez,"February 6, 2020",5," The app is incredibly easy to use, and very user friendly. I especially like being able to label each shipment so that I know what I'm tracking, if I have multiple packages on the way."
238,Leslie Alexander,"March 6, 2020",3, Since this update I have not been receiving regular notifications like I had been getting. I have gone back into the website and read and my preferences for notifications and nothing has changed I still don't get any!
239,Marian Eberle,"March 16, 2020",5," You can easily track your packages with this app. It's simple, no ads or pop ups to annoy me. I recommend it if you need or want to keep an eye on your UPS packages."

242,Kris Dawkins,"March 27, 2020",5, I love it! It has made my life much easier and organized. I can track my orders and stay informed with ease.
243,Ava Roberson,"April 10, 2020",2, App. Is messed up fonts are huge. Unable to reduce on my phone. Erratic as hell. Manage options says no delivery for today. The tracking option says delivery scheduled today I really expect much more from UPS than the dinky dink app. I have installed

249,John,"April 8, 2020",5, Keeps me up to date on where my package is and when it's going to be delivered and allows me to notify the driver as to which door I would like my package delivered or to place it on the back porch if I'm not home.
250,WXdestroyer,"April 10, 2020",3, This app would be great if I didn't have to sign in every time I opened it. I'll give 5 stars when that's fixed.
251,Mark Bensley,"March 11, 2020",1," App tells me I'm not signed up. When I fill out the form to sign up, app tells me I'm already signed up. Circular problem prevents me from using the app."

256,Bonita Slaughterbeck,"March 25, 2020",4, Cant leave feedback. Some of your drivers still cant tell the front door from the back. That is fine except for the dog food. Don't like dragging it all through the house.
257,Real Deal Big G,"April 1, 2020",5, Very convenient and provides me with peace of mind with statuses of my shipments in the palm of my hand. Love it

Also should be more specific options for deliveries when a signature is required."

323,Moggy Curious,"March 26, 2020",4, Inconveniently the app interface allows you to delete only one tracking number at a time.
324,Pat Loonam,"February 20, 2020",5," Of the big three (UPS, FedEx, USPS) this is the most user friendly. Notifications are timely, just wish there was a way to incorporate deliveries automatically into my calendar."

339,Michelle Deskin,"March 16, 2020",4, Good app. It's hard for me to remember my user name though. You can't change your user name once you have it. I misspelled mine & now I can't remember it due to the spelling. Wish you had a remember user name on it & it did...
340,Tracy Bunn,"March 17, 2020",5," Quick, easy, and very accurate. It lets you know exactly when your package has arrived!"

356,Jason Abernathy,"March 21, 2020",5, Great app for tracking orders. most the time I don't even have to put my tracking number in. It already knows I have a package.

They let me know if there has been a change in delivery or time. They always deliver during the time and date promised. I have never had a problem with a delivery. I cannot lift heavy items and the drivers will always set the package inside the house for me so the package is not left outside for a long period of time. I applaud all the drivers for their kindness and courtesy in delivering items to me. Thank you so much UPS!
1293,Mona Crosby,"January 21, 2020",4," This app is so helpful. I can easily track packages, actually track the delivery truck on deliver day and more. I highly recommend this app. Also, the option of receiving updates on package progress is a great hit with me. Love it! Besides, UPS is by far the best."

Not to mention that I have wasted hour of my time which I will never get back. The developer needs to go back to the drawing board on this
1296,Randal Huffman,"November 30, 2019",5, This app is very helpful. It lets you see at a glance when your stuff will arrive. There are ootions you can do like have things delivered to a UPS store or other locations and I think you can adjust dates later also. I just use it to keep an eye on shipments. Highly recommend if dealing with UPS.

1304,A Google user,"December 9, 2019",4," I really appreciate this app. I live in a very small town, and my address is a bit tricky, (unmarked dead end street, looks like a driveway). With the app I know when to watch for the truck so I can go outside and ""help"" them find me."
1305,Mike Tuersley,"December 13, 2019",5, Great app as far as the tracking goes which is all I use it for. My only critique is that it would be nice to be able to set the default delivery location if you have multiple locations. Currently you can set it but it defaults back to the first address numerically.

1367,Constance McCutchen,"April 20, 2020",5, Very easy to navigate and saves a lot of time when needing to make quick changes
1368,Nancy Long,"March 16, 2020",5, With the UPS Mobile app I always know the status of a delivery.
1369,Alethea Chase,"November 21, 2019",4, Must have optional Space 2 have driver instructions on where to leave packages not just general areas such as must be left with resident not left anywhere else. Also on the survey it popped over and I could not clear particular answer so I'm not sure if it's correct I can't move backwards thank you
1370,Sam Rafeedie,"December 1, 2019",1, Can't edit the HUGE FONTS. The Tracking no. takes up more than a third of the page. I spent hours looking for a link to edit the fonts unsuccessfully. Why did you change your App. I used to love it.
1371,Michael Inouye,"April 7, 2020",4, App works very well!
1372,Jyl Beanz,"January 20, 2020",5, I like the app because you don't heave to keep going online & typing your tracking number. The app tells you when it's shipped & updates you on its location. And you never have to worry about the tracking number. I wish it had more options but perhaps they will eventually.
1373,Cameron Caldwell,"March 10, 2020",5," Great app! UPS does a fantastic job! Only wish I could easily remove item's from tracking after they're delivered, like USPS and FedEx do."
1374,Kathleen Larson,"March 11, 2020",5, I love this app. It lets me know when UPS is close so i am able to get it. We live in a rural area so this works fantastic!!
1375,Tracy White,"March 29, 2020",5, UPS is almost always accurate. It's reassuring to be able to confirm detailed info about deliveries.
1376,David Tenney,"April 17, 2020",4, Pretty good communication 👍
1377,Jeffrey Colussy,"November 19, 2019",5," Favorite part of this app for me is that it automatically saves tracking number. I can open a tracking number from email, Ebay, amazon, wherever.... and all are in my UPS app when I open it. Also, you can rename the number to what the package is for easy identification."
1378,Ed Wahner,"January 5, 2020",5, I love the app! Everything works like it should and it's nice getting delivery updates via text or push notifications. It's w way easier with an app versus going on line logging in and all that. But the online method was never a problem either.
1379,Taryn McCleary,"November 11, 2019",3, Nice looking app. It is really annoying that you have to sign in every. single. time. It's a pain that it doesnt just keep you signed in. Otherwise no other complaints.
1380,Karen Driver,"November 26, 2019",4," This app still has a few bugs when using a samsung galaxy s8. But overall, it is a great app which can track all shipments sent or received. You can file claims, upload documents and modify deliveries when necessary."
1381,Daniel Machen,"January 22, 2020",5, I have great experiences with this delivery app. The push messages are a great part of the app letting you know when and where your delivery is or left in mail box ( size must be of letter type) when package has been delivered. A great App for Tracking your shipments.
1382,Bill Bryant,"January 28, 2020",5, I really like the app. It let me know when I have package in transit from the sender to the date of delivery.

1388,Ann Karby,"January 7, 2020",5, It really helps plan for deliveries. It also helps when I realize the driver had rerouted my package to the post office and shouldn't have! I have found this app very useful! No problems or annoying ad's.
1389,Doug Wedman,"November 14, 2019",1," Like another recent review (Nov 2019), this app is currently broken. Constant error message -- tracking service currently unavailable. Until they fix it, try another solution."

1398,Helen Rideout,"December 12, 2019",5, The app was helpful since 3 deliveries have taken instead of 2 days from Amazon 5 days for 1 and 6 days for the other and they have 20 different entries for their journey to get here. The snowstorm wasn't that bad and truck was less than 1/2 mile away 3 of those days. Sorry had to vent.

My normal driver is good.
1405,Sugar Hill,"December 4, 2019",5, I love knowing when any packages to my address have been delivered regardless of which resident they are for. And tracking and making changes to the delivery is quick and easy. The app is extremely user friendly.

If you are waiting on a delivery and you need to be there to get the package and you are given a several hour window, you could decide if you have time to go make a run or not before your package arrives. Most times its fine to sit at your home for several hours, BUT if you live in a bad neighborhood where 'things' seem to disappear without a trace, this feature could be handy. I believe when your package is scanned just before it's delivered, that scanner is connected via satellite to the internet so it could be possible."
1416,johnnie jennings,"November 21, 2019",5," This is a great app because once my delivery went to the wrong address and it said that the driver had somebody signed for my package and none of that was true, but because of the app I few what it was deliveredthat and was able to contact the UPS and find my package."

1418,Kimberly Langston,"December 20, 2019",5, I absolutely love this app! It alerts me to when my packages are scheduled to be delivered and it is pretty accurate. So many are having their packages stolen and I think this app helps in deterring them.
1419,Dewey Sasser,"December 21, 2019",3, Awkward to use. The UPS web site was straight forward. The app...not so much. Too easy to hit the wrong button lose all the info you've entered. On the plus side...it does allow you to create shipping labels.

I once had to track down the truck & easily tracked it down.

Got home to find another failed attempt at home despite the app saying it had been processed. I phoned to ask what happened and was told that my request went in but the depot didn't action the request. Why have an app at all then? I also couldn't speak to the depot to ask why and the rep couldn't speak on behalf of the depot apparently. Great customer experience...

I get the motion sensor already that someone drove up then the ups delivered notification followed by my motion sensor detecting the driver leaving. Thanks to this quick turnaround I know that a real delivery was made and that all.my delivery preferences have been addressed. It's nice to have peace of mind and exact knowledge of delivery or pickups.
1769,Olivier Hautecoeur,"October 2, 2019",1," I registered online and validated the email address. But you have to register again to get access to the service and the registration page requires your membership id. And if you say that you don't have id number, you are redirected to the same page! Maybe app is good... But not for the newcomers."

First it does its own different coding of checking for WiFi or Data connection. When the phone itself already has that ability but the stupid app claims I have no internet service when I am using 4G LTE with full bars.   Then after refreshing the screen several times, it tells me where my package is and there are options available for shipping. But in order to do that, I have to register and sign into a separate service to manage that. Then after doing all that, it tells me, ""Service unavailable"".    Of the other three carriers, Canada Post, DHL, and Purolator, we have options without the need for signing in to two separate services of which both wanted unusual access to my phone including my contacts list, location and hardware control.  That last part is really stupid because even with hardware control, it could not tell I was connected to anything when I clearly was. A really stupid app. I bet all that permission they require is a way to mine our data for 3rd party purposes."
1788,Roger Gibbs,"December 15, 2018",4, Other than being slow the app seems fine. I can track a package or view future deliveries. There seems to be some UPS quirks. Sometimes a package will be out for delivery and then will say date tentative. For no apparent reason a package out for delivery will not get delivered.
1789,Duane Ross,"September 30, 2018",4," Works great for giving updates on your packages and allowing some changes such as delivery location. Sometimes it works best for me to have packages delivered to my local UPS store. The app loads slowly for me, but that's my only complaint."

1858,Keith Lettiero,"September 11, 2019",3," Edited: I had the same issue as others. Forcing to recreate account. I found it is because it's a dumb app. You must logon to the website and verify your email address again, then it works good again. Rating changed but low since this issue is annoying. Hope this helps others!"
1859,leonard smalls,"October 22, 2019",2," After an age to agree to all the various terms and conditions, and promising to give a delivery time slot it gives exactly the same information as internet tracking - i.e. by the end of the day!

1873,A Google user,"December 16, 2018",5, I love this app. Trying to guess when and if your package is going to be delivered can be stressful. With this app you get notifications the day before that you have a package being delivered. Then notifications when it is. I use it all the time.
1874,Rose Davis,"May 8, 2019",5," I love the fact I can be notified when a package is being delivered to my residence.

I have been redirected 100times in the last 4hours trying to log in and nothing. I hope UPS goes under. thanks for the help.. NOT!!!!"

Sometimes packages come a day early but you wouldn't know about it until the day it happens which sometimes this is inconvenient. If I'm able to see the progression of my package I can gauge whether it's going to be early or not and make preparations. The only tracking information I get is at the very beginning of the journey!
1957,Kelly Stine,"June 13, 2019",5," A very useful app! Accurate, too. I know when my packages are due to arrive, within a comfortable window, and can plan around that knowledge. The status updates are wonderful."
1958,Jerry T,"January 6, 2020",5," I love this App, it's a step by step guide to watch your shipping from the store to your home."
1959,AHI MEDICARE,"August 14, 2019",4," This app is definitely worth 5 stars if they just add one more thing. A place where we can request the package to be dropped at the door. For example, a hiding place that is on your front porch. Super happy having AUP S mobile app!"
1960,Ryan Johnson,"August 28, 2019",4," I love the app. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 star rating is because in the tracking section it says my package will be delivered today but in the manage section it says no deliveries scheduled for today. Other than that, the app works great."
1961,Leanne Sloan,"September 4, 2019",5, Great and useful app! I always know exactly where my packages are and when they'll be delivered. I use a medication that has to be refrigerated so this app is very much needed so I can refridgerate it as soon as it's delivered. Thanks for making suxh a great app UPS!
1962,Pam Yockey,"November 19, 2019",5," Is a great app...only issue is that if I instruct to put things in garage, there put outside in driveway...not even on the porch :-("
1963,Cynthia Gardner,"November 27, 2019",5, Works great! I always know when my packages are arriving.
1964,Sami H,"November 29, 2019",1," Awful, force logs you out, and adds no value why do I want an app to tell me the package is in transit? I can check that on the site. It would be great if you could give estimated delivery times via push notifications."
1965,Barb Powell,"December 5, 2019",5, I love the way that I can track my packages. Ups has a great system and it's very accurate also.
1966,Richard Burns,"December 18, 2019",4," Solid for tracking and planning for arrival of packages, helps avoid leaving unattended and avoid tempting theft."
1967,THERESA WERDER,"December 29, 2019",4," It's very handy. I love that it notifies me of delivery plans, without having to look for it."
1968,Jim Lingenfelder,"January 14, 2020",4, The FedEx app is very good and helpful. The tracking the delivery portion could be improved but overall I'm satisfied.
1969,Stephanie Erickson,"January 28, 2020",1," Absolute worst. After setting a password it tells me to confirm my email address in the email sent. HEY! Heres a great idea morons, how about sending the email so i can verify? What a POS."
1970,R.Stephen Jordan,"January 28, 2020",5, Easy to use Spot on with updates and delivery times GO UPS!
1971,Dee,"February 3, 2020",5, Best delivery service ever! Friendly and pleasant drivers. Notifications thorough and correct.

1973,Renegade Logic,"April 8, 2020",5, Simple. Secure. Straight to the point. UPS and there respected affiliated companies keep up the good work. Awesome!
1974,Milton Mizenburg,"October 1, 2018",4," Nice. I don't have to keep logging in to track packages. It's intuitive so that I don't have to enter tracking numbers from Ebay or Amazon. Once, I even had an option to upgrade shipping. Would be nice if I could ship using just the app..."
1975,Elizabeth Quinn,"December 19, 2019",5, UPS is accurate & on time. I like the tracking feature & on time deliveries. Notifications come in handy.
1976,Nomer Penaranda,"December 14, 2018",1," I don't know if the app actually works it works for tracking package but the delivery preference doesn't I guess I set my preference for all packages to be left at the front door and no signature required, and they still don't do it, and it is annoying."
1977,paul lail,"December 4, 2018",5, I think this app is awesome. It's very nice to get immediate alerts when packages are coming. And it's also nice to know when packages have arrived with the immediate text alert that package has been delivered
1978,Pam L,"January 5, 2019",5," I love that I get such accurate updates on tracking my orders. I know when it will be delivered, can change the day it's delivered if I want to be there when it arrives or I can choose to pick it up at the UPS Customer Service Center or Access Point!"
1979,John Zavacki,"February 12, 2019",5, Very useful and accurate. Updates in real time and offers a great way to remotely use all of UPS' best features. However- an option to toggle back to the dark display would be much easier on my eyes.
1980,Tung Tran Hoang,"April 27, 2019",3," The display is good and easy to use. Should add ""leave message for driver"" function, the delivery instruction is not enough. I need space that I can write how I want my package to be shipped."
1981,MZ Normann,"November 1, 2018",4, Great app for tracking deliveries. You can find out where your parcel is and changes. Delivery windows are tight and you can redirect your parcels as needed. I can't imagine the Christmas season without it!
1982,Anastasia Cole,"May 3, 2019",5," Great way to track packages quickly. This app gives great updates on where your package is and if there are delays and the reasons why, if they are delays. Very informative!"
1983,Floyd Koenig,"October 1, 2018",4," The only thing I don't like is that it takes a long time to start up. Otherwise, it is nice that my UPS automatically sees packages that are being delivered to your address that are addressed to you, before you give it the tracking number. UPS is good at service."
1984,A Google user,"November 23, 2018",1, Doesn't tell me anything more than the email notifications I got. This lazy excuse for an app even redirects to their normal site if you want detailed GPS tracking of vehicle. You may as well just use a web browser (for their site) instead of using this. Uninstalled.
1985,A Google user,"December 23, 2018",1," App is useless compared to browser. It kept wanting me to sign up for UPS MyShip after I already signed in with the account I use just fine for it in the mobile browser. Somehow, the app just can't reconcile one half of my profile info with the other."
1986,Ceasar Diaz,"April 16, 2019",5," Excellent app, a great way to manage and track your outgoing and incoming packages. Great Way to schedule pickups, figure out shipping cost, and ease of use to manage all your UPS needs."
1987,Margaret M Kautz,"June 3, 2019",5, A great way to keep track of packages to be delivered. especially in this time of package thefts. You can reset the day of delivery if you will not be home or you can be on the lookout around the posted scheduled time for delivery. A wonderful advantage.
1988,John McGinty,"June 4, 2019",4," My first time using the App , very easy to navigate and control according to my schedule and yours, so far it has kept me right on track with the estimated time of arrival, great so far."
1989,Kathy Kimberlain,"June 29, 2019",2," I signed up for this app as suggested in email which said it was a free app.  Then I was asked to enter my credit card information.  If it is a free app, why do you need my credit card information?  The app will not let me submit without that information.  Why?"
1990,Kathy Gilmore,"September 6, 2019",5, I love this app as I can track when my packages will arrive. UPS MyChoice is particularity nice as I can track in real time where my driver is and when they are in my neighborhood. It is so accurate that I've been able to meet my driver at the door. Definitely 5 stars!
1991,Lloyd Mitchell,"November 19, 2019",5," I run a business and the app does wonders. Keeps me informed on a minute to minute basis of where the items are, when they will be delivered or any exceptions so my customers can be kept informed."
1992,Chris Gilbert,"November 20, 2019",5," Keeps me up to date with my deliveries. Notifies me so I don't miss the driver at the door, usually withing 30 seconds after they arrive. Love that about the app."
1993,Tina Petersen,"December 2, 2019",5, Love this app! So easy to use and notifications on packages are so helpful.
1994,Jamie Crapps,"December 2, 2019",4, Great overall - would be nice if you could actually put a hold on packages when needed.

1996,Diane Hallgren,"December 3, 2019",5, Easier to use than the website when you're on the go. Really like it!
1997,Anna White,"December 5, 2019",5, Much more convenient than the full website. It's very easy to navigate and it's simple to use and understand.

1999,Karl Vonk,"December 9, 2019",4, UPS App very convenient for tracking incoming packages. I have not used any of the other features.

2006,Yvonne Cervantes,"January 29, 2020",5, I like the capability of tracking anticipated deliveries and the updates from ship date to package arrival.
2007,A Google user,"November 24, 2018",5," Since it's my 1st time using the mobile app, my opinion is limited. I have always used UPS on my computer & I find that useful (except when UPDATES aren't applied in a timely manner). It's a busy season now & UPS is probably getting overwhelmed. U Re forgiven."
2008,J. FLOOD,"November 14, 2018",5, This app is reliable. It is awesome!! I can trust this app to help me track my package with current accuracy. I don't have to worry or stress myself and I am grateful that my package is on its way.

You can even just google ups tracking, put # n will show where package is. Guess some peeps are not to BRIGHT OR JUST DUMB!"
2011,Dean K,"June 4, 2019",5, i like it. the main part I do like about the app is it gives you live tracking of the vehicle your package is on. It also automatically updates an alert you when you do have packages arriving.
2012,Arthur Zaslawski,"May 28, 2019",4," Good application overall. I have pick up pending, but the application shows 'Reaft for UPS' which is confusing. The same message is displayed on the website, so I don't think it is application's fault."

I can even see where the truck is on the day of delivery - in my town, in my neighborhood or on my street. The app also sends delivery notices. The best feature, in my opinion, is the fact that your tracking number is included in every text; you don't have to find it every time you want to check on the status of your package. Robin, MD"
2015,Janny S.,"September 5, 2019",5, The app is easy to work around. You type in your tracking number and it manages it all for you. You can keep track very easily. Looks of it is easy and what i love is an easy way to get from point A to the end of the alphabet.
2016,J W,"September 5, 2019",5, Tracking packages made even easier. The app is so easy to navigate. I like that you can see upcoming deliveries in one screen and have the option to change deliveries if need be. Great app!

2073,Cassandra Hamblen,"December 27, 2018",4, Easy to use and fairly accurate! I really like. It is helpful especially when you have a delivery that requires someone to sign. You can change the date and/or time so you will not miss the delivery.
2074,Caleb Markle,"April 18, 2019",4," this app does what you expect it to, you can manage your deliveries and be notified about incoming packages. I would like to see them make the app a little more responsive, as it feels a little android 5.0, but that's kinda nitpicky"
2075,Tsrif Tsal,"April 21, 2019",5," I'm a local traveling rep. It's important that I know when a delivery is coming to my home. Thanks to this app, I can fenagle my schedule to be able to get back home to receive the parcel, especially if a signature is required. The following of the driver's route is awesome!"
2076,MELING WOOTEN,"May 22, 2019",5," Love it. It's let me know every moves the packages makes, and it also let you know when, and the time your packages will arrive. It also let you know that your packages has been delivered."
2077,miggz400,"December 13, 2018",5, Awesome app! I use it to track my packages and leave simple instructions for the driver if I'm going to be away from home. It's been very helpful and supportive with my deliveries. I'm very happy with this app.
2078,Todd Ziegler,"May 3, 2019",4, This is a good app but has one flaw. It is very hard to add your tracking number. You almost have to wait for ups to add but other than that I would recommend using the app.
2079,Angelina Arevalo,"January 8, 2019",1, When I would try to login it would tell me to verify email first. So then I would go to my email and verify email listed. And still did the same thing over and over and over. So I finally just decided to delete the app.
2080,Lynne Tally,"March 7, 2019",5, I appreciate how accurately this app tracks packages and how quickly I'm notified when the package has been delivered. I recommend using it if you don't want your packages sitting on your step all day.
2081,Robert Benoit,"September 22, 2018",2," It used to be a great app until the latest update. Now it just freezes when I try to get my tracking info. Uninstalled then reinstalled and still the same, it keeps freezing. Please fix"
2082,A Google user,"March 4, 2019",5, love being able to just click on the app and all your stuff is right there instead of opening my email. finding the email im looking for. open that then click on this and click on that. just awesome.
2083,Pat Painter,"June 4, 2019",5, Great app! I love knowing when to expect packages & having the option to redirect them or change the delivery date. They keep you informed every step of the way. Love UPS app!!
2084,Randy Goodwin,"July 2, 2019",5, I find it so convenient as well as helpful to be able to check on the progression of my packages and to know when they will be delivered! This is a perfect tool to beat back the porch Pirates!
2085,Tracy,"June 21, 2019",5," I rely on this app so much! It's so easy to navigate and if I need to schedule or reschedule a pick up or delivery, there's no hassle. Great app! Thank you UPS for making my life so much easier!🥰❤"
2086,Simon Palmer,"July 31, 2019",1," Utterly useless. Makes you sign up to see when your package will arrive - the only company to do so, then promptly sends you round in circles asking you to sign up again. Simply doesn't work, this isn't the 90s"
2087,Glenda Spiwak,"July 23, 2019",5, Found the app to be dependable. Realize that info is only as good as the person who inputs the data but so far that has been great. Like knowing the status of packages as it happens.
2088,Darren Walker,"October 2, 2019",2," I thought maybe this app would give a more detailed delivery time, other than 'anytime today', which frankly, compared to other courier companies (who provide you with texts and emails saying where their drivers are), is almost completely useless information."
2089,Karen Bennett,"November 19, 2019",4," The app works great and the UPS drivers work really hard especially during the holidays, but I REALLY WISH they would not just leave the PKG out on the porch without ringing the doorbell!"
2090,Jay Gar,"December 2, 2019",4, It's slow to update. It's hard to set optional delivery instructions.
2091,Thelma Reed,"December 4, 2019",5, Lets you know where your package is located and when it was delivered. Updates if there is a schedule change. Great app!
2092,Chris Buchanan,"December 4, 2019",5, I love the up to date info and tracking this app is amazing and easily navigatable!!

2096,John Hojnowski,"December 11, 2019",5," So easy to use, you know exactly when your package is being delivered I wish the FedEx app worked as good"

2105,Kevin Osbourne,"March 18, 2020",5, I use the app two or three times a week.

2107,eugene blackson,"April 23, 2020",3," First experience was bad but the next on point. This is great, would recommend. I don't expect perfection everytime. I order, i mean....I ORDER. This is good to have if YOU ORDER."
2108,Angela P Gaines,"August 28, 2019",5, One of the few apps that does what I need without a bunch of extra stuff. I love that miraculously the app picks up almost any UPS order without me having to track the order down; many times even before I hear from the merchant.

2110,K. Goldbaum,"May 13, 2019",4," My directions have been followed about 30 times with this app, and 1 not having been followed. That's a good record. I am able to track, check, and control my deliveries."
2111,Gordon Nodine,"October 12, 2018",4," Pretty cool, I get notifications about when my package will arrive. I can see where it came from and the stops it makes. I can pick a place at my home to have it placed. I recommend this app."
2112,Ty Mc Flash,"May 7, 2019",1, Waste of time. All the trouble of signing up for up to date alerts and you get no more info than you would just tracking online via website. Just seems like a way to get your email address amd send spam.
2113,Ron & Gloria Wilson,"April 13, 2019",5," I frequently order online. This app not only let's me know when packages will be arriving but also let's me change the drop off point if I'm not going to be home. I can also ""nickname"" the arriving packages so I know at a glance what will be in the box. A great service, I love it!"
2114,Kristin Stattel,"September 20, 2018",5," Love this app! I can keep track of all my Ups packages! Once you have an account, you don't have to manually add in your tracking numbers. It's great, especially for those of us who shop online a lot!"
2115,Aaron Dolan,"June 5, 2019",4," I don't use it often and only to track incoming packages. it seems to change a lot and my main use is to release the signature which can be difficult to get to somtimes,"
2116,Robert Miller,"June 12, 2019",4," I can say that ups is not a bad way to go when receiving packages from online orders. it may take a while if your not paying more for fast shipping or ups ground but overall its great, I haven't had one package that was damaged and that's what keeps me coming back! thanks UPS"

I really wish more companies would ship with USPS."
2119,David Roberts,"September 4, 2019",4, It keeps displaying at 1st and old address that I haven't lived at for 5 years. It would be nice if that would fall off because I wonder if the system at some point is going to accidentally default back to that.
2120,Pam M,"November 20, 2019",5, I love to be able to track packages from various merchants all in one place!

2130,John James,"March 20, 2020",4, App works awesome.Was easy to navigate threw and very helpful.
2131,Cameron,"April 18, 2019",5, I love this app because it tells you where your package is and it gives you an estimated time of arrival on the day that your package is supposed to be delivered it's amazing And you can keep track of every single package through UPS right here on this app😁😁😁😁😁😁
2132,L,"May 16, 2019",1, Absolutely appalled. Only AFTER the lengthy sign-up proccess did I have the option to check if the tracking service was even avaliable in my area and turns out it isn't. So now they have my personal data for nothing. Waste of time and pointless invasion of privacy.
2133,Chris Lada,"April 21, 2019",4," Great app. I thought I would have to enter tracking numbers for my 2 package manually, but as soon as I opened the app all the information was right there."
2134,A Google user,"November 13, 2018",2," Jumped through all the hoops to register, only to find it only allows you to have a parcel redirected to one of their access points. Disappointing and a total waste of time installing. Other company's app allow redirection to a local address."
2135,Dennis,"May 2, 2019",4, Good solid app. I would like them to improve driver instruction text a little more than this door and PIN. Drivers for some reason don't ring doorbells or read notes then leave doortags that I must not be home.
2136,Vera Toulmin,"May 6, 2019",5," I love this app and the information it provides; however, I get two exact emails every day to my same address...Only one is sufficient as they are identical. Thank you."
2137,Cameron Collins,"November 23, 2018",1," For some reason they limit the amount of characters in an email for login, and my ups email has more characters than is allowed, so the app is completely worthless. Bizarre."
2138,The Mountain Midget,"March 18, 2019",5," So easy to manage any delivery coming to your house! Copy and paste your tracking number into your clipboard, then paste it into the app, give it a nickname, and set up what alerts you want. SO SIMPLE!"
2139,Suntech Tinting,"June 26, 2019",5, The ability to track and manage packages with this app is excellent. I can see where the packages last location and can determine if I can still pick it up at a customer center.
2140,Elayna Boucher,"July 9, 2019",1, cannot get the app to work. reset pw several times and keeps saying I need to confirm with email that is sent but yet I am not getting the email. so it says request another but you can't and makes you go through everything again and again. frustrated!
2141,Sherri Cushing,"July 11, 2019",1, Absolutely HORRIBLE! The login sucks ridiculously. programmer needs to be replaced. Take the app down until the wrinkles are ironed out. Don't waste your time on it.
2142,Ralph Cox,"July 15, 2019",1," not thought through. Takes you through to sign up to do anything, but if you are already signed up it won't let you log in which means you are stuck doing anything. I always groan when somebody is sending me a parcel via ups"

Only benefit is i can see tracking numbers way faster than via email to know somethings coming."
2144,BrickBros Manson,"September 3, 2019",5, Its fantastic... I have advance notice of my packages and where they're coming from. I can make delivery changes and I can see their progress. I love it when my senders use UPS! They make other shippers look 50 years behind when it comes to logistics.

2170,Cory G,"August 11, 2019",2," app is nice when it works, but regularly will drop all of my saved packages, display nothing, then when I try to reload them will say tracking information unavailable. I dont see the point in using it if it only works maybe 30% of the time."

2185,Neil Dennis,"November 26, 2018",3, Slow and no better than its online equivalent. Takes ages to retrieve any information. While UPS continues not to offer estimated 1 or 2 hour delivery windows like most of its competitors then the app has little additional benefit.

2194,Lynda Bridwell,"June 20, 2019",5," I love the UPS Mobile app. I love being able to follow the truck and see when it is close to my house. We received a lot of packages, so it is very nice to be able to track the packages and actually follow the driver."
2195,Tracie Bohannon,"July 3, 2019",4," When I click on Track, it will say I don't have a package on the way...even though I just saw it in route on the truck under Manage! Other than that i like the app!!"
2196,Morris Wallace,"July 5, 2019",4," App is ok for the most part. Now actual delivery can be hit and miss, but most services are the same. Online UPS gives same info, but app is somewhat easier to use."
2197,Andrew Gobel,"July 16, 2019",3," App works OK when logged in. Problem is, when using a linked Google account to log in, it becomes logged out every time you close the app and you have to re-log in every time app is opened."
2198,Nukka Repo,"July 25, 2019",2," Sign in required constantly, screen after screen, again and again!!! The email address verification link is HIDDEN in the email as normal black text! So pissed off I cannot recommend this app at all!"
2199,james Daum,"August 5, 2019",2," very difficult to setup account. the AI just could NOT recognize an apartment number. after multiple attempts, it finally got it. I'm not impressed with this app at all."
2200,Onesimo Solis,"September 9, 2019",4, I really like this app. The new Follow my shipment feature is a really nice addition. I also like that I can manage delivery and shipping instructions. Very well done.
2201,Troy Spetz,"October 26, 2019",1," It is not possible to set the preference for UPS pickup point, after first delivery attempt. After selecting the pickup point, it tells me I am trying to leave the screen without saving my preference. Doesn't work like related 'skip my house and deliver directly to pickup point option'."
2202,Raul Medina,"November 20, 2019",4," App works good, for a while it showed a real time map, but not any more"
2203,barbour29,"November 25, 2019",5, This app is easy to navigate through plus this app keep you updated on your deliveries very well.this app is worth having.
2204,Dewayne Coleman,"November 28, 2019",5, Love this app. you can do everything from changing the delivery option to shipping a package

2206,Shawn Lynch,"December 1, 2019",5, Up to date daily tracking. Very happy with all of UPS's services and communications!
2207,Alice Fleury,"December 4, 2019",4, I love how this AP dings to let me know I have a package coming. I order books in advance of publish and it's fun to know when it's been shipped and on way!
2208,Rupert DuBois,"December 11, 2019",5, I always get my package on time unless there's a problem and they notify me and we go from there THANK YOU !
2209,Jennifer Gunderson,"December 11, 2019",5, I really like the notifications as well as real time tracking for certain shipping services!
2210,Greg Crnkovich,"December 23, 2019",4, Very good at tracking. Only wish would incorporate sender info to help distinguish pkgs.
2211,MaverickDipper,"January 3, 2020",1, Useless app that is difficult and inconvenient to use. Representative of the company's customer service as a whole. Not recommended.
2212,Thad Raines,"December 21, 2019",5, This is a great tool for checking the delivery times of packages. It is very easy to use.
2213,Kathrine Ganoe,"December 20, 2019",5, I love this app. It is so easy to track my packages every step of the way.
2214,Paul Lavallee,"January 6, 2020",5, Works as described. Can follow packages been set so there not missed.
2215,Ron Lewis,"October 24, 2018",5, I do a lot of desktop computer work. I like the UPS app because it is not always convenient to get to my computer to check the status of my inbound packages. This app lets me check status on my phone wherever I am
2216,Lisa R,"October 31, 2018",5, Great App! I use it all the time to track my packages and know if my item has been delivered. So far Ive never had s problem with it.
2217,ShowNuffDaKing,"May 8, 2019",4, I'm really enjoying the app you get text notifications and you also have the ability to send updates to the driver like where you want your package dropped I would like additional options like behind screen door etc.
2218,Kitty Kelsor,"May 2, 2019",5, This app is very accurate & it's so mych better to interact w/ UPS directly when expecting a delivery as opposed to a vendor. it makes receiving packages alot easier when U know exactly when to expect it. Just try it if U get deliveries.
2219,Daniel Miller,"October 2, 2018",5," Easy, simple installation, app does most of the heavy lifting, shows exactly what criteria are required at each step. Nice."
2220,Charles Toogood,"April 22, 2019",5," Great app. Give's you all the information you need to assist in a safe and secure package delivery. If you have ever had a delivery from UPS or may in the future, you should have this app."
2221,Cw Smith,"May 10, 2019",4, UPS is the way to go and knowing about your deliveries is very helpful to prevent lost packages. I don't often see it but showing a photo of the delivered package is fantastic! It only appears when sending to GA so hope this expands.
2222,Ray Krass,"April 12, 2019",5," Easy to use. Allows tracking of delivery vehicle so that I can be home, if I want, when it arrives. Drivers are careful in following any directions I add on the app."
2223,Linda Davis,"December 20, 2018",5," Convenient control of deliveries or shipments. Easy to understand and navigate, set preferences, and be kept up to date about all shipments coming or going."
2224,Charles McDonald,"January 30, 2019",4," when away, the ability to control your package(s) en route to its destination is cool, would have given it 5 stars, some changes cant be done unless an delivery attempt is made. still a good app tho."
2225,DC Y.,"June 5, 2019",5, this is a very convenient app and lets me know location of my shipments and almost the exact time that it's going to arrive. I am very pleased with the app and makes it so much easier.
2226,Bill Johnson,"May 31, 2019",5, Great app to keep track of all my incoming packages being delivered . Also to track them from shipper to being delivered to me.I always know where they are and when they will be delivered.
2227,James Fraboni,"September 24, 2019",2," Hey your web site's Schedule a Pickup has been down for more than 48 hours now, beginning Sept 22 or earlier. Would it be faster for you to add that missing feature to this app than restart/fix what's broken over there?"
2228,Aaron Fritzsching,"November 22, 2019",4, Definitely room for improvement within the app itself. Still beats FedEx hands down. The two are going in total opposite directions. My choice is UPS for quality of services and management skills.
2229,Mike Bresnahan,"December 4, 2019",5, Easier to use than the website. starts and retrieves data quickly.
2230,Adam Cashion,"December 10, 2019",5," Easy to keep up with pkgs, great way to plan your day if you worry about pkgs being left unattended."

2237,Eddie Honrado,"April 25, 2019",5, This is a great app. Love the fact that it notifies me any time that package is coming to my address. Even if Im not expecting a package. Love it. 😍
2238,A Google user,"October 23, 2018",5," Comes in handy, let's you know approximately when to expect deliveries. Normally gives you a 2-4 hour window and updates through the day. Has more features I haven't used yet."

2240,Tony Russo,"April 12, 2019",5," Very helpful, so you know when you will receive your medicine. Especially when you are a diabetic like me and your medications are life supporting."
2241,CJ Caufield,"November 3, 2018",4," Good app. For some reason, it still has my previous address in addition to my current one. Not sure how to delete it. But overall, very helpful!"
2242,Connie Wilson,"February 1, 2019",5," Great app keeping me up to date on my shipments. I have never never met a rude UPS driver!! Great company. I especially thank you for your deliveries, even in this harsh winter weather. Thanks for an app that works!"
2243,Dick Powell,"September 27, 2018",5," Easy to use with helpful, almost realtime tracking status info. The app detects if you have a tracking number copied into memory, which saves some time."
2244,Anne mclaughlin,"November 21, 2019",5, I love being able to see where the delivery driver is on a map so I can gauge when to provide a signature
2245,John C. Bruccolieri,"November 9, 2018",5, Very intuitive and very easy to use. Navigation is a breeze. Tracking shipments with customized notifications is a virtue. Thanks UPS!
2246,tony 0,"April 17, 2019",5," This app is awesome. I get an email each time a package is shipped with the day it will be delivered. Also, sending a package is easy and they will pick it up. Thanks UPS"
2247,Brenda Beers,"December 8, 2018",4, The app is quite good. It's better than the last delivery I had yesterday. I guess he was just filling in for my regular carrier. Luckily nothing was damaged. He didn't even see me standing in the doorway. Anyways I am happy with the app.
2248,Jonna Quigg,"September 22, 2018",3," Ok, but could be better. I shouldn't have to add tracking numbers. FedEx and USPS apps automatically include packages coming to me. But now, the app isn't responding even after update."
2249,Trevor March,"June 5, 2019",1," why is your app impossible to use. Same as your website. ""Log in"" ""incorrect email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"" ""forgot password"" ""invalid email"" ""sign up"" ""email already in use"". What the F***"
2250,David Weatherford,"June 23, 2019",5," Very useful tool. Lets you reroute or upgrade your package among other things. What's not to love? Has ads, but not in your face.."
2251,Desiree Moeller,"July 9, 2019",4, I appreciate that you don't have to copy and paste the tracking number. Everything is just a click away. I just wish there was a more accurate delivery time.

Everything is just a click away. I just wish there was a more accurate delivery time. I don't always have the time to wait around for the delivery and my neighborhood is notorious for five fingered discounts (theft)but overall this is a great app!
2252,Virginia Mayer,"July 26, 2019",3, I like the app I find it convenient for tracking packages. I dislike the fact I cant delete an address I no longer live at. Plus it keeps defaulting to it everytime I open the app. Very Annoying.
2253,Angel Andrews,"July 29, 2019",1," Doesn't keep you logged in. Everytime I go to check my packages or to track a package I have to log into my account, and it is a pain to do that everytime I want to go on the app."
2254,Glen Oberg,"September 6, 2019",5," Fantastic, plenty of details in the tracking selection. Easy to use app, once on a selection the flow is pretty swift, just sometimes there are delays before it initiates the task."
2255,Dave Johnson,"September 11, 2019",5, This app has proven invaluable to me on numerous occasions as I work and am never home to receive packages. This app let's you keep track of your packages and make arrangements to get your stuff.
2256,michael otis,"September 10, 2019",5," Needs the ability to store multiple addresses. I still do receive packages at other locations, but it's nice to be able to Store them- unless I'm missing domething."
2257,John Ray,"November 15, 2019",1, A nice idea only it would not accept my tracking number (It worked with my PC).
2258,Eli Matthews,"November 29, 2019",1, UPS app doesn't fully complete sign-in process if you attempt to log in via a Google account.
2259,Debbie Stegall,"December 11, 2019",4," It is hard to tell which package it is or where it is from, from what we get to read on the label.

Sometimes the name is something we have never heard of, so it still doesn't help us.

I would like to tap the tracking number and be able to see what is in the order I are receiving."
2260,Maria Williams,"December 11, 2019",5, I'm able to see when and if my package has been delivered. I'm able to select where I want the package left.
2261,William Garrett,"December 22, 2019",4, Great app but just a bit slow. Very convenient.

2272,A Google user,"January 11, 2019",5," AWESOME APP! As an Avon Representative, I have many packages sent by UPS. I can always trust the info on this app as to when my packages will arrive -always true and up to date info. I love this app!"
2273,Catrice Rhone,"December 11, 2018",1, I cannot log in with my already established log in as it does not provide enough character spaces. Frustrating as I only needed one more character.
2274,Sarena Campbell,"November 16, 2018",2, I'm logged in but I can't even manage my packages since it will only give me a sign up option and not a sign in for that part. Doesn't help me much anymore if I can't do anything besides see that something is coming.
2275,A Google user,"March 20, 2019",2," the app doesn't keep me signed in. it signs me out and sometimes won't even let me sign in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to see if that would help, but it doesn't. please fix this!"
2276,Rebecca Peterson,"December 1, 2018",1, I can't log in anymore because the username field is limited to 26 characters on Android (my email address has 28). Please fix.

2281,Tony Sturgeon,"January 23, 2019",5," This app is great. You are able to track your package almost real-time. My package was on the porch, I received an update, and the driver was getting in the truck. Excellent!"
2282,A Google user,"November 2, 2018",1, Why should I have to sign and fill so many pages to simply track my parcel! It would have been quicker to drive to Glasgow and pick the package up in person!

2285,Robert Shaw,"January 7, 2019",5," Great! Easy to use. As someone who does a lot of shopping online, it helps having the app to keep track of packages instead of using the browser everytime."
2286,Drew Parrish,"March 14, 2019",5," App works very well 99% of the time. Easy to upgrade deliveries. Regularly upgrade SurePost method... It's cheaper to upgrade the SurePost ""free delivery"" from merchant than to pay merchant more for UPS ground delivery."
2287,Tim Favero,"December 9, 2018",5, Great app. This is better than getting an email notification about package delivery as I can get immediate notifications by the app instead of having to check email!
2288,A Google user,"March 7, 2019",5, A very good and smart app. I like the way when I have a package coming I just open the app and the tracking number is already there.
2289,Phyllis Fowler,"June 25, 2019",5, I desperately needed to have a package held at UPS until I get back from vacation and this app made it so simple. It took me a few minutes of my time and I was all set up for pick up when I get home at my closest UPS Store.
2290,Hugh Collins,"September 14, 2019",5, Just downloaded it. Appears to be very user friendly if I could do it and has some exciting features that I'm really looking forward to like customizing my deliver if needed. Should make life so much easier.

2304,Paul Wade,"April 16, 2019",1, The app never recognizes when I'm connected to wifi and won't work until I disconnect and use my data. Seriously this app sucks. I never have wifi problems with any other app.
2305,KATHY BACHMANN,"May 9, 2019",4," *update: Love having this app/service. It helps when I know approximately what time my package is coming, in case I need to run errands at last minute. Haven't used it much but so far it is great."
2306,Meredith,"May 9, 2019",5, Website is not very mobile friendly both in layout and updates to phone number information fields. This app seems to be the best way to get mobile updates.
2307,Dr Zen,"May 8, 2019",1, They are lucky they got one star. The Worst app I have had to use in ages. Extremely counter-intuitive. Extremely hard to sign up and understand. Will not use it again.
2308,Mary Lee,"January 15, 2019",5, I love being text letting me know an estimated time my package will be delivered or has been delivered. Now it shows you on a map about where the truck is in respect to my home. Love this app.
2309,Terri Smith,"April 25, 2019",4, useful app...I like knowing when my packages are going to be delivered. Sends me text to keep me up to date. its definitely worth it if you use Amazon or other ecommerce deliveries.

2312,selena apodaca,"December 18, 2018",5, It is really handy locating and keeping track of my packages. with so much crime and theft it's helpful knowing when my package is due to arrive so I can plan on either being home or make different arrangements!
2313,Jason M.,"June 15, 2019",5," Easy to use app, clear and simple functionality. Nothing fancy but gets it right with everything you need to know about your parcel."
2314,Michelle T.,"July 4, 2019",5, App is very convenient only thing I don't like is when you have to sometime put in your password information after your phone sometimes updates but it is very good to have all the features work from my experience
2315,Michael Roberts,"November 5, 2019",1," Keeps logging me out, and when i drop things off using my email, the package never shows up in the app"
2316,luke1841,"November 8, 2019",1, Awful...to say that this app is a heaping pile of steamy garbage would be generous. Horrible functionality and UI. UPS makes simple things asinineically hard with this app.

2322,Gina Rosas,"January 10, 2020",5, The app works great except for I usually get noticed that my orders have been delivered a couple hours after I receive them. 🤣
2323,Andrea Conover,"May 21, 2019",1, The app doesn't tell me when packages have been delivered even though I set it to text me at all stages of delivery. And you're supposed to be able to redirect a package but there's no obvious way to do it. I don't know what its good for.
2324,ken dean,"October 25, 2018",4," Not sure what the questions have in relevance to the app, but found the app relatively easy to use. I like the app and will use it every time I use UPS for my package needs. Recommend it!!!!"
2325,Tyrone Edmond,"November 27, 2018",4," Not bad at all. Can do most of the things I would like. If possible a chat function would be great. Also, if there was a way to re-route packages that would also be beneficial."

2332,Clint Fisher,"May 31, 2019",1," Tried to make a free account, but the app wouldn't work without a promo code. I don't have one or know why a ""free"" app requires one, waste of time!"

2335,Andy Ingram,"July 4, 2019",1," Don't waste your time. Absolute rubbish. Continually asking for acknowledgement of email address, sends you to Web page, doesn't see a scheduled delivery despite inputting the scheduled package number. Its not an app. Uninstalled it."
2336,Alex Nguyen,"September 3, 2019",1, S*** app and sign up process to try and change delivery options. Created an account but keeps looping with a signing up process for ups mychoice when I've already done it!! Really infuriating as it doesnt seem to linknthe mychoice sign uo with the account created???????
2337,Frank Morgan,"September 10, 2019",1," I just used the app backed out, went back in and get locked out. Pain in the ass, was still connected and now none my passwords will work. When i get my package ill never use the app again, nor will it be recommended to abyone i know."
2338,Monica Martinez,"November 8, 2019",1, Tracking is not available. I spent my whole morning waiting for the UPS truck because it kept saying the driver will arrive soon. That was 3 hours ago. Have to change my schedule just to wait for my package because it needed my signature. App not use full at all.
2339,Nick McKeon,"November 19, 2019",1," Asking me to sign up to ups my choice when I already am. I seem to be in an eternal loop where I sign in, am then asked to sign up, I put my details in and it tells me I'm already signed up. Can't proceed beyond this point at the moment."

2347,Terry Thomas,"February 19, 2020",1, I can't even install the app. It just keeps waiting for download which has now taken over 40 minutes. This is the 4th time I've tried to install the app with the same results. What a waste of time. Maybe you should hire some Americans to write your software.
2348,komaits,"October 5, 2018",5," I love the ability to change my delivery date, address or whatever I need to change and also to be able to see any updates/changes to my deliveries. Great app, Bo ads either"

2378,Attila,"February 4, 2020",1, The company and the app are useless both. You actually can't track anything after it's out for the first delivery. Customer service lied to me two times and I was sitting 10 hours at home waiting for nothing. No compensation offered so far. Disgusting.
2379,Greg Larson,"March 12, 2020",4, Works very well for knowing where your package is.

2472,Fat Chungus,"March 25, 2019",5, Really useful app however one suggestion would be to add a delete package option from the MANAGE section. Sort of annoying seeing something delivered still there clogging the line.
2473,KT Keley,"November 11, 2018",5," I've used this app all the time and I like that I can give my delivery a ""name"" so I can remember where it's coming from. I also like that I can add drivers instructions as well."

2480,Wayne Dauber,"July 31, 2019",5," generally great. If a package is scheduled while you are away and you need to have it delivered several days later because of a trip or delivered to a neighbor, you can do that. It has worked every time."

2495,Bob,"June 7, 2019",3, must be a lot of things this app has to sort through... because it is very slow whenever it opens..... giving you opened it just a minute ago then closed it. what's up with that?

2661,Deborah Deane,"April 12, 2019",5, In thisday and time it's good to have this app so that you know what's coming and when it's coming and you can keep an eye out for it and if you don't receive it and your UPS Mobile tells you it's been delivered and then you know this notify someone that you didn't receive your package .

Also, I appreciate the notification that the package was delivered, because again, due to our rural location, occasionally a package mistakenly gets delivered to a neighbor. With the notification, I know to start texting my neighbors if the package wasn't delivered to me."

Second time this has happened recently and no response from UPS support. Also notice that every review is a 5 star review and practically worded the same.

2742,Graham Byars,"April 16, 2019",5," This app is fantastic, especially if you receive a fair amount of packages or even a lot of packages."

2749,LeVar Ward,"July 13, 2019",2, Used to be really good but for the past month or so it literally doesn't update tracking info... And I know it doesn't because Amazon will have updates and UPS will still be stuck on days earlier smh. App needs an update BAD.
2750,Gene F,"September 3, 2019",5, This alerts me to my delivery so I can get it right away. I would appreciate a proximity feature where I can know how many stops away it is.

2754,Simon Clark,"November 27, 2019",1, Utterly pointless. Simply does nothing. Offers you the option of getting a delivery window time but then asks you to sign in to another service which then just takes you back to the beginning. No way to contact ups to change a delivery option or leave instructions. It literally does nothing.
2755,johnny ross,"December 10, 2019",5," I'm not big on technology but this app is TOO easy. Even I can use it, which is great for me."

2780,Gail Korn,"September 8, 2019",5, I really like this app. If you have multiple deliveries it lets you name them so you can keep track of which package it is.
2781,Sharon Klein,"November 22, 2019",5," I UPS gifts to friends/ family, the UPS app texts me when delivered to their homes ... I have on-line purchases UPS'd to my home, UPS app emails me there's a package on its way and who shipped it, and text when delivered to my home. UPS alert app is the best, I love it!"
2782,Jim Frerichs,"December 13, 2019",5, Only bad is I can't make a permanent change. Like always deliver to front door. Outside of that this app is fantastic.

2815,Cookie Gacha,"August 19, 2019",4, I use this app as it helps me know when to expect my packages. It helps to know when to expect them as some of my items are for medical reasons and need to be brought in as soon as possible.

2819,C Lee,"October 31, 2019",1, Hopeless. There seems to no way to retrieve my Id or password. Also no way for me to get an Australian number to call. I need a prompt reply but an email form wad my only option for assistance. Every interaction with UPS was undatsfactory.

2827,Bruce Drouillard,"April 23, 2019",5," took couple minutes to setup, once that's done it's very easy to use and track your package."
2828,Kino,"April 18, 2019",1, I know my premium membership will be expired next month. You don't need to harassing me to renew it every single time when I click a tracking.

2830,Lucas Barrie,"March 12, 2019",2, This app is just not good. it misses the mark on most UX best practices and is hardly better than their moble site which is also pretty terrible. I expect so much better in 2019.
2831,J.L. Cervantes,"March 28, 2019",1," says sign up to manage your packages. sign up, ""package doesn't have the option"" to manage a package being sent to me. theyre just data mining."

Of course that did not take place. Had it not been for this app I would not have known that my package was delivered before 2pm- while no one was home. I, once again, had to miss time at work because the people at UPS do not communicate properly and essentially just lied to me. So yes the app is great and accurate, but UPS, will not ever be my first choice to use for any deliveries I need processed going forward. App ☆☆☆☆☆ UPS👎👎👎👎👎"

I know that the drivers are suppose to ""knock"" when dropping off. It's not a big deal that they do because of the App and modern technology notifying me of my packages arrival. And it probably was an Amazon driver in their personal or company car. So I didn't notice. Anyway, the app works like it is suppose to. Only a few times I didn't get tracking info until the package was almost in my state or city. And that was the company failing to provide it. I'm sure it was NOT UPS fault. Happy with the App. Download it today and track a package for Christmas!!! Now it sounds like I'm a promoter or someone pushing the App!! LoL!!! I'm not. The App works. I'm suprized anyone continued this far in reading my non sense! Sorry! ;-)"

2956,Brill Harrell,"December 22, 2018",2, Shipments for me have to be manually added and very limited options to make changes. No security code is required for all apartment buildings.

I appreciate the delivery drivers in that they respect my property & make the effort trying to conceal the package if they can; as in setting it to the side out of sight from street view. UPS is much better than the Amazon contracted delivery drivers who just dump packages, even throw the package to our front door just to avoid a few more steps. Some, not all. Thanks UPS for great service."

3382,Alisha Brown,"November 17, 2018",2, This app is hard to maneuver and why can't customers be given the option to change a delivery only once for a package?

3525,Joe Ferreira,"December 3, 2018",1, Brutal. Why use this when it's a crippled version of the website? How do you change delivery instructions? Why aren't pending deliveries displayed? An app for the sake of an app is pointless unless it's easier to use than the webpage

My package was in Clarenville, NL, at 630am, then it got sent back to Nova Scotia, literally within a half an hour!! Why didnt they just deliver the package? Instead of sending it back where it can be delayed once again due to ""weather"". And UPS doesnt have a place to store packages on the entire island? Bull poop. Wow, I think I rather have it sent through Canada Post, at least I know exactly where it is at all times, from point A to B, to C and even D. Even if it did take months to arrive... Great job UPS !!!"

Confusing with address partitioning (I'm interested in ALL my pending and previous deliveries to whatever address) it seemed to have no idea of future dates even though I'd been emailed an hour previously that delivery was ""tomorrow"". The auto phone answering system was to kill for and an expensive way to waste my time with a deadline approaching. Who was the idiot who decided to put the tracking id as a URL only? In the end I was able to use a laptop and notepad to extract the id from the URL and figure my way through the change dialog (that was obscure!) and reschedule my deliveries.

Delivery driver left notice that I needed to sign for the package three days in a row. First off, I was in the house in the very next room over at the times he supposedly knocked (my dog flips out at any knock, so I have my doubts he even knocked). I signed the back of the info notice he left saying he could leave the package. The driver ignored my signature and left the final info notice saying I can go pick it up across town. I order things online for convenience, so driving across town to pick up a package that was supposed to be delivered is frustrating. Ultimately, the most frustration came from not being able to easily submit feedback about this instance. I'd love if UPS had an easier way (or any way?) to get customer service and give feedback about drivers or situations."
4998,Karen Martinsen,"September 17, 2018",5," UPS lets me no as soon as a label has been created where package is at every day there's a update, and when it will be delivered. I signed up for text messages, but you don't have too."

7435,Tom Aageson,"November 8, 2018",1, UPS is going downhill. Drivers think dropping off a package at the foot of our rural driveway; and or putting it in front of the garage door or delivering a wet and creased box. FEDEX can deliver to the door on the provided table. Been to the UPS Hub to report the problems. Yet to see any change.

7556,David Booker,"May 22, 2019",5, Great for estimating arrivals so if I'm not home I can arrange for UPS to hold or for neighbor to pickup.

7562,Albert Cox,"June 12, 2019",5, My name is Albert Cox. I am a disabled veteran. I am extremely happy with U.P.S. my driver goes way out of his way to get any packages to me. More than anyone should have to. Thank you and God bless all of you.
7563,Carlotta Delgado,"December 12, 2019",5, This way I know what time to be home so I can get my order before some else gets it . Very easy to track what I've ordered as well thank you guys UPS

7566,Rank Overall,"May 9, 2019",1, it's so dumb that only one person in your household can enroll in ups my choice. if I wanted to surprise my wife and have it shipped at my job well tough luck. she will be able to see my changes.

7572,Andrew Butler,"December 24, 2019",2, You cant actually do most of the things you're meant to be able to do. Forget changing any delivery information if you're outside the USA
7573,Sherry King,"January 9, 2020",5, I like the idea of having a time frame so that I am not waiting all day for a delivery. With the time frame I have the time to get other business taken care of.

7578,Jakub Pína,"December 22, 2019",1," Doesn't work, at all."
7579,Terry Henderson Jr,"July 9, 2019",2, Why is there no option to instruct how you want your package delivered and not UPS options how it should be delivered i mean how the customer wants it delivered if you live in a apartment and want the driver to ring the doorbell but they don't cause they have no common sense smh
7580,Shane Pickles,"November 8, 2019",1, Dont bother wasting you time with this app. It dosent work.
7581,Janet Steingasser,"December 2, 2019",5, I love when they leave my packages inside on the porch. That way I don't have to stress out about somebody stealing them. Thank you.
7582,Ramona Roberts,"December 6, 2019",5, Lets me know exactly when my order is arriving. I can track it during the entire ordering process. Makes deliveries so much easier.
7583,Greg Pratt,"January 29, 2020",5, The new map feature is nice
7584,Desiree Britter,"April 18, 2020",5, Would like my cash winning prizes from SweepStakes to be delivered to my door mailing address ! (Happy)
7585,Neil,"December 20, 2018",1, Do not use UPS!! I used UPS to send Xmas presents to another country. UPS labeled box incorrectly now have to pay 3x sending fee as taxes before box is released. The sending fee and tax's way out cost the price of the toys. UPS don't care. Ridiculous
7586,Brad Bonato,"January 13, 2020",5," GREAT SERVICE INFO: As I would expect from a shipping/delivery company😁👍; OTHER Service Providers ""should"" take Notice! ... Are ya listening AT&T👎😡??"

7591,RR BB,"January 27, 2020",1, The worst ever delivery service. This app won't help you.
7592,Kyle Lucas,"April 3, 2020",1," Never use the UPS Store location on Broadview Road in Parma, Ohio."
7593,Martin K,"March 19, 2019",1," So, basically to see when YOUR package that YOU PAID to be delivered by UPS arrives (if you're lucky), you have to sign a monster long agreement (visible only through a tiny window) where you waive many of your consumer rights. Sounds legit."
7594,Robert Wallace,"October 25, 2018",5," The UPS app allows me total control of when, where, and how my UPS packages get delivered. In my opinion, that's all you/I/or any reasonable person should expect. Does what it promises."
