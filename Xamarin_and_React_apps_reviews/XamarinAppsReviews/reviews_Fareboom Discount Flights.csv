When I put in the flight that I needed I thought I was getting a good deal but then realized that I was not after the fact. The app had counted my lap baby as an additional person to make the rate look great. I ended up paying more than I would have had I just called the airline first. Live and learn."
1,Husam Ismail,"February 17, 2020",5," I used Fareboom for international trip including multiple stops, I loved it. I didn't have to use any airline app or website; all info I needed was in Fareboom App, with real time notification about flight status, gate assignments, etc. I will definitely use it again."
2,PHJOURNEY75,"April 21, 2020",3, Not the best prices actually...I still use expedia as well.
3,Anna Ramos,"March 13, 2020",5, Great with notifications and rates. The only bad thing is the pack of 24/7 assistance When running an International travel agency this is a must.

Finally you'll be charged lot more (after you authorize the payment) + you'll be charged additional payment from Fareboom. Note that all the money you'll pay will be in US dollars. All you'll finally will pay you'll find down after the money are taken from your bank account and there is absolutely nothing you can do about that. As well your flight may be changed without notice.

36,Serene Lee,"July 17, 2019",4," Easy to book. Only issue is to call helpdesk to verify payment. Need to call IDD and waited for 10mins till your call is picked up. Then more time taken to verify the caller, credit card etc. Easily took up to 20 mins. But once the ticket is confirmed, everything is a breeze. Great App."

38,Moni B.,"May 31, 2019",4," One of the better flight searching tools for Online Travel Agencies (OTA's)! I use this app as well as Momondo, Kayak, & Skyscanner.

40,K Workman,"October 7, 2019",4," Very good app. Baggage claim and gate information could have been more accurate, however. Although that could be more of a airline issue than an app issue."

They apologised but I did miss my flight ) Never had to pay extra to fareboomto get rerouted. I was skeptical at first but they sorted it all out in a matter of minutes not hours. I had a horrible trip but none of it was due to Fareboom. Outbound flight cancelled due to weather on the east coast. They rerouted me through Canada and made my following connection. Return trip United screwed up my first leg, had to spend an extra night in lillongwe.
