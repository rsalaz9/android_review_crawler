1,Byungsuk Kim,"October 9, 2018",3," It's straightforward but when I try to switch it to delivery, it won't let me. I have to do a work around to get it to work. The work around causes me to have to pay more instead of having for what I I could call a combo. The option just doesn't switch out when I try to change it."
2,A Google user,"December 30, 2018",3, It just isn't very user friendly. Jumps around and could be more streamlined.
3,Jason Staub,"July 10, 2019",3, milios sandwiches are great but this is a somewhat confusing and poorly designed app. I couldnt switch frim pickup to delivery? Ordering food should be easier.
4,Brian Diels,"October 16, 2019",5, Easy to use and the repeat order functionality is great!
5,Michael Fisher,"September 14, 2018",4, Glad to finally find the app. It makes things a lot easier.
6,Rachel Blynn,"September 6, 2019",5," Easy to use, speedy service, great food!"
7,Terry McElree,"May 1, 2019",5, Service is always excellent. Sandwiches are fresh & so tasty.
8,Keith Hanna,"February 3, 2020",1," I can't place an order for this company to make when they open. I want to tell them to bring me a sandwich when they decide to start business today, but I keep getting this location is not delivering right now. So instead I'm going to try to find a closed sandwich deliverer that gets me."
9,Andrew Marnocha,"October 3, 2018",5, Simple and easy to use
10,Adam,"August 28, 2019",5, The drivers are all great here!
11,Malena Clement,"August 7, 2018",5, Only down fall is you can't use regular coupon in the app
12,Tiffany Tessen,"July 18, 2018",5," Super easy to use, convenient, love it!!"
13,Prox Of Love,"May 27, 2018",1," It doesn't notify you that the location you're trying to order from is 
closed. It says that either they don't deliver or they're closed. If you 
try to change from delivery to pickup it says you can't because the ""menus 
aren't compatible."" Very poorly made app."
14,MD08,"May 24, 2018",3," It's good, but it doesn't allow you to pay with cash. That's a pretty big 
flaw. Save for that though, the app is pretty much perfect."
15,Willie Ware,"March 31, 2018",5, Love it
16,Md Cg,"September 7, 2018",3, Milios should have a rewards program!!
17,A Google user,"January 29, 2019",5, love it
