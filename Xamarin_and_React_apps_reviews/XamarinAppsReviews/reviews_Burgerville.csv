0,Samuel D.,"April 20, 2019",5, The app is easy to use even when ordering as a guest. I like this as an option and the app makes drive-thru that much better.
1,Jay Lundgreen,"July 11, 2019",1, Worthless. Menu not even current. Uninstalling.
2,Jay Watne,"September 18, 2019",1," I am very disappointed that online ordering is no longer available. It made ordering and pickup so easy for my family. All locations that I researched, which is a large area, no longer offers online ordering."
3,Corwin Hackett,"December 22, 2019",1, Awful app. Steals your money and the store doesn't even get the order.
4,Jaynee Erickson,"December 8, 2019",4, Works great!
5,Mick Taylor,"May 22, 2018",5, Very convenient
6,Tyger Reynoldson,"July 19, 2017",2, This app doesn't show which locations actually do take online orders. How can 1 proceed then..?
7,Tia Smith,"October 24, 2017",5, Way easier than going through the drive through.
8,A Google user,"March 14, 2017",4, Good except would not add coffee to the checkout basket.
