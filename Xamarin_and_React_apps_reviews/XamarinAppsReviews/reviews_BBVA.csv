0,Kris & Kayla Jones,"April 23, 2020",3," The app would be so much better if there was an option to have a live chat with an agent as opposed to sitting on hold for an hour. There needs to be more methods of communication. It is not just due to the coronavirus, because this was happening even before COVID-19 existed."

After opening a checking and savings account online the app rejects my account number and says that it is already linked to an account I own. This is my first checking or savings account with BBVA. Now I have to go and withdraw all of the money out of the account that I used to fund the new account in case they try to hold onto it somehow. Wish I had never used this bank to open a checking account!

Dont even bother unless you can spend your day at the branch getting things done"
3,JC MACK,"April 21, 2020",5, This app has always worked great! I especially like the alerts . Any time there is a withdraw or deposit I get notified.
4,Robin Vosen,"April 3, 2020",4, Was great until... I am not able to log in with my fingerprint. It freezes up and I have to close it and log in with password.

Paying a credit card bill through BBVA is almost not worth the effort. If not for a fairly high credit limit that I was given, I would scrap this all together. You guys need to study how other credit card card companies receive payments, either online or via automated phone systems, and try your best to emulate them."
7,makjamesmorrison,"April 15, 2020",2," App works when it wants to, basically just a blue screen and have to wait for next update. Not a great banking app...."
8,James Waters,"April 22, 2020",5, It's worked everytime. I'm impressed with BBVA over other banks I've worked with both personally and commercially.
9,Allen Chris Brown II,"April 13, 2020",2," As far as the app goes its pretty good but customer service being available, even before the pandemic hasn't been efficient. When you need someone its take a day and when you try to leave a call back request their system doesn't allow you to put in the time correctly. In military time or basic time."
10,Alice InWonderland,"April 16, 2020",1," Bbva sucks horribly in general. I have no idea how theyre still in business. From incompetent customer service to constantly broken app, nothing works.

11,Delores Ford,"April 5, 2020",5, I have been using a version of this app for many years. I have not had any problems with it. The updates always come on time and the notices are give 72 to 48 hour's ahead of time. Keep up the great work!!!

Very frustrating, i have been to the bank twice and called service center twice. Issue still not fixed, please help"
13,loving light,"February 19, 2020",4," This app is fine in most regards, 38 dollars for overdraft fees are way too high though and if things hit your account in the wrong order you can get a few. If they can fix that this bank and this app would be perfect. I don't think the bank wants to lose people but maybe."
14,Edgar Arasa,"April 18, 2020",5," Convinient and easier to use. Very understanding customer service representatives. I highly recommend them to everyone especially low income people who are exploited by other banks. They give free checking accounts unlike other banks. If my reviews helped you, tip me.

For some reason every week I make the same transactions and the last two weeks they put a fraud block on my card. I cant call them because it's not during business hours. Have to wait hours until its business hours to contact them. So now after waiting all night to call I've been on hold for 35 min. Frustrating. You think they would be able to see that I have made the purchases at least10 times a week for the last 6 months. Ready to change banks over it
16,KOSH Naranek,"April 5, 2020",4, Used to get notifications for purchases at walmart grocery store and withdrawls not anymore. The only notifications I receive now are for online purchases and direct deposit. I am on android 8 and the app is updated whenever play store nitifies me.
17,Jim Chappelle,"April 14, 2020",2," Alert push notifications are unreliable. The old text messaging alert system was flawless. Please either fix push notifications or bring back text alerts. And btw, i have turned off battery optimization for your app, allowed notifications, and allowed autostart."
18,Eric Johnson,"April 15, 2020",1, Website is down with a notice to download this app. App is down as well. Left with no account access whatsoever other than going to the bank..... which is closed due to Covid. Good job BBVA!
19,Lynne Moyer,"April 6, 2020",5," Very, very convenient. Find I can do practically everything from from home. Thank You. So glad I bank with BBVA."
20,La Verdad,"April 17, 2020",1," Has functioned excellently. As of recent & patiently, it does start up AT ALL. What's the deal? No further info is provided. Any directions in assistance? Nope🙃 Can anyone assist?"
21,Jarrod Davis,"March 21, 2020",5," Great app! Extremely easy to navigate and open new accounts and makes banking easier because I don't have to worry about making it into a branch before they close, even more handy now that COVID-19 has everyone mainly staying home."
22,SWGOH CLONE,"February 15, 2020",4, The app is great and very convenient. I think that a couple improvements are in order though. While viewing transactions it would be great if the time and location were included for all transactions.
23,E Michael,"March 25, 2020",5," BBVA mobile app is highly robust and reliable. I have used it for bill pay, deposits, transfers and my favorite feature... mobile check deposits. This is a full featured mobile app that does pretty much everything the web portal does."
24,sheldon harracksingh,"March 31, 2020",1," I would suggest finding a new bank. The app works amazing but the bank it's self has no customer service, and horribly long wait times. If you like to keep your money safe I would say go to a different bank."
25,Chris James,"April 6, 2020",1, Paper statements are turned on by default in this app and I was charged a 3$ fee for this. I never wanted paper statements. Ridiculous.
26,Zippy Buggy,"March 3, 2020",1, Not showing card transaction pop ups anymore. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and tried all settings and alerts and nothing. I don't know what happened. Used to work perfectly then stopped out of nowhere.
27,James Mathis,"April 5, 2020",2, I have been trying for two days to get into my account using this mobile app to no avail. All I get is a blue screen. I tried my desktop and got right in
28,Gabriel Perez,"April 20, 2020",1, The app doesn't display your username name so if you forget it and you enter it wrong more than three times it locks you out and you have to call customer care. I wouldn't bank with them. I

My only issue is sometimes when trying to use the app, it tells me it isn't able to retrieve my information, which is frustrating. I chalk it up to my lack of mobile data signal sometimes, but it seems like this app is affected more by it whereas my other apps are not. It seems there are bugs that need to be worked out, but largely, I am satisfied with the BBVA mobile banking app."

Useless over the weekend. If you get paid Friday morning and then pay a bunch of bills, you have to really keep track 9f your money yourself, because it won't update your balance for 72 hours. Meanwhile, you'll be getting receipts from your bills saying they've been paid, but the BBVA app will reflect none of this--nothing--for basically 3 days. It's pathetic."

67,Trevor Bontke,"December 28, 2019",1, Extremely difficult and confusing to set up autopay. There are two ways to set up autopay and one requires you to open a BBVA checking account.

I'd give this a half star if I could."

When you submit a payment, you don't get a confirmation number or even email (why doesn't this app send you an email that you made a payment??). This WILL lead to double payment since 1) you don't get a confirmation, 2) the balance on the loan will remain the same.  3. You have to select frequency on a loan payment....why? If I'm selecting to pay,   BBVA shouldn't have broken the app further. If you make an accidental double payment, don't let them bounce you around between the call centers in South America and Asia.

291,Kevin Moore,"August 1, 2019",3," The app is pretty good. Only issue I have run into is that I have to actually sign my check instead of just using a stamp. Without the written signature, for some reason it won't deposit the check."

297,Bobbie A.,"August 26, 2019",2, The fingerprint scanner on the note 10 needs improvement please. The app doesnt highlight where to put your finger so you have to just put it in the area where it usually is. Every time the app just freaks out and says I have to enter in password due to too many failed attempts at the fingerprint
298,Graciela Davila,"December 12, 2019",5, Easy to navigate
299,Tim Higgins,"July 4, 2019",1, To pay your credit card online you need a BBVA checking account. You can dissable your card online. Then pay credit card at a BBVA branch. Get this if you pay your credit card with cash at a BBVA branch it still takes up to three days to post. Get a capital One savor card you cannot go wrong.

302,John Billingsley,"July 26, 2019",4, I like this app so far and the convienience it provides. My main concern is security and the privacy of my personal account. Nowadays people are worried about hackers. This is a safe and secure app.
303,A Google user,"October 5, 2018",5, The app is easy to use and it is very helpful by letting you know what you just spent you don't have to login to check your statement. I'm always login to check any.
304,Kelly Branson,"June 9, 2019",1, Difficult to use. I installed the app to make it easy to pay the credit card bill. why does it have to be so hard? Just have a easy to find button that says pay card!. This company needs to take a lesson from Capital One and Chase!
305,Sunny Planas,"May 28, 2019",5, The app works great and I've never had any problems with it. Today when I went to log in it is telling me to update my password. I was wondering why as I've never been told to do that before.
306,Ant Moreno,"September 5, 2019",1," BBVA has potential of being great bank but lil BS like this stupid app not working properly, try logging in, it just repeats itself askin for my log ons and nothing.

307,Bertha Contreras,"October 8, 2019",3, I dont like how it asks me to select a frequency of how often i want money to be added to.my savings when i only want to add once.

354,Zoltron Slartibartfast,"April 30, 2019",1, As usual. BBVA dumps the Wallet app and all the useful notifications (i.e. ATM activity) and replaced it with nothing. The high school kids working on this app need to be more closely supervised.

I did leave a bad review in the beginning but BBVA Associates did do their best to help me and I really appreciate that more than they can imagine, I give him a five out of five star rating since they actually tried to make contact with me and get them settled. I'd give them a 10 out of 10 if I could."
1502,mark ceries,"July 12, 2019",4, calling BBVA yields no information about the purpose of the daily accruing notification alerts nor the information they are purposed to convey. Business as usual.

The website is simple ...Full ReviewThis app is not bad overall and accomplishes the basic functions like making a payment or checking a balance but is not near as well planned as the website. It is structured like a puzzle that has to be navigated like a maze and often can not tell you the information you seek. The website is simple and informative. Hopefully future plans for this app are to simplify. The help feature tends to send you in circles looking at features that you likely have seen already while looking for what you needed. Try to answer these questions in a few minutes. What is my interest rate, how long is my special rate on a purchase, how much was the payment I made a few hours ago, and did a payment I just made go through ok...on the app this is going to take too long. It is better to just call them. Oh, and to save you time trying to find it, the auto pay function is done through mail or fax not on the web or through this app."

When it works it's not even good for checking account balances, they sort them as they wish to maximize penalties and withdrawals that should show up immediately are marked as pending. Since they sort everything according to their whims and randomly mark transactions as pending, you'd think you could search for drafts by name, but their search engine is incapable of this simple feat. You can't contact anyone unless you go through the website which doesn't matter because they will not contact you back. If you call them, they will lie to you to get you off the phone. I deposited a check a week ago on an account that was over drafted $180. Somehow, in one week, with nothing else going through, I somehow owe this mafia bank $500! They are the WORST. There is no comparison. You're better off burying your money in the yard like a dog than dealing with the hassles of this bank and their terrible app."
2101,A Google user,"December 30, 2017",5, I have had a really great experience with the telephone representatives who work for this establishment. And I've never once been overlooked with a concern by a scripted service recording or call rep. Thanks.

There's zero advantage to use this bank over any other big bank, probably more reasons not to use..."

Now it has trouble taking images of the check and when it does accept the image it sends an unclear image thus resulting in a return deposit fee.  I spoke to a representative at the mobile banking customer service and was told that the transaction would be totally reversed but said nothing about a return deposit fee.  The rep at mobile customer service i spoke to this morning wouldn't help me and was going to hang up on me even when I asked her for a supervisor.  I went to a branch and told a really nice lady about the situation and got it taken care of for me.  I'm never depositing checks with the mobile banking app again!
2356,David Laurie,"July 18, 2017",1," Worthless since update. ""Better"" apparently means ""no longer able to deposit checks"". Any software generated check with placeholders like leading or trailing asterisks cannot be deposited. A banking app should be able to handle computer generated checks. That's online banking 101."

It was working just fine until this latest update. Now half the time I can't log in or it doesn't remember my login information and I constantly get System Errors.

My new account became overdrawn by ONE CENT, which was caused by their internal process, and they STOLE a $32 overdraft fee from me and are refusing to return it! Beware of these white collar criminals, and do your banking somewhere else. If you have an account with BBVA, I would recommend withdrawing your money and closing your account ASAP, and putting it into a reputable bank or credit union."

It works in that it allows me to check the status of my accounts, pay bills and make mobile deposits.   What this app lacks is any checks and balances for deposits that usually comes with banking and accounting. If I make 5 deposits of the same amount during the month, I cannot from my online statement tell which customer's check was deposited. I can't tell if I have a deposit or an accounts receivable problem. There is not a picture of the check that I took a picture of. When I make the deposit, there is a 6-7 digit number number that is displayed on my phone. I record that number, but BBV Compass never shows that number again. The 800 number and the online support people tell they are working on a solution, but I have been waiting for several months. If I go to the bank for deposit, they make a copy of the check, not for mobile banking.   I consider not having checks and balances on a mobile app a serious problem."

I believe that I would give the app 5 Stars if it could/would do the following: 1. Show Copies of Checks Deposited (currently you can only see copies of checks deposited on your phone), 2.

It simply takes too much time and focus to use it while you are actually on the go. For example, if I try to pull it up now, it takes forever to finish drawing the initial map because it finds ""at least 90 Branches/ATMs in this area."" That's because it includes every Allpoint network ATM, and there's no setting to exclude those. It takes a lot of pinch-to-zoom before I can even find my own location among the 90+ icons. If I switch from map to list view, I can do a search to filter out ATMs by looking for ""branch"" in the description, but that takes many taps to accomplish, and there's no way to make list view the initial view by default. What this app really needs is some shortcuts for Nearest Branch, Nearest ATM, and Nearest BBVA ATM. Save the 90 data points for desktop web site; when I'm on the go, I want to be able to tap once and find the most convenient location ASAP."
