0,Mark Zero,"November 18, 2019",4," App works great for me now, no more crashing and even an email coupon worked. Feel leery typing my credit card into the app instead of using Google Pay or something else like that, though."

Cold foods, like cold sandwiches & salads taken to go are not supposed to be taxed. Ordering through the app, it charges taxes on these cold items, yet ordering in-store, not taxed. Unless you dine in, then you are charged a dine in tax. So why is everything in this app charged with taxes on each & every item? I pay less by ordering in-store than by using the app.There are no rewards, no incentives."
3,April Michelle,"February 19, 2020",1, App continues to close when attempting top place order. It's been like this for couple months. Please fix.
4,Emily Leiker,"February 11, 2019",4, I wish there was an option in the salad section to substitute a different kind of lettuce for what's normally the base lettuce. Example: if something comes with spring mix I would like to substitute romaine for it.
5,Felix R.,"March 27, 2019",3, Attempted to check out a 2-from-4 special but the app doesn't accept 3 digits as a code.
6,Keith Harloff,"January 26, 2019",1, thought this app would allow me to load gift cards on it and keep as a balance to pay at store without having to carry all the cards in my wallet. take a lesson from starbucks.
7,C E,"October 31, 2018",1," Was told to download the app for the rewards program, just ordered food here at the restaurant and was told the rewards program was discontinued!"
8,Charles Kase,"August 25, 2019",1, Kept on rejecting my payment information. Utterly useless app
9,Haley Jessup,"November 18, 2019",1, I wish there was a way to browse the menu without clicking place an order
10,Dorothy Smith,"February 24, 2020",1," Keeps shutting down, won't let me order. I'll keep ordering from Panera until the app is fixed."
11,A Google user,"November 10, 2018",1," In order to get specials, I must receive emails on my phone I don't want emails on my phone."

14,Nicholas Mays,"December 14, 2018",1, Clunky and messed up my order. Total P.O.S. I don't understand why it's so hard for a big company like this to make a good app. Copy Starbucks for F#$! Sake... Jesus.
15,Rudy Zuniga,"January 7, 2019",1," App sucks, can't even order breakfast. Coupons would be nice."

18,Eric Williamson,"March 3, 2020",2," Can't place an order for tomorrow. I want to place an order for tomorrow morning, the 4th. The date slider shows the 4th as an option, but when you scroll to it, it ignores the 4th and forces me to the 3rd."

24,Tracie Grady,"September 2, 2018",5," Haven't used the app yet, but the food made me download it so I'll come back and order through the app to avoid the line. Oh My Gosh-PANCAKES are almost to-die- for!"

26,Mario Bravo,"February 13, 2019",1, CHEAPSKATE COMPANY.
27,Micah Nowlin,"July 6, 2018",5," The app works well for me. I find the category of food and then I'm 
presented with pictures. Once I choose something it presents me with 
relevant customization options and soft upsells at the end"
28,Peter Olpe,"June 23, 2018",1," Installed for 1 hour and my phone notified me it was draining battery too

36,Loan Nguyen,"June 1, 2018",1," Lost all my Rewards in this new app, which apparently is only for ordering. 
DON'T UPDATE lest you want to lose your Rewards. Their customer service is 
horrendous...it's been 2 weeks and still no resolution from them."
