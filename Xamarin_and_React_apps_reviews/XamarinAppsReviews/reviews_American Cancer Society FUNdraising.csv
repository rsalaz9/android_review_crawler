It combines features across all possible ways of fundraising  - accepting credit card donations directly from people at the spur of the moment, reaching out to your contacts, processing paper checks, checking team status, sending receipts, adding photos to your page, sending event coordinates...   Plus, you can put it in your pocket. Sure, it's not perfect, but nothing ever is."
