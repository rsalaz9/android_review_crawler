I can't tell which produces what or if they are even all working. The ads for the app say you can see production vs use and have all of these breakdowns, but NOPE! For a company that is so technology driven you would think they would have a much better interface for their solar product....esp after buying a company that did."

It's easy to use, convenient, and quite intuitive. However, it still can use a few more capabilities, such as the ability to (1) schedule charging times right from the app, and (2) receive an alert and view a live feed (or at least a snapshot) from the cameras as soon as Sentry Mode depicts something. Overall, we love our Model X and this very handy app!"

I had the same issue with an older phone. With a Pixel 3 it works great. Almost never need to open with the card key. Also love the heating, cooling, sentry mode, battery charging, venting, and every other feature. This is what makes a Tesla different than any other car."

Now I can, maybe once in 24 hours if lucky, see the status of the batteries, power flow, and the percentage of solar/battery/grid usage. Once I could see everything except the battery status. I don't know what happened here. In talking with Tesla battery support they can see the status of all the equipment on my house."

I don't have a car so don't need all that FLuff Relatively useless app. Just a portal for documents no capacity to overlay production last year vs this. BIG downgrade from solar city app. What is the rationale for only allowing me to access certain data from phone instead of any platform like my computer. Forced invasion of my phone privacy is NOT needed. Open the access up to desktop!

But remember that it gets its data from the cloud and not directly from your Powerwall. So... expect a lag compared to a browser connecting directly to your device over the local LAN. % battery capacity remaining will be 5% lower than the direct browser connection (at its lowest point) as it hides the 5% reserve you can otherwise see on the browser. I would like to see more manual controls, e.g. timers, and a ""hold"" function (neither charge nor discharge)."

I woukd not only like this in the morning when I go to work but have it allow me to set at 1700 when I finish work and have it ready for me to leave. Also android huwaei p20 phone key seems not to work great at all.
11,Yoric,"April 5, 2020",1," Waking up, waking up, waking up. Have to sign out and back in again to connect. Update: still the same, says waking up and most controls are disabled. However, if I click unlock, it instantly unlocks and the rest of the app then comes to life. Suggesting to me it's the app and not the car."

Set storm watch to charge during the battery during certain time. Allow storm watch to allocate up to a certain percent to backup. Example, right now storm watch charges the battery more than 36hrs before the storm is expected, so solar is feeding the grid the day prior which is not cost effective."

You guys are a silicon valley tech company and this app looks like something from the days of the motorola droid. Get some bleeding edge designers and UX people. The design and UX of the car's computer is so well done. I'm surprised the app doesn't match the design language or quality of that at all.
15,David Leffel,"April 1, 2020",3, Buggy. The latest updates have screwed with the ability to stop charging. There is no longer a way to message Tesla through the app. They want us to use self driving and summon but the tire pressure sensors give erroneous readings.
16,Jeremy Sikora,"April 21, 2020",5, Picked up my new Model 3 Performance a few days ago and so far this app has been flawless. ive had zero issues so far. Car is great and so is the software. (Would like the ability to turn on notifications for Sentry Mode activity.)
17,Rob Chanock,"March 9, 2020",5, The various functions of the app are very convenient. The transitions between functions are very smooth. It's great to be able to use your phone as a key. Being able to turn the phone climate on remotely is a big advantage.
18,Charlie Jenkins,"March 26, 2020",5," Very helpful, I always wonder when I watched videos why people said that you could like preheat the car from your phone, and this app answered my Qs, and enhances my Model X very much!"
19,Anders Johansson,"April 5, 2020",5," Works mostly great. My main annoyance is that the ""unlock charge port"" button moves when the closest supercharger list loads, making me sometimes hit the wrong button."
20,Steven S,"March 9, 2020",3, Re Powerwall2: Battery % should also be shown at the bottom of the power flow page and it would be good if you could zoom/rescale the energy usage plots. -1* because app wont show battery kwh to powerwall for over anything more than the day (can use to determine efficiency over time)
21,Greg Rogers,"April 8, 2020",4," Very useful features to remotely check, and for some non-driving functions, control your Tesla EV remotely. Good to see ongoing development attention."

Surely the last item is a no-brainier."
23,Stuart McGivern,"April 2, 2020",5, I'm not saying it's 100% perfect there's always room for a few additional features to control vehicle functions but it is very good up to now.
24,Cascadia 1601,"March 28, 2020",5," Pretty nice app, although I don't like that firing up the app triggers charging to begin. I also wish I could turn on rear defroster to remove ice/snow during pre-heat."
25,ILAN Lewkowski,"March 14, 2020",1," Compared to the old Solar City app, this app is useless. Impossible to navigate and find the simple answers one is looking for. Your online web page is even worse, with zero information available. I would expect more from a leading edge company"
26,Jim Brown,"April 23, 2020",3, 4/23/20 Don't know why. But my phone works fine as a key. But can't use Bluetooth in the car for phone calls or to play music. Won't connect.
27,Kyle Frederick,"March 18, 2020",4," Does a lot, but the time it takes to connect to the car is annoyingly long. 1% problem, I get it. Hence, 4 stars. Also, the UX is not straight forward."
28,Jason Geyen,"April 1, 2020",5, Love my car. Love the app. I would give it six stars if it would connect slightly faster to the car.
29,Gordon Russell,"April 24, 2020",3, App works great but couldbe more feature rich. I would love to have ability to open Frunk from a function button on my phone or to add shortcuts to lock screen etc.
30,Sami Koskivaara,"March 13, 2020",3, Slow to connect to the car. Would be good to see some drive statistics and other information too. Don't really like the dark theme. Tesla being a software company this app is not too good. Hope they spend some time to it to develop it more.
31,Bryan Glasow,"March 18, 2020",4," Solid app, but I would love for more options in the application for the car. Things like changing between milage and % on the fly, altering charge rate, etc."
32,Peter Adams,"April 11, 2020",1," Had been working well but since start of April not updating information correctly , battery full 100% then an hour later empty 0% with Little power used and full sunshine"
33,Trishia Singla,"April 4, 2020",5, Very well designed app. I love the ability to do a lot of useful things in there car via the app.
34,A Google user,"April 23, 2020",4, Phone key is now reliable. Updates and connects slowly at times. Love the summon as party trick. Await future versions.
35,Werner Sevenster,"April 5, 2020",5, Pretty amazing as usual. Works well with the car controls always being there in my notification drawer as well.
36,J Han,"March 25, 2020",1, the key issue now back. it now DOESN'T recognizes my phone until I wake up my phone. So annoying... why is it so difficult to get this right? Back and forth with every update.
37,zain shah,"March 24, 2020",4," Great, but could be a bit better (especially better and more stable connectivity)."
38,Peng Ning,"March 23, 2020",1," I only have the solar panel. When I tried to log in following the instruction from Tesla, the app says I have no linked product. Very confusing. I will change my rating higher if Tesla can resolve this problem."
39,Kyle diemer,"March 17, 2020",1, This app is awful!!! Gives you zero information cannot find billing account info anything and if your solar is off its absolutely useless. Cannot find out billing on this app or their terrible website.
40,Brad D,"March 4, 2020",5, Thanks for eliminating the guessing game and adding battery percentage number to the charge level visual! If only you can offer an MCU v1 eMMC fix via mobile app.
41,Michael Becerra,"April 17, 2020",2," Worst app on my phone, and unfortunately also one I need to use the most. I call it the ""waking up"" app since that's all it actually displays. Please fix this Tesla. Shame!"
42,Ron Zastovnik,"April 25, 2020",2," Normally I'd rate it 4.5, but the latest upgrade to 3.10.4 causes my Tesla app to crash when I click on Location."
43,Mohit Goenka,"March 15, 2020",5," The app now had a lot of features, and most of the functionality could be controlled remotely."
44,Nathan Campbell,"April 22, 2020",5, Works very well. No problems at all. Probably the most stable app I've ever used.
45,Cormac Cullen,"March 14, 2020",4," For Powerwall operation - app is great would be better with at least two ""on-peak"" time zones please."
46,Jurrand Summerville,"April 8, 2020",5, Love my Tesla the app works great. I love that I can use my phone's NFC to unlock my car.

50,Eric Ferguson,"April 17, 2020",1, Terrible. I had a solar city plan before they sold out to Tesla. Tesla website and this app is just horribly designed. I can't even pay online its so bad. now I get 503 errors. TESLA makes JUNK
51,Stephen Filippelli,"March 9, 2020",1, This APP replaced the Solar City APP and I hate it. I only have Tesla Solar and the Solar City APP was superior in every way for that use. This one is a waste of time for me.

If we are going to be forced to use a product at least make it comparable to what is being replaced."

This isn't just lag. It is waking up for hours sometimes. Please fix the lag and the complete freeze of the app. It's an important feature of the car and if it's not reliable, then it degrades the overall joy of owning a Tesla. Lots of great ideas and hard work went into these vehicles. Fix the app out of respect."
74,RT&TT Tam,"February 8, 2020",1," Often times does not open Tesla car door. I have to take my phone out and launch the app first, which I shouldn't have to. Also, the app often times does not connect to the car. It just keeps spinning and let's me know when it was last update. Very frustrating!"

I am not going to change the rating however, because I think Tesla should have a checklist to follow when the phone key doesn't work. I would guess that they have seen my problem many times before and could easily suggest checking the settings as follows: On the S8 Settings/Device Care/Battery/Tesla make sure that Put App to Sleep is OFF. I think that a Tmobile update a few months ago must have changed the default of Put App to Sleep to ON. Before a few months ago (for nearly a year) the phone key had no problem. On an S8, phone key fails more often than it works. Intermittant, frequently stays nonworking and I must go through the key setup to get it to work.

Drove to site then was locked out with Sentry's red eye staring at me. If U can't count on app as key the rest of nice features R irrelevant. Tesla fixed next day but doesn't help when you're standing in rain locked out of car. Now that the initial BT connectivity problems are fixed, I'll revisit this. Overall, once you've got an app for your car, you wonder how you lived without it. But the actual execution is mixed. Doubly so with EV Pros. Wonderful to be able to turn on HVAC remotely before you get to your car. Nice 2 start frequent software updates. Cons. Can't schedule software updates, only start. HVAC control inhibited by in car settings, and that car temp is often wrong. Little awareness that multiple people use a car, and settings/ authorities need 2B diff. Can send nav links but not actual routes. Can't locate car wout GPS i.e. parking structures (needs WiFi RFF location?) . Stats MIA tire pressure, mileage per charge, no offline trip planning (import Google Maps waypoints)"

458,Greg Peck,"September 10, 2019",5, Stable and functional. On the power flow screen it would be nice if the power powerwall graphic could show the current state of charge. This way the charge amount or discharge amount would be on the same screen as the state of charge which in my opinion would be of huge benefit.

538,Ivan Sutanto,"October 10, 2019",1," It is a joke this app. Keep saying No product associated to this account... resetting pwd many times. When coming back it keeps saying the same thing. PLUS, where is my solar usage monitoring. Solar city did better job developing an app."
539,stephen yuen,"May 1, 2019",3, I have a powerwall and use this app to check energy consumption. When it works it works well. But more times than not the app does not update and shows no info.
540,David Navarrete,"June 25, 2019",1," The Solar City app is way better than this and offers so much more information than what this silly app provides. Why on earth would I want to switch to it? Oh that's right, you're making us. Would rate 0 out of 5 but it's unfortunately not an option."
541,Peter Perkins,"August 12, 2019",1, We Solar City customers are forced from a useful PC based system where I could use my 24 inch monitor to a tiny cell phone. The info is not nearly as useful. I spent 43k on a Solar City solar panel system and feel that the bait and switch has been used to dupe me. The app is difficult to use.
542,ZIP RIDER,"October 17, 2019",3," Works maybe 8-10% of the time that I try to use it. Constantly uninstalling and re-instaling the app, logging out and in, and now it says I have no products linked to my account (obviously not correct) and I cannot sign in at all now. Support is nearly non-existant. Get it together Tesla."
543,David Parks,"November 7, 2019",2, Tesla needs to add the ability to check my bill from the app interface. Paying my bill is not user friendly and is in fact buried in web sites.
544,Rebecca Brawley,"November 2, 2018",1," After only a couple weeks, I was signed out of the app and can't get back in, even tried resetting my password. I need a consistent place to check my solar city/ Tesla solar power guide!"
545,Ben Taddeo,"February 20, 2019",2, The last update removed the ability to turn off all heated seats by holding icon. You have to restart the app every morning to wave the car. I see some other developers that got Teslas app collect. They should stick to building cars.
546,Karl Robstad,"June 5, 2019",5," does it's thing well. summon can be finicky but I'm not sure what the issue is. would LOVE to see voice assistant integration tho. tremendous value to ""ok google open my frunk"" when you have an armload of groceries for example..."
547,Yutian Lei,"January 8, 2019",5," Very easy to use. In a lot of places, there is poor reception, so summon over bluetooth would be great."
548,MJ M,"June 5, 2019",2," this app is unfortunate for home solar owners. considerably less functionality than the mysolarcity app. i hope it's improved to add at least much data as the mysolarcity app has. data by day, month, year, lifetime. i do like the aethstetics of the app tho"
549,Randy Wilson,"July 20, 2019",5," I don't have a lot of other car applications to compare to, but of the others I've used, this one is leaps and bounds better. Intuitive, prett, fast, and of high quality. It's simply the best!"
550,Frank Fruhwirth,"October 15, 2019",4," App meets expectations and has not failed yet. I updated it today (Oct. 15 2019) and now have access to the version 10.0 Model 3's ""vent "" feature. Cool😎, pun intended."
551,Ann Savage,"January 29, 2020",5, Love the cars and love the app!
552,Mladen Draganović,"April 13, 2020",4," Great app, I don't have Tesla so, for now I'll give it 4 stars..."
553,Aleksander Kenton,"March 1, 2019",5, Very good app! Just goes to show how far ahead Tesla are (having owned/used car linked apps from other manufacturers) would like some more features and controls but what you get is very well done👍
554,Laura LaBarbera,"December 28, 2018",2," Feature of remotely heating seats and steering wheel worked for one day then disappeared. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling app, restarting phone, no change. emailed customer service at Tesla for the past three days with no response"
555,Bryan Maddex,"September 28, 2018",5," Love the phone interconnectivity with the Model 3. Using Pixel 2 XL, summon feature is very unreliable, but keyless entry has been flawless as have the quick buttons for trunk and frunk release."
556,A Google user,"October 10, 2018",3," I used it for awhile & now all of a sudden it won't let me sign in. Saying username & password are not correct, but it was never changed."
557,Joel Handler,"June 5, 2019",5, Works really well. I wish it let you customize the front quick controls. I use the truck more than the frunk so it would be great to have easy access to that button instead of the frunk.
558,Matt D'Elia,"August 16, 2019",1, App is junk if you only have Solar Panels that were previously under the Solar City app.  Solar City customers were forced to switch to this app which has 1/10th the functionality of the previous app.  No historical data outside of current year or month.
559,Leonard Burns,"September 26, 2019",5," Works ok, would be nice to have a remote window up feature. Also the app seems to have issues unlocking the car sometimes when I get close, other than that its not bad. 9/26/2019 - they added window up and vent options, and climate changes. 5 star edit!"
560,Rere090174,"September 27, 2019",1, Ever since I was forced to change from the Solar City app to the Tesla app for my solar system I haven't been able to see my production. I shouldn't have to buy additional parts for my system to see this. This is not what I signed up for. Fixed this issue.
561,Dario Vazquez,"September 28, 2019",5," Awesome app for an awesome car. Especially with the v10.0 update, you can control even more things like Enhanced Summon, can roll down/up windows a little for venting, can manually defrost windshield, can control Homelink for garage door outside of Summon."
562,Jorge Chavez,"November 12, 2019",5," It says I have an account, but won't let me log in..... and that no tesla products are attached to it yet. :( although website tells me to go to the app and complete registration. I'm confused."
563,Kevin Sellstrom,"April 3, 2019",5," Works great, super happy with our car and the app. Occasionally slow to connect when car is sleeping, but found unlocking the phone before walking up to the door usually unlocks it perfectly."
564,Peter Epstein,"October 9, 2018",5," Elegant and yet practical and easy to use. You can check battery charge, location, etc, and open trunk, frunk, charge port, etc."
565,Kyle Blagg,"February 27, 2019",5, PSA: If your version of android has battery optimization make sure you mark the Tesla app to be ignored. Otherwise the app may not always be running. Once I did that this app works flawlessly. 1000x better than when I used thr iOS Tesla app.
566,J L Brown,"March 9, 2019",3," Generally very good, but a bit slow to communicate with the car (press 'unlock trunk', wait, trunk opens) & summon sometimes refuses to connect."
567,João Manuel,"June 3, 2019",1, Impossible to do login. This application refuse all time the new passwords. Each time to enter is necessary to erase the password and made one new. But what is this? The Carnival is not already finished?
568,karolyn stewart,"June 15, 2019",1," what a terrible app. it used to show more info but now i just see what my solar panels are producing at the moment. you think when you spend 25k on a product you would get a better way to see what your investment is doing for you. just like their customer service this app sucks. come on Elon, skip o...Full Reviewwhat a terrible app. it used to show more info but now i just see what my solar panels are producing at the moment. you think when you spend 25k on a product you would get a better way to see what your investment is doing for you. just like their customer service this app sucks. come on Elon, skip one month of your income and improve the app for us little folk who made you rich. i love my solar panels but i truly have had nothing but horrible experience with this company."
569,Greg Medendorp,"September 20, 2019",1, Had my Solar City account converted and supposed to be able to track my power generation and usage but it just gives me an error that there are no products on my account when I try to log in. It shows I have solar on my account on the web site.
570,Dominic Blake,"November 23, 2019",5," Love the updates, car and improved connectivity on the app."
571,Anonymous User,"January 17, 2020",1," Total 'tater in sub-zero weather. No heat, no range. Crashed mine on purpose and claimed the insurance. Going back to Honda."
572,Jon,"April 29, 2019",5," Works perfectly. It would be nice to be able to modify all the car settings from within the app too, such as setting to chill mode, less regen, etc. Love the app though, great work."
573,Mahesh Jagadeesan,"February 26, 2019",5," This app keeps getting better and better. I'm now able to schedule service appointments, control media playback and seat heating, among other things. Pretty cool!"
574,Ken B,"February 6, 2019",4," great app for a great car. gave 4 stars because it is often too slow to wake up the car, like a couple minutes or not at all. Needs to sync within 10 seconds to be useful"
575,Lou Morda,"March 25, 2019",5," Okay so it appears the stuck on ""waiting"" issue is a combination of the car going into some kind of a deep sleep because it only happens in the morning. Otherwise this app is actually pretty phenomenal"
576,Calvin Gaisford,"February 14, 2019",5," I have had cars with apps but none as awesome as this one. Much more control over the car and it just keeps getting better. My favorite part is not javing to carry a key. My phone locks and unlocks my car by proximity. No key, no fob. Thank you Tesla!"
577,Douglas Kim,"May 22, 2019",2, it is good as a key and app overall but the battery drain almost makes it unworth it. my battery was at 50 percent before I slept and now at zero. this happened the night before as well. needed a fix.
578,Vijay Ravishankar,"March 7, 2019",2," UX sucks - it takes forever to wake up. most of the time, i would want to pre-heat the car, and it takes so long to wake up for me to control it that i end up going to the car to do it manually. please fix it soon"
579,Han Chueh,"June 25, 2019",5," Best car app for the best car ever. Allows you to control many aspects of the car, including remotely turning on AC and trunks and even allows other people to drive the car for you without a key."
580,theodore deleon,"July 2, 2019",5, Beautiful app. I saw silicon valley the tv show. I didn't quit understand the app and the car combo. I find it awesome putting the app on valet mode so people driving the car cant test ludicrous mode. Talk about full control.
581,m jew,"July 23, 2019",1," horrible app. I have solar panels from solar city, which is now tesla. the solar city app is being disabled, and when I try to use this tesla app, it says I do not have any products linked to tesla. also, the tesla website is garbage and won't let me see my billing."
582,Arco Vink,"July 19, 2019",4," Its oke. But the Volkswagen app can schedule AC temperatures in the morning (when freezing) and in afternoon (when hot in sun) already for 4 years!! Still I have to manually click everyday in the Tesla app, which is inconvenient."
583,Jerry Lambert,"July 28, 2019",2," For Solar City users it's a step down in functionality. I can see output for today and yesterday, week, months, and years, and that's all."
584,Jean-Pierre White,"November 3, 2018",4, App works well on Pixel Phone. Does not work very well at all using Pixelbook android app support. SCreen size does not resize cirrectly to the Pixelboooks screen. This needs fixing.
585,Aniruddha Joglekar,"March 23, 2019",5, You have to have if you have Tesla. I wished it had way to manage your account as well. Also if you can see all energy dashboard of your rides etc.
586,Lansing Chew,"March 31, 2019",5, Pretty solid with the Tesla...not perfect but has consistently good functionality and is intuitive. It complements Tesla's outstanding cars and commitment to a reimagined driving experience.
587,Sean Gaylord,"December 9, 2018",4, App has worked very well overall. I don't see the charging options from the Dec 1st update. Connecting to my Model 3 could be faster.
588,Marc Bernard,"September 27, 2019",5," A good app is updated on a regular basis to fix bugs, improve it's ease of use and introduce new features. Well done Tesla! And keep impressing us. Special thanks to the developer team."
589,Jennifer Siron,"April 29, 2019",3," Besides giving phone control of car, it should incorporate the ability to find charge stations even though that feature is in car display. Also, my phone doesn't have media option but my kids phone does and we both have Samsung phones."
590,Anup Nayak,"March 19, 2019",2, The summon feature on my model 3 almost never works with this app. The car starts and then loses connectivity with the app. neither the continuous press mode nor the press-to-start/stop work. very frustrating.
591,A Google user,"November 4, 2018",2," The app has a custom UI that just doesn't flow well. Also, the persistent notification is pretty annoying. There's gotta be a way to get rid of that or make it an option."
592,Moonseok Kim,"September 27, 2019",2, Service schedule is gone with the latest update today. I scheduled a service to fix my Model 3 and there is no way to access to the service schedule so that I cannot check or change it on the app. Very disappointed.
593,Jennifer Montgomery,"October 3, 2019",5, Would be awesome if users could see all of the vehicle's cameras from this app. Would be nice to be able to see the route another driver is taking. Would also be a very effective tool (in addition to the GPS) should a Tesla be stolen.

595,Joe Thielen,"April 4, 2019",5," I love all the remote items you can control on the Tesla. It would be handy to be able to access your SuperCharging history and charges via the app when traveling, instead of just the website."
596,Kyle Olson,"March 10, 2019",5," great app! i never have issues. i use it mainly for turning the climate control on before i leave, and controlling charging."
597,Erick Zavaleta,"February 6, 2019",5, Works great with my model 3. Sometimes It takes about 20 seconds to connect to my car to unlock but it works most of the time.

601,Steve Trojo,"September 6, 2019",1, Sux for solar app. I had the SolarCity app before they closed it. It was more accurate and consistent than this app. This app shuts down for days at a time for no reason. Why did they close the old app for this piece of junk.

My Tesla Wall installers took 2 hours to try and figure out how to get to Tesla Wall rather than the car. Now I am tryiing to get the Tesla Wall to store energy during the off peak hours. Something says that the Tesla something does not work for the first 24 hours. That is when I want to charge the Power wall during my time of use low period After 7 Pm. and before 7 AM ifor me. but I can't tell it to do that in the first 24 hours??? What is tesla going to do, wait for the sun to trickle charge then amp up during the High cost hours so i will have a full charge at High rates. Not the most lucid directions. IF the installer took 2 hours to find the Tesla app, then what am I supposed to do? Does TESLA Support a chrome BOok? In otherwords can the chrome book down load a Tesla APP? I am using a 4 year old Samsung Galaxy Pro for ""smart"" phone access. I want to use my Chrome book, which is much easier to use. and less costly. I do not want an apple. I like my samsung. I prefer using my chromebook. I know the TOU costs but cannot put them in the Advanced place. Where is the Advanced drop down menu. I can find custom, but where is advanced. .

605,Bill Watson,"April 28, 2019",3, Would be better if could review past powerwall usage over a custom date range. After an update the history graphs don't render properly (going from year to month to week view).
606,Paul Sanders,"February 6, 2019",5, Having my phone as a key is my favorite feature. I have seen other people say it is hit or miss if it works but it has always worked perfectly for me.
607,Kevin Le,"October 26, 2018",5," Love the new update. I can see how much electricity was generated, sent to the grid, or used for the house."
608,James W.,"February 24, 2019",4," Pretty good but the icons are a mess. Do they indicate actual status? Or the command when pressed? Sometimes both, sometimes neither. Phone key only works about 60% of time."
609,Jaime Visser,"June 9, 2019",4, Works mostly flawlessly. Summon can be a bit finicky needing both location and high BT signal strength which can be challenging in parking garages. Basically only works when standing within two metres of the model 3.
610,Steven Blatt,"June 17, 2019",1, so much less useful and user friendly the the solar city app. This is not an adequate replacement for monitoring solar panels. you can not look at past Calder month only last 30 days. unable to find lifetime or past years.
611,Rupert Wilson,"August 13, 2019",4, Using this app to monitor my Powerwall 2 and the latest update which gives access to all your historical data. Plus there is now a Lifetime level and you can download your data as CSV file. Awesome 😍
612,Alex,"October 12, 2019",5," Great app with lots of features and it keeps improving like the car, very rarely has bugs and I've never had it crash in over 5 years of use. All other OEM need to learn from this!"
613,Kirstie Caffarel,"October 14, 2019",1, I cannot compare my production and usuage with my solar system. Solar City had such a great app. Now that Tesla took over it is useless. I can't see what my day to day or month output vs production is. Such a terrible app and there is very little support.

I downloaded this app and found that when I tried to login it told me I have no Tesla products and couldn't be logged in.

644,vishnu narang,"October 19, 2019",4, They're making an amazing app for an amazing car. One thing missing is adding multiple log-ins and switching between accounts if you want to drive your friend's car and you share.
645,Christian Batchelor,"April 15, 2019",3," overall good concept, but app doesnt always connect to the car. Both have great signal, but app will spin for 10 minutes with no connection until i physically wake the car"
646,Quix Toys,"December 12, 2019",3, Annoying you cant open if it needs to update. Low signal ? Cant use.
647,Jacob Fascia,"March 28, 2019",1, I'll adjust this review once you make the notification functionality better. There is constantly a notification that my car is disconnected when its not in range. Only thing you can do is disable notifications entirely.
648,Tre Retter,"September 20, 2019",5," So much better now! Connects to the car much faster! Would love the ability to adjust windows up and down, and open/close front doors."
649,A Google user,"December 13, 2018",3, 12.1 update with v9.46.2 software. Share function from google maps is no longer working. States unavailable. Try again later. Please correct.
650,Jeff Curless,"February 27, 2019",5," Works well, no issues, with a Pixel. Had one connectivity issue on the first day, reset phone and... have not had the problem since."
651,Johnny Thunder Lei,"October 9, 2018",5," Great app, but could be faster on the connection and updates. Automation with voice would be cool."
652,D S,"June 18, 2019",2, I cant log on and you killed the solar city app. Now I cant pay you. Great Job! App finally working. Changed rating from 1 star to 2 stars. Solar City app was infinately better.
653,Leon Loo,"July 7, 2019",5," I've used the apps from Mercedes for a Smart Fortwo and from GM for a Volt. In comparison Tesla's app is far more funtional, reliable and looks great. Keep up the great work."
654,A Nonymous,"September 30, 2019",3," Phone unlock is buggy and not as useful as a nice remote.... it is inconsistent, as much as the locking function switching lights off and mirrors in. Sometimes. And sometimes not."
655,Sam Iliopoulos,"December 3, 2019",2, Keeps asking for password and not able to show any backup history for powerwall
656,Mark King,"December 22, 2018",3," great app, but with v3.8 the font size for Internal Temperature is too small, difficult to read. please make bigger"
657,Max Dirnberger,"May 2, 2019",5," really net app, only problem is that the latest android keeps on shutting it down after a couple of hours even though I tell device care to not do that"
658,Tamas Føldesi,"July 8, 2019",3," Schedule service does not work - it fails to find any address in Norway, as if it was bound to the wrong country. Please fix."
659,Preetesh Duvvuri,"July 15, 2019",1, no time invested in testing the app. month is adding up previous 28days and year is adding up previous 365 days. i calculated the numbers for a month and when compared with solar city app i see the yearly numbers dont add up.
660,Lauren Wolcott,"August 25, 2019",1," Dear Tesla, your app is awful. I literally can not do anything on it. I can see the wattage of my solar and i can send out referral links. Why can't i access customer service? Why can't i see my totals for the life of my solar? Why isn't there more options?

661,Brad Dohack,"September 28, 2019",5," It's hard to imagine there is a better app for a car out there. While not perfect, it's always improving and Tesla adds new features all of the time. Keep up the great work."
662,David liu,"March 3, 2019",4, The app kept thinking there is no internet when I am roaming. would be nice if this bug can be fixed. s7 edge here
663,Ken Yamabe,"March 12, 2019",4," Agree with other reviews, needs to connect quicker, and schedule climate controls would make it a 5 star app."
664,Rick Spears,"November 26, 2018",4," Great app! Can sometimes be slow connecting to car, in particular the summon feature, for me."
665,Gokul Bhat,"December 20, 2018",2," the android version is suboptimal and slow to react occasionally, despite not using the power save feature which is a bummer in itself."
666,Scobo03,"April 13, 2019",4," Good app. I lots of options, but I would like a few more like sentry mode streaming."
667,Dennis Tang,"February 24, 2019",5, Its a must when owning one. Convenience of monitoring plus control of the vehicle with climate and summon. Functional.
668,Michael Briggs,"June 5, 2019",1," this app is not as good as the app Tesla is abandoning. unable to review history older than 1 day. not very useful. unable to select day, month or year of data displayed, overall much worse than the app it replaces."
669,Meg Treglia,"September 2, 2019",1, Zero stars if possible. App always has issues. Not user friendly. It was so much better when it was Solar City.
670,3x3q,"September 27, 2019",5, Simply amazing how much control this app enables over my car. This app and my car is just getting better and better all the time! Outstanding development.
671,Dustin Hon,"July 4, 2019",5," Great app, and it keeps getting better! Now that I can update my Tesla from the app, my only ask is to add more Solar details from my solar panels, like in the old MySolarCity app."
672,Dwight,"April 23, 2019",4, Great app and great control. I wish the app could not only control the sunroof but also control the windows.
673,Matt Tsurumoto,"April 24, 2019",5, Amazing App! Does so much for the car. occasionally has issues connecting but still worth it nonetheless.
674,Anthony Waitz,"July 28, 2019",5, Notification dot is stuck on and never goes off which is irritating. Other than that the app works well but has some issues like inability to open charger door at times and random freezes etc.
675,Nicholas Garn,"April 21, 2019",4, App could do much more and should. Last update on either car or app goofed up climate control from phone. Often get cant connect error.
676,Tianon Gravi,"August 12, 2019",1," Getting forced to use this app from MySolarCity, and it is anything but great. Harder to browse older data, missing all data older than July, etc."
677,Ian D,"September 26, 2019",5, The app is fantastic when linked to the car. Lots of control. Also really like the ability to send destinations from Google Maps directly to the car via the 'share' feature in Google Maps.
678,Martin Hyson,"August 14, 2019",4," For those who have different accounts for a cars and solar, an option to quickly switch between those accounts, when switching between screens would be nice."
679,Ally Park,"September 12, 2019",1, Having trouble with my solar acct too. The app says there is no product linked to the acct. The transition as as rough as it can ever be.
680,James Yeager Jr.,"September 27, 2019",5, Other car manufacturers need to use Tesla's app as an example of good design and functionality for remote control of a car. This app is simply light-years ahead of everything else.
681,Gene Cook,"October 14, 2019",3, More wore needs to be done on improving the functionality of the app and less on games and other frivolous (but humorous) features.
682,Travis Reid,"October 24, 2019",5, Overall app works great. Using the charging level slider is a little out of calibration. New features pop up a few times a year.
683,Jack Jones,"November 7, 2019",5, Works well sometimes takes a long time to connect to the car.
684,David P,"May 1, 2019",5, Amazing UX and beautiful looking. Flawless control and monitoring of your Tesla with continuous updates and enhancements.
685,John Fields,"December 19, 2018",5, LOVE this car! Only issue I have is sometimes it won't connect to the car. Very sad.
686,William Lau,"September 30, 2018",5," Love this app. Takes time to connect, but thats okay, considering all the functionality."
687,J.H. Snider,"May 23, 2019",3, This app is needed to operate a Tesla Model 3 but it doesn't connect to the car. I understand connectivity is an ongoing problem.
688,Audrey Sato,"August 15, 2019",2, This app drains my battery so I have to turn it off between drives. The current version has made me reconnect my phone key with my key card each time I restart the app I and get in the car to drive. Super obnoxious.
689,Ryan Pierre,"October 19, 2019",5," Best app for a Car yet! The amount of control you have of your car, and added feature that your car can pick you up in parking lot using your phone GPS is Amazing! Great job Tesla."
690,jordan slingerland,"December 4, 2019",5, The best app you can use to unlock your Tesla.
691,__,"May 18, 2019",4, Great app with a lot of functionality. The app however is not notifying me when sentry mode events occur.
692,Brian Young,"April 17, 2019",4, Love just about everything on the application. Please add windows up and down plus open a bit for hot days.... Thanks
693,Khurram Rehman,"October 18, 2019",5," Great app. Makes it easy to check charging status, set charge limits, preheat or precool the interior, open the frunk from outside the car, summon out of a tight space etc."
694,Brian Dixon,"October 19, 2019",3, This morning it won't connect and I can't unlock the charging port. It won't connect to the internet by WiFi so can't get software updates. Used to update without and app is still in contact .
695,ADM Mo,"August 30, 2019",1, Worked well until August 2019 update. But.... now it refuses to update so I have no idea how my powerwall is functioning.
696,Bruce Mallett,"October 19, 2019",5," After last update this app no longer connects to the car (Model 3), just keeps spinning with a message of ""Updated on . Other apps such as teslafi and tezlabs connect fine."
697,Mukhtar Shohatee,"February 12, 2019",5, Nice app but it takes long time to connect to the vehicle. please improve on the connectivity b/w app and vehicle.
698,Yassir Albazzaz,"October 27, 2018",4, Sufficient but there are better ones out there that give you more control. The official one is understandably sanitized with respect to functionality

700,Vic Olegario,"June 27, 2019",1," I hope in August when it transitions from the old app for my solar, it will include all the features, otherwise from what I can see this app was developed for the Teska vehicles and not for Sokar energy. Useless"

Energy Explorer, AMPit, and the live energy production streaming features have been removed. Online access to the Tesla's ""solar"" provides no live, active info about my solar production. IMHO, Tesla is now treating solar customers like poor, second cousins of the Tesla family. I'm not interested in their cars and don't want to see them."
702,Ronald Miner,"September 10, 2019",1," I just wanted to pay my bill easier, BUT the site has been down since tesla took over 2 years ago. Waste of time. This app is all about referencing not about an acct you may have."
703,Jayanta Dey,"December 22, 2018",4," Nice app, clean, design. Functionality improves with time. i would like the app to 'wake up' abd connect ti M3P sooner!"
704,Ronald Branch,"December 22, 2018",4, Need the ability to disconnect key from M3 without disabling bluetooth like an toggle switch. My Tesla is within bluetooth range when I am in my bedroom and Phone Key shows connected. Would be nice to know which door is not closed properly in the app.
705,me only,"February 14, 2019",2," The app log out from time to time, then can't log in back and have to reset password again, so annoying."

718,Hieu Do,"February 12, 2020",1, Come on Tesla. You are a tech company. How does the app not support the new Face Unlock API yet?
719,Lee Olds,"December 19, 2018",5," Great car. You can operate it without the app, but I consider the app essential."

722,Owen Valentine,"January 11, 2019",5, functions well but the one function that is most crucial to understand (lock/unlock) is also the most ambiguous.
723,Holy Edge,"August 11, 2019",3, Works ok for the car and powerwall. Summon is hit or miss. Needs to integrate the solar city app features.
724,Joe King,"September 29, 2019",5," Works great, use it almost every day and I have never had had any problems with it. Very useful being able to precool car."
725,Maurice,"August 21, 2019",4, Good app summon is unfortunately not working fine. What I really would like is to see the total used energy (like in trips) also in the app.
726,Steven Yoho,"February 13, 2019",4, I love the app. I never thought I'd be happy to have an app for my car but I am. I'm wondering why the location on the app presently is off by about eight miles?
727,John Wai,"October 9, 2018",5, Is pretty simple and basic but extremely useful. Not as stable as I thought on my S9. But my phone might need factory reset

760,Brad Townsend,"September 20, 2019",2, App needs a widget and alerts too better monitor the system. A proactive call home feature might help Tesla discover a problem before weeks go by.

780,MJ Pasquariello,"September 13, 2019",1, I have Solar City panels and am unable to access the billing portal through the app. I can see usage only but have no way to find out my bill!
781,Will Dreyer,"September 30, 2019",5, Super convenient app for vehicle controls. Also awesome that my solar system is integrated so I can optimize vehicle charging with solar production all in one app :) 5 stars
782,Andreas Brauchli,"October 21, 2019",5," Being able to set the charge rate (amperage) from the app would be great, or when it should finish charging and adjust accordingly"
783,David Thomson,"December 19, 2018",5, Great app. As functionality is added to the vehicle they update the app.
784,A Google user,"January 10, 2019",3, Desperately needs better historical data functionality for Powerwall2. Day level detail is gone after 30 days.
785,ashwin pt,"February 19, 2019",5, Great App. I have been using this app for almost 6 months.Absolutely no issues till date.
786,Roman M,"November 29, 2019",4," updated to 4 star from 3, not all phones work well as key, with OnePlus I had to always wake up my phone, with pixel I don't have to"
787,Bart Pola,"December 27, 2018",5, Well designed Android app that is reliable and bug free. Kinda important when this app is my car key! Thanks for not skimping on the app.
788,Vikash Shah,"November 13, 2018",4, Why can I not locate or even see Supercharger locations from the app? I cannot control seat / steering wheel heaters either from the app.
789,Tim F,"December 22, 2018",4, Generally very good but this android version doesnt seem to have seat warming control on the climate section.
790,Omer Tamir,"May 29, 2019",5, very good app 👍 would ve great if yoy could add charge rate controller so while I am charging thr car from solar I can. adapt the charge rate to the panels solar production.
791,Seth Rogers,"June 25, 2019",5, Just brilliant. I've used other solar tracking software. this works really well.
792,Joe Steinberger,"August 11, 2019",1, App stopped working and Tesla support unresponsive after months of trying to contact them. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling and playing with all the settings but no luck.
793,Simon Thunberg,"August 21, 2019",4, Good looking and got most important features but needs two step verification when installed on a new device.
794,lee savage,"August 26, 2019",2," Ugly. Unattractive UI. Lacking in features from the old MySolarCity app. If there was any other way to track my solar usage, I'd probably switch to that."
795,Jim Cogbill,"September 3, 2019",1," Does not support the Roadster. Wouldn't be an issue, but this app is how you are supposed to schedule service, get updates, etc"
796,Richard Gil,"October 20, 2019",4, Good user interface and functions. They need to add a way to see the sentry mode recordings on this app!
797,Paul Cottingham,"October 20, 2019",1," Horrible, with the My Solar City app I could pay my bill. This app does not allow you to do anything really. Even their web site is difficult. The app gives mom instruction or anything. I really wish I could get out of this mess. The app does not work for solar."
798,Donald Griggs,"November 30, 2019",5, So much better than the Nissan leaf app. It surprised me how much difference a better car app makes.
799,Bruce Lortz,"November 19, 2018",2, Does not work with Acer Chromebook 15 (series: CB5-571). I really wouldn't only fault Tesla for this as compatibility with Android Apps on the Chromebook has been flighty.
800,Mike Shaffer,"October 9, 2018",5, It is simple but getting better all the time..the best thing is that it works perfect.
801,Jason Hamlin,"April 5, 2019",5, Functional and intuitive. I love being able to control my car with my phone. From anywhere on the planet!

803,Marilyn and Scott,"August 20, 2019",1," Really sucks compared to the previous Sun City app. Used to be able to look at historical data, last week, choose a month, choose a year. Tesla has been pretty disapointing so far."
804,Aarón Stark,"October 9, 2019",3, They must create a demo version without login for people who don't have a Tesla yet to be able to test the application and see if they like the application and features before buying a Tesla.
805,Andrew Eng,"October 10, 2019",1," Doesn't work if you have Solar City products (purchased by Tesla). Everytime I try to log in I get a message saying ""no products are linked to this account""."
806,Lori Hawkins,"November 1, 2019",4, Would be great if from the app we can choose a driver profile since it doesn't always work automatically
807,Ron Pal,"January 30, 2020",5, Good app no problems
808,Kurt Jenney,"October 11, 2018",4, This app is great! I just wish it had Wear OS support. Please bring Wear OS support so I can control the car from my wrist :)
809,seifer69er,"October 6, 2018",5, Only use it for my powerwall and i spend way more time monitoring it than expected. Its a really good app
810,Shaun Drummond,"April 11, 2020",5, Best app in it's class!!
811,Kiet Huang,"July 30, 2019",3, most of the time the app doesn't turn on. I've tried to delete and down load the app a few times but it didn't work
812,Shaman Aujla,"November 18, 2019",3, app takes long to wake up cars sometimes..upwards of 5-10 minutes
813,Eric Hart,"September 29, 2019",5, 4 star for now. 5 stars Now after getting my model 3! App works wonderful on my Note 9. The car is amazing as well. The summons feature is kick-ass! Keep it up Tesla /golf clap...
814,Daphne Poytress,"September 12, 2019",1, Terrible app. Can't access solar use!! Never had a problem with Solar City app.. Can't talk to anyone!!
815,Bruce Parker,"September 14, 2019",1, No associated services despite being a solar city customer for years. As a result i can't monitor my solar array. Customer service hasn't responded in a month. The solar city app was great.
816,Anthony Lo,"October 20, 2019",5," Love how this app gets better with time, along with the over the air (OTA) updates for the car!"
817,Clive Rand,"December 21, 2019",5, Works as designed. What more is there to say?
818,william cobb,"February 23, 2019",5," App is great, car is fantastic, service and the sales process has some maturing to do."

820,R Muddana,"August 3, 2019",3, Solar monthly display is inaccurate ie current month vs last 30 days and dont have the facility to send in-app feedback!
821,Adam Kelley,"September 27, 2019",4, Good app so far. Hope Tesla updates it soon as it currently doesn't support some of the new features in software release V10 for their cars.
822,Ashley Wilson,"October 23, 2019",5," Polished app with lots of data, shows me everything I need to see about my Powerwall. I hope I can add a car to the app one day!"
823,G,"November 19, 2019",4," Please add charging scheduling from the app, then I can say it's a 5-star app."
824,Arif Hoque,"March 14, 2020",5, Love the convenience!
825,Bryce Pickett,"November 27, 2019",5, connection really slow once you are in it is awesome
826,Naeem B,"June 23, 2019",5," It's embarrassing how much better Tesla's app is compared to other car companies. Great set of features, thoughtful UI, excellent steady connection, and best of all...FREE. Every other car manufacturer charges upwards of $150 a year to do half this stuff."
827,Cory A,"June 4, 2019",5, Great app - wish it had a few more features and could control more within the car
828,Martin L,"August 2, 2019",1, Keep the Solar City App. This app does nothing for the solar panel owners for review past performance and see energy usage history. I feel pigeonholed into a useless app. it is basically an app to market powerwall to customers.
829,M Tamaki,"August 8, 2019",5, great app. would be better if they moved the open trunk icon to the main page like the frunk.
830,Peter,"December 17, 2019",5, Great car. Great app.
831,Malis 88,"April 5, 2019",5, Great App now. Lots of updates. No longer an issue with doors not unlocking.
832,Jay Gee,"October 12, 2018",4, How about more robust climate settings such as to define a cabin temperature setpoint for it it to turn and a setpoint dor it to turn off?
833,Parker Anderson,"March 1, 2019",4, app has improved significantly! a lot more reliable and has a lot of great feautures.
834,David Green,"December 14, 2018",4," I have a powerwall 2 and gateway the app is showing the time reversed as in 10am is shown as pm , atm it is 10am but the app say 10pm and shows previous days stats .help ?"

837,Ryan Pierre,"August 7, 2019",5, Best vehicle app ever! Full control of your car at your fingertips. Cant get any better than this
838,Matt Hansen,"October 15, 2019",5, Ultimate control and convenience + keeps getting better. Nothing else comes close.
839,Greg Yurchenko,"March 23, 2019",5, Using this up to monitor our Powerwall 2 and manage household electricity daily load. Tesla done very good job in visualising power management environment.
840,Jim Taylor,"November 14, 2018",5, New ability to share destination/directions from Google Maps and other apps is most excellent.
841,Dag Blakstad,"November 30, 2019",5, Would love to set time the car should be charged and preconditioned from the app

845,Angelo Gunanayagam,"October 11, 2019",5, Truly a great and efficient app but I have nothing to compare it to. :)
846,Richard Newbould,"January 3, 2020",5, Useful vehicle status information and remote control functions
847,John Robinson,"December 22, 2018",5," Best car phone app ever. Sure, not perfect, but does any car manufacturer make a better, more feature rich, useful app?"
848,Jeff Sprigg,"May 17, 2019",5, Works great! Wish they had homelink control from the app.
849,Ryan Moquin,"August 14, 2019",1," useless for solar production monitoring. the solar city app showed me statistics up to date but this app only shows the previous month. it sucks, very disappointed with Tesla."
850,Jim Potter,"September 7, 2019",1," I don't have their overpriced cars, I just have a Solar City PV that I'd like to monitor. This app sucks! Doesnt tell you 1/4 of what the Solar City app did, most likely, on purpose so that Tesla can tweak the customer bills in their favor! Will most likely uninstall, it's not worth it folks!"
851,TRUMP2016 VIVATRUMP,"September 27, 2019",5," Absolutely LOVE this TESLA app, super reliable and useful. I ❤ my Model 3 *SO* much!!! It's easily the COOLEST, SMARTEST, SAFEST, and most FUN car on the planet. THANK YOU Elon and TESLA Team. 😊"

858,Alf Rønning,"October 29, 2018",5, Awesome especially during the winter season. Would be nice if we could open/close Windows.
859,Tanner Berkson,"June 8, 2019",5, Absolutely a must have for all Tesla owners. It would be nice if you could plan trips on the app and see where the superchargers would be.
860,Ed McAllister,"August 26, 2019",1, Horrible. I have a solar system. The old Solar City web page view on a desktop computer was OUTSTANDING. Now it's only on my phone?! And it sucks at that? Please go back to the old system.
861,James Abbott,"April 18, 2019",5, awesome app. I love monitoring/controlling my car with this app.

865,Daryl Adams,"June 4, 2019",1," For viewing solar panel power generation information, the mysolarcity website is so much better than this horrible app. Please don't force me to use this woefully inadequate app by shutting down mysolarcity."
866,Toumal Rakesh,"June 5, 2019",5, Does all it needs to do. Works a lot better than the companion apps by BMW and Renault.
867,Zelrion ReaX,"June 7, 2019",5, Best car key I've ever owned. -Would be great if updated to allow the user to view the dashcam files while on the same wireless network.
868,wendy simms,"June 28, 2019",1, app is useless to deal with billing. it'll show you your amount of solar produced and that's about it.
869,Jay Multanen,"July 10, 2019",3, The app stopped syncing with my car. had troubles before. Finally had to uninstall. Will see if reinstalling helps...

882,Sylvia Centeno,"August 30, 2019",1, Worthless for Solar users. The app only provides the amount of solar energy produced and consumed. You can't see your bill or much less pay for it. The app is really worthless.
883,Damon Palagi,"October 5, 2019",2, I have to use this app now that the solar city app is gone and it doesn't read my panels at all. It is awful and there's no service.
884,Dawn Gorden,"October 26, 2019",1, If I could give it a negative 5 I would. Every since it switched from my solar city to Tesla it sucks. It doesn't work at all. I can not see anything about my solar panels. This app is useless.

892,Craig Renaud,"June 29, 2019",1," This app is to replace the Solar City app and it is terrible. Historical info is extremely limited and reporting for SRECs will be much more difficult. Tesla, please for us dedicated solar owners at least offer the same reporting as the Solar City app!"

897,Earl Lemar,"October 26, 2019",1," I'm not going to update this Tesla app going forward, after the update I'm not able to log into my account and monitor my production. I'm very frustrated with the Poor customer service Tesla provide, I think it's the worst."
898,Todd Shreve,"January 8, 2020",5, Fast and stable

902,Jaimin Patel,"April 2, 2019",4, Would be helpful if there is a link to update release notes when notification for M3 update is shown. it is frustrating not knowing what new features/fixes are included in the update before starting the update from the phone app or the car.

908,Brian Fligg,"August 26, 2019",2, Can we have the old SolarCity app back please? It provided so much more info and was easy to use. This tesla app is also loaded with useless options and features that dont apply to someone only using it for solar.
909,Vegard Brøtan,"October 2, 2019",5, Very good car app for Teslas. I use it almost every day.
910,Iain McDonald,"October 8, 2019",5, Amazing. The thing I really want it to do next is send sentry clips remotely as they happen.

926,Mr H,"August 2, 2019",1, Useless app. Tesla app sucks SWEATY PRISON BALLS. Doesn't work with the wife's car. Won't communicate 100% of the time. Now I have to use with solar panels and it sucks even harder.

930,Shawn S,"October 26, 2018",3, App works good but it doesn't unlock or lock vehicle it only works about 2% of the time
931,Phillip Duke,"May 10, 2019",4, can there be an option to remotely close your windows? Also can the passenger side A/C off or on while keeping the drivers side on and vice versa?
932,E H,"June 3, 2019",1, Downgrade from Solarcity app. This is a poor poor excuse for a solar app. Tesla should be embarrassed. Shameful. App makes it impossible to track generation per month year after year........hmmmm maybe this is what they want?
933,andy walker,"May 27, 2019",1, If you like being locked out of your car while you fiddle with you phone for 10 minutes then this is the perfect app!
934,Tiffany Williams,"August 24, 2019",1, As a Solar city customer we have now been directed to us the app to pay. I am loghed on but have absolutely nowhere to pay! This is ridiculous!

Does not tell you : production by each inverter,  if the inverter is down and not prodcuting does not have the same informaiton, they could used the same software and name it Tesla.  In addition, you can not access it online on your own computer.   The application is design for cars and selling energy and NOT for energy prodcution.  Tesla needs to reinstate the SolarCity access online and renaming the application to Tesla.  Tesla needs to have access to Energy production only not to cars or selling solar panels. Thanks"

But limited historic data, compare with the solaredge app where you can see day by day not just aggregated data.

On that note, PLEASE allow Android Auto and CarPlay on the vehicle. You'll never get close to them, so just support them. It would be great to get notification if a scheduled charge is not going to take place due to a wall connector issue, or if low on battery. It would save someone from waking up to a dead Tesla.

This app is a fantastic way to communicate with your car from anywhere, as long as you and your car are connected to the network.

This is absolutely incredible for places like Canada where we face winters with lots of freezing rain and snow.

2393,Joseph S,"September 12, 2017",3, No widgets. Just updated to new version. Like the UI changes but no widgets and still can't turn on rear defrost.
2394,Dave Hamill,"August 9, 2017",2, Works VERY occasionally and is pretty good when it does..BUT 9 out of 10 times it won't connect on either my Samsung or IPad. Overall pretty useless.
2395,Duncan B,"August 3, 2017",2," Powerwall 2: previous version worked well with periodic login required. Update from yesterday continually logs you out, plus when you do login there are ongoing network/communication issues - poor update. Please revert to previous version since it worked..."
2396,Radhwan Abood,"February 10, 2019",1, Lots of issues after the latest update. 1. The charge schedule time doesn't show anymore 2. Doesn't send charge complete notification anymore. 3.the heating controls are buggy
2397,Lars Tobias Skjong-Børsting,"August 30, 2017",4," Stable, does not crash. I wish for: Show battery percentage along with mileage (""typical""). Show exterior temperature. Close windows."
2398,Vincent Anzelone,"August 17, 2017",3," Has limited control of the car and some settings.  This would be a 5 star app if you could change the other settings in the car, plan trips, etc. like you can from the 17"" display."

2403,A Google user,"August 25, 2017",3, Missing a lot of things but maybe that's the point to encourage 3rd party apps?
2404,Krishna Merai,"August 13, 2017",4, Allow us to change the amperage the car is charging at OR intelligently adjust amperage automatically to charge multiple cars at once.
2405,Vivian Jones,"September 22, 2017",5, Handy app. I use the heat or cooling the car the most. The notification when my car is finished charging is great

2415,Chad Bentz,"July 5, 2017",1, How about a order/CPO mode where I can view some real time status about my car being prepped!  2 months is a long time to wait for a vehicle purchase and this would be an awesome time killer!
2416,Tiến Nguyễn,"August 1, 2017",3, It's useful but please make it work with Bluetooth connection just like model 3
2417,Michael Tinsley,"July 20, 2017",4, Excellent but new to Tesla family. After now having read some other more seasoned user reviews there are clearly some solid recommendations for reliability and functionality.
2418,A Google user,"July 5, 2017",4, Just wish it could do more.  Supercharger locations for example.
2419,Peter Joseph,"July 12, 2017",5, Almost as awesome as the car
2420,Markus Kohli,"May 24, 2017",4, Only thing I'm missing: a widget to start the A/C with one simple push of a button :) Otherwise a great and useful app.

2427,Dave Smith,"May 18, 2017",2, Its pretty poor connectivity is scetchy and not much of real use for a tesla app its rubbish 2 out of 10 for effort..
2428,Elliott Goldwyn,"May 11, 2017",5, I love living in the future!
2429,Tesla Adventures,"May 19, 2017",5, It is deeply heading in the right direction. Since the last update
2430,Jim Balkovec,"April 22, 2017",2, Could do so so much more. New version an improvement over old but did not expand capabilities. Update: now I can monitor my energy usage with Powerwall... Not happy with Tesla putting effort into this instead of adding useful features to the app. Dropping my rating to two stars!
2431,Justin Horrocks,"April 20, 2017",5," Very helpful, easy-to-use app. I was recently locked out of my house and realized a great feature to have would be the ability to have the car open the garage door by pressing a button in the app. Please add that to the suggestion box!"
2432,Brad Ward,"April 27, 2017",2," So much potential, but so little effort put into making this great..  how about scheduling, or changing charge amps... Or any way controlling most of the cars capabilities."

Tesla disappoints again  I like the new UI and the updated app works as well as the old one. However, it really is a missed opportunity to provide much needed functionality. For example, the ability to switch on the rear screen / mirror defrost, control fan speed or reset the climate control to full auto, and switch on the seat heaters, adjust charging amp, timer for charging/climate control. Less critical but nice would be the ability to send a route to the sat nav. I look forward to the next update."
2439,Daniel Barnett,"March 22, 2017",2, App gets worse with each release. Car won't respond even though settings are correct within the vehicle. Never wakes up. Very frustrating. Wish we could give up some features and functionality on the app simply so the thing would work correctly. Note 6.
2440,Kim Lising,"March 19, 2017",2, Why does this app continue to stop working? 2 times in 2 wks that it can't connect. Uninstalled & reinstalled numerous times. Turned off phone numerous times. What the heck?

That sucks!"
2451,J. David Karlin,"March 7, 2017",1," Please fix this app. I had no problem with the previous version. Now it simply doesn't work with my Samsung Note 5. It either doesn't connect at all, connects but can's change anything and rarely, if I'm sitting in the car it works!! Bizarre. Please fix it."
2452,Anibal Jodorcovsky,"February 14, 2017",4, Excellent app. I'm still having intermittent issue with the summon functionality with connections to the car. It'd be really good to be able to open trunk and frunk from the app. I hardly ever take the fob out but I have my phone on me at all times.  Very nice look and feel!
2453,Stuart Saunders,"February 14, 2017",5," Never connects. Need to select Location tab or kill app from activity stack, otherwise you get stuck with a loading spinner. I've tried reinstalling, but it doesn't fix the issue. Surprised there isn't more active development with this app."

I echo some of the frustrations of the other users though in that the functionality largely remains the same. Great features would be route planning that one can send to the car (including charge stop options), preheating the battery, heated seat, steering wheel & wiper controls, rear windscreen heater, front windscreen demister, integrations to other apps, widgets, complete control over charging currents and schedules as in the car, global window open/close. I could think of more, but these would really be great features as some exist in competitor's offerings like BMW and I hate being outdone by fossil fuel guys 😉"
2455,Brad Simon,"February 18, 2017",3," Great when it works. Mine has said ""network error"" for a week on my Samsung Note 5. The app works just fine on my wife's iPhone. I've rebooted and tried everything. Won't work anymore."
2456,Nathan Drozd,"February 11, 2017",5, UI improvement is nice.  No more hangup issues if you are logged in but haven't accessed the app in awhile (had to totally close out prior).  Would LOVE to see Android wear functionality.  Please add this!

2459,Mashukul Hoque,"February 13, 2017",1, The app keeps saying 'updated 2 mins ago' at the bottom and all controls have stopped working. This is on Galaxy S7. Anybody else having the same problem?
2460,Simon MacArthur,"February 13, 2017",2," Wasted opportunity to add basic features like seat heating, seems like a waste of time to upgrade if no new features are added and the marginal benefit is subjective aesthetics."

2463,Brett Ludden,"February 10, 2017",4, Would love to see remote seat and steering wheel heater options.  I expected widgets. I don't see them yet. It looks clean and tight though. Hopefully its interaction with the car is quick response.

2468,Tim PJP,"February 11, 2017",3, I'm only giving this app 3 stars because there is so much potential to improve it.  Most of all I would like the ability to program time of departure so it will be warmed up first.
2469,Support 41As,"February 12, 2017",1, I updated the app and now I cannot send commands to my vehicle. I cannot turn on the climate. This is really frustrating
2470,Kathy Chen,"February 26, 2017",4, I agree with other people on the whole more features thing...I also want to add that I wish the app would allow you to see the temperature inside the car before you turn on climate control...overall the new aesthetics are amazing...also was anyone able to summon via this app?
2471,Hubert Dekock,"February 11, 2017",5, Very nice. Thanks a lot Tesla. But where's the widget for Android ? I'll continue to use my self-made 'T Widget' on Android (search for 'Tesla T Widget' on Google Play) and I'm expecting an official one from you guys at some point please.

2905,Andrew Tibbits,"February 4, 2013",4,Solid first version Very sleek and functional. It's a great idea to be able to talk to the car over the internet. Several minor bugs though I am looking forward to being fixed in future versions.

It's a nice touch that the image of the car is color-coded to match your actual car color. It has a good 1-3s response time. I guess that's to be expected though. It's not like a TV remote. Even if you're standing right next to the car, the signal is traveling for miles and miles, through several exchanges and protocols before it ever hits the car."

Most times it keeps loading without connecting unless you completely close the app. Lacks notifications present in iPhone version. Has to be restarted if minimised to background.
