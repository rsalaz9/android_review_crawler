I cannot login without link it to my phone number which I don't remember. It has been more than 10 years. Too bad. Why cannot I login by username and password as usual? Actually I can login, but cannot send or receive any messages. I hope the next rev would fix the bug."

38,Dean Lewis,"March 29, 2020",3," Looks great but no English or International version, which QQ previously had for the desktop version ""back in the day"".

Is not only about Tencent. It is about how they (companies) consider themselves.    They  can't make a linux version - looks impossible for them to use winelibs with their software and  looks impossible to port QQ to linux., now looks impossible to put their software on Android.   this is bad because they already got a big community.- I need to talk with my chinese friends but I can't from mobile just because they can't do native Android things .. I can't from Linux because they are incapable ..   and they can't get they point they could create a big  bridge between the outerworld and China - windows mobile market is going down therefore the mobile market for QQ will do the same. .  and if they think I'll buy window to talk with my chinese pals, then dream on  Tencent"

Therefore, and excellent product but locked down because of the language barrier."
