0,Atlanta Bombshell,"September 22, 2019",1,"Hacked then Disabled without warning!! I‚Äôve been a Facebook user for years. Recently I started getting messages of someone trying to reset my password from another state (hackers). Even after changing my password each time, the attempts continued. The most recent hacker attempt must have been successful to the point my account was disabled by them for violating Facebook rules and regulations. There was nothing in my email asking me to verify anything! Once I saw the attempt at password reset, I tried to use the app to change it and that‚Äôs when I received a pop up notification that the account was disabled along with every app that uses Facebook as a log in method. Facebook help center provides no help. All they ask for is your email, name, and ID for their investigation purposes. Then I get an email stating the account was permanently disabled and can never be reinstated‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt even me! Now I don‚Äôt even know what else the hacker was able to get into prior to it being disabled. Did they gain access to other apps with more sensitive information? Can I not even appeal and prove it wasn‚Äôt me trying to reset a password in a states miles away!?!? Very frustrating. And with no real online support or customer service‚ÄîI‚Äôm dead on the water. Help?!"
1,WHaynie,"February 15, 2020",1,"Forcing ‚ÄúContinue in Watch‚Äù is a very bad move My two stars from the other week in regards to my saved items automatically being saved to a folder when they aren‚Äôt supposed to is now down to one star due to the newest excuse for an update. In the past I would be watching something and if I clicked on it to watch it bigger it would then show other suggested videos from Watch under it. That was fine. But now I will only be a few seconds into a video on my feed without touching it yet and it will COMPLETELY STOP the video and te me to continue watching  it on Watch. HOWEVER when I try to click the video to make it bigger and thus open it in Watch it won‚Äôt do jack squat. This tells me I would have to click over to Watch and then attempt to refind the video just to bloody watch it in the first place. I don‚Äôt know who was smoking the stupid juice this time, but I would rather watch no videos than have to go out of my way to hunt a video down just to watch after it‚Äôs already been presented in front of me. And as someone with a business page that posts videos (AND PAYS GOOD MONEY to use some as ads) it makes me want to cut back what I spend with you all if this is what my users will be left with. Please please PLEASE change it back."
2,WinstonFl,"September 17, 2019",2,"Buggiest app on my iPad Let‚Äôs face it, if you use social media Facebook is a must have to stay connected.  However the Facebook app is a complete bug filled app that only seems to break more with every update.  I‚Äôve been waiting for years for it to work right and yet I always know when an update comes, because something you use regularly will break guaranteed.  If by some miracle it gets fixed in the bi-weekly update, I promise you something else you use will be hindered in the next version. "
3,MKaip,"November 19, 2017",1,"Locked Out of Account If I could give 0 Stars, I would.. Facebook has locked me out of my account for days, saying they need to review a photo of me. There is no one to contact or email to fix it. I have had my account since about 2005 so it doesn‚Äôt make sense.. The Help Page is of no help because it consists of regular people who do not have access to unlock accounts. Facebook needs to have a direct contact via Chat or email to assist their customers."
4,Mzkishanicole,"November 14, 2019",2,"Ok app, people you may know feature is annoying The app is ok to deal with but the people you may know feature is completely annoying and frustrating. I must say it‚Äôs a nice feature but it gets frustrating when you remove people and the next day or a few days later they show up again as people you may know. Facebook needs to add a delete button for that and not just the remove button or the remove button should remove that person and their profile permanently because hitting the remove button only brings that person profile back up within a day or a few days. I‚Äôm completely irritated with it because if I hit the remove bottom it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know that person, I don‚Äôt want to know that person, or don‚Äôt want to be friends with that person. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time ‚Äúremoving‚Äù but not permanently removing people from the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù only for them to pop back up as people I may know 24-48hrs later!! IT‚ÄôS ANNOYING. STOP IT FACEBOOK LET ME PERMANENTLY REMOVE PEOPLE I DON‚ÄôT KNOW AND/OR DON‚ÄôT WANT TO KNOW OR BE BOTHERED WITH WITHOUT HAVING THEM POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. REVAMP THE ‚ÄúPEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW‚Äù FEATURE SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER MANAGED BY US!! Thanks üò§üò§"
5,Valensghost,"November 16, 2019",2,"Issues that need fixing There are several things that are frustrating.  1- if I mark See posts first, that means I want to see this persons posts first ‚Äî NOT three days later, and not after seeing countless posts from people not marked See first. See first means see first.  2 - when I scroll through my newsfeed I doesn‚Äôt want it to stop after 3 or 4 posts.  I want it to keep scrolling.  When I‚Äôve seen enough I will quit. If I delete the app it and reinstall, it will work for awhile but will behave the same way again soon.  3-  if I see a post on my Facebook iPad app, I should be able to also see it on my iPhone Facebook app.  Why aren‚Äôt these two newsfeeds consistent? 4 - if I have a custom list or a smart list, why can‚Äôt I click on that list and see posts from just those people?  5- if there are birthdays or events that show up in the right hand column, I don‚Äôt want to see the word DONE, I want to see the event or birthday.  Again, I can get this to work again if I delete and reinstall the app. Perhaps rather than working on enhancements the developers just need to fix the bugs, and then be sure future bug fixes don‚Äôt break things again."
6,Pu Erh Tea,"April 19, 2020",2,"Attn: FB suspended my account for no solid reason suddenly Greetings Facebook crew! The purpose I write to you is none other than to impart my report as well as to acquire assistance pertaining to Facebook account service. So today all of a sudden Facebook is asking me to submit a photo ID upon logging in; and I have uploaded and sent a photo of my driving license (genuine!). I have been using Facebook since 2009 if my memory serves me well and I never did infringe your ToU or regulations but somehow you team got me as using a fake profile name? I believe someone from within my friend list or a page (I don‚Äôt know as I followed/Liked tons of pages) was behaving mischievously and made a false accusation or report over my profile for no solid reason. What‚Äôs more, I did not do anything wrong ever since I use Facebook, or use the service for illegal purposes. Pretty please review my account suspension that does not hold water and reinstate it in next to no time. Please reach out to me please. It is the quarantine period and I need to work from home. Not to mention I have other foreign accounts that I link FB to login with. Thank you for your concern. Why do I have to bear a fault that is not mine?"
7,Pikaboo09,"February 17, 2019",3,"New update causing newsfeed to freeze Didn‚Äôt have this problem until yesterday when the new update kicked in. Everything else works fine, notifications, clicking through group posts and whatnot. But as soon as I go to news feed before or after doing other things on the app it just freezes. I‚Äôve reset the app, I‚Äôve reset my phone, I‚Äôve cleared all of Facebook‚Äôs caches, and I‚Äôm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling next."
8,ehmob,"March 17, 2020",2,"WHAT IS GOING ON??? A couple of my posts are being removed as going against Community Standards regarding spam. One was an historical article entitled ‚ÄúCoronasvirus and the Sun: a Lesson from the 1918 Influenza Pandemic‚Äù (I posted one and the other that appears on my timeline I was tagged in) The other post that was removed as spam was regarding digitized artwork from Paris museums entitled ‚ÄúParis Museums Put 100,000 Images Online for Unrestricted Public Use‚Äù. In this case I did post both, the first time was March 4th, the second time was March 16 with a title that suggested a wonderful way to view the art work - by streaming the site. A form of entertainment that is both beautiful and educational. I would not be writing this here except for the fact that there is no longer a place on the app under Help and Support were I could pose questions or defend my posts. I was also unable to find FB‚Äôs definition of spam. Did I miss something or miss an update? I do try to update regularly. Or perhaps the most recent update for my phone, needs to get some more bugs worked out and improvements made. "
9,Daaabby,"November 2, 2019",1,"Terrible app, terrible website I hate Facebook. There's more things than I want to even write out. The security/customer service is pure garbage. Why? Because they don't have customer service! My Instagram (of course Facebook owns Instagram) got hacked and the situation was so complex that there was no way the automated response service could help with it. Come to find out there's no live customer support... Honestly, how is that even legal???? Does it even matter how many accounts there are on Instagram? It's not like Mark Zuckerberg and Co have no money to hire people or something? I don't know maybe I'm just crazy. Because I thought they were pretty rich."
10,Amyncosolo,"October 3, 2017",2,"Shutting down I don't know why but lately Facebook app has been shutting down and going to my main screen while I'm reading somethingüò°very annoying!!! Fix this bug please! It also refreshes on its own. That's really annoying too when you are going through comments and then back out wanting to continue where you were before going to the comments and it decides on its own ""nope you were done scrolling"" üôÑ "
11,Diane Harris,"October 10, 2017",3,"Irritating App The app has been driving me crazy for months now. If I stay on the Facebook page, it only blacks out once or twice per evening. If I want to read something (my cousin's newspaper article, for instance) posted by my friends, the app blacks out every time and if I want to continue on Facebook, I have to open the app all over again and hope I can find my place. I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing!  Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?"
12,Kristycake,"November 6, 2017",1,"Enough with refreshing the newsfeed! I never write reviews, but these recent updates make me want to delete Facebook. 6 months ago, if I needed to pause my Facebook scrolling go do something else, I would just click someone‚Äôs picture and it would ‚Äúhold my place‚Äù in my newsfeed. This was great. I‚Äôm a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we‚Äôre set! I‚Äôm tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load.  I can‚Äôt imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to ‚Äúok‚Äù these poorly planned ‚Äúenhancements‚Äù."
13,So Done!,"October 24, 2018",1,"Someone LIED to you Whomever told you this latest update was a great idea, SHOULD BE FIRED. 1)When notifications come in that I‚Äôve been tagged or someone has replied to a comment I made, it no longer takes you to the post, just to the comment. So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There‚Äôs even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to  their page, I haven‚Äôt been blocked and they call me to say ‚Äúdid you see my last post‚Äù and all I see is nothing. "
14,Sheryl1468,"November 11, 2018",2,"No notifications about my posts! For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess.  The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don‚Äôt load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself.  All I see are notifications about my friends‚Äô posts.  Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications.  When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn‚Äôt refresh to show any more than exactly 20.  Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it‚Äôs not because of anything I did or didn‚Äôt do.  AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I‚Äôm limited to 20 again.   AND notifications for my posts still aren‚Äôt in the list.  I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn‚Äôt fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions."
15,Matti moo,"December 3, 2018",1,"If it isn‚Äôt broken, don‚Äôt fix it Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It‚Äôs amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that‚Äôs across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I‚Äôve done my best to continually update my setting but it‚Äôs getting crazy. Now I‚Äôll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don‚Äôt need a red push notification making it seem like I should."

17,The lord is exceptional,"August 4, 2019",1,Following the prompts doesn‚Äôt work at all I have follow all the necessary prompts that i am suppose to take and every since i got my new phone but it won‚Äôt let me get back into the app at all when i have repeatedly taken four selfies on yesterday with me whole up different numbers and i have taken some other selfies with me whole up different other numbers today as well but by me repeatedly doing this i am putting myself at risk repeatedly doing the same thing over and over again and if you are a new user to Facebook don‚Äôt trust it if you get log out and can‚Äôt get back in because you switch mobile companies and you don‚Äôt have your old phone number or old mobile phone and if you more than Facebook post they won‚Äôt take that down neither once putting you at risk for hackers so if you are a new Facebook user don‚Äôt trust it if don‚Äôt be put at risk for haveing more than one Facebook page and post i will not give Facebook any type of ratings for haveing my identity expose in a manner in which i just stated in this paragraph it‚Äôs wrong and will be getting in touching with the Federal Trade commission center since i no way to deactivate all my pages and post.
18,shortcxke,"December 20, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs good. Not perfect, but good enough. Just be smart and don‚Äôt click on random links, don‚Äôt give away your password to anybody, don‚Äôt accept suspicious links even from your friends unless it‚Äôs 100% sure that it‚Äôs your friend who messaged you. There are many cases that people are ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, when in reality they just gave away their password. I‚Äôve been using the Internet since I was in 3rd grade and i‚Äôve never been hacked. I‚Äôm in college now!"
19,Homanomana,"February 8, 2020",2,"Little details make a big difference Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I‚Äôm just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it‚Äôs entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It‚Äôs frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It‚Äôs too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you‚Äôve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you‚Äôve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button so you don‚Äôt risk closing your page. It‚Äôs little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you‚Äôre on the verge of falling apart."
20,asmileforjenna,"April 8, 2018",1,"Nothing loads anymore... When I open the app I can only see a handful of posts from days ago. When I scroll to the bottom, the app doesn‚Äôt load any more posts. Refreshing does nothing. I don‚Äôt get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don‚Äôt load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don‚Äôt show up. "
21,cevans172,"August 18, 2018",3,"Nothing loads anymore I‚Äôve been a faithful Facebook user for years. It is my go to social media platform and I love it. However for the last couple months I‚Äôve noticed it won‚Äôt load random things. Images, comments, and video will stop loading if I‚Äôve been scrolling for a minute or two. Sometimes I‚Äôll be just hopping on and comments won‚Äôt load for something. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm on WiFi or data. I‚Äôve even gone as far as to uninstall it and reinstall it twice this week, which worked for that night and stopped the next day. I never used to have this problem until after I got the iPhone X. My husband just switched phones to the iPhone X like me (got mine on Mother‚Äôs Day) and now he experiences it too, and we have friends who say they noticed it as well on this phone but when they switched phones, it was all good. Is there possibly a compatibility flaw between Facebook and the new iPhone? I hate not being able to use it like I used to. Hopefully this can be fixed so we can keep using it."
22,TamaraMonkey,"September 5, 2018",1,"Unwanted sounds. Huge unusable app. I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It‚Äôs obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea."
23,changemessenger,"October 12, 2018",1,"Facebook Messenger Please find a way not to show all your friends when you‚Äôre on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn‚Äôt want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger!  It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don‚Äôt know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I‚Äôm a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do."

25,Xavier Wolfen,"April 1, 2020",1,"Not worth it, borderline violates freedom of speech They‚Äôre run almost completely by bots it seems and you can be banned from posting for the most ridiculous things. Wasn‚Äôt like this before, but either they‚Äôre under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn‚Äôt even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I‚Äôm in (I‚Äôm in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I‚Äôm going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I‚Äôm blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It‚Äôs 8:58 now and I‚Äôm still blocked, but no explanation this time. I‚Äôve had posts taken down before that don‚Äôt break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don‚Äôt offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it.

26,Sarikay1994,"January 17, 2020",1,"Buggy in the app, buggy in the browser, just can‚Äôt win. I use my iPad exclusively for managing a business page on facebook. IT IS INFURIATING. Nothing works properly. The app skips around, comments don‚Äôt post occasionally, and the worst is trying to dig through a whole post to find where someone has tagged me in a comment. For some reason, notifications don‚Äôt bring me to the tag or reply, it just sends me to the general post or group and I have to DIG for it. It‚Äôs a huge waste of my time and a hinderance to my business. Then, in the browser, it inserts double spaces every time I hit the space bar. This is a confirmed Facebook problem, not the fault of Apple, safari, or chrome. It is the same across all browsers. Some have theorized that this is so facebook can force you to use the app, where they have more room for advertising, but THE APP DOESN‚ÄôT WORK EITHER. If I was not dependent on Facebook for my business, I flat out would not use it. It‚Äôs terrible. Terrible platform, terrible apps, terrible algorithm codes. You‚Äôd think a multi million dollar company would at least be competent enough to resolve the double-space issue in the browser. Ridiculous. FIX IT."

28,Tazzie637,"April 3, 2020",1,"Um, what?! I have an idea!! Instead of pretending your app is perfect, how about make a place where people can actually report issues with the programming??

Why am I getting the notification that they are calling when it clearly states they will NOT be able to call?? Fix that.. Also, I loathe that when I pause a video and put my phone down, the video starts playing again.. That makes absolutely no sense at all.. Why have a pause button?? It seems like the ‚Äúupdates‚Äù that happen every two weeks are just adding more minor inconveniences and prohibiting more and more options, like changing your name.. Also, why are people I have on my blocked list placed on the list of people to share posts with?? I went to share a post on a specific persons page and two people I have on my blocked list were on that list of people to share with.. WHAT?! Makes so sense!!

31,Craigbiz,"May 6, 2018",1,"Privacy Wanted I am a very private individual. I keep my friends list very limited to under 20 people tops (mostly family and not even friends & co-workers) so that I can share video and photos with them about life events. I also post news commentary. I know about the NSA thing with Snowden. This is not what has upset me. Now, Facebook is publicly threatening that instead of just the algorithm and a relatively small team of content curators based out of Facebook's HQ, they are planning to hire an army of up to 20,000 human content police! I have real fears that one of these 20,000 strong may end up being a nosy neighbor down the street. I don't like the idea of having 20,000 people capable of seeing my posts that I don't even know who they are. The NSA is in Maryland, Facebook is in California. I was not worried about people from either of those groups being a neighbor living next door to me that I do not want to have access to my information! I am very weird in what I post (ufo stuff). Im sick of having to worry if my neighbor might happen to be a Facebook mod, like those in the website Nextdoor in which I am constantly tearing up snail mail invites for."

35,Tootsdm,"September 4, 2018",1,Most frustrating app ever I have been a holdout since Facebook started. I finally gave in so I could see what was going on with family.  This has been the most stressful annoying experience ever.  No tech support while developer Mark is a billionaire.   I also several times a week only have about 6 items and the feed ends.  Log out and back in. Did setting for a couple people to be on the top of my feed.  Never are.

37,Keetgi,"February 3, 2020",2,"Updating the App into Uselessness I am a member of a lot of groups and rely on my email notifications to decide which posts to actually read and which to ignore. Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I‚Äôm assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What‚Äôs worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the ‚Äúview on Facebook‚Äù button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it‚Äôs doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn‚Äôt show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else. Stop updating the app to make it less convenient for users!"

Also it‚Äôs just annoying every time it takes me to the other app. It‚Äôs just as acting like Snapchat and it doesn‚Äôt do the best job. I would also recommend having the settings be a little more comfortable and less confusing for everyone thank you. I would also recommend NOT having soooo many ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù it‚Äôs so annoying and it‚Äôs so crowded. I would also like my feed to NOT RESET every time. it is VERY difficult to find a post when almost nothing is in order and TOO MANY suggested posts appear!! I would also like an option to be able to delete EVERY SINGLE post. It would also be MORE comfortable(in my opinion)to have the RESHARED POSTS be on a different category to posts I ACTUALLY made. Because seriously it doesn‚Äôt make sense!!! My feed is a mess and honestly idk if it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt been on the app much but please being on the app is sometimes is irritating. Thank you have a great day.

I can see the items and search for the title of the items I see still nothing.  The recent posts I want to see what happened with my friends since the last time I was on and that is a total joke.

I hung up the phone and checked my Facebook wall only to find an ad for the walk in tubs AND for one of those ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" services. Facebook searches through my private address book and suggests that I might want to ""friend"" people they find. There is so much fake news that shows up on my wall. Some of the ads are so obviously fake and they show up everywhere on FB. Ones about alive celebrities where the ad says so and so died and no one knew she died. Others that say things like Joy Behr is quitting the View because she uses a certain face cream. Our president spends all his waking hours lying to the American public.

That‚Äôs not it! Until it happened to me! I have never purchased or looked up sudifed online or anything like it even Tylenol or anything else online  pain reliever in my life.

Meanwhile, someone can make one racist comment after another, get reported, and nothing happens to them.

If you‚Äôre typing and then click on the completed word and hit space afterward, it actually backspaces and erases the last letter of the word that was just put there. If you don‚Äôt catch it and retype the last letter and hit space and start typing the next word, you end up with one long word instead of two. This is is s new glitch that Facebook hasn‚Äôt bothered to fix in its many updates since the glitch started.

Facebook has never listened to its members, and never will. This app continues to be the most unreliable, complicated, cluttered mess I‚Äôve ever seen. The news feed shows what Facebook wants you to see, instead of what your friends post, in the order it was posted. There are so many irrelevant advertisements on your timeline and you can‚Äôt even watch any videos without Facebook forcing you to watch another irrelevant commercial they‚Äôve inserted into the video. Also, this is the most invasive app in the App Store. Facebook mines your personal information 24/7.

And it *acts* like it's updating, so if I try to scroll all the way to the bottom (it only goes down about two screens' worth now) it ""glitches"" as though it's adding new notifications and I lose my place and it takes forever to get the notifications hidden and sometimes even then they still take up all the space in the notification list. I miss *everything*. People say they tag me in stuff, poke me, put stuff on my wall... I will never see it! I guess now we just wait til whatever the thing is that takes over from fb.

But I was in multiple mom & small shop groups & these ladies literally bully & harass other moms & I reported the page for bullying. There was no reason for such mean & awful behavior. We‚Äôre moms, ADULTS. These women are 30 & 40 years old being mean girls just because people have different opinions & different taste. Facebook got back with me & said ‚Äúalthough we are aware there are some bullying content on this page, it does not break our Facebook rules/guidelines‚Äù ...I was furious. Does it take a person(s) to take their life due to bullying before a page is taken down?? I have a 0% bullying tolerance. & believe it should not be allowed AT ALL. Yes, people can have different opinions, but to put someone down over small shops/what you choose to do as a mom?? No. I‚Äôve lost too many people to bullying & it should NOT be accepted. "

I also keep getting blocked out of my account and ppl are reporting for things that I should definitely not be reported for and it‚Äôs locking me out of my account I have had to make a new account because of this only to be blocked by Facebook and I have been for 2 days now I HAVE NOT posted anything wrong at all this is very frustrating and annoying if this keeps happening I will delete the app and never use it again fix this NOW!!

Honestly I think they get too much information about people and share it to openly with companies and advertisers. Even with these shut off, I still get ads for something I google searched. I have been having to constantly turn off notifications for random people. Every day the past several days. If I want notifications set for people, then I will set them! I don‚Äôt want to be notified every time someone I hardly talk to posts something.. I also am not very fond of the new app interface or the fact that I can‚Äôt scroll through my newsfeed to watch videos I come across anymore. I have to press on the video and open it all the way to continue watching the full video, and I have to watch ads all the time now. I honestly skip videos now when I see an ad pop up.

Take the gif icon, it‚Äôs a royal pita being inside the comment box, especially with the touch keyboards - hard to avoid with a finger tip when editing a comment. Come to the end of a line and try to edit it, it‚Äôs hard to avoid hitting the stupid thing. Make it optional! I will never ever use a gif in a comment. Plus I do not want to see them, so let us block gif comments. New bells and whistles are meaningless and continue to make FB the number 1 consumer of battery life.

85,f.u.m.z.,"July 10, 2019",1,Can you not fix the problem or is it censorship? This past year I‚Äôve had a hard time seeing the posts from pages I love and to see new posts I have to go onto the page. I should be seeing a lot of their posts because I‚Äôm liking commenting and frequenting the page all the time and to top that off I got a top fan badge from a page I posted one comment on and never from the pages I frequent which I don‚Äôt care about or understand the idea of badges but I still just found it funny that it happened. Also on any public post I can see that there is thousands of comments and when I go to the comment section it says most relevant comments are selected and there is none. And there‚Äôs no menu to change it like there is on my friends posts. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating and I find it hard to believe that out of thousands of comments you find none of them relevant. We all know you have an extremist left wing political view Facebook but it doesn‚Äôt give you the right hide information from people that don‚Äôt think the same as you.
86,eChangX,"September 5, 2019",2,Facebook on iOS is not very interesting This app is kind of boring. If it‚Äôs too much to develop then just separate everything like you did with the messenger. Do the same for groups and pages as a different app or apps. I don‚Äôt mind downloading them all. At least I will notice them and always remember to check those places. Till you find better solutions to every little things that sets off everyone‚Äôs feelings towards the app. I can‚Äôt even go straight to a page that I am following which someone commented on. I can only get the working on a normal browser which takes me straight to the page itself. Which much more convenient for me. But these days it seems I can‚Äôt even unfollow a post that I don‚Äôt want to see its notification. So why not try this.. put some sort of expiry on every post we view unless our name is mentioned in it. So no notifications show up till my name or a reply was made under my comment directly since everyone already knows how to reply comments.

I tried to recreate a new FB account, start over. So I used my real name, and same real ID. And FACEBOOK ******* disabled it! It‚Äôs just so upsetting, because they don‚Äôt have customer service, just a help center. I would try the help board but I can‚Äôt even do that because you need an account for that.

Would love to get an older version of this app from two years ago would be nice. Would also be nice for Facebook to stop banning meme pages and conservatives but keeps up brain-dead pages like occupy democrats.

Anything they disagree with goes against their so-called community standards because they don‚Äôt want ideas to be challenged. They are constantly silencing the opposition by saying our posts are hate speech. That‚Äôs happened to me several times. They took my posting privileges away several times supposedly for posting hate speech. The first time I got a 24 hour ban then after that a three day ban and finally two 30 day bans. I really hope Facebook goes out of business soon because I am really fed up with their censorship. Facebook is anti-America, pro-Islam, pro-Socialism, and even pro-rape. They actively promote graphic violence and pornography while banning anything they disagree with. Facebook isa publisher posing as a platform. That is unacceptable.

I have no respect for the company today, as they've diluted the user quality and have begun to focus on profit over people. What's the point of having a separate app for messages!?!? To get more user data. Why? More targeted ads. Now, they update the app almost daily and it's ANNOYING. I would be less irritated if they were small sized updates (like 20-40 Mbps), but noooo, every update is over 200 Mbps in size and there's very little to NO difference in the app's already diminished quality.

Because of his liberal views there is so much information that is withheld. These liberal views alone have divided the country by keeping the truth from the less informed.

I offered repeatedly to give her money, which she would not take, she needed legal advice but had only enough to provide for her family. The Democrats say one thing but constantly do another.

How does someone get flagged for selling a curling iron or video game system?!?! It's garbage. Constantly getting restricted or flagged for perfectly good items that meet the standards is harassment!!!! Also sellers should have a place to go that perfectly states what is and isn't allowed, what posting guidelines are and how many items you can post at what frequency so they can meet your guidelines!

113,Captain Mongoose123,"May 26, 2018",1,"So bad that I had to write a review Facebook is where I like to share with my friends and family back home photos and videos of my life living overseas. However, I have the hardest time doing that because of several reasons: (1) There‚Äôs a 40 photo limit, which is an inconvenience because users who take a lot of photos and videos would have to upload their photos in batches and it can be very time consuming. (2) The app lags while typing out captions and completely crashes after maybe the 10th caption, thus wasting a lot of time. (3) The MOST frustrating thing is that after all that typing and finally clicking upload, none of the photos upload. So I have to do it all over again. Oh wait, actually they did upload...3 weeks later so I ended up with doubles of the same photos. This happens every single time without fail and it is a complete waste of my time. This app should make it more convenient to upload photos straight from your phone, but instead it makes it 10 times more complicated."

This is by far the best time imo, to create a separate app just for communicating with your groups. Call it FB Groups or whatever, you want but it needs to happen soon.

While scrolling, if your finger is anywhere near a video it will open it and then proceed to take an eternity to close out so you can go back to your news feed which will have, without being asked, refreshed and updated. This forcing you to look for 16 hours for the post you actually wanted to see. Once you find said post the app will inevitably crash, where you will no longer feel inclined to look for that post anymore but instead cry within yourself and wonder why they can't just fix the app. Then when you find something else that you like or want to react to you have to press the like button 4 times before it responds.

They constantly scroll back to the top without even touching anything on the screen. I‚Äôve sent in numerous reports to the Help Center but nothing is being done to fix it. I haven‚Äôt updated my old iPhone 5s just so I can keep up with the visitors posts on the public pages I follow. That shouldn‚Äôt be necessary in this day and age. Fix it please.

FB needs more updates so that our timeline are in order as posted, be more current with posted from friends, not showing up until a day later. Currently all i see on my timeline are day old posts every time i open FB on top of that its the same one from ours earlier. Just because a friend post something doesnt mean i want to see the same post again if i didnt make a comment on it to have it recycle back to top of timeline, nor do we want to keep seeing it just because others commented. This update is doing the same thing it has done several updates ago. It has progressively gotten worse. I know alot of people ive talked to are looking for s new social media site to change to. Just saying....oh and when we toggle between screens for multitasking after scrolling down 30-40 posts, when switching back to FB, it starts you back over at the very top where we started at to begin with which is so irritating!"

Apparently at some point 40-50 million accounts were hacked due to a vulnerability with the view as feature. Resulting in the loss of the feature and the start of an investigation.

This was so incredibly useful as it took you right to the new posts, and now all it does it take you to the page of the person or group so you have to search around to try and find the post with new activity, which is incredibly inefficient for buy/sell groups where there are tons of new posts all the time.

If it hides anyone else, all I'll be able to see is a newsfeed full of advertisements I don't want. To make it worse, before I updated I could toggle between top posts and most recent posts. Now I can't. I can only take what Facebook wants me to see. I never wanted to see the top posts, I ALWAYS had to toggle to most recent first thing, or Facebook would show me the same three posts for five days. Now I can't do that. I hate this. They are cramming too much on a page, it's too busy and it's nothing I want to see. The app just keeps getting worse and worse. Can I roll back to the version from eight months ago?

Make an app without so many glitches and at a reasonable size while slowly adding features once they‚Äôve been perfected or don‚Äôt and continue pad the app and kill your brand it‚Äôs your call. I‚Äôm tired of reporting glitches and they‚Äôre never solved yet you add features designed to make you more money off of customer info which would be fine if you upheld your part and gave something that was actually worth your errors in judgment and the damage your algorithms cause society so you can make more money.

No other app does that except you guys & i REFUSE to send in my PERSONAL information for an app. I used facebook daily & i had years worth of photos on there & now i cant even get them back. Facebook is not the top app in the store to require all of this.

I run a daily music album/page where I share a video post with my description and a separate artist portrait that both go into the same photo album every day so that that people can access all the posts in one place. I have been doing this for almost a year and after hundreds of postings it suddenly no longer gives the option to add the videos to the album. This is absolutely critical and needs to be fixed ASAP.

This app doesn‚Äôt let you be the first since you can‚Äôt organize the listings by ‚Äúnewly listed‚Äù.  It picks which ones it thinks you‚Äôd like.  So week old listings pop up first along side ones that were posted an hour ago. You have to scroll forever to find something that was posted within the past 10 minutes. This company‚Äôs obsession with mind control is really quite disgusting. You see all these fb commercials about them  trying to gain your trust back. Rubbish. Stop trying to think for me. Stop making me stay on fb longer by putting all the new listings at the bottom. It‚Äôs no wonder why everyone under 30 is deleting this app.  Bunch of invasive creeps working over there.

Mostly if you have a lot of data for them to store and no crazy engagement with they childish likes competition plus ad clicks with clickbait. It would be hilarious if wasn‚Äôt tragic. Unfortunately I‚Äôve my hard drive with my children birth photos and I had in my mind that I had them on Facebook and they would be there perennially. As any other mega multinational Facebook doesn‚Äôt and will never care for their users it‚Äôs a matter of profit and profit only. Thanks for nothing."

This update comes with an issue that won‚Äôt allow the personal timeline to load, amongst other features having slow loading speeds (not related to my speeds on either cellular or Wi-Fi). The app would be a lot better if the Facebook team took the time to fully review all bugs or potential crashes before posting an update.

I randomly typed Chatty Tracy in the search bar on Google the other day and I was very pleasantly surprised that my image as well as my Facebook persona appeared.

Here‚Äôs the tea: I‚Äôve been using Facebook since pretty much forever and I kid you not, this is one of the worst app updates I‚Äôve had to endure. They‚Äôve added a feature to scroll down after clicking on a picture to view similar posts (like what was already happening with videos). The issue is that the feature is so slow. When you click on a picture, it doesn‚Äôt expand it to full size as it did before so you are forced to wait while it buffers and shows a small bar in the middle of your screen that says ‚Äúscroll down‚Äù. I WANT TO SEE THE PICTURE FULL SIZE AND THAT‚ÄôS WHY I CLICKED IN THE FIRST PLACE. It also won‚Äôt let you exit from the picture after the buffering has run its course.

The app version also doesn‚Äôt even show you all the latest posts you have made much less aggressively filtering the posts you see by others. Facebook is so greedy now that they constantly making your posts less and less visible to others unless you pay them to promote it.  Facebook stop being evil, just be honest and ask for a monthly subscription in exchange for allowing posts to be seen by all friends, not selling your info to marketers, and reducing ads.  Those that want to make believe they are getting something for free rather than selling their privacy for access can continue to have crappy visibility."

So far, in their infinite wisdom, they‚Äôve allowed me to see one friend‚Äôs constant posts and 2 other random friends‚Äô posts. I hate to lose contact with my friends but as it is, Facebook has removed that functionality for me. I‚Äôve already downloaded all my data. So there is NO reason to keep my account.

550,Road~King~Custom,"November 27, 2018",1,"Horrible Facebook used to be a great app. No gimmicks, no BS, just join and connect with folks from your past and present, that's no longer the case. All the updates and useless features have ruined it. Initially Marketplace was a great addition, one of the few good add on's. Now there are whole categories that show nothing but the title when I click to open an item to view it. For example, when I open vehicles the page loads fine and shows what's available, same with home sales. The problem arises when I click to open a posted sale item to view it. No photos load and all I'm left with is the banner at the top of the screen with the name of the posted item. It seems like every time they update something they screw something else up. I wish someone would develop a similar app without all the BS."

600,Pro-Vaccine CHOICE,"March 13, 2019",1,"Censorship I think we can all agree that the vaccine debate has become a pretty big topic now in 2019. Some people believe it is causing problems, other believe that people have the right to speak openly about their fears and concerns. Today, Facebook decided to take that right away from hundreds of thousands of people. I feel that this goes against our right as grown individuals to speak freely about concerning topics and to educate ourselves on both sides of the story. A mother just mentioned to me that a picture of her own son having a seizure (within an hour of being vaccinated) was removed from Facebook and that her commenting, posting, sharing, reacting and Facebook messenger right have been revoked afterwards. This is happening to thousands of other people expressing their opinions and concerns. This is wrong and Facebook, you should be ashamed."

And to provide rapid, although often times incorrect, current events, it is an awful necessity. And that‚Äôs despite the horrible ads that spy on you or steer you toward an untrustworthy site to steal your identity. Unfortunately, with the most recent update, I can only view about 10 featured items in my newsfeed before I cannot refresh or see anything else.

My first complaint was going to be about how not funny it was that the app constantly reset my setting for the in app sound even when I didn‚Äôt update the app. I was  constantly having to turn my in app sound off EVERY time I opened the app. I found this to be disturbing and odd which made me feel like what the hell else is FB doing to accounts without the users knowledge. The sounds are ANNOYING btw. I recently updated the app and now it crashes out of nowhere. The only use I get out of this app is reading posts and some support communicating with parents from some groups created for children with special needs but other than that I don‚Äôt use it because of the frustrating crap I have mentioned above.

628,Joc$,"February 22, 2020",1,Getting worse I recently learned FB uses third party vendor to monitor reported posts. They are reportedly very underpaid and work in a difficult environment. This I think is most of the problem. The community standards are loosely enforced and definitions of what is acceptable are too vague.  There is a lot of bullying and a lot of dangerous posts regarding religious and ethnic discrimination that gets reported and somehow is determined not to be against the community standards. The answer from FB is to block the person or unfollow. If the person is a public figure in the community it‚Äôs important for us to see what they are saying and it should be the responsibility of Facebook to remove harmful posts. There should be an option to comment on why you are reporting something because it seems those reviewing the reports are missing details.

First of all I pressed x to get out and second of all I wasn‚Äôt signed into google how  did they even get my email address the game I was playing you didn‚Äôt need to sign up with an email and neither did I sign into google I was signed out. So this thing just pops up on my screen takes me to a page of which my email is signed in password and all and the Facebook just expects me to sign up when they are stealing all your information illegally that is just well wrong never download this app it breaks every rule of privacy.

Now Ive changed it so many times that I cannot recall the new PW and when I attempt to recover it.... guess what, I need to submit another photo.  But for FB parasitically infesting everything an many apps/games requiring login through FB I‚Äôd close my account. As it is, next time I actually get on I plan to delete all content, the icon and never visit again so this, ‚Äúsecure your account‚Äù nonsense does not keep ruining games that are played over a given time frame which FB interrupts... thus costing me in-game purchases as well as progress and status.

Before this update, Facebook was one of the better social medias because you could watch endless amounts of videos with the occasional ad video between them. Now, almost every video you watch has an ad right in the middle of the video (sometimes in the middle of a sentence) it's very frustrating and takes away from what made Facebook great (the ability to just sit and scroll). Overall the update makes Facebook inferior to its social media competition that does not place ads in the middle of a video if at all. So, if you want to get back to the old Facebook i recommend Instagram because it's just the more modern easier to use platform now."

Facebook admits to manipulating users emotions on a large scale. Congress has directly questioned bigtech companies about ‚Äúprogramming people‚Äù using algorithms. The experiments done by Dr Pavlov prove animals(people are animals) can be brainwashed with visual and auditory stimulants on a biological level.

I think it would be nice to have more reactions to choose from for posts that we see daily. For example, a facepalm reaction, sick face reaction, or even a heart eyes reaction. These would be nice to see because I feel that the reactions we have aren‚Äôt enough. It would be nice to see more than what we already have. Also dark mode seems to be a lack of a feature that all other social media apps have but not Facebook. It would be nice to see dark mode be added as well."

The rare times the app worked before the update it would always have glitches like the following: It would display only a small sliver of scrunched up colors with the rest of the screen being black, it would freeze when I played videos, websites that I visited through the app would tremble and shake.

I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a mass group of people reporting the account, but I‚Äôve made several status updates informing my friends of the account transition. If there‚Äôs a way Facebook can solve this kind of issue and become just a tiny bit more relaxed with the hassle of identification checks, this review would then be rated a 5-star. Until that happens, I can only give 2."

It either only displays one or two items or displays a message that it can't load the newsfeed right now and I get nothing.  Repeated reports of this issue - Facebook has been unresponsive and has not fixed this.  I have recent model iPhone with 70mb internet connection - issue is not on my end it's this software. Fix it!!!  If give them 0 stars if I could right now.  Customer support this bad for a typical company would signal the death bell for the business.

Why is it so many people trust and use an app when it screens posts so that you see what they want? I often receive notices that so and so posted on such and such a page. Click on the notice and nothing. In order to view said post you have to reverse the process and go to the person‚Äôs home page just to see what they posted. Oh but sometimes it‚Äôll show up a few days later when everyone is done talking about the topic and know one cares anymore if you have anything to contribute to the conversation. Leave the posts in chronological order or at least make it a setting that can be adjusted by users/admins. Some of pages are used in hopes for communicating r messages.

757,Gilbert.lafebre.3,"July 2, 2019",2,Not fluid at all. Facebook is one of the only apps left that still has the volume bar that blocks what you are viewing. The Marketplace is really hard to swipe out of a post or exit out of a picture using gestures. I can‚Äôt stand using marketplace sometimes when I am in a hurry. I have to keep swiping and swiping and nothing happens. Idk how the developers keep looking over and think it‚Äôs okay in comparison to other social media platforms that are really fluid and easy to use. The volume bar is just dumb on their end at this point. It‚Äôs been well over a year that most apps have switched to an above small line volume bar but yet FB still uses the huge iPhone/apple volume that blocks your view of a video.

832,Sandy Ruckert,"March 24, 2018",1,Getting hacked I‚Äôm fighting getting hacked on a daily basis how the heck do I stop this how do I get my Facebook page back I have apps on there that I am working off of on a daily basis I take pictures for and I have to get some pictures on the website I cannot get the website because I have to be approved and I‚Äôve already been approved on my Facebook page and Facebook cannot protect me how my supposed to do my job? I have a secondary one so I can get onto contact you guys but I keep losing that one as well. I have tons of friends that are getting hacked because these losers will not stay off my Facebook page and that is why they‚Äôre attacking me because I have many friends on there then I‚Äôm going to lose and a business I am going to lose if I don‚Äôt get my site back.
833,Hafygirl,"November 23, 2018",4,"Buggy lately... I like the speed with which I can go through notifications and see my news feed, but it‚Äôs not full featured so I prefer to log into Facebook from Safari instead so I can completely access my Facebook groups. So now when I do that I get interrupted by messages saying ‚Äúuse the app‚Äù.  If the app was fully functioning I would! "
834,Demi√≠,"January 7, 2019",2,"News Feed and Live Videos This app would be better with a few improvements. The news feed is one of my biggest pet peeves. I have over 1400 friends and yet I only ever see the same 10 people. And if they didn‚Äôt post anything recently then all my news feed shows me is what they posted a week prior. My next complaint would be the notifications for when someone goes ‚ÄúLive‚Äù. I have turned this feature off and yet I still receive notifications every five minutes about someone going ‚ÄúLive‚Äù. Aside from that, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out why I‚Äôm updating this app nearly everyday and not noticing any changes except in the amount of space this app takes up."
835,Lisamncg,"February 27, 2019",1,Are you able to fix the ongoing problems? Seriously? I keep sending messages trying to explain to you that my newsfeed is all out of order. I slept most recent yet I see stuff from last week five days ago two days ago yesterday it‚Äôs all out of order. Not only that but my notifications are the same what. You would think that they would be most recent at the top to oldest at the bottom; Mine are all out of order. In other words at the very top it‚Äôll say that someone liked my picture to hours ago then directly under that one it‚Äôll say someone liked your picture 30 minutes ago in right under that it‚Äôll say two minutes ago someone made a comment on your page seriously what is going on with this app in 2018.
836,Amjad A. bahnasi,"May 4, 2019",5,"Facebook doung the right things started on fb at 2010 & right now i‚Äôve been here for about 8 years and if we compare each update coming out we knew fb going to right way BUT when the fb touched clients & users community privacy it‚Äôs bad card in their bucket, as well as how the way His CO-mark with respect coming out and explained every single line of what been happened and we all respected the way he says that was their mistake, hope you doing something incredible couple months and get verified to all users haha joke."
837,mc4asia,"December 28, 2019",1,Worse and Worser Poor grammar is used here to point out that with each iteration of this digital approximation of social interaction we‚Äôre being treated more and more like the cattle we‚Äôre sold as to advertisers and anyone else who wants to reach and manipulate us.  Their ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù methodology is laughable - they‚Äôll post resolved when it isn‚Äôt.  Things don‚Äôt work and they obviously don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs not like you can contact a living human to figure out what new way you need to accomplish what was easy before.  
838,Newmongi,"June 11, 2019",2,Marketplace doesn‚Äôt won‚Äôt let me scroll. I stopped using Facebook seriously quite some time ago. Came back to use the marketplace feature as it has gained popularity and the app has just gotten awful.    The marketplace (which now has its own tab) now only shows the same things and won‚Äôt even show you all of those things.  I can search for let‚Äôs say a tool and I‚Äôll get the same postings for 50 cars once I scroll down the feed. And that‚Äôs even if it lets me scroll which it doesn‚Äôt most of the time.  I scroll down and as soon as I let off the screen it makes me scroll back up to where I was.   Facebook you are a huge company you should be able to fix these problems.
839,Jill4peace,"November 24, 2017",3,"Problem with Facebook I‚Äôm getting sick of Facebook because so many TERRIBLE, VIOLENT, and ANIMAL ABUSIVE POSTS ARE COMING THRU the NEWSFEED but with no PETITION and no facts (when, where, what) as to what to do to help the situation!!!  But when you want to report it, you can‚Äôt explain what it is or why it‚Äôs disturbing!! They just ask very fundamental questions that may not at all relate to what the problem is!! So sometimes you‚Äôre just reporting the person who last posted it and not the original posting and person who originally posted (possibly the perpetrator who staged the cruel situation).  Why can‚Äôt we directly explain what the problem is? My guess is that you don‚Äôt want to know!!!"
840,LexieCarmody,"December 10, 2017",1,"So many problems First, I can‚Äôt even be on Facebook for more than two minutes without it crashing. I could be really into a video or a post and then it just exits to my home screen and I have to hope that I can find it again. Second, the adds are one of the most annoying things about Facebook.  I clicked on the video to watch the video, not the ad.  Seeing an ad video that can be long makes me exit the video, it does not work. Also, it is complete trash that it automatically refreshes.  I don‚Äôt want to lost my spot when I‚Äôm scrolling through? And when I look at some videos and posts that have thousands of comments, I see none.  I have submitted a problem report and got nothing back.  Fix these for the sake of your users!!!!"
841,Johnnyboy1960,"December 20, 2017",2,"iPhone X Since your application in the App Store does not support the link app support I have to use the review section to make a functionality request. Most applications at this point use Face ID instead of passwords. A study has been done that the applications, with Face ID up to this point in time, are being accessed almost twice as much as apps that do not use that technology and require passwords. My question, when will Facebook support Face ID?  Since the majority of apps already support Face ID functionality I would suggest that advancing to it cannot be that difficult. I appreciate you listening to my comment. Again I could‚Äôve put it under app support but the link does not support a dialog box. Thank you, John"
842,ponyspaws,"April 21, 2018",1,"I have never been able to access Marketplace I have been sending in problem reports to Facebook for the last year now. I think I am up to at least 11 reports. I am over 18, I live in the United States, I have a cell phone attached to my account, and yet I still do not have access to Marketplace either on my Computer, my iPhone app or on my iPad app. Facebook just enjoys ignoring the problem. I know there at least thousands of people out there with the same problem and Facebook is completely silent on the issue. Hopefully this bad review will make them take some action.  Note: All of my friends, and my family who live in the same house as I do I‚Äôll have access to marketplace. What is it about me that makes my set up different? Facebook please answer us!"
843,LadyDragon96,"June 26, 2018",1,"Annoyed I was already unhappy with Facebook. New algorithms that were supposed to determine what I ‚Äúwanted to see‚Äù. Privacy breaches, and targeted advertising. I miss having things post in my newsfeed in the order they were posted by all of my friends, not just the ones Facebook seems to think I want to see. But now I can‚Äôt even see my newsfeed. It won‚Äôt load. I can see my notifications or go to a friend‚Äôs page and see what they posted. But my newsfeed is basically gone. Only one item will be available to see, the rest won‚Äôt load and then about a minute later the whole app shuts off. Very sporadically for short periods I‚Äôll be able to see my newsfeed then it goes away. The last two updates have not done anything to fix the issue."
844,Thbritta,"July 6, 2018",3,"Annoying notifications I‚Äôm not sure why I have to be notified of everything or why everything needs a separate tab. I don‚Äôt want the marketplace button, I don‚Äôt want the video page button, and I don‚Äôt want stories. Now there‚Äôs something new! My favorite group that already appears in my news feed every other post now sends me a blue dot notification every time a member posts something. How annoying! I don‚Äôt allow any of my apps to send me push notifications on my phone but for some reason I can‚Äôt tell Facebook who I want notifications from. Facebook is becoming more and more annoying to use and less pleasurable."
845,Cass4556123,"July 17, 2018",1,Not Facebook for iPhone? I have downloaded a lot of games and I am having an issue connecting my Facebook with my games. When I am in the game and I try to log into my Facebook to use my profile it takes me to safari; asking me to login. I go ahead and login. Tells me my account information isn‚Äôt correct. Goes on to say if I had the correct app for Facebook it would help me do this faster. I click on the link to get ‚ÄúFacebook for iPhone.‚Äù I already have it. It tells me I already have it and opens it in the play store for me. But it will not let me connect my game with Facebook? I have the updated version of the app but it still will not work. Why? I‚Äôm frustrated I can not play with my friends or save progress in games because I can‚Äôt connect to Facebook.
846,forwarnd,"October 11, 2018",1,"Poor security in protecting user accounts FB has already been called out on security breaches and privacy issues yet here we are again, having our accounts hacked.  I‚Äôve had many FB friends issue warnings that their accounts were hacked and not to accept friend requests that you may receive from them.  Then there is the canned message from one  of my FB friends saying they received a friend request from me and to forward their message to all my friends not to accept the request.  Not doing it, i will not forward that message to anyone as I believe that is the root of the hack.  "
847,Jophan,"October 20, 2018",3,"Going backward! The Facebook iOS app has long been a work in progress, but it had gotten to the point where despite mysterious divergence between what it showed you and what you'd see in a browser, it could mostly be relied upon."
848,YOSBob,"October 28, 2018",2,"Facebook continues to go downhill, get out now FB has sold out its users privacy and is not respectful to the people that allowed them to become rich, and doesn‚Äôt share the wealth of what we all created together, they think they did it all. FB should have given stock to its users so they could have benefitted like they did and then everyone wins, right?"
