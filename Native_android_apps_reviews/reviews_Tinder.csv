I paid for plus for a year and it was a waste of money. Now there's not even anyone to swipe on. It was the same 20 people on a loop before, anyway. The occasional ""secret admirer"" was always someone that I had never even seen before while swiping. Such a bizarre algorithm. And, now it won't even let me delete my account."

The real one's won't. Sometimes the app shows me people from unholy distances (when I specifically told it NOT to). Or it shows me 1-picture profiles with a quick reference to their Snapchat/Instagram/gmail account. If you like these profiles: Warning -- they are fake. They ""match"" right away. Without video chat capabilities this app just stinks. Video chat would weed em out."

I don't trust a platform that doesn't let you delete your own account and that is blocking new swipes altogether...."

Tinder has stopped showing me people in my area or any other area that i put. it worked fine until few days back but then all sorts of things started happening. and their customer support is so pathetic that they dont care to understand your problem instead send you pre written standard replies. Guys beware of paying for tinder gold!

It also keeps showing me people who are way WAY too far away. A few years ago I paid for a subscription and it made sense. I felt like I got what I paid for. Now, even with a paid subscription if you want to do anything you have to pay more. Really not worth it! After a day or two I felt like I was just giving you money for no reason. What did I even pay for?!"

Insists on looks rather than all the important info about a person. UI and handling in general are absolutely horrible. It's so easy to dismiss or like or super-like the wrong person without being able to fix your mistake. Freezes and fails to load avatars too often. Too many fake and spam profiles - more than real people. Often you never see the people who liked you, so you can't like them back"

After awhile the tinder algorithm slows down your traffic, they fix this by making you buy their boost for 7 bucks or the megaboost for 30 bucks. If you don't buy the boost you get little to no likes after your initial start up, also has tons of fake profiles. Tinder is cancer, stay away people you have been warned. These people taking advantage and manipulating people will have what's coming for them."

Tried the premium, didn't feel premium enough, there's always something extra tinder tries to sell you. Can be particularly damaging if the user isn't at their best emotionally.

15,nosbled,"April 24, 2020",4," You get a lot out of the app without having to pay for it. Not without its issues though. Notifications often stop working, or they work too good and spam you with reminders to buy premium even though it's turned off. Other things could be improved. But for a free dating app it's pretty solid."

104,Mohit Singh,"April 21, 2020",1, Full of computer bots. Just a scam to get your money. No matches untill you pay for premium memberships. After the match the other person never replies as if they never received the message.
105,Amanda,"April 18, 2020",1," Rubbish. Full of bugs and glitches. Keeps crashing and no way to fix it. Have had to delete my account many times to fix, losing 300+ matches only for it to crash again. So frustrating!"

108,VDiddy Ramos,"April 17, 2020",3, I like the app but it's too easy to accidentally like and/or super like someone when I really just wanted to look at another pic or scroll down to their bio. There isn't a way to undo it once done.

And when you report that as being a TOS violation the app hilariously still gives you the option of rejecting or liking the prostitute's profile. On some level Tinder is literally just a place for hookers to congregate who can't be honest about their line of work."
110,Rohan George,"April 25, 2020",4," Actually, it was a good experience. But they should help those who are in free membership also. They must help them choosing better photos and bio. Also, they must also introduce them to their potential dates too."
111,Covers by María,"April 17, 2020",3, I think the app would be much better if you could archive conversations or delete messages. It stresses me out to see so many chats open with people who take so long to reply. Thanks!
112,N Oz,"April 16, 2020",1," Can you please fix this app? Last week was okay, but I cant even get through the verify . How many error codes am I supposed to get? Really annoying. It's the app's end, not the phone carrier."

125,Constantine,"April 18, 2020",2, The chances to match someone dropped dramatically if you use the free version. I used to have at least a match in a month or two but now its basically dead. Probably they changed the algorithms.

But its overpriced you cant even see who likes you unless you pay 15 a month which is ridiculous it should be free or no higher than 7 a month. Which brings me to another point there are several types of subscription for 1 app they should just combine all their subscriptions into 1 and price it no higher than 10 dollars. Tinder is better than other apps of it's kind but until they lower the price or make more stuff free they won't be the best.

Used to kind of work, feels like the dysfunction is intentional to wring as much money out of people as possible."

Issues like this ends up with a person just not bothering at all since it feels fake and fishing for paid services wich in the end will show nothing on the people you already declined. Fix this stuff and make the app great again. Best Regards Trip"

Meeting new people is always so peculiar and exciting. Sometimes people dont answer back immediately and that's okay. It cycles people over again sometimes but not as much as you'd think.

I recently downloaded the app again and I didn't even finish the account setup before being banned again. I have no idea why? I have no idea if a user banned me or what I may have done that violated their terms. I'm getting really sick of the fact that I'm not allowed to know why I was banned, and that even after making multiple accounts with multiple emails I was consistently banned for no reason."
741,Sid 5901,"March 25, 2020",1," Im not able to message the person with whom I matched. And then you keep giving me quotes like "" The answer is always no if you don't ask"" as if you're allowing me to message that person. This is so frustrating, do something asap!"
742,bluehorseshoe444,"March 31, 2020",2," Only works for paid subscribers, otherwise you'll stop getting matches after a couple days... that would be fine if that's how it was advertised but it feels like a bait and switch"
743,DEEPIKA BEHERA,"March 30, 2020",2, I logged onto my profile and even after 48hours did not receive a single match. It is surprising because it didn't happen the last time i was around. Please fix the issue
744,Alexander Allison,"April 2, 2020",3, I don't know what's going on at the moment but everyone is thousands of miles away when my preference is set to <10. It's very annoying getting matches and finding out they live on the other side of the planet. Is this a new thing because of the COVID-19?
745,Sarah Britton,"April 4, 2020",1, Been on for a couple of months. Put several photos up and changed the bio a few times but still no matches at all. Also continuously showing me profiles I've already swiped on... not sure if something went wrong with the activation email for my account?
746,Felipe Faustino,"April 5, 2020",3, Well the app was good until the free passport option came. Personally I am not looking for people out of my city and even keeping the same distance I've always keep before the update now it's showing me people out of my city.
747,Benjamin Glueck,"April 4, 2020",1, I only see people who are really (really) far away. From other continents mostly. Logging out and back in doesn't change a thing.y location is also set to current. The app is no use anymore. deleting it.
748,Avi H,"April 11, 2020",3," Slightly better than other apps, but same results. Don't like how even when I have simple settings, it gives me folks 3k miles away. Like why. I've had little to no success using this."
749,Jada DJ FoxXxy J,"April 10, 2020",1, How come you did not allow your app to have notification sounds on the gadget? Its so hard to know when someone sent a message or got a match because the phone/gadget does not make sounds!😡
750,Miki So,"April 12, 2020",2," It works good only if you pay the subscription money, else you keep try for days and you won't have any results. Also there are few negatives but probably developers doesn't care."

752,Joshua 大砲 CarnifX75,"April 16, 2020",1, This app is an absolute rip off. They rip you a new one just to force you into tinder plus then they rip you a complete third new one for tinder gold after a couple of weeks. They want you to pay $300 a year to talk to people. Eff that. Match is a better deal.

I did nothing to abuse the terms of agreement and when I contacted customer service they said they can't say what I did to get my account banned. Not to mention once your account gets banned they say there is no way to get it back and when you try to make a different account you have to have a phone number which automatically says you are banned if you try to use the same one from your old user

They only way to get matches (with fake profs) is by using the blue star which you only get 5 per day with tinder gold (Also overpriced) This is a money grabbing scam that in turn, shows you pictures of thousands of people whom you will never get to talk to. There is no real matchmaking involved."

I really like this app but this is super disruptive and it's likely draining my phone battery. If the notifications are shut off it shouldn't send me notifications. That's basic app development.
901,Jordan Farley,"March 21, 2020",4," Tinder is great. Minus the fact that even after you pay to subscribe monthly, there is just more and more you have to pay for to get the full extent of the app. Easy to use and tons of people to swipe through. Better than any other dating app I've tried so far."
902,Dream Bigger,"March 24, 2020",1," Login trouble, I can't log in even though i already paid for the services. Support system is very bad. Can't think of any rating except 1 star. Will think about it in future if service improves."

I was able to get to know women and plan dates on the weekend, regardless of how busy or tired i was throughout the week.

919,levi franz,"April 17, 2020",1," Never match with anyone, top picks just remove potential matches from the pool. Total waste of time. They just want you to pay $20/month. Be old fashion, approach people irl and put some magazines out to keep you entertained during your daily bowel movements."

922,Joel Cabezas Morales,"February 12, 2020",3," So one of my biggest peeves is how when you're using the free version, the app doesn't delete the likes you received but likely swiped left on eons ago in what seems to be an effort to arouse your curiosity as to who liked you and buy Tinder+. It's clickbait and it's wrong!"
923,Fedion Baldinger,"February 28, 2020",1," Very very misleading when you go for a subscription. Never take a one month subscription, it is a pure waste of money. You will not see who liked you, this is only about money for them, nothing more."

I feel they should have options to put other as people's genders because it's frustrating not everyone can use the app and it's a simple change. Since people can pay to hide their gender they appear on everyone's feed and they can see yours it's like a glitch. Please change this
927,Abbes Malek,"March 20, 2020",4," Overall good , you've got to make some improvements tho concerning the explore/swipe search idk and how accurate it is But most importantly if it's going to survive it really needs some mandatory and necessary improvements , for example make users able to send pictures in chat ."

931,William Wensley,"April 4, 2020",1, Doesn't even match based off of proximity anymore. All distances of matches seem to be random. Ultimately making it useless. I can't even purchase premium it's so glitchy.
932,John Garcia,"February 22, 2020",4, A well developed app. The only problem I absolutely hate is the limited swipes but other than that it's as real as it gets. Honestly idk why I use this app still when people unmatch me and I can't get a match lol. 🤷🏽‍♂️Oh well
933,Happy Clopper,"February 27, 2020",2," The app itself seems OK, but the constant reminder to upgrade to Gold is overbearing and renders the app virtually unusable. Plus, $29.99 a month? My cable bill is cheaper than that."

Tampering with likes. ""running out of likes"" in heavily populated area even though I was a paid member. Then got BANNED for NO REASON. Tried to email someone and there's nothing they can do about it nor would they tell my why I was banned. For a company that's been around for 8 years it's appalling that they don't have an appeal process. Honestly if they're going to treat their users like garbage I'll stick to bumble."
994,Michael,"March 23, 2020",3," It works to some extent. Not a lot of people in my area so the silly restrictions don't make sense. Sucks that there's not a single redo when without a subscription, thus wrong swipes cannot be undone."
995,Daniel Garcia,"March 28, 2020",1, Almost no matches. I keep seeing same people I've already swiped on. Which app says because it didn't connect to server. So what I'm never connected to the server daily? Ripoff!!
996,Daizaria Randle,"April 1, 2020",1, Fix your app! Plenty of times I have canceled my subscription and kept getting charged! I'll have my bank block chargers and report as spam if this keeps occurring.
997,Kee Kee,"April 1, 2020",1, I wasn't get messages for like a week which I thought was strange because some matches on their would message me every morning and all day then I go to log in yesterday and it told me I was banned. I'm so confused.
998,Sam Johnson,"April 5, 2020",4," It is what it is, although I cant edit any of the notifications as trying to change them just brings up the phone's regular notification settings for the app which is to turn all of them off or on. Nah."
999,Nebulae Astroid,"April 1, 2020",1," I feel like my account that was connected to my facebook got hacked. After 3 years of not being on, I tried to log on, and it bricked the app to a screen that says I've been banned."

1032,Neil Du Toit,"April 6, 2020",1, No reasons provided for being banned. 3 days after starting a new 6 months subscription. 100% sure no rules were actually broken. This thing is a scam.

1034,Nate,"February 17, 2020",2, Old inactive accounts are kept intentionally to make it seem like there are more active users than there actually are. Spam/fake accounts are allowed to exist for similar reasons and they add people from locations far off from your own. Get it together.
1035,Hannah Simpson,"February 20, 2020",1, Would be nice if my matches actually registered. I paid for a month of Gold and it's not even working. I've had the app for like an hour. Very disappointed.

Second, show us the people who liked us or promote them to us. The probability of getting the people likes you is very small even by luck!!!"
1088,tandoyi,"February 29, 2020",2," The distance filter doesnt really work. Tinder should allow paid subscribers to drop a message to people whom they are interested in, instead of waiting for mutual likes."

1110,Marjorie Smith,"February 29, 2020",1, App was working great and now after booting me out won't verify me using my tel or email. Message 'oops something went wrong - please try again'. Have reinstalled x2 and made no difference.

Not to mention that 9/10 times you match with someone they don't respond. WORST DATING APP EVER!!!
1123,Kinley S,"February 19, 2020",5, Excellent and simple platform. I was under the impression as a 40 something that Tinder was for the young. Apparently not. I have met quite a few lovely men my age. Thank you.

When the bot told me to send a screenshot of the error code I got the exact same response. I get that the app is huge and it's easier to have bots and an algorithm than real people. But you should balance it by maybe not making bans permanat. It's unfair to the user. 1 star man.
1127,Kim Klever,"February 12, 2020",1, Latest update sends notifications that are not selected. Truly annoying. Why take up space with super boost banner on pages? Definite swipe right on this update. Plus no customer service contact. Pretty awful

1140,Dabbin' David Strikes Again!,"April 5, 2020",1," It doesn't mention recurring billing when you get tinder gold, but it will bill you again anyway. Plus it is garbage, don't download unless you want to be constantly illegally solicited to by prostitutes."

1190,Eddie Allan,"April 15, 2020",1, Horrible app. Joined in past and got banned without being told why. All pics appropriate. All messages respectful. Never violated terms. Asked them to look into it and they just copy and pasted that I violated the terms. Horrible app. Match is an awful company buying out all these apps.
1191,Mehr Cheleh,"April 14, 2020",3, It's nice app and took me many day that one person message me. It looks like not much people stay for long time in this app. Maybe it could be the features
1192,Axolile Mzongwana,"April 3, 2020",5, Lol. I love it. I just wish there was a voice recording option though. And another option to share media files with your match 😅
1193,Layefa Williams,"April 9, 2020",3," The free passport travel made me happy.. although I would have liked if the free trials, let me see a few likes...that way I would know the benefits from this app."
1194,Subhan Kar,"April 12, 2020",1, I have used tinder for long time and had subscribed for tinder plus for 3 to 4 times and tinder gold for 1 time but it's useless. The matches which came was not genuin or fake or not interested to talk. I really don't suggest to invest in tinder gold or plus.
1195,Amit Chauhan,"April 17, 2020",1, Very bad app dont use it because I log in many type but still show error
1196,Preshen Ramadu,"April 18, 2020",4, Mostly good. Adequate matches withing your search criteria and can easily block users. Sometimes repeat users profiles show up.
1197,A Google user,"April 4, 2020",1, Cannot get rid of matches over 124 km away are getting matches over 1000 km away. Questionnaire had answer look for notifications no such thing. When I open up my settings. Please help
1198,Digvijay Thakur,"March 8, 2020",3, Research from YouTube about making a tinder profile and The results are good. With right photos and bio in one male can get beautiful matches. This is how much this application can do rest all is human effort how to meet up or whatever. Not getting people to talk is not the Application's fault.
1199,Mike L,"February 18, 2020",1, Why can't you just use a username and password? Your asked to enter your email to log in instantly. Only to be prompted to enter your phone number. To wait for a text that is never sent.
1200,Reda Sahraoui,"March 9, 2020",1, Most of the useful features are locked behind pay walls. At least make em time limited like superlike. Costumer support is next to non-existent.
1201,Karson Smith,"March 23, 2020",1," Will not let me upload videos. Most of the time it will fail, the off chance that it does work it I try to move it from the first spot to the second and it deletes it."
1202,NovaBombastic,"April 8, 2020",1, I'm almost 19 and i got this a bit after turning 18. It worked fine for awhile but suddenly its age restricted and they refuse to fix it. I don't understand what happened and why they refuse to do anything about it.
1203,Starr Trak,"February 13, 2020",1, Playing around with the distance and age ranges does not give me anyone new which doesn't make sense! Your app needs significant improvements to pretend being a paid app.
1204,Brad McCurdy,"February 20, 2020",1," I paid for the 6 month gold membership. The money came out of my account, but I never even got a confirmation email or anything. Support won't get back to me either. This app is a complete scam."
1205,Ahmed Nasif,"February 23, 2020",1," I used to get lot of matches when i opened tinder but when still didn't purchase the app for a month I stopped getting matches and also all my previous matches were deleted , this app tries to hustle money nothing else !"
1206,Steven Campos,"February 19, 2020",1, I haven't been on this app in over 2 years and now that I try to log back in. It's telling me that my account has been blocked I'm not sure why if I haven't been on it in over 2 years.

1209,ciera klein,"February 26, 2020",1," Deleted my account and made a new one. Caused me to update and I can't even edit, add photos to my profile, let alone match with anyone. Total bs. The app is a total virus bug now"
1210,Yash Bararia,"March 7, 2020",1, Stupid app. Been trying to upload pictures from yesterday night. When I'm selecting Instagram or gallery while uploading it keeps loading and loading. Don't download this app. Go to OkCupid instead
1211,Jim Osullivan,"March 12, 2020",3, Its not to bad however messaging is not as instantaneous as it could be in app purchases are a pain since tinder makes good money off the many adds also membership is rediculouse charge people say 12 bucks a month and ur profits would soar its called productive bussiness
1212,Junenior,"April 24, 2020",1, It's cool... But subscriptions are expensive... & You could get banned anytime... Even after obeying the rules & everything... i just got banned this morning for no reason!??...
1213,Alexander Lepkowski,"March 22, 2020",1," I was unfairly banned and there is no appeal process. I've been using tinder for years and never had a problem.

I'm a respectful person, and I never violated their terms of service. The fact that anyone can report you if you don't date them /like them after talking is completely unfair. I know I didn't do anything wrong and after doing research it seems tons of people have been banned and never given a chance to appeal it. I am really dissapointed with this app."
1214,Ahmad Taheri,"March 29, 2020",1, It gives me like 10 to 15 likes per day....when I first got the app it gave me like 30 or so. But now it's like 15 if I'm lucky enough to match with one of their fake profiles.......
1215,Danny Hamblin,"April 12, 2020",1, I can't even create an account! It's stopping at adding photos and just staying on the loading screen. Is this common for the app?
1216,George,"April 9, 2020",2, It's not working properly. Swipe right on one profile and then you see that profile next time you open that app. Needs fixing.
1217,kasaija Andrew,"April 18, 2020",5, Very good though I do not know why we dont have easier ways of paying for subscription. Atleast even direct from PayPal.
1218,Tapiwa Muduwa,"April 22, 2020",1, This app is all about trying to make you spend money just to get matches. Don't waste your money on this
1219,Sergey Keshishoglyan,"April 21, 2020",5," This is certainly the best dating app ever since iPhone, it's simple, with a nice interface and works in different countries, thanks Tinder"
1220,Daniel Hernandez,"February 25, 2020",4, Your app isn't free anymore for basic necessities. But that's not what's aggravating. It wont accept any of my payment methods.
1221,H. K.,"April 14, 2020",2," It works, but please add ethnic background feature. Also please make that you can't unmatch for atleast a minute or two."
1222,Simon Burkhardt,"February 26, 2020",2, it is mostly ok. except that I never had an app where I needed to contact their support so many times (4/month). And their replies were seldom helpful (your account does not exist).
1223,Garvit Aggarwal,"February 13, 2020",3, Mixed reviews. Good UI/UX but a few bugs exist. 1. I am re-shown a person I have left or right swiped 2. There is no support chat 3. I cannot upgrade for the remainder of my term
1224,Andrew A,"February 17, 2020",1," Dont waste your time with this app. Hundreds of obviously fake accounts. And apparently I have 99+ likes, but guess how many matches I get before they expire and I have to wait 12 hours? Yep, zero. So obviously just a scam app these days. Don't waste time downloading."
1225,Josh Kellerman,"February 13, 2020",2, After a few swipes it would lag. The person you swiped on wouldnt move it would just freeze but you can keep swiping and in the background you can see it's still active. Its buggy
1226,Prince Jnr,"March 3, 2020",1, fix the freaking log in for Ghanaian numbers....no matter what other login options i use it all brings me back to the number part ....and even when i do put in the right number....the code for confirmation never arrives....freaking frustrating
1227,Saksham Srivastava,"March 13, 2020",1," I have bought Tinder Gold like 5 times with different account taking care of ""ELO"" as well but I don't get a single match. I am not that ugly and my bio is fine. I have seen worse guys getting matches without gold. I paid for this service and its biting me back. Really disappointed."
1228,Brainless LB,"March 20, 2020",3," Seems like no one wants to use it for it's purpose. Only see people advertising their snapchat or ig, which is fine but when you try and message them there because ""I don't use tinder anymore"" or ""I'll reply faster there"" you get nothing you just find someone with thousands of followers"
1229,Vanessa Montanez,"March 23, 2020",4," It is a grest and useful app. However, i wish you could be able to video chat and share photos within the app, i think that would help weed out the creepy users. But overall worth it!"
1230,Tinashe Mugweni,"March 26, 2020",1, Algorithm that makes sure your actual matches are pushed out. So in essence it wastes your time. Throw it in the trash. Would put a -5 star if I could
1231,Dan 345,"March 27, 2020",1," The apps not working, when I try to sign in I get the text confirmation code, type it in, and then the app just reloads. I just bought gold too so I definitely will be refunding that purchase"

1233,Jacob Formosa,"April 13, 2020",3, Very good except it has been glitching and not working properly. Redownloaded it several times and still glitching.
1234,Nina Pritika,"April 10, 2020",4, A great app but it could use some sort of tutorial; it was a bit tricky until I got the hang of it
1235,Keval Pandit,"March 3, 2020",3," App is not useful as every time i delete my profile on tinder and create it, it shows my earlier profile and image even after deleted. Even same things happen after updating the app plus you get no like and match."
1236,Tejinder Singh,"March 27, 2020",2, It always shows to buy gold for more matches. It's waste of time . If one buys then only he or she will get matches. Pure business
1237,faith Maphanga,"March 29, 2020",4," It's a great app... Whether you have a subscription or not. I love it, it has helped me meet interesting people."
1238,Ali Nabavi,"March 30, 2020",4," Tinder seems to be improving somewhat. There's still tons of spam every morning, fake accounts, etc."
1239,Francis Nkho,"April 16, 2020",5," I want to sign up for tinder gold using my Google play store credits but it either shuts down or it tells my my subscription unsuccessful try another time😒 really want tinder gold... Problem fixed, works well😊👍"
1240,Arun Das,"February 14, 2020",1, This was my experience with tinder. Even if someone swipes right for you it will not show up on your swipes. So we eventually you have to pay for gold to see the profiles. its a scam.
1241,Meister Chris,"February 23, 2020",1, Freemium product. U get liked but can't see who did. So it's useless unless u spend money. Even not in a limited amount to find out if it's for u.
1242,Rannvijay Kumar,"March 5, 2020",3, The app is not able to access my gallery even though I provided it all the permissions. It hangs each time I try to add a picture. Really a bad experience with this app.
1243,Mayank Prakash,"April 19, 2020",1, Getting lots and lots of glitches.
1244,Eurabena Sika,"April 25, 2020",5, Very nice app...... fun and a good option when bored nd wanna make healthy frnds
1245,Nicholas Williamson,"March 14, 2020",5," Works as it should, and for free. Beware of fake profiles, and any ""match"" asking for verification signing up for anything. No real date will require this and most likely you about to be scammed. Also beware of camgirls trying to make themselves or their sites."
1246,yomaris hernandez,"February 18, 2020",4, Would give it all 5 stars but I noticed there are small glitches on my a51 with this app. It freezes up on profiles that I have already liked. In order to continue swiping I have to close the app.
1247,Fala English To Me,"February 29, 2020",2," I'm receiving notifications of messages which don't appear when I try to look at it. When I enter the chat, it looks exactly the same as it did before."
1248,Theresa Lim,"March 1, 2020",1," Just register but when follow step by step to fill in info till last step to ask me upload a picture and press next, then pop up said my account being banned! Damn what a rubbish app, I'm not even have a chance to start use it yet...what a lousy app"
1249,Alex,"March 7, 2020",1," The algorithm used makes no sense at all, when I start the account I get plenty of matches and after a few weeks the matches drop to 0"
1250,Paulina j,"March 15, 2020",1, I can't delete subscription from the app. Customer service is not great. Waiting for reply to my emails regarding this issue for long.
1251,AJ Gatchell,"March 9, 2020",1," The app is just not the same as it was when it first came out. You guys got greedy, I truthfully feel like matches are hid to encourage users to purchase tinder gold."
1252,Sasquatch Models,"March 18, 2020",1, Tinder used to be pretty good. But they've made it to the point where you're pretty much guaranteed to never see who liked you unless you shell out $30. I find a better option if I were you.
1253,Fortunato Samuel,"March 19, 2020",4," To be honest is a grate app. I've got 10 plus matches in just few hours, at first I thought that they were fake girls, just to try to get u into upgrading, but they are acc real girls. Guys, upgrading to tinder gold is acc worth it, I didn't even need to swipe for ages like I initially thought."
1254,Juhi Prabhu,"March 28, 2020",1, Pathetic App.! It is taking 2 hours to Log in and still It isn't getting logged in and Doesn't matches with anyone. Having alot of trouble with this app
1255,Anand Jayaram,"March 31, 2020",4, Good when it comes to matches but please introduce a delete your msg feature that saves plenty of embarrassing moments and allows the app to take a picture.
1256,Sahid Ansari,"March 26, 2020",1," They ban account even if someone report and unmatched you...it doesn't provide re appeal for account or in future doesn't give chance to sign up,this is the worst thing it have...other than this everything is fine"
1257,Hugh Sandgathe,"April 4, 2020",3, Something is wrong with location filters. It's frequently showing users exceeding the maximum distance filter.
1258,JAKKAM VAMSHI,"April 7, 2020",1," It shows some rate before buying, while entering our card details without any OTP our amount will be deducted from our account. Soooo bad process."
1259,manoj mahi,"April 10, 2020",1, Waste of time... I have been using this from past 1 year. I couldn't able find a single match
1260,A Guy,"April 15, 2020",1, I miss the old Tinder when you would just match and talk. What happened? The devs really messed up with all these pay walls.
1261,Mond Natividad,"April 10, 2020",1," No improvements. Even if you have fast connection, the app is slowly loading profiles."
1262,rahul lazras,"April 16, 2020",1, Why it is asking for money if the people liken the profile. You can charge for the msgs. Not for only seening profiles. I'm just telling you that charge for msgs not for likes or somebody likes so you are not giving permission to see the profile. Not Good
1263,ノア,"April 12, 2020",1," Allowing everyone to use the passport feature is the worst idea ever, it really dilutes the experience and makes it worthless for people that take the app seriously and want to meet someone local."
1264,Mr dan,"April 16, 2020",1, Be careful when you buy the subscription they are very clever then can steal you at once I did it which was expensive but they don't want to reimbursements...I no you can find partner here but still it's about ur hardwork
1265,Sarah Perkins,"April 24, 2020",3, Why can't I sort my matches anymore. This renders the app essentially useless
1266,TheLegends Of Minecraft,"April 2, 2020",3, It's pretty good but I hate how you can't just send a message. I want to be able to talk to someone without having to have us match. Also it would be nice for a search feature to be added.
1267,Danny Villanueva,"February 21, 2020",4," It's easy to use, and helpful to connect people, but it could be more efficient. In many cases I find fake profiles"
1268,Tyler Roberts,"March 25, 2020",1, change your phone number and you can't log into your account and update your contact info and I tried to use Facebook and email options as well with zero affect.
1269,Melinda Johnson,"April 24, 2020",2, I like it but when I like someone and it's a match and I go to write them. After I've wrote to them they r gone and not matched to me anymore. Why. And after I've swiped left I still get some of the same people the next day.

1278,San Zan,"February 29, 2020",1," I am a man who gets hundreds of matches on this app but is it working for me? of course not! Because women get millions of matches in no time and they dont even want to say a ""hi"" anymore. Tinder must ban the women who dont talk."
1279,Christine Innature,"March 2, 2020",1, Horrible. Worst application for the reason there are a million fake accounts with no verification system. Also deleted my legitimate account with no justification. Really dissatisfied.
1280,Paul Belk,"March 4, 2020",4," This would be better if you could at least message someone you like before you match with them. Not everyone has time, or the desire, to keep checking an app all the time."

1282,Richard Anderson,"March 8, 2020",1, I tried for an hour to find and email or number to report an issue and could never find anything. The lack of support is ridiculous.
1283,Doug James,"March 18, 2020",3, Tinder is fun if you're looking to get matches and find out that the people who you matched with are only promoting their private nudes and asking for money. It's fun to play the game and turn the tables.
1284,Nick Quail,"March 21, 2020",1, Many features don't work properly. The filters are terribly vague and there are too many spam/fake accounts.

1301,Dakshin Alva,"March 18, 2020",1, Worst app and only works when you pay. Totally disgusting way to look at things if you understand what I am saying. It's full of bots and fake accounts also. I think bumble is a better choice as it not fooling it's customers.
1302,Malicious Upload,"March 23, 2020",1, Account was banned for nothing and no appeal support contact ability. Dealing with constant bots while I myself am quite decent on the app. Quality system they have in place I can see that for sure. Good job Tinder you are killing off the real userbase 👌

1308,Tarun Varma,"April 14, 2020",1, I'm unable to login through my phone number.i am not getting a code. terrible experience with tinder for the first time I logged in through mobile number again it is asking for number verification
1309,Evan Kline,"April 15, 2020",1, 40% of the accounts are clearly fake. When they have the same photos and the same bio is should be easy to identify spam acounts.

1316,van Gink,"February 15, 2020",1, Sending push notifications when someone is typing that can't be disabled was a horrible tactic. Will not be using the app until this is fixed.
1317,Rahul Sharma,"February 29, 2020",1, Why my subscription gets auto renews even when i did cancel my subscription ? I cancel n number for times and it ask for card on file when o clicked no it just kept on suffering. Waiting for positive reply

1319,Brian Mwangi,"March 4, 2020",1," Absolutely stupid. There's some algorithm that limits the #of matches you get overtime. Waste of money, wouldn't recommend it"
1320,Ashok Kumar,"March 8, 2020",3, There must be a delete message functionality and read receipt notifications on Tinder unlike messanger and WhatsApp. If possible please include call function also as you take all permissions. This feature will increase the traffic on your app.

1325,Zain Asghar,"March 12, 2020",2, Is good and all but the Tinder plus just match back ruins it soooo much because the girls are waiting to get matched back but I never can find their profiles! At least let us match back in a few days not never!!!
1326,Pascal L.,"March 12, 2020",1," Not worth the frustration you get from all the useless notification and the annoying ads about their useless overpriced premium. Unless being asked for your credit card constantly is your kink, I'd suggest every other dating apps."

1339,Kendall Belle,"February 28, 2020",3, Wish it had a filter for ur preference. Tired of swiping left on all these white dudes only to see very little of my preference. I think this app would be much more appreciated if there was a filter for ur type.
1340,DanTheMan,"March 3, 2020",4, Aside from making me pay for literally the whole purpose of the app after a certain point it's pretty decent. Can't complain as of yet so far it's done everything i was promised. 😎💯
1341,Ultra Pool,"March 12, 2020",1, 0 stars. App is slow and alot of bots and scammers. Since you have to be a paid member to basically use anything on it. Waste of time and space.
1342,Rick D,"April 2, 2020",1, The distance settings don't work. I've tried everything to get local guys to come up. It's a waste of time if I'm only seeing guys from The Phillipines and Brazil.
1343,Kiera Lilly,"April 12, 2020",4, Please get rid of superlikes. Everyone I know and have spoken to think they're dumb and I'm real tired of accidently superliking someone and having to immediately unlike. It's stressful. Please get rid of it I'm begging.
1344,Gary Bevis,"April 10, 2020",1, This app is a joke Everybody is too far away. And if you're a guy all there is is cam girls on here trying to get you go to a different website So you can look at their pictures and send them money. So in other note if you want to waste your time and money download this app.

1355,Chantal,"March 17, 2020",2, Its annoying that tinder makes you automatic like men's pictures when I haven't liked any pictures. It's good for remote connections but in bigger towns it doesn't have any filters. It needs filters!!
1356,Tasnim Raza,"March 17, 2020",1, Worst app for males....u rarely get a match and when u get it then within a minute the match and the chat box will disappear....this happened two times with me...just a useless app

1377,RAJ ARYAN SINGH,"April 14, 2020",1," If you are still using Tinder, you are trapped in their psychology. It's just a mental state to make you addicted to swipe right and left. And in the end to make you buy their services. I am definitely hated this app."

1800,systematic101,"March 2, 2020",1, Got banned for no damn reason. Had a great convo going and boom banned. No reason given and nothing on my profile violated the terms or guidelines.

1822,Ken Paxton Lim,"April 18, 2020",1, There's something about tinder culture that is really wrong. People literally don't initial chats or reply at all. It's like tinder is simply just a channel to advertise their Instagram profile or something. Others are just catfishes

After 80-100 profiles, tinder somehow locks the profile you can swipe saying ""no other user in your area"". At first I thought it was plausible. But then as a gold user i changed my adress to other cities. Same as before after 5-10 swipes the same message apeared. Well i was convised that my city of 1million, had only 100-200 tinder users. But after i switched to other cities I cannot be convised that they have 5-10 users."

I feel discriminated against as I'd been using the app for a few days and banned without warning despite the fact that I hadn't talked to or matched with anyone.

If this app was designed to make matches between people (which it advertises itself as doing), then the first people I see when I open the app would be the people who had already swiped right on me. However, the number on my profile goes steadily and slowly up, without ever actually matching me with anyone when I start swiping. If I do get matches, it’s later, with people I have swiped on days or weeks before. Because of this, I can only assume the app does not work for what it is advertised to do, and is therefore broken. From what I can gather, it seems designed to elicit a feeling of inadequacy or abundance, in other words to reinforce what the user feels in normal dating situations, only more immediate."

If it does technically NOT work properly and you need support, then you WILL run into serious trouble: I had Plus membership and Tinder wasn't working as intended, so I opened a support ticket: 1st response was a copy from an answer in the knowledge base which had nothing to do with my reported problem - I informed about it in my response 2nd response was another copy from an answer in the knowledge base, which again had nothing to do with my reported problem. - I informed about it again in my response. My ticket got closed without permission or solution so i submitted a bad survey. I opened a 2nd ticket and related to the first one. I got a response that my first ticket will be checked again. Since then no more response again although I queried for status several times. As my Tinder is still not working properly after 4 weeks and I did not get any response i wanted to ask for a refund, which will get refused as you can only ask for refund after 14 days, which have already been passed. I personally work in customer support also and if such an event would happen in my company it would run into serious labor law-related consequences for the employees involved in this support case. In addition our customer would be eligible for compensation by law. Tinder really has to rethink their customer support. With such a behavior it will vanish from the market when proper alternatives are available."

If you would have taken it for the first time, you get a few good matches and going forward you give a super like, boost, or anything, the matches you get keeps reducing after months. They can easily claim your profile is not good. Plead don't fall into the same trap. It's pure business. Even if you send mails to them regarding the same, you get no proper response too. #USELESSTINDER#FAKE"

So bad really I will never ever use it again and I will recommend all my people and friends do not use it and tell my story for all
3870,Raymond Blanchard,"February 5, 2020",4," Great app, but I don't feel people should be banned for representing more than one person on an account. What about the polyamorous couples? Feels a little exclusive, but otherwise good."
3871,Indian Guy,"February 9, 2020",1," horrible, DO NOT INSTALL, always showing your account has been banned due to Premium subscription of other applications. I don't understand why Tinder is bothered about other apps or premium subscriptions. Uninstalling just now. pathetic app."
3872,Chirag Seth,"February 5, 2020",1, The worst app that one can ever use. You dont have any option to delete your account. To get liked you need to buy subscription. I dont have any option for minus stars

3881,nadine warde,"January 7, 2020",2," To many profiles without actual pictures of people. There seems to be a new trend of blank coloured profiles, or pictures of anything but a person.

3884,SpaceMan,"February 20, 2020",1," 1st day I downloaded, I got plenty of likes. Every day since then, nada. This app is basically a money grab. They want you to pay for services, which due to the the other comments, obviously don't better your odds."

3895,Rob,"November 11, 2019",5, It's a good way to help complement dating life. People complain because they use this as their only means of dating/hookups. You get a lot of rejections as a dude but it's the same as in the working world. Just gotta keep on grinding and you'll find someone for you.

I have sent at least 8 messages in the last 3 weeks with 2 replies and no action taken to restore my account it seems like they can just steal your money from you. And you have no recourse

3969,Fish,"December 3, 2019",3," The most recent update has left my app acting glitchy. It won't tell me if I make a match but suddenly I'll get a message from someone?? And if I don't reply to it, they just won't show up in my messages list."
3970,Emily Stevenson,"December 11, 2019",2, A really good app and I was liking it until it logged me out and when I tried to log back in it said there was an age restriction even though my date of birth is the 12th of april 2000 and I'm 19 and I've had no email back when I tried to contact tinder
3971,jennifer c,"December 11, 2019",2, I really hate how I have to have my location on when I'm using the app even if I'm just chatting with someone. It drains my battery quickly. Unless I'm actively searching there is no need for the location to be on.

This having to pay for certain privilages is, whether Tinder will admit it or not, is most certainly directed towards men. Due to the fact that close to if not all women will get a match 9 out of 10 times every time they swipe right. Its ridiculas u decided to charge only after realizing people who met here were falling in love and going on to get married"
3973,Jason French,"April 12, 2020",5, Good app to meet new people and make new experiences.
3974,Mark W Goron,"January 5, 2020",2, It's was great for the few times I used it but recently when I got matched with 2 people I'm not sure why can't I see them in my activity feed.

Definitely pay through google if you're going premium. Restoring your paid account if you delete it to refresh it: paid with google = instant.

3976,Kyle Español,"January 16, 2020",4," Overall, great app but it lacks so many things such as sending stickers, photos, and videos. There should also be a chat head feature so I can still use the chat tab while doing others things in my phone."

I got reported and banned for life even though I wasn't being rude or abusive to anyone. I did meet one nice guy before that happened but if you lose access to the app you lose contact. I recommend Badoo instead, they will discuss service user complaints with you and get to the bottom of it. Or Bumble! The person/people who got me banned tried there too. I do miss using Tinder but customer service is automated and very unforgiving."
3978,Daniel Judson,"February 1, 2020",1, Rip off App would tell me I had 6 people like me prior to buying the tinder gold. Soon as I paid it went down to 2 people. What an absolute joke. False advertising and devious. Not to mention now I have tinder gold I rarely get any match now. I would like a refund.
3979,CJ Mashego,"January 29, 2020",1, Every time i try to upload a photo of me from my gallery it never opens up my gallery. I'm forced ti take a photo of myself instead of uploading one. Very inconvenient.

3983,JJPsyc,"April 13, 2020",1, The app keeps resending me like notifications about people I already swiped left on.
3984,Rainer Zill,"December 16, 2019",1, New update has put boost in a terrible spot. Just wasted my one boost by accidentally bumping it..... At least have a confirmation prompt. And the response they posted to this review makes absolutely no sense...... What does my photos have to do with their placement of the boost button???
3985,kayley moore,"January 19, 2020",1, I cant load any gallery photos. Please fix this. I've reset the app multiple times. Uninstalled and reinstalled. This was written in 2019. Now its 2020 and still not fixed. Please get back to me

That being said, the application subject to this review has only matched me with a single person in the past two days, a dismal far cry from the rapid fire reliability and frequency of my previous experiences.

After a while, no boosts = no matches"

3994,Michael Carsejr,"December 7, 2019",1, A waste of time trying to meet people but instead people are trying to make friends instead of making connection. People are not say who they are playing with people's time and not knowing what they're for is to fine something.

4000,Rebecca Young,"November 8, 2019",3, Decent app. Not as scary as their reputation says. Just use common sense. The message notification is inconsistent. All app freezes up frequently and I have to close and restart.
4001,Pandarian,"November 6, 2019",2," The app keeps freezing and continue to see the same profile even if I swipe left or right. I was able to find matches when I first got the app, now it feels like you can't find anyone on here."
4002,Kevin Kroll,"November 9, 2019",3, A lot of bots and people who just expect you to add them on another platform are the main negative. However the app is usually stable and simple to use. Probably a high variance of your experience will be based on your location and age range.

4014,Daley,"January 1, 2020",1, I have too many matches and it is slow now and crashing. Very very slow it's almost unusable. Is there a way we can have an option to autodelete of those matches you have not messaged? I have thousands of matches already and it's slowing me down.
4015,Brian Barr,"December 23, 2019",1, It was a good app until they started getting greedy. Far fewer matches these days unless you shell out money. Whenever a new pay feature is introduced your amount of matches drop unless you pay for the new feature.
4016,Doug DuBois,"January 13, 2020",1," They are very clever and have made it impossible to unsubscribe from paying for gold. Endless run around, I'm only given the option to uninstall, but how can I tell if they will stop charging me if I do that."

I have just started swiping right on every person. I have yet to be presented with a single match for days. they just hold the likes over your head in the hopes you break down and pay them for gold so you can see who likes you.

4308,Rasmus Kjeldsen,"December 11, 2019",1, - Ads are showing even though I pay for Tinder Gold - seems like the only way to get matches (suddenly there's a lot) is by using boosts - Doesn't feel like my Gold function where you should be able to see who likes you work either.

4491,Ross Scalise,"November 13, 2019",1," Dreadful, scam. Entices with potential then once you pay money to reveal, the pictures change and then you receive no more potential until your subscription expires so you have to pay again. Full of fakes and links to other scam websites."
4492,Aanchal Pandey,"November 13, 2019",1," I have been trying to log in my tinder account but i just don't understand why the fail to log in. I used email, phone, facebook everything. But they always show 'oops something went wrong' or just keeps buffering."

4502,Alan White,"December 28, 2019",3," Tinder is easy to use, and has enough free features to actually be useful.

4841,bluecynic,"November 6, 2019",1, never got to use it ( I downloaded it at 17 so I wasnt able to use until turning 18 and I did recently but then I open it up to see if the countdown is still there or if I can finally use it and it says I was banned??? I contacted customer service via email but got little to no help)
4842,kaustubh gangurde,"November 7, 2019",1, Stupid aap. Can't even get the code for verification of mobile no and it asks for same verification even for logging in with Facebook. Tried it like 10 times.
4843,Nic Molloy,"November 17, 2019",1," Terrible app. Hides all of your matches behind a pay-wall and tells you ""there's no one in your area""."

4846,Josie Reid,"November 27, 2019",3," I enjoy the app, especially in college. But all my matches and messages disappear. Too soon and too many to just be unmatched. It's very frustrating."
4847,Elaine Jessyka Buras,"November 30, 2019",1, crashes. doesn't give me notifications. won't allow me to respond to messages. have to keep uninstalling & reinstalling. trash. not worth paying for.
4848,Matt Sitch,"December 2, 2019",2, When you're out of likes it should also prevent you from disliking profiles considering once you swipe left they're gone for good. It's entirely too easy to accidentally dislike a profile.
4849,Colin Fay-Hagan,"November 26, 2019",1," Unless your paying for services, this doesnt work out well, a lot of old profiles and people who catfish you. I wouldn't use this again."

Tinder then cares only about faces and nothing else. Okcupid is way better in this aspect, 500 you can barely express anything. At least you can see messages and who sent them which is a better feature, could be temporary to get your interest?! So much greed in these apps makes them way less functional than appropriate. A male ego booster at best. I get it now, it gives you the opposite to what you are looking for in hope"
4851,Daniel C,"November 26, 2019",1," I get no matches, no its not my pics. I was getting matches non stop everyday and all the sudden for 2 weeks straight not one match.. Tinder keeps putting my location in a place where I dont even live eventhough I changed it back 20x"

4856,Benoit Chartrand,"January 3, 2020",4, Overall great. The only thing I don't like is there should be a minimum of info to enter. Also profiles of 1 picture and of their dog only is insulting. Not the apps fault though.
4857,Paul g,"December 24, 2019",3," Can you bring back the X and green love heart without us having actually click on their profile? Some, right off the bat we know which way we're swiping and for me it's easier to tap than swipe. I don't want to have to click on their profile."
4858,Jean du Plessis,"January 2, 2020",3," Excellent Concept, but App buggy. Messages not always synced, messages sometimes sent many times as if you type the same thing over and over. Needs improvement!"
4859,Daniel Fernandez,"December 27, 2019",2," I'm in the middle of a conversation, and my messages don't get sent (it says sent, but is not) and the conversation gets deleted. I know because later I get asked why I stopped answering. This happened already 3 times."
4860,Christian Jo,"December 17, 2019",2, Although I have updated the latest version.. although I have logged out and re-log in.. I can't save my profile update.. This apps doesn't allow you to update your profile.. what a shame!
4861,Alejandro Sanchez,"January 4, 2020",4, I like this app but when i got a couple matches they messaged me then they disappeared not to long after a couple texts back and forth and i dont know if there not interested or the app server just glitches out. I kinda want to know which one it is.

4863,Julie Zuvela,"January 18, 2020",4, Easy to use. Would like the option to delete sent messages and I would say if the gold monthly price was cheaper I think more people would purchase it.
4864,Yusuf Tayob,"January 20, 2020",1," The most dissappointed things for this year is to buy this ""premium"" subsribe. Dont bother to buy subscribe.

4866,moto bazuka,"January 20, 2020",1," There's no profile verification. Also there are so many fake profiles it's just awful. Like seriously the more you use tinder the more you develop a spidey sense for fake profiles, and you notice huuuge amounts of fake profiles. Truly garbage"

4879,Thomas E Brown,"December 7, 2019",1," Awful algorithim. The app never matches you with people who have already liked you. At one point it said 10+ likes, and there was nothing. I can't say anything other than skip this app, it's a scam to take your money."
4880,Akshay Sharma,"November 10, 2019",1, Worst app. I bought Tinder gold subscription for a month but it ended in just 15 days. Also not getting matches. Sheer wastage of time and money.

At first I typed in my birth date wrong, accidentally confusing the day and the month so that it was a month earlier than turning 18 but I had already turned 18. I then tried to use Facebook and it seemed to work but I got immediately banned! And the customer support is TERRIBLE and I can't even use it. Like wth?!"
4959,monica zerby,"March 4, 2020",4, Sometimes the app doesn't tell you when you have messages
4960,Bertie Young,"November 5, 2019",3, Unless we spend money we will never get matches. Uve got us by our single lonely balls so the algorithm has zero to do with matchmaking and everything to do with you being a corporate machine with zero humanity.
4961,Sean,"November 13, 2019",1, Can't do anything. I get errors whenever I try to add photos or put something on my profile .
4962,Al,"November 13, 2019",1, Took up offer for half months subscription and that has expired today but they have charged me for a full month this month as of today. Many fake profiles and this charge means I am deleting my account.
4963,Praveen Yadav,"November 14, 2019",1, This app is now just a waste of time because even after having matches I am not able to send messages at all i am not able to talk to anyone if someone has a solution then just tell me I tried reinstalling and I tried re-login
4964,Avery Gmail,"November 16, 2019",2," I am not getting any matches or likes at all. Based on my previous experience with Tinder, I think the app is not working properly."

4969,Sergio Eid,"December 5, 2019",3, Well I guess it could be better if some bugs are fixed and if they work on their customer service and at least give their mail to send emails when in need.
4970,ALEXANDER FAVOUR,"December 7, 2019",1, I'm not happy.. I just installed this app now.. Tried login with my mails it keeps rejecting it and I'm very sure I've not used this app before.. Tried with my phone number it said that my account has been banned I don't understand why?
4971,Whitney DePriest,"December 30, 2019",3, I hate that the app has to be uninstalled a lot in order to get messages to come through. Other than that it's fine.
4972,han back,"December 26, 2019",1, If you like or swipe right on everyone Tinder eventually stops matching you completely. They can not make a profile on you to sell so they drop you from their game.
4973,Patrick Frawley,"January 3, 2020",2, This app used to be good 2 years ago. Now it's a ghost town. I have a sneaking suspicion that most of the profiles you swipe on are inactive.
4974,Saurav Zach,"January 6, 2020",1, I cannot use Gallery to add pictures. It shows a white screen and app gets glitchy. Cant even go back or exit app after that.

4976,Simon Dickinson,"January 1, 2020",4, It is what it is. Useful way to meet new people if you are new to a place. Just wish it would categorise what people were really looking for.
4977,K. P. Law,"January 13, 2020",4," The app itself is great, easy to use and I have received many likesssss from girls who posted lovely photos. However, there are also many female scammers and deceivers. Becareful when using it. An advice for men."

4985,E B,"February 3, 2020",1, Full of bots and none of the reports ever get looked over.
4986,Bryce Conrad,"January 30, 2020",1, I work out of town and the app usually crashes while I was out in the Bush. And one day for no apparent reason at all I caught a ban 😂
4987,Ron Burton,"February 16, 2020",1, Quit demanding users logging in with Facebook give you their email addresses to use the app. The reason we use Facebook log in is because we do not want you to have our email addresses. Scammers.
4988,Anime Space,"January 27, 2020",2, The app is kinda hard to get matched when you use free version I can't afford to pay the paid version. Also you can't tell if someone has seen your message or not

5068,Bace,"November 30, 2019",1, Wasted time swiping. Wasted money trying to pathetically use boosts as an average looking man to even have a chance to be seen by Women. No Matches... This is Fine.
5069,Elham Niazy,"November 21, 2019",4, Some times matches just disapear all at one time and i didnt get a match for almost 6 months this should be fixed but its also not about membership
5070,Pro Viper,"November 22, 2019",2, This app sucks I've been banned once before for no apparent reason and the help took forever and they didnt even respond the second time plus everything hides behind a paywall so good luck finding the one who likes you because it will never show you

5076,John Bradley Peele,"January 9, 2020",1, Tinder hides your interested parties behind a paywall and its been proven over and over. It is fraudulent. IT IS FRAUD. It's absolutely untransparent and truly should be banned from the play store.

I thought I had pressed something by mistake but was sure I hadn't and double checking my purchases I haven't. I have emailed since Jan the 4th and was promised a refund.

5201,Hawk 1911,"November 2, 2019",4, For what it is it is pretty good. I wish the price was something less. I do not feel its worth the up charge. $5 a month no commitment feels about right.
5202,ankita soni,"March 14, 2020",3, this app is quite good..no need to payment anymore..
5203,JJ Dawkins,"November 15, 2019",5, Pretty cool app. Love everything about it. Its just i wish we had more ways to contact someone but other then that i love this app.
5204,Onwugbara precious aka EPrince,"November 24, 2019",1," ISSUES!! Not that good, all day and all night since I downloaded the app I haven't gotten any match yet. Am always liking up profiles but end up with no match now I'm currently tired and bored of it"
5205,Sean Hao,"November 26, 2019",1, I had lots of matches before paying for the upgrade but hardly had anything since then. I was manipulated by tinder.
5206,R Navarro,"December 4, 2019",4," Overall happy with the features although I wish there was option for stats so you don't have to ask the inane question of, say for example, someone's height."
5207,Adam Bushell,"December 7, 2019",1, Poor and bad. They blocked my account straight after I just logged in for the first time and they won't even help me fix it so I can get back in again.
5208,Zach Coyle,"December 11, 2019",1, Every other account is a bot and it feels like you are prevented from getting matches unless you pay.
5209,Owen Palfrey,"December 12, 2019",1, Purchased a 1 month plus subscription and only lasted 5 days! Nearly £30 down the drain! Seriously not happy!!! 😡
5210,Maria Schneider,"December 12, 2019",1, It sometimes logs out without me doing anything. It's annoying because I don't have that phone number anymore

5213,RY MO,"December 27, 2019",1, Doesn't even deserve a one star.... Locked my account and can't even make a new one or anything.... And not even brake any guidelines. Really poor service and poor help. Worst app ever made.
5214,Shubham Naik,"January 1, 2020",1, Fraud app! Subscribing automatically and deducting the amount without any permission and also responding too late even after complaining..
5215,satya chandiramani,"December 19, 2019",2, Not getting any matches not because I look ugly or my profile is bad but this just doesn't work properly now like it used to 2 years ago.

5217,Cate Smyth,"January 1, 2020",1," Crashes all the time, so I deleted it, and when I tried to get it again it just says oops please try again."
5218,Gabriel,"January 2, 2020",1, Will give you a bunch of likes and then require you to pay to like them back and chat. Constant nagging to upgrade to paid and barely any functionality available otherwise.
5219,Luca Leisi,"January 8, 2020",2," Since last update almost never matches, even when, then outside of search radius (>50 mi) Sad to see this, used to like the app Also still some scams and virus links"
5220,Daniel Lee,"January 25, 2020",3, It would be a lot better if you could sort your matches by distance or age or something other than most recent first.
5221,Gabriel,"February 2, 2020",1," Horrible experience, I paid for 3 months of gold membership and I get a boost every three days!?"
5222,Jeff Ellis,"January 24, 2020",1," Just like all the other dating apps they now hide all your matches behind a paywall. Yeah, not paying for it."
5223,Herich Gunawan,"February 10, 2020",5, Tinder is good. It would be better if Tinder can give me a 1-month free VIP membership and then a special price.
5224,Else Giorgi,"February 10, 2020",5, Conversation is very good to describe ur character 😋❤

5231,CC 1497,"March 16, 2020",5, I never actually got a match that worked out but damn is it fun to make up these pick up lines with girls names in them
5232,Pranav Dandekar,"March 18, 2020",4, It's helpful but you gotta improve your profile and keep swiping folks. That's it. Enjoy life
5233,Crew Manning,"March 24, 2020",1, do not pay for tinder gold or tinder plus because before pay you will get many msg and match but after paid amount you will not get single match and msg . its all scam from tinder my 680 ₹ got wasted and going to uniststall this app
5234,Swell_jp,"April 1, 2020",1, I was banned from tinder for having a picture of a cigarette in my picture. This is total bs I liked this app but you guys need to update your policy.

5237,Shantnu Gupta,"December 22, 2019",1, Older version was much better. I didn't like moving my hand rather than clicking on heart icon in app.
5238,Devin Platt,"December 9, 2019",1, I put in the code to get in after it got sent to my number and it said my account has been banded after saying error and I'm confused has of y🤣🤷 I tryed again about a month and 3 days later i dont see them fixing it

5240,Ellswin comedy,"December 3, 2019",5," The app is easy to navigate, and pretty self-explanatory. I had the app before it never had a premium that you paid for. Oh well still a great app."
5241,Logan Pitosky,"January 3, 2020",3, I'd give it a higher rating if they didn't raise the prices for some of the features like super likes were raised 250% in price and boosts doubled in price. I'm now less inclined to use this app as often.
5242,Felix Ramirez,"January 1, 2020",1," Being banned not even knowing the reason why is not nice. You can't even get your account back, and it's like Tinder makes sure you don't even contact them to fix the issue."
5243,satyam singh,"January 22, 2020",1," Instead of giving u matches tinder is more considered for u to buy their premium and for the nibbas hoping to get a match after premium subscription, hold on they need you to pay for their VIP subscription too 😒"
5244,Mohamed Alwakeel,"January 25, 2020",4," It's good enough, but too much features are restricted for those who pay, and payment options aren't really suitable."
5245,The Ungreatful Show by Tim Stubbs,"February 2, 2020",3, I mean it's an app meant to be for finding people you may have things in common with but it's used more for hook ups 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ so it wont ever be 5 stars js!
5246,Brian Hirth,"October 31, 2019",1," The new picture scrolling is terrible!!! No way to turn it off, makes the app unusable. If they don't turn off this feature I'm deleting the app!"
5247,David McFarlane,"November 9, 2019",3, It would be nice to actually have your matches come up first instead of just sitting at 30+ likes for a month with no matches
5248,Sumit Goyal,"November 13, 2019",1, Even though I've full speed internet. Tinder doesn't load profiles messages. chrome version works better.
5249,hi yall,"November 12, 2019",4, A cool and neat little app no problems loading or the gps stuff only get 4 stars cause sometimes it froze my hole phone and I had to restart but that was only 3 times in 3 years of using this app not to bad
5250,Anshuman Das,"March 29, 2020",5, The best app ever seen in my life ...... My phone is blessed to have this app ..... And I m too❤️..... I would give the developer a big thank and love from the bottom of my heart.....

5258,Khalil Mohsin,"January 8, 2020",1, Hey tinder. Can you stop auto renewing my gold subscription i used it once in my life and ive cancelled it 4 times and got charged about 8 times. Enough with your schemes. Make an easier way of blocking payments.
5259,Andreja S.V.,"December 21, 2019",5," Search by age could be a little bit better, instead of 55+ the range should go a bit further beyond."

5261,Keyser Soze,"January 12, 2020",3, Just made an account. And it's asking me to pay for gold or plus membership. I don't have a Facebook. So how can I chat with people if it's trying to charge me. My understanding is that it was free.
5262,Don Yarrow,"January 15, 2020",3, It is ok in most respects but it takes ages to load a persons pictures up onto the screen and sometimes freezes on a persons profile
5263,Christopher Dehn,"January 16, 2020",1, I created an account and directly got banned. After contacting the support I got told that they are not providing information and that they are not unbanning accounts... No functioning support --> bad app

The app works well and have matched with some great ppl which is great, but I'm not sure if I'll continue to pay much longer when there are some other good dating/meeting apps on the play store. Also for having Gold the swipes that are pop ups to the internet sites are annoying after a while. If anything send emails I can just ignore.Thanks XD"
5277,Brajesh Tripathi,"November 1, 2019",1, Useless and waste of money. Complete waste of money can't chat with profile even when of paid and most of profile seems fake.

5293,GZO7,"December 4, 2019",1," The app indicates I have over 35 matches, but even after swiping for days at the max distance and age I wont get any matches and it keeps saying there's no one nearby. Tinder WILL hide people from you unless you pay a ridiculous fee. SCAM"
5294,ruttu 2020,"December 10, 2019",1, I purchased tinder gold premium yesterday but after few hours not showing any gold premium feature. I also tried restore purchase with new account but didnt get confirmation number. Worst service or app its kind of fraud?

5344,The Polite Pirate,"March 27, 2020",1, Singles out men. Does not actually work. Says you have sent inappropriate messages? No idea. Never installing again. This app is the reason dating is so bad these days.

5351,Khaled Sheta,"December 25, 2019",3, I don't get any activity what so ever by the other gender Almost like my profile is being hid from the searching page on purpose so that I have to pay for the app!!!!!
5352,Abhinav Paitandy,"January 4, 2020",1," Dear Tinder, It is not ok to revoke the premium feature a fortnight before my subscription expiration date! This is a violation of trust and agreement. Hopefully you have the courage to tell this upfront instead of resorting to such tactics. Thanks"
5353,Jeff Womack,"January 5, 2020",1, It's a joke. Most profiles aren't active and search engine doesn't work. Set for 30 miles and get woman from 100 miles. Not good
5354,Kathy Varner,"January 3, 2020",3, It's online so potential for misuse is there but it's a good screening tool. Just need to have some sort of varification of the details people post.

If you download this app you're a loser because you're wasting time go with fling it actually works. 90% of the profiles are fake.

I didn't even jump on Tinder the second day the day that I was banned
5360,TLF Fleming,"January 23, 2020",1, You cancel and cancel ans the still charge your card or your method of payment and its impossible to get it back. There is no phone to communicate with anyone directly. Its a joke. All the cute guys have gotten off here.
5361,michael langan,"January 27, 2020",3," I'm getting REALLY tired of reporting the same fake profile. At least one of every three encounters is the same fake profile. No matter where I am when I log in, it says she's less than 1km away. Tinder, you guys should really do better than that."

5367,Acacia Akenson,"February 11, 2020",1," I was wrongfully banned and there's no way to appeal it at all. I respect tinder's no nonsense policy, but if people are banned for possibly being catfishes tinder should give them an opportunity to verify their identity or something."

5464,Micah Hawman,"February 11, 2020",1, Decided to check out your app based on a friend's suggestion both my Facebook and phone number are banned before I even use it. Thanks for making the decision if your app will work for me or not. Looks like you are riddled with bots or a ton of fake profiles

There's a flock of ""premium"" snapchat girls that advertise themselves. I feel like the words venmo and cashapp should get a profile banned.

Even when paying for memberships such as plus or gold the app isn't truthful in the amount of matches around one. I don't recommend it, although I keep coming back...."
