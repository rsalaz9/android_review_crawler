So much for A.I and getting your users to use this app. Update: I've tried to uninstall and reinstall Assistant App and still it continues to want me to train my voice. I go through the entire motion at least 2 dozen times I know the routine! This does not work!!! JUNK!!!

I wanted to turn my home AC on while on the road before i arrive, i had to pick up my phone, unlock it to turn the AC on! Then the slogan ""get things done hands-free"" isn't applicable. Please bring back this option ASAP! It's highly needed! Every time there is an update something doesn't work. Now you can't even get the time without unlocking the phone. Shame shame."

You have to be calm and collected with this Google assistant as sometimes it doesn't obey your commands, another problem I've had with it is getting me lost- I once used my assistant to guide me to a supermarket, and when we ""arrived"" it turned out we was in the middle of nowhere and miles away from our house it took us 30 minutes to find out way back home I'm not very happy with how it turned out."

Siri wasn't very good on my iPhone X. It was really just a talking search engine, although it could operate some apps on the phone. Assistant does even less. Most of the time, it turns itself off and I have to spend a lot of time trying to turn it back on (difficult when the controls are grayed out or not present). It rarely talks, and can't operate any of the other apps. Very primitive compared to Alexa and Siri."

Ex. If I ask ""What's the weather?"" It will give the weather no problem. But if I ask it anything else after that, it hangs after giving a high pitched tone with no response. Happens routinely. I have to exit out of the ""Assistant"" app in order for it to work again."

If this is the case, it has been rendered almost entirely useless. I often used the assistant to operate my phone while driving or at work, both instances where I cannot look at the phone, much less reach for it to open the screen. Google has made a slew of questionable changes to their apps over the past couple years, whittling away control and functionality bit by bit."

I don't know why, but it really creeps me out when my phone suddenly prompts to open Assistant even when I didn't say 'Hey, Google', 'OK, Google' or anything similar with activating it, and it happens randomly. My game also messed it up because when I play, sometimes it activates for no reason, and then it would take a significant time to close the app and continue playing, only to found out that I lost the game. Could have given 0 star."

And this after more than 10 years of collecting my voice data. It seems that the voice recognitioneven became rather worse than better. But maybe it's the connection between my hearing aids (Phonak Audeo Marvel) and Google Assistant via Bluetooth? Anyway, this needs improvement."

This has been reported through forums and the finger has been pointed at the assistant as being at fault. When will this be fixed???

It's horrible to try to use it now. The routines are not working right. Before you screwed it up it worked great. Now it's a royal pain in the ass. It's faster to type and send the text myself. You took something that assisted and made things more convenient and turned it into a train wreck. If this is how it is going to ""work"" then remove the assistant from the name it's false advertisement. I mean I'm even using your device pixel 4 it should work great."

Google knows but has no interest in fixing it. This is what you get when the government gives the entire industry a pass on liability. Even if you are lucky enough to get a response your wording or question or whatever you are asking Google to do is an overly tight set of spoken words in a specific order to get the correct or desired response.

I will say the positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot so far. The only down side I see to it is you can not rename your assistant. What I mean by that is instead of saying ""Hey Google"" I would like to be able to say ""Hey (some other name I give it). This would be a good idea because if I'm near someone else who has this on their phone I might trigger their phone instead of mine or I might trigger both. Now on the positive note as someone who has worked on trying out software to help people with learning disabilities this is a great app to help people keep their life organized. Just speaking to get something done faster is a very helpful feature for a lot of people. I am a stay at home dad (I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old so things get hectic at times) who uses Google calendar, Google tasks, and google shopping to organize what I do on a daily basis. Because of this the ability to say ""hey Google, Good Morning"" and have it give me a summary of what I have that day helps me know what I have to do to get ready for that day. This app has also gotten me into using the Google reminders feature which has been helpful. I also use it because I tend to think of reminders I have set for myself while I'm driving When taking care of the kids I very often do a weather check with it by asking it while I'm in the middle of anything ranging from preparing a meal for the kids to changing a diaper. Like I mentioned earlier, I know from experience that people with learning disabilities have a tough time keeping their lives organized and this is a helpful tool for people in that situation. On a side note I would like to mention that many years ago I used to prefer Microsoft Outlook for organizing my everyday life and was not very fond of google. I have switched over because Microsoft seems to be making stuff mean for keeping people organized at work environments only. (I, not saying that is a bad thing) Google however is a lot more accessible on the go and a lot more catered for people to organize their personal life and work life at once."

I don't know if it was caused by an update, but I wish I knew how to fix it. I can't see very well, so I miss when she read to me."

Whilst there is a slight vibration on the mobile device that can be felt on app launch it is not always noticeable for me because the vibrate is so soft and short. Also this vibrate function is missed when not holding the device. Therefore it would be a great asset to me and fellow vision impaired users if the beep was implemented again. This would let me know that my wake word has successfully launched the app and that Google is listening. Please make this app more accessible. Siri is light years ahead in terms of this.

I have Google Home, Mini, and LG G7 My LG G7 has the Google Button on the left side of my phone below my Volume controls, so my phone is always listening, plus the Button. I prefer Button feature, so I want to disable "" always listening "" on my LG G7 Mobile. There is no support / settings for this feature. I want to turn off ""always listening"" especially when at home. ""Ok Google"" can't help on this issue, tells me to mute the Mic on the back of my Phone. No such button on my LG G7. There needs to be a setting to control this feature on these devices. Google can't help so maybe posting my feedback here might , wake them up. At home if I say ""ok Google"" I don't want my 3 devices all listening and talking to me. As I read this review before posting my LG G7 Google is listening and responding, but their responses are incorrect, and the You Tube Videos are B.S. i ""Ok Google"" your turn. My LG G7 is using Android 8.0 Michael"

It sets my alarms, lets me know when I have appointments, weather and driving conditions, and tells me where I parked should I not remember, and so many other thing. The list goes on and on. The only thing I am a little bumbed about is that I just got a new Acer Chrombook and cannot seem to get the assistant to work on it. All well, no big thing as I have it all over the house. I will figure it out and if not, no big thing. At least it is on my phone and that is where I need it the most. Thanks Google for making such a great and helpful tool. I clearly am a Google fan and so far Google has always come on top for all my needs. I will be watching for more updates to the assistant."

It requires me to accept the terms and turn it on everytime I request it to do something and only blames the engineers for being worthless.

Includes hands free instructions following and even capable of some conversation. References to pop culture makes it quite a fun app to spend some time in. However, I happened to find some bug that I hope the app developers can take care of. This app allows you to talk to few other app services inside the Google assistant platform. It's definitely a great thing, but here's the bug. My morning routine (assistant let's you build a basic morning routine and remembers it) includes talking to headspace for meditation, it's the last thing in my morning routine. After headspace leaves the conversation, Google assistant can no longer understand even the easiest commands, eg. Call a person, set an alarm, set a timer, text someone... etc. etc. The only reply I get is, ""sorry, I don't understand"". I need to restart Google assistant for it to regain functionality. There's a glitch. Overall, I'm very happy with the gradual development of Google assistant over time. And I'm confident it's the best assistant service platform there is. I'd like to see the day when it passes the Turing test."

Unfortunately sometimes The Voice comes back different on two different occasions. Sometimes it will ask me to clarify things that I've already clarified a hundred times. When I ask it to bring up a contact and it says mobile or work, when I answer mobile, it says okay there are a few places near you, and brings up Mobile stores near my location. If I answer work, it will randomly at times bring up my work address. Sometimes it randomly goes into high speed. Other times it will not read my contacts properly. So if for example I ask call Mary it will bring up the Mary's. If I ask it to call Oscar, it does a Google search for Oscar. sometimes it will bring up the phone number and dial the number one a matically other times it asks me what number, other times it does Google searches. Sometimes it actually says"" I'm sorry I don't understand"" to everything I say. Somehow it seems to learn things and then unlearn them randomly. I had to change my daughter's name from Rebecca to Becky so it would narrow the search response. Even after telling Google that Becky is my daughter . now when I ask for Becki sometimes it calls her and sometimes it asks me if I want her or a different Rebecca.... to which I replied the first one and then asks me mobile or home , and when I reply mobile , it tells me it's done a search and these are the Mobile locations near me. Is there anyone actually monitoring all of these bugs?"

I use my samsung phone to get her to tell me things. or to respond to a question, to tell me what my name is or to just just say the how are you morning routine but it does not work at all any more. The assistant does not respond any more and does not even bring up what I want. like if I start a conversation like ""Hey google, what is my name"" , it takes me to the song ""What's my name"" and other google search results."

Trying to figure how to make it respond like that is impossible. It's called getting worse, when things should be getting better.   But then again google is expert at making things more complex. I use to use IE explorer to browse (started with netscape), then it got worse not running smoothly, but it was simple. Chrome took over as number one position, but they are always more steps to do what explorer did in one. I think google is collaborating with MS, because they are the same. Like MS Word. It use to be simple, now it's extra steps to do everything, like print, it's now three steps. You actually have to leave the page to print something. Just like Google. Why? Because they have techies running everything and they like complexity, yet the public wants simplicity. And google runs the world now, so they don't care. It's called a monopoly"

I've tried everything and the settings are all correct but every time I use it, it defaults to the wrong settings and presents me with the enter pin screen.

I can't believe that with such sucky recognition technology Google prompts me to use voice match to unlock my phone. It just responds to anyone's voice. I wonder whether this will be my last Android phone... was a big fan sadly.

Suggestion- Google Assistant should not be made available for download to phones having pre-installed assistant...or...the Google Assistant app should display something like 'INSTALLED' instead of 'INSTALL'. Thanks

Even though the Geeni app is listed on their list of compatible apps, they refuse to accept my user password for Geeni and won't link up. I've downloaded the Amazon Alexa app and it linked up to the Geeni app with no problems. Alexa also does everything that Google Home & Assistant do. GOOGLE, YOU BLEW IT BIG TIME."
1741,Eliana Castaneda,"March 14, 2019",1, I used to love it. it would read jokes out loud instead of now when all it does is open up a web page. ugh! it's the only assistant that can keep up with my spanglish tendencies. I might just be a bit picky but I want Google to TELL me a joke instead of me having to read it.

1771,Victoria Hartline Lindeman,"April 1, 2019",3, Google Assistant is not available a lot; Tells me that more than a few else. I do have a Motorola E5 and you do have to turn them off every single night for them to work properly; I have been turning it off every night & it has all it's updates.
1772,Kushagra Mahajan,"October 14, 2018",4, Whenever I am bored Assistant tries to keep me entertained by telling lame jokes and interesting facts.

1838,Larry DeSaules,"October 21, 2019",4, I drive rideshare and use Google assistant all the time. It works great with most questions. And it works great great with YouTube Music . My only gripe is I'd like to use a different hotword (instead of 'hey Google '). Google: let me change 'hey Google ' to 'computer '
1839,Sheila Dorman,"October 29, 2019",5," I was thrilled that Google set up my tablet. I convinced myself that I couldn't do it. Just loved it!,"

1861,Jonathan,"October 8, 2018",3," It takes way too long to start up, and there's no sound to indicate when it's ready to listen. If you're going to be speaking to it, it could easily make a sound. You're probably speaking to it because you can't look at the screen so why can't it make a sound when it's ready?"
1862,TheGreatPiggy igPay,"March 19, 2019",1," Only thing I needed it to do was play music I downloaded onto my phone, but it refuses to do that.

1864,A Google user,"December 20, 2018",4, only issue i have is the Google pixel buds and this app aren't playing nicely together. Google support says it's a problem with the GA app. very frustrating my buds don't work correctly still after about a month. BUT the addition of call screening is amazing
1865,None Of Your Business,"November 29, 2018",1, You'd think they'd make Google apps work on a Google phone. OK Google only works once and then won't work a second time unless you physically press the button for our to start listening. Every update makes this app worse than before. Google Pixel 2 Nov 29 2018
1866,tristan ruhanen,"May 29, 2019",1, Google assistant only works if you repeat yourself... it is very annoying and should be fixed. It would be the best voice assistant if you had to ask one time!!!! extremely annoying!
1867,Bailee Koslowski,"June 19, 2019",1, Access with Voice Match refuses to turn on. Completely and utterly useless tool without this function. Been an issue since September of 2018. You'd think a trillion dollar company like Google could figure out how to fix their shite when given nearly a year to do so.
1868,Jeffrey Alexander,"June 30, 2019",1, would be great if it worked at all. app wont open. assistant wont register in my car anymore. ok google does nothing. hands free isnt hands free when I have to interact with my phone. and when I do (try to send a text) it registers the forst two words and assumes im done.

1873,lars de wijzer,"August 3, 2019",1," Suddenly not working on my phone. Neither does lens. All I get when I open it is 'Google assistant is not available for this phone', when my sister (who has the exact same model and make as me) has lens and assistant working fine. What's up with that?"
1874,Kevin Ward,"August 4, 2019",3," Super smart and works well. I'll use it when it feels less Orwellian. The fact that I have to say ""Hey Google"" instead of ""Hey (literally anything else)"" deters me from using it."
1875,ydog doggy,"August 13, 2019",1, Real unreliable. Does a horrible job launching at voice command even with everything set right. And it won't open at all anymore. not even from the install page with a fresh installation. what a joke!
1876,Gmah Macky,"August 19, 2019",1, it has totally stopped working for me. I had a joke that it was my best friend .I'm not technically savvy and my son has done all he knows .but I have no assistant. help!!!it started to have a problem when I for the last update .hasn't worked right since
1877,Jonathan Jackson,"September 23, 2019",5," The assistant has come a long way, it is now worthy of being a Google product. it now easily rivals and even surpasses Alexa. I find it to be very useful, especially when I dont want to type. The voice recognition is much improved, as re the search results."
1878,Carrera Waller,"September 26, 2019",1," Everytime I try opening the app, it freezes my phone (Samsung Galaxy S10+ Note). I liked using it on my old phone, but I had to delete the app. I did the steps as suggested. It's still freezing."

1880,Robert Jacoby,"October 27, 2019",4, Google assistant works great. The main reason for only 4 stars is I would like to see Siriusxm support like with Alexa. I know you can chromecast the app but I looking more for voice commands to play the channels on my Google JBL screen without using the chromecast.

1891,Daniel Coats,"March 12, 2019",5, Hands down the most intelligent virtual assistant on any mobile or home device/platform. All info received from her is also very customizability. I'm not sure how someone could give Google Assistant less than 5 stars.
1892,Kylie John Skates,"March 10, 2019",4, Only thing stopping me giving 5 stars is that I'm unable to take a screenshot with voice command on my Samsung note 9. For that I'm stuck with Bixby which I don't like. If Bixby can screen shot then why can't something as advanced as Google Assistant do it..?.

1895,A Google user,"November 17, 2018",1," This is really starting to get annoying. My internet is working perfectly fine but when I try to ask my Assistant a question it stops and says,""Can't reach Google at the moment"". But when I go to get support you won't even give me A PERSON to talk to instead of reading forums?"
1896,A Google user,"December 5, 2018",1, No option for a dark theme/mode. The AI if it is real doesn't work well at all. Made for hearing and voice users mainly. The keyboard option is obviously stuck in and not really for anyone to use - it seems.
1897,Aniket Dutta,"January 4, 2019",4, Please fix only one thing.. When we ask our Google assistant to remember this location then it only remembers the phrase told to it... But it should be like... When we tell that phrase it saves our location to google maps... So please look to it.. And make it happen
1898,Juan Trotman,"October 25, 2018",1, I think this app is a good idea in theory but it takes too long to find anything.....anyone with a 1st grade education can find what they need by typing without waiting for hours and repeated requests for information.
1899,Jing RFerrer,"October 24, 2018",2," Google Assistant pulls out long deleted or updated contact numbers, even when those numbers no longer show up on your Google Contact list. Still a problem despite web tech advice to fix it. Apparently I'm not the only one having this issue."
1900,James,"March 8, 2019",2," I'm not sure what y'all did in recent updates no, but my phone does not like it. ""ok google"" and commands are not as responsive and sometimes hang. I can no longer hear audio when connected to Android auto and to my car via Bluetooth."
1901,David Barnett,"December 11, 2018",4, This is an amazing helpful app but I'm a bit annoyed because lately its been saying it can't open because theres not any connection but there sure is. If you could fix this problem it would be a five star
1902,Hawka,"March 28, 2019",4," Good, but could be better. I wish you could use separate accounts for the regular Google Search app and the Assistant. It would also be nice if there was a Dark Mode for it. But it's still one of the best virtual assistants out there."
1903,Thomas Hart,"February 19, 2019",1, it's a great idea!!!! and it use to be a great app but lately it has gotten worse and worse I have uninstalled and reinstall several times and done everything else I know to do I really like it please fix it!!!!!!
1904,Aswinth Velayudhan,"September 19, 2018",4, I only suggest that Please enable working of google assistant when the screen is lock. That I could wake up my phone from lock screen itself.. And command to unlock the screen... So I hope you have got my point... So please bring this in the next update of this app
1905,Gary L,"October 13, 2018",1, Not too sure what happened with the latest update. I cannot even use the mic feature on the GA of my Pixel2xl. It's frustrating because I cannot use the mic to communicate with it. Only keyboard is working
1906,ipmanwanttobe,"October 15, 2018",5," It's a very helpful app to have and it's free. It's helpful for navigation, questions and people, places and things. It even will tell you jokes when you can use a good laugh. I highly recommend the Google Assistant."
1907,alessio imperato,"November 18, 2018",1, After the last upgrade it's not working at all! It keep asking me to unlock the phone to play music and to do calls.

1916,V. S.,"September 10, 2019",1, Can't get it to work while connected to Bluetooth in my car. Also can't get it to work unless it's connected to a Google Home device. I'm too scared that everything will disconnect and not reconnect that I haven't bothered to uninstall and reinstall.

You should really check it thoroughly for it's features are also very fun.

So now, my Assistant can't do some stuff b/c my droid version is too old. WHY ...Full ReviewOk, so I have an older cell phone. I cannot buy one every 3-4 years to keep up with the latest 'droid version and my supplier and carrier certainly are not going to, either; they are trying to get the new stuff to market. So now, my Assistant can't do some stuff b/c my droid version is too old. WHY DO YOU ALLOW THIS GOOGLE? Do not let my app update if it is beyond my O/S version. I would rather have a limited app, than one that does not work. My Google home products now suffer from me setting new features and I cannot restore old ones if I have problems or don't like the new feature I may try. #2) Talking to my telephone seems to buffer and it is not the wifi. I get about 10 words in and it cuts off the rest. It USED to work fine--maybe that is a new option buried in the abyss or yet another O/S issue--how can I tell unless I have to call and tie-up the support line?"
