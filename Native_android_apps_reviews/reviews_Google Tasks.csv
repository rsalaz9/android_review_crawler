This app pops up individual push notifications that are harder to miss than the ones that come up for Google Calendar. This app could be improved, however, by automatically giving you the option to set a time for a notification. I have to click too many things to add a notification. Also, if it synced more seamlessly with reminders on Google Calendar and Gmail, that would be helpful."

Makes it hard to schedule. 2) When deleting a re-occuring task your only options are to delete it the one time or every single one of them ever.

A cleaner interface for ""today"" list so that once today's items are done, can look blank, gives great feeling of completion. 2. Ability to set a recurring due date based on completion rather than a set rhythm, e.g. if I set repeat on Monday but I want it done every 7 days and I actually do it Tuesday, have the next occurrence on Tuesday. 3. Three or four levels of priorities within a list."

I like having a list of things to do to look at whenever I have free time.

They got rid of multiple layers of nesting, which I used all the time. The new version ""helpfully"" offers to corrupt your old data. The fact that tasks disappear instead of getting checked is also a major downgrade. The completed tasks view seems to place tasks in random order, and so there's no clear way to see what I did each day. (Also, on desktop the new keyboard shortcuts are absolutely terrible.) Multi-account support is also broken: if you ""share"" (eg: a web page) to Tasks it places the task in whatever Google account you'd last used in the Tasks app, and there's no way to move a task from one account to another. So you end up with work tasks in your personal task list and vice-versa."
8,Jason Rivette,"April 18, 2020",4," The app is great, but would like a few more features. Ability to sync with calendar, reminders, and have more sublists. Either way, the app is very satisfying. I just go back and forth between this and keep notes, which has more features. But this is great for simple daily task lists"

However, GT has a MAJOR flaw that makes it uncomfortable to use. Repeat tasks do not show up until the next due date after completing the last one. In fact, the task may not show up until some random time the day it's due. Pretty scary to use; doesn't feel reliable. Future tasks DO show up properly using the calendar app in Chrome on my PC. Please extend that function to Android!"

Using this for any important tasks can be a proplem because there is no pop up reminder that lets you know the task is coming up. You have to manually check to see what tasks need to be done, which if you have the time to continually check your list it works. However, if your busy doing something and an important task needs to be done you will fail to complete it because there was no alert outside the app to let you know it is coming up."

But it still feels like the bare bones of a good task management app. There should be an option to see all tasks across lists together. I think this is a pretty basic requirement. This functionality shoud have been ready when the ability to create lists is introduced. Takes so much time to load these lists too. Such a hassle.

Needs a serious overhaul with many needed bells and whistles added. One example could be a Location Reminder ability. This capability is a function that is already in the Google Keep app. Just add that bit of code from Google Keep to Google Tasks and voila. Though you could make one change to that bit of code. It would be extremely useful if a user could set up a text that would auto-send when a specified gps-fence set up for that reminder had been breached. TBW.

I have adult ADD and task-keeping has always been a challenge. I use Tasks a lot because I can jot down ideas, set reminders, categorize, and check things off. I use my G-calendar all the time, so this keeps everything on one device. And syncs everything in one. My only recommendations are to have colored options, priority indicators, and ability to list by priority, etc. vs having to manually organize tasks."

Why would there be no interaction between gmail app, calendar app and tasks app on the phone as well? Google always talks of making things simpler, why would you miss out of these things for mobile app then? The sub tasks such have a nested view, its quite confusing as there is no nested view. Also there should be a a button to set priority level for task."
47,Nathan Salas,"March 29, 2020",3," So I want to store using Google Calendar and Tasks. I would give this five stars if there was a way to view tasks in Calendar. I've tried looking up ways on the internet to perform this but nothing is working. I have both apps, but they don't appear to sync."

It would be cool to have other options like a grid-style to do list (for example I have the same ten tasks with respect to seven different students, so it would be cool to have a grid of task v student and be able to fill in the grid as I complete the tasks rather than making separate pages for a task list per student)"
49,Kam Desai,"April 16, 2020",5, Can't function at work without this app. The Gmail integration is amazing as you can create tasks straight from an email and later click to see the associated email with the task. I wish the add to tasks button wasn't buried in a weird menu and it was an actual prominent button like spam or archive.
50,Jen Seret,"April 21, 2020",4," Integrates seamlessly with Google Calendar. I wish I could see my tasks in one list on the given day instead of having to open each list separately. Otherwise, I find this app far superior to all the other free apps built to sync with Google Tasks."
51,Dan Dreise,"April 22, 2020",5," My favourite featues: It's simple, intuitive, you can create subtasks, export to Google Keep, multiple lists, and arrange by date or custom. You can even mark emails in Gmail as a task (love that feature). I've tried many to do apps and this one just works great!"
52,Sattya,"April 23, 2020",4," I like its simplicity, fast loading and integration to google platform and calendar.

54,Theresa Cook,"March 27, 2020",4," I switched from another list app that is going away. I like that it imported reminders from my calendar.

You might want this if to get reminders reliably, even without a host web app like Gmail open. Maybe you're using Gmail Android app on a Pixel Slate, similarly to get emails even with the app not open. You also can't share a list or a todo, which is a frustrating omission when working with Tasks next to Gmail on group projects."
106,Sarada Lakshmanan,"March 27, 2020",3, I really like the option to create sub tasks but I want to be to move around tasks. There's an option to organize by date but it doesn't automatically include subtasks. Moving around tasks would help structure the day. This feature is available in Keep so I don't see why it isn't available here.
107,Estan-Charles Hall,"April 7, 2020",5," Simple but streamlined to-do list. Intergrates well with Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Keep. I've used it to check off 500+ tasks and finish several projects over this past year. Highly recommend."
108,Robert,"April 3, 2020",5, Tried tasks apps before and they haven't took. Very easy to use and syncs well with other Google apps. However this functionality is not availble on the mobile version but I hope that this is something that is in the pipeline
109,Shayari Banerjee,"April 13, 2020",5," This is really, an amazing app. I just wish I could rearrange the lists according to my preference, like I can, the tasks. Otherwise, I absolutely love it, and it is perfect!"
110,Joaena Hyewon Ryu,"April 20, 2020",4," I am glad I found this app. I have one major request: PLEASE make it an option for us to drag and drop the order of the Task Lists, just as we can drag and change the order of the tasks themselves. That would improve the quality of my life significantly. Thank you."
111,Eleanor,"April 19, 2020",3," Definitely on the barebones end of things, but I like that I can update my list from anywhere. My biggest complaint is that the sort order doesn't change on the widget. I hope this is fixed soon."
112,Randon L Carroll,"April 19, 2020",4," I love this app. My ONLY complaints are that tasks assigned to a time don't show up on the mobile Google Calendar only on the desktop Google Calendar, and you can't collaborate lists with other Google accounts/people. It would be awesome to have those features."
113,Prince Wilson,"April 3, 2020",5, This is Perfect for the ones who are struggling to manage time and also for the ones who forget to do things they want to. It is simple without too many features but quite useful. I am really satisfied!
114,Chris Mandeen,"April 19, 2020",4," Love that I can bring it up on my computer too. I miss the old version though, sometimes I'm not ready to clear completed tasks and I liked when it had its own page (not part of calendar)"

116,Lyman G Phillips,"April 4, 2020",3," This is a fine to do app. It does the job and integrates with the Google calendar. However, if it works with Google Assistant, I don't know how - so maybe they need to publicize it more."

118,Deplay Stationforme,"March 30, 2020",2," The whole interface is clean and smooth but something just does not feel right or rather does not have the functions i desire. Nonetheless, is a reliable application."
119,Jason Barnett,"April 2, 2020",4, It's a good app for listing to-do lists and tracking completion. I would like to see a single location to view all tasks not just viewing them within the created sub folder. Works great though.
120,Nicolas Hernandez,"April 7, 2020",3," Would love for the subtasks to remain below the main task even when sorting by date. Also, there should be an option for sorting by date to be the default to not have to change it every time there's a new list"
121,Daniel Wagner,"April 8, 2020",3," Simple but effective, despite somewhat feeling like an afterthought or intern project. It's definitely missing some more advanced features and integration into gCal would be nice too. Please add the ability to change the sort method of the home-screen widget (eg. due date)."
122,Kate Miles,"April 10, 2020",4, Overall useful. I wish there was an archive option so I could archive past lists rather than delete them. The checklist is easy to use and also accessible on Google calendar. It syncs across devices.
123,Travis Fink,"April 12, 2020",4, Simple and easy to use. Like the reminder feature and subtask feature. Straightforward app for when you just don't have a piece of paper to write down your to do list.
124,Harry Tanner,"April 16, 2020",5, Amazing. It would be great to see a whole list of tasks to do though (currently I have to go into each category to see my to do tasks; would be very useful to see an overall list)
125,cgcg7777,"April 21, 2020",1," Reoccurring tasks dont reappear until the day they are due, CRAZY.!!!! You can view tasks across all lists you create in one view. You have to go hunting for your tasks. CRAZY!!!"
126,Adelbert Ames,"April 21, 2020",5," Accessible across multiple devices, fast, minimalistic, simple to use. A little bit of organizational functionality too - you can make sub-tasks, task descriptions, and multiple to-do lists. Been using for 3 years, still love it"

128,Thomas Scott,"March 22, 2020",5," This app is a fantastic way to keep track of what needs to be done and what IS done. Simplistic, yet intelligent. Minimal, yet backed with small yet useful features. Pairs up nicely with other Google services to help you easily track and tackle multiple tasks at once."
129,Katsushii Blookie,"April 19, 2020",5," It's actually helpful tbh. Though, it'd be nice to have more functions for it like, connecting your tasks to the calendar ( I could prolly be wrong with this function), and perhaps something more..? All in all, it's beneficial."
130,Mark Osborne,"April 21, 2020",4," Is one of the best I have used for keeping track of tasks etc to do, memory is not bad but obviously as good as years ago so to make a quick note of things to do later that u think of on the spur of the moment is useful"
131,Jacob C,"March 16, 2020",4," Best task manager app I have tried so far. I enjoy subtasks and being able to set any kind of reminder you want. However anther layer of tasks might be nice. For example currently is school, class, sub task assignments, vs school, classes, assignments. As it feels cluttered very quickly."

134,Dils Does,"March 29, 2020",2, this app would genuinely be perfect for me if i could just set tasks with subtasks as repeating. i keep trying to set up my routines or subdivide things i find more daunting but have to do regularly but i cant because subtasks cant be repeated.
135,Alexandru Dominte,"April 2, 2020",3, the app has potential but: - no reminder settings? - widget sorts the tasks in desc order. the later ones first. what's up with that. i have to scroll everytime to the bottom - no sharing capability between gaccounts. that would be so cool to share chores and stuff
136,Beng Mangubat,"April 1, 2020",4," The app is great. Easy to use. But, I hope, when deleting or editing a task, there's another option to apply the delete or edit like ""This and future tasks"" or something"
137,Brandy Ross,"April 12, 2020",5, I love this app for my grocery list & other lists. As you buy the groceries you can simply click on it and it goes away. And if you accidentally erased something you can pull it back up quickly
138,Chirag Pugalia,"April 14, 2020",5," Amazing for keeping a tab on things you have to do, and has only the limited features that i need to keep my todo list simple and easy to use and update. I like the UI as well"
139,Giovanni Benincasa,"April 21, 2020",5," I love the way it is integrated with GSuite Tools on the right-hand side of the screen. I wish it could be embedded with Drive file types: Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc."
140,Karl Moore,"April 23, 2020",4, It has been great for organizing the different tasks for my different projects. I do wish it was possible to share tasks list with other people so that you both can check-off different tasks.

143,Chris Jack,"April 2, 2020",5," Greatest thing ""since sliced bread""... It just now need to work hand in hand with Google Keep. Definite recommend. Should connect to the calendar though or at least play with Keep & Calendar a lil better."
144,Sergey Yershykhin,"March 29, 2020",4," Overall great app, but 2 things missing: 1. I would like to share my list with other users, so we can have same tasks if needed. 2. I would like to collapse all subtasks so they are not visible in general list."
145,Klariz Mateo,"March 31, 2020",5," It is simple app, very minimalist. It has dark theme. What I love about this app is I can add a lot of tasks, I can use the repeat multiple times without accessing pro version"
146,Ian Cohen,"April 4, 2020",3, Please fix the android widget view..... This is still the best native task app if you want tasks to sync HOWEVER please fix the widget which does not reflect the sort order of the app (when sorted by date). Fixing the android widget would make this a 6
147,Ziyad Thomas,"April 16, 2020",4, The sub-tasks and reminders are very handy tools for daily tasks. It would be good to have a feature that let you check how often you had completed a daily task over time.
148,Amowogbaje Gideon,"April 17, 2020",5," It's an awesome app, it has helped me to keep track ofy activities, it will be so cool if a reminder attribute can be added to alert when a to-do timeline is starting or elapsing. Nice one to the developers"
149,Sam C,"April 18, 2020",1," Fix the bleeping repeating tasks. When I mark a tasks to be repeated it should repeat. Instead, when I mark as complete for an iteration, it never repeats. This is really simple. Please fix."
150,Byron McNeil,"April 21, 2020",4," I like Tasks and how it integrates with Tasksboard and Google Calendar but it would be good if the user was able to create ""rules"" such as ""if item is overdue, move to overdue board and place in date time order""."
151,Stefano Calò,"April 24, 2020",5, The app is amazing! Love that I can set date and time for tasks and get reminders if they are overdue. Love the integration with Google calendar that has been pushed few months ago.
152,Cory Stanley-Stahr,"March 21, 2020",4," I love this app for it's straightforward simplicity. That said, sometimes I wish that I could create a more complex hierarchical list, or that I could cross-reference 1 list from within another list. But I guess then it would not be as straightforward and simple."
153,RW Dusing,"March 20, 2020",4, Very helpful in keeping me organized on a daily basis and scheduling future tasks. I would like to see some way to prioritize tasks within a given day or time frame. Also a few too many clicks needed when entering a task and date

Now for homework I actually am using Microsoft To Do, but I do prefer Tasks."
155,Vicki Foley,"March 27, 2020",5, Works well for me. Not too structured. Easily adaptable. Works with laptop and Android phone very well. If I had to ask for more...it would be a print facility.
156,Joey Clavette,"April 6, 2020",3, Very useful app. I would give it 5 stars but there's an issue where recurring tasks don't show up in your task list till the day they're due. On forums it shows people have been complaining for years on deaf ears.
157,Rupesh Shejwal,"April 10, 2020",5," The app helps me a lot in helping me remember my tasks for the day. It should keep a points system, like on completing a task you get some points which will increase the users enthusiasm towards completing the task."

162,Justin Masayda,"April 19, 2020",3," Helpful overall, but lacks some essential features. It would be dramatically improved by two changes: 1) Collapsible subtasks, and 2) List reordering. It's a shame such simple organizational features aren't present."
163,Nicholas Morgan,"April 24, 2020",3," Its simplicity and ability to link emails to tasks is great the massively big problem, is I do not get notifications on my phone, all turned on, just annoying and seems to be a common issue"

165,oliver hermanns,"April 21, 2020",3," Pretty basic functionality, but does the job. Two features would be great to have : 1) sharing of task list with other Google users (similar as calendar) 2) one overview list of all tasks"
166,Simcha Benabu,"March 20, 2020",5, This is an excellent app that helps me keep on top of everything I have to do. This app allows you to put due dates on you're tasks. It will remind you on the due date itself. I got in the habit of checking it everyday so it can be useful.
167,Vicken A,"March 28, 2020",4," I am a power-user of Tasks, both on the cell phone and within Google calendar on the desktop. Nicely synchronized. A pity Google does not invest to add some more functionality and user-friendliness."
168,Anne,"April 1, 2020",5, Straightforward and highly useful app for task reminders. One thing that would be nice would be to link subtasks to the major one so date/time sync automatically with major task date/time. Happy with this app 😊
169,Only One Hope Ministries,"April 13, 2020",3, It is still not easy enough to have a reminder to look at the task list.

It's a simple option you can put in the general settings.

I can even share the shopping list with members of my family and get suggestions. I recommend Tasks highly."
173,Trevor Corcoran,"March 21, 2020",4," So it's great, but I'm not sure of it's purpose? This is a slightly more advanced version of reminders from the calendar. It even asks you to import reminders from your calendar. In my opinion it's less of a hassle to just stick to calendar reminders than use a separate app."
174,Marisella Pacheco,"March 25, 2020",2," I was really disappointed. It looks great and you can sync all your life with Google but this list does not allow you to share lists or tasks with other people, to create collaborative lists either or to reorganize your tasks... I was hoping more but it's really basic."
175,Ran Oren,"March 24, 2020",4, I like it. But... Still some valuable features are missing. For example sync with MS To Do is not working for me. Automation of reminders copy and their deleting. Ability to select account during task creation and not by switching accounts before task creation. Looks like stability overall improved.
176,Jonathan Shaw,"March 24, 2020",5," Google finally got this app to achieve perfection. I had early versions that showed promise but wasn't impressed at that point.

178,polygloryholy,"April 1, 2020",4," The app is intuitive and efficient, especially the repeating tasks. A suggestion would be to allow subtasks for the task set to repeat, so that the subtasks would remain the same but be set as uncompleted the next time the task is due."
179,Paul Crozier,"April 1, 2020",4," Great app. I suggest adding color-coding options, so people can categorize their tasks and it is easier to break down the lists."

187,Glen Denning,"March 19, 2020",4," Great simple app for multiple lists on the go at the same time. Could do with a little bit more flexibility in relation to nested lists, and I wish there was also a stand alone Web interface as well as the calendar integration. All in all good stuff"
188,Kat Bernhardt,"March 23, 2020",4," This is an excellent app and the UI is extremely simple, which in my opinion is very tasteful. I would give this app 5 stars, but the tasks should have a collaborative option to add other google users to tasks set as reminders, much like how you can add collaborators in Google Keep."
189,Matt Dileonardi,"March 24, 2020",4," I absolutely love how much this has helped me organize my to do list, especially at work with it's synchronization to Gmail. I would give 5 stars if it had the ability to create shared task lists within gsuite to keep teams on the same page with the ongoing to-dos."
190,Michelle Weaver,"March 26, 2020",5," I love using this app to organize my day to day tasks and my master list of tasks. As someone with ADHD, I have to pre-plan my day so that I have a concrete process for each day, and so I don't forget to do things that need done!"

204,Rafael Sepulveda,"March 17, 2020",5, I love this app. It's a quick way to write a to do list without having to worry how to categorize the tasks. It becomes more convenient once you created the habit of using it. Highly recommend.
205,Jasveer Dhaliwal,"March 25, 2020",4, pretty good so far. great integration with other google apps. 4 stars because always possibilities to make an app like this better. Great to quickly add tasks while you're on the go to your to-do list
206,Ben Kittel,"April 1, 2020",5," I make checklists of what I need to do. I set due dates, reminders, and sub tasks. Helps me keep track of what needs to get done, prioritize, and stay focused. What more do you need from this app."
207,ferdia fagan,"April 4, 2020",5," I have tried loads of these kind of apps. This is all around the best. Able to sync with all devices, easy to use, clean, and to the point."
208,Benjamin Tibbetts,"April 4, 2020",4, An absolutely vital addition to the Google Suite. I found Gmail somewhat unusable before if i couldn't track tasks tied to emails i received. Great job making it functional and clean.
209,Andrew Dixon,"April 10, 2020",4, Great that it links with Google calendar. Like the simplicity. 4 stars simply because I would LOVE to be able to collapse a task where it has subtasks. This would just display all my major tasks I have listed for each list.
210,Kelly Carter,"April 13, 2020",2, Is the date for a repeating task when it will next be readded to my list or when it's next due or when I will next get a reminder? Why can't I reorder subtasks? Why can't subtasks have their own due date? Why is this app missing so many basics?
211,Caleb Anderson,"April 21, 2020",4, I wish that sharing tasks with others was easy to do without using google suite taskboard. It would be great to have immediate updates too... For personal view I think that this app is fantastic.
212,Kirk Henderson,"April 22, 2020",3," I like this app. Very powerful with Gmail integrations. Needs a swipe or other ready method to switch between Lists. Otherwise, tasks hidden and to cumbersome to see. Thank you"
213,Kapil E,"March 22, 2020",1," Sorry, but Google must be playing a trick on everyone by claiming this is an adequate replacement for Inbox+reminders. Either that or playing a trick on itself, thinking it's product decisions make any sense.

Either that or playing a trick on itself, thinking it's product decisions make any sense. I sure hope the project manager(s) in charge of all these decisions got the promotions they were shooting for, so they can move on and decide that Google Trips should be worsened combined into the assistant or something like that."
214,Debanik Moulick,"March 28, 2020",2," Lacks many essential features, Cant add images/ docs for reference. The tasks do not appear on callender app. There is no location based reminder. Not expected this from google!!"
215,Joe Moore,"March 28, 2020",5, I love the way it's so seamlessly integrates with Gmail and calendar. Only thing it seems to be lacking is the ability to share tasks with another person.
216,Amy Tatton-Brown,"March 27, 2020",3, Google hasn't bothered to put in some basic functionality like being able to search tasks or move tasks between lists. It's still useful because it syncs with other Google products and is easy to use.
217,kiara stewart,"March 29, 2020",5, Fairly simple. I use it because the tasks sync to the desktop version of google calendar. No problems with the app so far.
218,Pavan Kumar Peddibhotla,"April 24, 2020",3, This app is not of much use unless it has persistent reminder option. I would like to be reminded of a task at periodic intervals untill the task is complete
219,Derek P,"April 16, 2020",1, This app is useless if it doesn't communicate with the Google Calendar app on Android and the Google app on Android. This is already available when using Chrome on desktop.
220,Simon Björkman,"March 17, 2020",5," I love it for my projects, especially that you can keep several different ones at the same time. Great for structuring different projects and then thanks to it check out what's to be done and just go ahead and do it all."
221,aaron verjans,"March 24, 2020",3," Great simple awesome, I love simple! But done more functionality could be nice. Can't put Google drive docs or whatever in there 😅 But what it does, it does good. (Except when you have the side bar open in two windows. It will not update properly sometimes)"
222,Melanie Oldham,"March 29, 2020",5, I really like having a routine and with this app it's super easy. I love having a daily list that I set to reoccurring each day and also a weekly chore list.
223,Nancy W,"April 3, 2020",5," Great app for making grocery store lists, errand stops, things to do... Easy to use and easy to cross off the list. Highly recommended!"
224,MaxxD17,"April 5, 2020",5," Works great! Syncs with Google calendar, sends me notifications about when I need to get things done and has a satisfying animation when you compete a task!"
225,Jason Cheng,"April 10, 2020",4," I wish they would add common features such as priority labels and enable subtasks for recurring tasks. Otherwise, the app is great. Simple yet mostly effective."
226,Shivani Saini,"April 9, 2020",5, It's great and kind of enthusiastic. Because i can check the growth of my tasks by those completed bulletins and that's one of the best thing i like about this app.
227,Andrew Kunkel,"April 23, 2020",1, If I can't see the tasks in the widget in date order the widget is useless to me. The ability to see my tasks on the Android calendar would be a great help but I can't do that either.
228,Andrew Bickerton,"March 18, 2020",4," Pros: Tasks is nice and easy to use, quickly add new tasks setting due dates and reminders are appropriate 👍 Cons: does not integrate with calendar, so I can't see tasks I've got coming is when looking at appointments, need a central place I can see both!"
229,Thomas Prikakis,"March 31, 2020",4, Absolutely fantastic. I'd add quite a few features if I were part of googles team. The features given incorporate all across google as is. Outstanding.
230,Stephen Rosen,"March 30, 2020",5," No frills, only-what-you-need. It doesn't replace other task trackers, but it's a great tool for quick notes to self."
231,Jonathan Prince,"April 1, 2020",5, Very good and simple way of keeping things organised - particularly useful having it on the side of Google calendar on the web. Would be good to be able to reorder lists though
232,PS TEWARI,"April 6, 2020",4," I just love it. Exactly what i want. Simple app, least memory and quick writing. Don't need extra features for task listing."
233,Allan Fisher,"April 9, 2020",4," This app is the simplest and one of the best task managers. It can be used as a todo list, shopping list or any kind of list to get the work done."
234,Todd Bakken,"April 19, 2020",3, Good but could use Assistant Integration. I use it for my shopping list but there is no way to tell my Google Assistant to add things to my list.
235,Dmitri Powe,"April 15, 2020",5, Very efficient app. Easy to use and very effective task manager. Also intergrates well with other google apps which is always a plus for me.
236,Jesse Brundage,"March 18, 2020",4," This app needs to be able to share lists. Also needs to be able to combine separate lists easier. Gesture navigation to other lists would be excellent. Overall, works well for managing lists but could use some improvements."
237,Trevor Silwones,"March 18, 2020",5," I actually use this for work, play, chores and nearly everything else in my life. I work for Subaru as the Love-Encore Specialist here at my dealership and the ease and usefulness of Tasks helps me keep my appointments and follow up with clients in line and on time.

I work for Subaru as the Love-Encore Specialist here at my dealership and the ease and usefulness of Tasks helps me keep my appointments and follow up with clients in line and on time. I would recommend this app to anyone who needs to keep track of reminders or things to do. Also extremely useful for lists as well for shopping or wishlists."
238,Dimitri Ajazi,"April 2, 2020",4," Let the user change lists by tapping their list name which is displayed in a large font at the top of the app's screen. That would help make this a great app. Otherwise, for my needs it beats Google Keep."
239,Claudia,"March 22, 2020",4," Simple little app, BUT TRULY AMAZING.!! You can as many categories as you wish, tasks and detailed subtasks, Honestly it doesn't look like much, you'll be surprised at all the little things you can do with."
240,Dobromir Churov,"March 26, 2020",5, An overall very useful app. Let's you organise you schedule an easy process and allows you to keep track of your tasks. Only thing I am missing is the ability to set a reminder.
241,Violet Hunter,"April 1, 2020",4," Just getting started on this. Feeling very organised now! Turns out it sends reminder notifications automatically, could perhaps do with more flexibility of reminder settings"
242,Adrian Thorne,"April 13, 2020",2," Clear and simple but the inability to search for overdue tasks, or get a clear day-by-day view is a real pain."
243,Pedro Gordo,"April 14, 2020",4," There seems to be an issue when you edit a recurring task, after it sas triggered several times, but everything good otherwise."
244,self studyign,"April 20, 2020",5, Best app for students especially really user friendly and minimalism is great and the dark theme is one of the greatest feature and for getting all your work done you really need a todo list which will be with you everytime.
245,Jill Rei,"April 22, 2020",4," Good solid app, only thing is in the widget i dont know how the order of each task was chosen...its a bit random..wish it was put in the order of time top down"
246,Raychill Z,"April 23, 2020",5," Easy to use, straightforward and completed task feature shows progress... Different than other list apps because it's connected to my mail and calendar."
247,Caspar Gutsche,"March 26, 2020",4," I really like it, particularly that you can create recurring tasks. The only thing that I really would like is that it is possible to share task lists so I can collaborate with my coworkers"
248,Jon Vance,"March 14, 2020",4," Great app! I like how it syncs between the PC and my phone, and how you can add comments and due dates. Sometimes it doesn't work quite like I'd expect and I wish it had better sorting capabilities."
249,David Stephenson,"March 21, 2020",4, Tasks helps me to stay organized daily. I like that it integrates with Calendar on my PC. I'd like to be able to organize a day's list by dragging and dropping. Priorities and/or color coding would be nice also. Nice app.
250,Rob Buhl,"March 18, 2020",3, This app is great except one thing. My tasks stay in the past. They don't automatically move forward to the current day. Noone sets a task for the past. 5 stars if this is remedied!
251,Yukyo B,"March 21, 2020",3," The app is great, but it would be nice to be able to see the time each task is scheduled in the list itself, rather than having to open each one of them individually, when sorted by date."
252,Jay D,"March 22, 2020",5," I enjoy the convenience tasks adds to my schedule. With the calendar feature I am notified promptly of upcoming events, appointments, etc. Without a fuss. Google tasks is effortless, user friendly and should be on everyone's list of daily use apps."
253,Nathan Bullen,"March 28, 2020",4," Really great, love being able to see my tasks alongside Gmail on the desktop. I'd really love a unified list view to show all the tasks across all my lists!"
254,Michael Witherspoon,"March 27, 2020",4," Well-designed, good integration, easy to use. I would give it a 5 if some display issues like showing sub-tasks at the same level as the tasks they support were improved."
255,Manil Hendrick,"April 1, 2020",5, Clean and easy to use. Fits my use case of just jotting down tasks to perform. The integration with google calendar is also nice.
256,Pierre van Wyk,"April 1, 2020",1, Poor idea for a task list. It's very primitive compared to Wunderlist. I can't even change the widget theme from light apparently on my version of Android.
257,Andrew Magana,"April 2, 2020",5," Love it. Simple app with tasks. I do wish these tasks would aggregate to my calendar of choice (Gmail calendar), but it works so nicely."
258,Richard Garrett,"April 4, 2020",4," Great app, it would be awesome if it was easier to move the tasks around a little easier, like the check box items in Google Keep"
259,Deedee Park,"April 12, 2020",4, I love Google Tasks. Use it for all my lists. I would only like the sub tasks to show under the main task on the widget like it does in the app itself. Other than that i have no complaints
260,E Lee Hammontree,"April 13, 2020",5," Nice quick entry. Integrates nicely with G calendar, with good functionality and notifications. No recovery if inadvertent delete of a list category--it happens."
261,Arkadiusz Lipiarz,"April 12, 2020",4," I would rate 5 stars if this was a part of Google Calendar - for me makes no sense switching between those two apps, I would like to manage my tasks similarly to web version."
262,Asif A. Ali,"April 17, 2020",5, I use it from getting simple tasks done to organizing my groceries list. It's Simple. Light. And Well- integrated into gmail to quickly add tasks.
263,Chinmaya KN,"April 17, 2020",4," Clean and simple. Although, the ability to show/hide the subtasks instead of them piling under the main task in the task list screen would be helpful"
264,TheoFreestyler797,"April 16, 2020",5, Great :) I use the desktop version. This is a great top up for when I'm not at my laptop. Just wished I got into the habit of using it more.
265,Monica Murphy,"April 17, 2020",1, Why can I not sort ALPHABETICALLY? The older version allowed this and it was awesome! New phone would not transfer the old version. UGH! I went from loving this app to HATING it!
266,Shahid Pasha,"March 22, 2020",2," This app needs add functionality to organize tasks in terms of priority eg. a priority matrix view. Also, needs to be fully integrated into GSuite to be able to assign tasks to other users and map them to other apps."
267,Mike Alleman,"March 22, 2020",4, Start here. App calendar integration is the best. Having no tags or categories is a miss. Having no search in the app is a miss. Those misses are small compared to the calendar hit.
268,Adrs Layton,"March 19, 2020",5," I like this app a lot more than several others I have checked. However, I think it would be better if it would be a simpler way to add tasks (e.g. not having to change screens as much). Thank you for asking, Dinna"
269,Nicholas Jozwiak,"March 26, 2020",5, Simple and easy to use. The simplicity is actually what makes it better. It also integrates with your Google calendar if you are viewing from your computer which is super nice.
270,Omar Pereyra,"April 13, 2020",4, Solid app to keep track of the to do list . It's a big plus that it's in the Google ecosystem. I need to use it more and will update my rating as needed
271,Shaik Hussain,"April 15, 2020",5, Very useful Application for noting down anything that comes to your mind so that you cannot miss or forget any items to be done on day to day basis
272,Jacob Johnston,"April 23, 2020",4, I wish they had features like any do where you can drag items between today tomorrow later and the nebulous someday but all in all it's nice and the integration with Google calendar makes it my top pick.
273,Karishma Pereira,"April 22, 2020",4," Easy to use, integrates with Gmail, but still doesn't show tasks that have a due date on mobile calendar, just desktop view."
274,LINDA HATFIELD,"March 16, 2020",5, The app really helps me organize and stay on task. I love the ability to schedule recurring tasks. Being able to set up various tasks groups is also very helpful.
275,warmastergorwrath Sheila,"March 21, 2020",5," I like that underneath the titles I can add subtasks, which is convenient and assists with organization. I love that I can set reminders for each individual task and sub task. Would be lovely if I can add pictures to quickly remind me what my task is."
276,William Moon,"March 19, 2020",3," This is a good app that I like for productivity, however I also have the app on my mac and it doesn't sync to it... in the past it's worked but then sometimes stops syncing which is frustrating."
277,Sebetha Orlovetz,"March 22, 2020",4," Wish I could leave like a 4.8...love everything about it with 2 small exceptions. Upon opening app, I would like to see ALL lists instead of most recently opened. And I would prefer completed subtasks to stay with the parent task instead of moving down."
278,Bryan Sellards,"March 21, 2020",5," It the way you can check out all of your account to get into the phone safe and get back with you and your account I wish to receive these notifications to get before, I'm new on this device an it was the only way you could not be able to make sure thanks"
279,Kim Reimer,"March 23, 2020",5," A simple app for organizing my life. I use it daily. I will suggest a few improvements. 1. The ability to change the order of the lists, and 2. The ability to copy items to another list, not just move them."
280,Felix Ulmanu,"March 29, 2020",5, Fantastic for organising my work! Just the amount of simplicity I need - it doesn't need to be boggled down with more features.
281,Matthew Alan Thyer,"March 31, 2020",4," Great but, a few features I wish it had. 1) List sharing at least between Google accounts 2) Better more consistent integration with Google home products"
282,Shuaib Mohammad,"April 5, 2020",4, Really like the simplicity of it and integration with Google. Lacks sorting lists based on what I want.
283,Naomi Tayler,"April 14, 2020",2, Hopeless. No way to sort the widget in a sensible way. No way to make repeated tasks. Unless you also use it on a PC don't bother.
284,Anne Todd,"March 16, 2020",3," Pretty good app, i like having it acŕoss platforms. Would like it better if (1) could set priorities by importance and (2) it notified me of scheduled tasks from all lists instead of only default list"
285,Danny K,"March 17, 2020",2," Would be a 4 star app BUT I'm still using the Samsung Reminder app because Google Tasks still does not support location based reminders. And something that no app has is multiple locations (i.e. remind me at any Target store, etc.)."
286,Savannah Throop,"March 22, 2020",3, The app is really great at creating tasks and lists but I wish I could see the tasks on mobile Google calendars and I wish I could share tasks easily with other users with Google tasks. Would make the app 100% better.
287,Rob J,"March 20, 2020",4, Google Tasks is my favorite app for getting organized. Seamless synching from mobile app to desktop. Clean user friendly format. The only flaw is that you cannot arrange lists in alphabetical order
288,Alex Tharman,"March 25, 2020",5," It's great having the tasks sync across multiple devices and being able to put them in the Calendar app in one form or another. I wish there was more creativity allowed, such as colors, etc. though."
289,Kaleab Melkie,"April 2, 2020",5, I really love this app. I just wish it had an official desktop app or a standalone web domain for access on my PC. (Accessing it just as an add-on inside Drive or Gmail is a little weird)
290,Thomas Raymond,"April 9, 2020",2," Useful with Gmail/calendar integration, especially on desktop. Could have better calendar integration. Sorely missing rated tasks and easier organizing."
291,Rick Ossendrijver,"April 12, 2020",5, Very clean and useful app. Simple to add tasks and easy to set reminders. Integration with Google Calendar is convenient!
292,Morgan Hewitt,"April 13, 2020",5, Apps works great! There's a third party app which can access these lists for MacOS which also works well also. Highly recommended.
293,Crystal Paws,"April 21, 2020",4," This is very good, clean looking simple app, it's a good organizer, but it does lack history."
294,Prasanta kumar Deo,"April 24, 2020",3, Please add alarm feature near every task so that a person can know it easily. It will be better if you can add features like TickTick has. These are really necessary
295,Rofayda Solaiman,"April 23, 2020",1," Really bad (Android version) 1-poor help guide 2-""Repeat"" can be set only while creating task 3-""Repeat"" has start date and no end date! Are you serious!"
296,Tyler Ohlemacher,"March 28, 2020",5, This app definitely gets the job done! I am torn between using this and Google keep. Both help me make to-do lists.
297,D Raf,"April 7, 2020",5, Awesome. Using it to set scheduled reminders. Dings each time. Your past self telling your future self to get to it. Very useful.
298,N. D.,"April 3, 2020",3," I think it is a marvelous app with great potential, but I think that you should be able to share lists, and make it available as a website."
299,Rosshee,"April 9, 2020",5," The best task application in the entire Google play store,what's important is that it's linked to my Google Account! Good job Google and I forget It has a dark mode!"
300,Alex Murtagh,"April 8, 2020",3," Flimsy UX: No capability to colour code lists/identify them with icona, create a full screen view on desktop, change background to check you are viewing the right list, etc"
301,Esteban Perez,"April 18, 2020",4, Great except I would like to see an overall task list that combines my categories. I work between different categories in my day and it would be useful to sort by due date overall.
302,Morris-Ken Hines,"April 23, 2020",5, I love this app for not only making list but I use one of the list for things I did and want to remember at the end of the day that was not on any list.
303,Алексей Ярощук,"March 12, 2020",4," Good simple task manager. One crucial feature missing though, is a possibility to reorder task lists - they always remain in the same order they were originally created. Please improve this."
304,Julien Goulet,"March 18, 2020",4," I love that it integrates with chrome. I wish you could move tasks around while it is in the ""date"" mode and I wish it would integrate with Google home."
305,C,"March 20, 2020",5, Syncs with Gmail is best feature. Maybe I missed it but sort alphabetical and better search list features would be good next step. Alarm for task might be nice too. Overall I like it.
306,E C,"March 20, 2020",5, Great for having multiple lists across multiple devices. Also able to edit the same list from other devices! Would highly recommend for grocery lists and every day to do lists!
307,Sloan Cooper,"March 25, 2020",4," It's quite good but is sorely missing a ""search"" feature. ""Search (find)"" is functional on the PC Windows platform and needed desperately on the Android."
308,Dave Connal,"March 31, 2020",3," Single tasks work really well, however, repeated tasks don't repeat, they disappear after you mark the first instance complete."
309,M Faizal Bhd,"April 3, 2020",5," easy to use. simple design. suggestion 1. font format eg bold italic etc 2. when making a list, have text and tick seperated."
310,Matt Kern,"April 12, 2020",4," The interface could be better, especially when breaking down subtasks, would like to have individual due dates."
311,Brian Thelen,"April 20, 2020",3, The subtasking feature is poor and really needs beefing uo. In addition the showing of historical tasks on calendar when you choose to show them is bad. Only want my current tasks not every single one from past showing up even when done
312,Becky Ballinger,"April 19, 2020",4, It would be great if I used it regularly. I just have not trained myself to use it. But having watched ted talks on learning anything in 20 hrs I think I will give it a try and at least attempt it.
313,Liza Davis,"April 24, 2020",5," I am a list maker and like how I can check things off with Tasks, but can go back and see what I have completed!"
314,jena jena,"March 19, 2020",3, I do love this app and use it. The only hiccup is that it won't flip to the landscape mode so I can use it with my tablet and wifi keyboard. This is extremely frustrating! Can you fix this?????
315,Patricia Fluker,"March 18, 2020",5, Love this app! I use it whenever I need to create a shopping list. It is especially handy when there are several stores involved. It saves me time and gas!
316,Jeremy Haynes,"March 18, 2020",5, Simple and functional. Easy to organize tasks with sub tasks and set up reminders at certain times. This app works for me because I often forget about what I need to get done.
317,Cassie Cooley,"March 26, 2020",3, The only issue I've had is that it doesn't remind me when I ask it to. I have to open the app and then all the reminders all happen at the same time...even if they are in the past.
318,Hong Roach,"April 5, 2020",5," Hi, lovely developer can add the ""vibration"" feature when we tick on the ""done task"". It will feels like more satisfying."
319,Veronica Edwards,"April 11, 2020",5, Love this app! I have multiple lists. Love that I can access from PC or phone.
320,Christopher Chew,"April 15, 2020",4, If it can upgrade to set the goals day by days would be better. If didn't completed today then the task will automatically go to the next day until u done it
321,Cole Kleinwolterink,"April 20, 2020",4," I'm a ""to do"" list person so I love the app! The only feature I would like to see added is a way to view all my tasks from all my lists in 1 list."
322,Fostur Stanley,"April 21, 2020",5," Easy to use, fantastic way to keep track of tasks, and a great way to stay out of the dog house with your significant other!"
323,Vas Littlecrow Wojtanowicz,"March 23, 2020",5," This app has come a long way. I really enjoy having the repeating tasks and the ability to synchronize across devices. The only thing this app needs to make it even better, as integration with Google Assistant."
324,Isha Geurtsen,"March 22, 2020",4, Good task manager. I would like the ability to reset the completed status of a task list. So that i can reuse recurring tasks more easily.
325,Katie-Beth Trout,"March 20, 2020",3, I really like the concept of Google tasks. The only downfall is that you cannot see your upcoming tasks. You can't look ahead to the next day to see what you have going on or get ahead.
326,Wolfgang Fechter,"March 30, 2020",3, would like to ask for an improvement with google tasks app. The view stays in portrait even when I turn my tablet (Sony Xperia Z3 tablet) to landscape position. Could a landscape view layout like in Google mail app be introduced?
327,Rucsandra Moldovan,"March 30, 2020",4, I would like to have subtasks collapse as an option. Would also be nice to have the standalone app on PC/desktop rather than only the integrated version with Gmail or Calendar.
328,PC CUBED,"April 9, 2020",4, Good and useful app. Cleanly made. Can be a little buggy with the widget function but other than that is great.
329,Donna Arcaro Serratore,"April 14, 2020",4, So far so good. I just wish I could change the notification sound and snooze the task (for 10 min or an hour)
330,Hilary Wong,"April 16, 2020",5, I like it's simple design and how you can look at the number of tasks you've already completed in a separate tab
331,Melissa Hammond,"April 20, 2020",5, Best app ever! Keeps me on track. definitely would recommend. No annoying ads! Love love love this app!
332,Marcus McClure Jones,"April 20, 2020",5, Very helpful so far is there a built in alarm function aswell I.e. take your x tablet at 10 am for instance and you get a message and sound flash up 5 minutes before ?
333,fabio brocco,"March 17, 2020",5," It's perfect to write down quick tasks. You can even input a time to complete each task, so you can prioritize each task you have"
334,Kayla Finnin,"March 20, 2020",4, It would be great if my Google calendar app would show my Tasks on the calendar like the online desktop version. I've switched to using all Google products for keeping me organized and they're great.
335,Sandra Bowman,"March 18, 2020",4, Overall great app. Integration with Google calendar works well. Would be nice to have a drag and drop from on day to another.
336,Maheen Siddiqui,"March 25, 2020",5," I wish I could copy my tasks from this to google calender, instead of the other way around. Or at least make it a two way thing? Other than that, I LOVE this app. I use it both at work and at home! 💕💕"
337,Anand Singh,"March 25, 2020",2," First - There is not option to sort tasks according to time (there is one for date but it does not sort according to time of the same day) Second - I manually rearrange my tasks but when they are auto-created the next day (repeating tasks), they lose the order and there I go manuallg arranging them ...Full ReviewFirst - There is not option to sort tasks according to time (there is one for date but it does not sort according to time of the same day) Second - I manually rearrange my tasks but when they are auto-created the next day (repeating tasks), they lose the order and there I go manuallg arranging them again, daily!"
338,Kim Nguyen,"March 31, 2020",4," Useful but more options please, like different types of reminders, colour coding and better ability to check and find completed tasks."
339,Kevin Nieves,"April 16, 2020",4," Clean and Simple, this app does what it does I just wish there was a little more connectivity with Gmail."
340,Jason Aschebrook,"April 24, 2020",4, Great app except one thing. It would be even better if you could share list with others in your household or teammates
341,Pear Only's,"April 24, 2020",4, really good for manageing task. Also a good sync acroos device. Wish the website version can open directly( no need to open from calendar)
342,Tarek Azam,"April 7, 2020",3, Adding a location-based tasks and reminders is a very welcomed addition. Integration with Google maps would be very helpful and nice.
343,Asif Ahmed,"March 14, 2020",4," Having a simple UI it's easy to keep the to do in a organized manner and get the tasks done consistently. However, hope for some extra features added like sharing to do with multiple accounts or move/copy to do from one account to another."
344,Bryce Hong,"March 17, 2020",3," Basic but does the job. No google calendar integration on Android, but it does work on the desktop. Only use this if you can't use better alternatives."
345,Alrighty Then,"March 25, 2020",4," Simple, and supported by Google. I would like if it recorded the date the task was completed and the date the task was created."
346,Robert Dill,"March 26, 2020",4," Easy to keep multiple lists. Features I'd like are selective history, ability to export or save, and line spacing reduced to allow more items on one viewing page."
347,Matthew Bridges,"March 27, 2020",5, One of the few tasks app that actually works. Lots of flexibility with due dates and lists.
348,Vanessa Huntington,"March 27, 2020",3," I just started using it early today. I'm not big on the list option ..no way to itemize, or maybe I haven't discovered that feature yet. 03/27/2020"
349,Chen Semo,"March 30, 2020",3, There's a lot of good tasks apps. Expected this one to communicate with Google Assistant... Or reminders. It doesn't.
350,Adam Wurst,"March 31, 2020",5," It's a quick, does what it needs to, integrates with calendar tool. Thanks again, G!"
351,Ken Jones,"March 30, 2020",5," Simple, easy to use. Quicker and easier than using the calendar for simple tasks."
352,Mansour Guirguis,"April 2, 2020",4, Great app lacking 2 points I would like to see future tasks so I could plan a head. To be able to share tasks with group with control of task by admin
353,Geoffrey Jones,"April 9, 2020",1, what about sharing the list and collaborating with others? from my understanding you use to have this functionality but removed it. very disappointing.
354,Yaahn Hunter,"April 13, 2020",5," I really like Google Task and it's integration inside Google Calendar. Google Task needs a ""MY DAY VIEW"" that Summerizes them by ""DAY"" and ""WEEK""."
355,Gage Smith,"March 23, 2020",4, Simplistic and easy to use just wish that there was a bit better integration with Google assistant. The difference between reminders and tasks are vague.
356,Nia P,"March 27, 2020",3," It's a nice app, but could you please add a kind of ""daily planner"" so all todays task would appear in one place? If you also add todays events and task widget, would be awesome. Thanks"
357,James McDonald,"March 29, 2020",5, I use Google Tasks very heavily to help organize my life. Very useful app. Almost can't live without it.
358,Rachel Wheeler,"April 4, 2020",5, I love the clean simplicity of this app. It does everything I need and no more and is very intuitive.
359,Lena Tatarinova,"April 14, 2020",5, Perfect for everyday and recurring tasks. Very user-friendly interface.
360,Harry Hoare,"April 18, 2020",4, Simple to use - one place to keep thoughts organized with different categories that you can make up.
361,Martin Hargreaves,"March 14, 2020",4," Great, but no notification about missed deadlines (i.e. when a deadline occurs when the phone is turned off, then it would be nice to see a notification when the phone is next turned on)"
362,Angela Sulfaro-Menconi,"March 18, 2020",4, Helps me keep all my tasks in order. It would be helpful to have a feature that shows you all your tasks from all your task lists at once.
363,David Quaal,"March 19, 2020",4," Would like to be able to print the task list and search the task list. Otherwise, works great/syncs well with PC Google Tasks. Reordering is easy."
364,sashin smith,"March 18, 2020",3, Very basic app. Easy to use but lacks greatly in appearance. No effort was made for a calendar or different colours for different tasks or anything.
365,Ryan Mutton,"March 19, 2020",2, It's just not a great interface. Too many taps to add a task to a specific date. Reminders fire on weird channels-will it be my calendar or keep or assistant?!?
366,Luke Tellefson,"March 23, 2020",4," It's good but would be nice to have more options with widget. Also can't seem add from Google assistant, adds a reminder instead (which is well confusing)"
367,GURU PRASATH,"April 1, 2020",5," As usual , very smooth and sleek UI and overall no bugs or glitches .Would highly recommend"
368,Christopher Lettie,"April 1, 2020",5, Life changing simplicity. Use and be amazed. Thank you for helping me with my ADHD!
369,Clyde Rockwood,"April 6, 2020",4," It is a good app for keeping track of my to do list and I can rename it, add and remove from it. It is better than a notepad."
370,Craig Miniter,"April 13, 2020",1," Overall, not bad. Would be ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ if the widget automatically sorted by date rather then only being able to view ""my order"" order."
371,Staffan Simmons,"April 9, 2020",3, Good basic functions. I like to be able to select and print todays chores from the main list though. @Developers: will you add this?
372,Andrea Coombs,"April 15, 2020",5," Simple UX, a nice UI, and a gratifying check mark animation. I have four lists and together with Monday, I stay on task. Best I've used."
373,Kris Duhaime,"April 22, 2020",3, I like the concept of this app is aggregation to Google calendar. It would be nice if the O.K. Google assistant could put it to use.
374,Ajaysinh Zala,"April 14, 2020",2," Checkboxes for subtasks,. And the task made for later date shouldnt show in my screen tiday itself. View all should be a different option."
375,Rickvian Aldi,"April 22, 2020",3," it lack of feature and seems like first software to do list project, add more feature that support daily use case please! Please integrate android calendar soon. i really looking forward for the better version"
376,Cameron Thorne,"March 16, 2020",4," Really find the app useful. There are some missing features that would be nice (e.g. end date for recurring tasks), but not bad overall."
377,Luis Mario Agreda Agreda,"March 23, 2020",3," When I want to receive the task in a certain hour, there is no function to quickly time it in the afternoon, night, morning, you need to manually do it"
378,Tomasz Milewski,"March 25, 2020",4," Functional, but i found 2 things that are annoying: 1. I can't move my task to another list when task repeats 2. When task repeats I can't add subtask and vice versa"
379,Tom Bartlett,"March 26, 2020",3," Good, but the lack of Google Assistant is very surprising and feels like a very big gap. It's a convenience that I miss from Apple"
380,Gilbert Moreno,"March 27, 2020",2, Wish there was a way to add emails to Google Calendar directly from an email in Gmail. Tasks and Google Calebdar seem a bit redundant.
381,T.J. Baddley,"April 3, 2020",2, I just started using Google Tasks today. So far so good. I like it. I need to use it more to give it a fair rating. I will update it as I go. I am liking it so far. Thank you Google.
382,Barry Raphael,"April 5, 2020",4, Simple and effective. Not as robust as GQueues but easy to use.

384,Haley Brown,"April 13, 2020",5, So easy and intuitive; love that it syncs gmail so things can be added from the web as well. Fav task tracker
385,Clive Sinclair,"April 8, 2020",1, Come on Google. Can't add a task using assistant? You can't move tasks from one list to another. No priorities. Half baked app.
386,Daniel Lyman,"March 12, 2020",3," I loved Wunderlist, and just wish Google would get somewhere like that. I use Keep, but it isn't great for tasks, maybe they should combine both..."
387,Brad Donohoo,"March 22, 2020",3, Pretty good. Would give five stars if there was a way to sort the tasks in the widget by date due (hard to believe this isn't already an option).
388,Dysfunctional gangsta,"March 23, 2020",5," The is a great app, and it helps keep me organized. There are minor kinks but nothing that takes away from the purpose of the app"
389,Arian Navabi,"March 24, 2020",4, Seems great but it could be a bit advanced with more options. Also it's only linked with calendar on desktop but not on android which is not pleasant.
390,Janet Cormack,"March 31, 2020",5, Only used it a few days but send to work fine. My husband and I can add to the same list so that's handy
391,Jen Hobden,"March 31, 2020",4, Good basic list-making. Would be very helpful to be able to lists share with others.
392,Doug Maloney,"April 2, 2020",4, Great app. Just perfectly uncomplicated. Would get 5 stars if it supported labels or hashtags in a similar way to google keep
393,nikita sawant,"April 6, 2020",4, Its almost perfect. But it would have been great if it has timer and statistics.
394,Earl Swalm,"April 10, 2020",4, I've tried many types of reminder apps but I come back to this being the most used one. Good job.
395,Robbie Yangco,"April 15, 2020",3," Please include the option for the task desired or completed. Optional, of course, but this would be me use task alot more"
396,Brian Price,"April 18, 2020",2, It's a decent and simple task list app but it lacks the ability to create/update the list between multiple users.
397,WG Peterson,"April 16, 2020",3, I would like this app to work better and stank open in the background. I would like an email reminder using Gmail if I have tasks that are past due
398,Christy Johnson,"April 20, 2020",5, Best way to stay on task and not forget what u needed to do before. Simple and easy without so many instructions that you're lost before starting the task. Thanks Google
399,Amy Hall,"March 18, 2020",5, Very handy. I was able to stop using and losing postit notes and little scraps of paper with my reminders scribbled on them. I like the check box function for completed items :-)
400,Alessa Gillespie,"March 27, 2020",5," I just switched from a different to-do app and I'm fascinated by the simplicity. Love the app, easy, comfortable yet very efficient."

403,Vikram Bhavsar,"April 7, 2020",5, As Simple as it can get. Not too complex yet provides time and date settings for setting up deadlines.
404,Paul Szypiotko,"April 8, 2020",4, Love that it auto-pulls reminders from google calendar without deleting it would be cool if Tasks could also appear on calendar in some form.

406,Glen Chen,"April 10, 2020",4, Simple to use. Would love to see a Kanban layout option and color labels to highlight different tasks.
407,Paul Buller,"April 17, 2020",4, Generally good. Very simple. Some extra features might be nice.
408,Carrie Allmon,"April 20, 2020",4," It works very well, and it'd be a great feature if color-coding was added!"
409,Steve Miller,"April 24, 2020",3, I use the reminders on Google Calendar all the time so how or why does this not sync up to that otherwise it's useless having this.....
410,Christopher Ismay,"March 16, 2020",5," Excellent app, perfect for having multiple lists and syncing them across devices. For an OCD guy like me, it's bang on."
411,Rob McGuire,"March 20, 2020",3, Recurring tasks don't really work: Can't see or modify a recurring tasks until an instance is due. Can't share or collaborate on lists.
412,Nancy Ogilvie,"March 18, 2020",4, I rely on tasks to keep me focused. It's easy to use and helps me stay on track. I do wish there was a way to list tasks for a day in order of priority.
413,Neville Bezzina,"March 30, 2020",5, I've been using Tasks for a decade with Gmail and calendar and I like how deeply it's integrated with those tools.

415,Sebastian Milhas,"April 13, 2020",4," It's cool, I think the subtasks could be better implemented. Besides that, it would be nice to have the feature of task status."
416,ashfaque alam,"April 18, 2020",3, Could have been even better with dash board where people can have snap shop of the total task / Alos weekly and monthly planner can be integrated...thanks

420,Nitin Bhopale,"March 21, 2020",4, Wonderful yet simple App provides all regular features required to note down tasks with time and simple interface. I would have given five stars if there was a way for prioritizing. I think it will be added some day
421,Carlo Ciccomascolo,"March 21, 2020",3, Google Task is a slick app to manage tasks. It would be 4 stars if there was a standalone app in Chrome (not just the integrate app in Calendar) and five of it was integrated with Google Assistant.

434,Michal Przybylowicz,"March 28, 2020",1," I hate this app. Why on Earth I am forced to use this app instead of just using calendar app and add tasks there like on desktop? Seriously I hate in this case the ""there is an app for that"" approach. Please integrate this into the calendar app!"
435,Freddie Sanchez,"March 28, 2020",5, Great to keep task in line without paper. You can even do subtask which is amazing.
436,Richard,"April 5, 2020",3, Get its job done Needs to have the option to snooze reminders from their pop-up notifications Would appreciate it if we are able to navigate by swiping (like in Microsoft To-Do)

438,Elizabeth Cashman,"April 13, 2020",3," I like that you can add sub-tasks, and I would like to add Sub-sub-tasks. These sub-sub-tasks make me feel more productive. I also like that you can set a finish date."

447,Jonathan Cothran,"March 23, 2020",4, Clean interface inside the app. I would like to see task on mobile calender similar to web or desktop. I would also like to combine features between keep and task to have a unified application.
448,Melinda Urquhart,"March 17, 2020",5, I love this app! The only thing missing for me is multiple levels for sub tasks. You can only create one level of sub tasks.
449,Yakup Albekoglu,"March 18, 2020",4," It is nice and simple, but doesn't integrate with Google calendar on the mobile version as well as on the computer."
450,Randy Shaver,"March 23, 2020",4, Why did this functionality disappear for so many years? Nice to have it back 👍. Still not sure if transfers over to other apps well for the reminders I use. Should know soon.

460,Judge Concepcion,"March 13, 2020",4," So far so good. Eventually, implementing labels, and/or tags would help in further categorizing tasks."
461,Jeff Steybe,"March 22, 2020",3," I can not seem to re-order tasks with a category,or the categories themselves. In a previous version I could."

467,Mark Piggott,"April 17, 2020",5, Simple & perfect. Just what is needed and no feature bloat.
468,Jack Olson,"April 19, 2020",5," Love the app, how it would be better if the text was larger. At least an option. Thanz"
469,Carey Reid,"April 17, 2020",5, Would like to input additonal dates when missed oringinal without deleting. Color coding would make this app more accessible for busy people to complete tasks.

I may keep it for the quick items, but for any serious task management it's a bit of a bust. 2/20/2020 Updated comments: You can create repeating tasks, but once you complete one the first time you can't see it in the task list view until the next day due actually arrives. You can see future repeats if you use agenda calendar view on the web, however; you can't hide completed tasks in the agenda view. Also, you can't filter out individual task lists on the web agenda view (all or nothing). My biggest issue is you can't set a priority level on a task. I try and use the time of day to set priorities, but that's a bit clumsy. I'm retired now and I only need to use it for personal stuff. No way I could use this for professional purposes.

So satisfying to check things off and I can find them in the completed tasks."

Please fix this."

1122,Howard King,"February 3, 2020",5," The app looks good. I'm hoping to hat it can fill my needs. One thing for sure is that it needs a robust widget that can let you view all your task in one screen. Allow you to add new items, and check off completed. Then this will compete with the Samsung task /reminder app."

1130,Arjun Narayan,"February 20, 2020",3, This can be a lot better. It needs to have calendar integration in mobile... Not just desktop.

1224,Frank Harper,"January 27, 2020",5," It helps me Get Things Done, I love it! Thank you Google Tasks team. On the web side, i would like to have a separate app, rather than having to go into Gmail where I can become distracted by other things."
1225,Logan Ward,"February 17, 2020",4," Great for simple task management across multiple devices. One task per entry, or subtasks under a bigger project, due dates, add details under task title. I wish it integrated more with the Notes app, Gmail, and Google Calendar."
1226,Tirelo Kooagile,"February 10, 2020",3," The Tasks app is good but if it could automatically link a sub-task with its task, and share the same date etc. it would be even better over having to do the same thing twice. Also, if the app could please sync to the calendar!"
1227,Richard Oswin,"February 18, 2020",5, Google's UI is what makes it easy and more creative for us to use these apps for long time. The most productive app for planning and scheduling. However you have to do the work properly in the right time :-)
1228,Andrew Phelts,"February 12, 2020",5," Incredibly easy, smooth and fast in the use. Great user experience. But I'm not surprised about that, I've personally had the exact same feeling in every other Google App. Love you guys. Thanks!"
1229,Joseph Mooney,"February 13, 2020",2," This app has one really irritating flaw in the UX. When you edit a task, the button position you'd think would be 'save' - bottom right - is actually the button to mark the task as complete. Instead, to save the task you need to use the back button. Please fix!"
1230,Shanna Muehe,"February 27, 2020",3," the app is simple to use, which is nice, but it would be extremely helpful if you could swipe left/right between different lists instead of having to open the menu (which you cannot swipe open) and select a different list every. single. time."
1231,Budget Innovation,"March 4, 2020",5," I've used this app for months and it's next to faultless. The only improvement I can suggest is to be able to enter a task and change the category without having to close and reopen. Other than that, it serves all my needs."
1232,Himanshu Chawla,"March 10, 2020",3," App interface is great but it does not have alarms and full screen reminders. Due to this, one has to always open the app and keep seeing it inside the app. The notifications are too small to be noticed. It can have, export tasks as reminders option."
1233,Selim Evin,"April 12, 2020",5, Just what I needed. Easy and efficient.
1234,Abi Gallagher,"April 16, 2020",4, App doesn't work in landscape on phone or tablet.
1235,Kierron Kinley,"February 8, 2020",5," Simple, clean, allows me to create simple lists for things like groceries, to-do lists, reminders etc. I can tick off things I've done too. The widget is also fantastic. A MUST HAVE!"
1236,Katherine Shotts,"February 11, 2020",4," I like it. However, I find it difficult to add a reminder from Gmail to Tasks. Sometimes can find the option, sometimes not. I want to seamlessly add a task from Gmail and from Google calendar."
1237,Kelly,"February 16, 2020",5," I use this app all the time, primarily for a to-do list but also for a few others. Quick & easy process to add/remove items and switch between lists. My only request would be the ability to share lists between other users +/- shared updating capability."
1238,Kohl Dybdahl,"February 13, 2020",4, Easy to use. Main tasks and subtasks that remind you when they are due. Its rewarding to complete tasks. Allows for multiple task sheets and can be accessed on computer or phone at any time. Yes please. I wish there was an option to make titles.
1239,Yaneury Fermin,"February 20, 2020",4," Really good app. The only feature that I think is missing is seeing all the tasks for all your lists in one view. At the moment, you have to switch lists to see everything you're working on for the day."
1240,J O,"February 17, 2020",3, Helpful but could do a lot more. Would love to have recurring tasks populate each set interval rather than just showing only the next scheduled task. Having categories and dates tasks were marked as completed would also be incredibly useful.
1241,arif hari a,"February 21, 2020",3," if only there's a way to create hierarchical (indented) outlines.. to better organized by category.. this is major features that Google Tasks missing and need to be implemented in the next update, like MLO have been implement since long time ago..."
1242,Arianna Iliff,"February 24, 2020",4," A good simple app. Being able to nest tasks and have multiple lists is helpful. Wish I could color code tasks, and I dont understand how to make tasks recur. Glad to keep using it though, I'm sure there will be updates."
1243,Dave Dubois,"February 28, 2020",5," I suck at traditional ""to do"" lists. This makes it so easy as I've got it displayed to the side when my Google mail is open. It's convenient and the app on my phone is easy and accessible. A+"
1244,Robertas Šefleris,"February 29, 2020",3, Having a widget on screen f to see all tasks is one of basics for thos type of app. But after using quick add (+) whole phone freezes. only way to fix it is to clear recent apps.. going into the app is pointless because you can just a simple notes app instead
1245,Bharat Mallapur,"February 29, 2020",4, Great app for managing tasks list. Wish the reminders were a little more configurable then just days. I'd like for a task to be recurring every few hours and that's not possible right now. Some other features and this'd be an amazing so
1246,Linda W,"March 1, 2020",5," This is a no-nonsense app. That does exactly what I would expect. I create a task and it allows me to check it off as it's done, then keeps a list of completed tasks. Perfect for my use. Operates smoothly."
1247,Francisco Sebastião Barbosa,"March 9, 2020",5," My to-do list of choise. As an app, it's ok but it's missing a browser dedicated page, as we have for the Google Keep. As a workaround, I set tasks through Gmail and then I can see them in the app."
1248,Geejo Joy,"March 12, 2020",4, One feature request. I would like to see multiple reminders for a task in a day. I want to set reminders for different times in a day. This feature is missing from most apps and I hoped Google would provide it.
1249,"Karín López Sandiford, MBA","April 1, 2020",5, Love this! Specially the integration with gmail
1250,Malcolm Scott,"April 8, 2020",4," Good, dependable but light."
1251,Kelli Norris,"April 19, 2020",5, Always reliable. I can access from anywhere.
1252,Ralph Ng,"April 24, 2020",5, Best free app for task management and reminder

1254,Yvonne Koechig,"February 13, 2020",5," It is always accessible and super easy to use. Since I adopted a Chronebook, my experience is even better. I always have my list be it on the bus on at my desk...wherever I go!!"
1255,Todd Zinda,"February 12, 2020",5," Use it every day to jot down things I need to do. Replaces my paper list that I was always losing, sending through the wash, etc. I have two separate task lists. One for tasks, the other I use as a shopping list."
1256,Suraj Jha,"February 21, 2020",5, Very useful but we want features like 1. A section that shows which day have I done my task. 2. Last day of the tasks that will help us in terms of reminding how many days we have left.

1258,Kelvin K,"February 28, 2020",4, Pretty good and simple. I like simple. The one negative is that I have to access it as a side panel in a browser on my PC. Why can't it stand on its own like it used to and as it does on Android...
1259,Todd Davis,"March 6, 2020",5, This app fits my personal needs very well. I have tried other apps and have landed well with Tasks. Keep is also great for saving things I might want to access in the future or share with my wife. Tasks is all about my day or future plans.
1260,Jason Paul Wilkinson,"March 8, 2020",5, It is a great app. The only issue I have is with repeat items once I select them as done it does not repopulate one for the next month. It is still on my Google calendar just not in the app.
1261,sadie jenkins,"March 11, 2020",4," Still learning while using app. But is great for getting things down visually, and free up my mind. I don't feel so overwhelmed all of the time. Still need to learn all it does and how to use it. Need directions & explanations."
1262,William Heili,"March 13, 2020",4," The app has served me well for quite a while, and I like its integration with Google calendar. I only wish that I could get it in my mobile work profile, and that it had a better way to mark task priority."
1263,Michael Light,"March 18, 2020",4, Wish that marked off items would automatically delete themselves
1264,Jeff Yu,"March 23, 2020",5," Amazing app, it definitely improves my daily productivity"
1265,Débora Brito dos Santos,"April 8, 2020",4, Very useful and simple!
1266,Stefan Svicevic,"April 15, 2020",5, Sleek and functional in use.
1267,Andre Williams,"March 8, 2020",5," It actually works real good.....but Is there anyway the app can be set to run a program or programs indefinitely, and not just once a day ? If it could run indefinitely until otherwise it would be an excellent application....👍"
1268,Nick Gliha,"February 3, 2020",4," It's a simple, but works. I still wish there was a dedicate web app rather than just a sidebar in keep/docs/calendar but that's fine. It's not a flushed out as Microsoft To-Do or organized as other task lists but it works."
1269,brian,"February 3, 2020",4," Good app, but lacks some features like search and more clarity/management options for sub tasks, moving a sub tasks to a new list, removes the master task for example. Also the lists seem a little old fashioned, tags would better allow tasks to have multiple tags assigned ."
1270,Ankur Sharma,"March 16, 2020",5," It's nice app. It can give its better version, if it can *reduce app size, *colors, *different tones(custom) for different group of tasks, *night mode, *direct editing without opening full app, *visible sub-tasks in the list."
1271,Derrick DeBenedetto,"February 10, 2020",3, Good way to set reminders and tasks. However it lacks the ability to set repeating tasks on the web version. It also lacks a search feature which I think is silly or I have too many tasks...
1272,Akin Sowemimo,"February 18, 2020",4," This is a very solid Todo list app I use quite extensively it's pretty straightforward and integrates with Google calendar. It'd be nice to see easier ways of rescheduling events like swipe to reschedule to tomorrow, categorisation of tasks etc."
1273,Stephen Taylor,"February 14, 2020",5," This app just works. I use it to manage grocery lists, to check off which of my roommates have submitted their shares for utilities, and to cross of items I'm looking to buy from my various wishlist. A simple, easy to use app that helps with organization for sure"
1274,Justine Villarreal,"February 18, 2020",4," My only complaint is with the widget. I wish I could sort the widget tasks by date and time vs Random order. As it is the widget is mostly useless. Other than the widget, BEST task list for my life that I can find."
1275,Chris Pinkard,"February 23, 2020",4, I love how simple this app is. For me it's way better than Apple's reminder app. I do wish there was a way to automatically add a calendar event to the list. Maybe there is and I just haven't spent enough time looking.
1276,Toby Brighty,"February 28, 2020",5," Amazing app, keeps my work and personal life on track! The only thing I would like to see added, is a way for tasks to be shared to other task users and appear in both list with both users able to collaborate on tasks"
1277,Henri Desautels,"February 25, 2020",5, Google tasks has helped me organize my day. It sends me reminders to make sure that I take my medications and I use it as a to-do list as well. It's like a more functional version of keep notes for your schedule
1278,Suzanne Currie,"March 3, 2020",4, I like the app for keeping track of tasks and jobs to come and tracking the repeating tasks and dates they were done in the past. I would like it more if the date showed in past tasks without having to click on it
1279,Google User,"March 11, 2020",4," A simple and clear app for creating to-do's. But I miss the possibility to connect Tasks with Google Calender so I could see both, tasks and events, in Google Calender for more clearness on every day. Just a second button for importing the tasks as reminders in Google Calender."
1280,STEPHEN MEYER,"April 12, 2020",5, Excellent for me inspection business and the many emails
1281,Stephane Dias,"April 15, 2020",4, Very good app and easy to use.
1282,YiffyCupcake,"April 16, 2020",3, Good but the event does not sync with google agenda...
1283,Ali Saedi,"April 21, 2020",5," Perfect! Do everything I need. Except using Persian calender, maybe I can't set it up."
1284,Kevin Burton,"February 27, 2020",4," Great app, but it really needs to automatically set a reminder when adding for example ""buy milk tomorrow 10am"" since a date and time is included. Wunderlist can do this, and Google assistant would be able to interpret this correctly. I hope this gets added soon."
1285,Aahasun Habib,"March 5, 2020",2," The reminder doesn’t work properly. For example, if i set two reminders within tasks at 10.00 pm & 10.15 pm, most likely the second notification won't show up at the time(at 10.15 pm) it was supposed to."
1286,Eben Jr,"February 15, 2020",2," Works, but importing or sync reminders from two google accounts into just one list is not doable , can't auto add emails marked with star or snoozed, no outlook integration... anydo, meistertask Microsoft's to do, beta (wunderlust) for je are more functional."
1287,Stuart Cameron,"February 12, 2020",5, This is a great and simple app to use. I just wish it could have a visual and functional upgrade so that quality wise it was equal with Keep. Tasks seems to be the poor relation.
1288,Rishi Nair,"February 15, 2020",3," The chromebook app is terrible. I can't resize it very well and it does not use its space very effectively. The app does not work in landscape mode and so that's also an annoyance. However, Tasks itself is a great app on phones."
1289,Mario Vukelic,"February 13, 2020",3," Good, but desperately needs search. Also should not silently cut off the end upon saving when the content becomes too long (not sure if the app does, but the Google Calendar in the browser does it at least with Firefox)"
1290,Hank Falck,"February 13, 2020",4," Hey, I have had Google Tasks for about 2 weeks now, and I like it. Easy place to drop a quick reminder without having to navigate through various icons. It fits my needs."
1291,Frank Billington,"February 15, 2020",5," Perfect for quick Todo lists. Easy to reorder items. Cloud based means it is available on all my devices and desktops, including Linux. Any more 'features' would only detract from its purposeful simplicity."
1292,Paige Frank,"February 23, 2020",4, Works great; perhaps adding an additional feature that allows you to prioritize (or rank) based on importance could take this app to the next level. I use this app everyday and Do appreciate it's value.
1293,Josh Peterson,"February 24, 2020",4, I really appreciate the ability to create tasks out of emails. Once this integrates with Google Assistant I'll change my review to five stars. One thing I would appreciate is the ability to rank tasks by priority.
1294,Neeraj Verma,"March 7, 2020",3, I like the mobile app. I rate it low as I miss desktop version for the same. UI is very nice. Flexible enough to create any kind of workflow. For my workflow it works like charm.
1295,Sam Lin,"March 13, 2020",4," Great interface and simple, ad-free experience. Integration with Google Calendar is seamless. The widget shows tasks in the order they were added, with the most recent first. There should be an option to sort by due date."
1296,Jessica Levine,"March 17, 2020",4," Leaves some to be desired. Moving an item from one list to another doesn't seem to work without copying, moving to a new list in left-hand menu, and pasting text. Could be slightly more user-friendly with basics."
1297,T- Mac,"March 31, 2020",5," So easy,so useful and helpful"
1298,Renee N,"April 14, 2020",5, Great tool for staying organized
1299,Scott Habeeb,"April 20, 2020",5, Yes! There's a widget now - perfect!
1300,John W,"February 12, 2020",4, I really like Tasks and want to use it more. What will it take to add search functionality? Google is all about searching. Ironic that there is no search functionality on this product.
1301,Deepak Kulkarni,"February 10, 2020",5," One of the best App for managing your own tasks. If used effectively it can take away all your stress, with effective task management. Connection with Gmail is fantastic. Email can be converted into Tasks."
1302,Huda Harith,"February 15, 2020",5, Likes - Ability to set the date and time of tasks. Notifications and reminders. Integration with Google Calendar. Suggestions - Make sharing lists and assigning tasks possible. Enable Tasks in Google Calendar app.
1303,Amir Morjaria,"February 10, 2020",4," Really good app. It's really nice that it integrates with Google calendar and Gmail. Having come from the apple ecosystem and using the 'reminders' app, this does an equally good job."
1304,Matt Bramley,"February 18, 2020",2, No integrations with anything else. Notifications don't come through to my Fitbit. No snooze option. Not really sure why this exists as there appears to be little to distinguish it from reminders.
1305,Versatile Julie,"February 13, 2020",4," I like the simplicity of it. However, I'd add a couple of functions, notifications and an easier way to switch between to do list and shopping list would be really beneficial"
1306,Christopher Hinde,"February 18, 2020",4, Simple and functional. I used to utilize Google keep for task lists. This is much more streamlined. One feature I wish could carry over from keep is the option of a geo- location reminder for a task.
1307,Aditya Mani,"February 15, 2020",5, Sometimes I need to set reminders quickly. But the current interface does not allow me to do that quickly at a particular time on a particular day. It takes 10-15 seconds to do it. Can you guys think of ways to make this process faster?
1308,Sandor Ajzenstat,"February 20, 2020",5," This app is so convenient. It reminds me of things to do every day, and other things to do once a month on the 15th, or on certain months, and every 10th day for my cat's medication. 100% reliable!"
1309,Gabriel Joseph,"February 23, 2020",3," Great, but could use more functionality. Sync to calendar would be a good start. Ability to create recurring checklists would be nice too. Just small things like that."
1310,Bruce Dirden,"February 20, 2020",3," Nice because I don't have to make an account, but I don't think it's very useful if I can't share lists and collaborate in real time. Add that feature and this will be a solid to-do app for getting things done."
1311,Lynda Waiheke,"March 6, 2020",2," Really great app. Love that it can stay open beside gmail. Only 2 stars as can't sort List of Lists in any order. Not even alphabetical, let al9ne in the order of my choice. Otherwise it would be a 5 star. Cheers"
1312,Vladyslav Nesterenko,"March 8, 2020",5," After trying many other apps that were either too fancy to be used daily, or too formal to want to open it, I have found Tasks to be just the perfect combination of power and friendliness."
1313,Samuel Farinas,"March 10, 2020",5," To do list with settable dates and notifications-- all that would need. Only gripe is that tasks that you put off will block today's tasks, so you would need to manually update each date, or scroll down each time"
1314,Nili Kivko,"April 2, 2020",5," Convenient, practical, nicely designed"

Fix this and I will change my rating to 5 stars."
1320,Martin Drobny,"February 4, 2020",4," It's a good app with seamless features but, I wish they had colour coded titles though for quicker visual reference. And would prefer to be able to see my list titles in one screen to switch easily between task lists."
1321,Nate Hardt,"February 9, 2020",5," there are some corners (sharing tasks from personal calendar to work calendar is one, putting unscheduled tasks first or last (vs only last) is another) but mostly the tools are there with Google tasks to build a great task management system."
1322,David Gagnon,"February 10, 2020",4," It's a great to-do app, I love the fact that it's integrated with GDrive and GDocs online. However I really think that Google should make their products less confusing by eliminating reminders and integrating tasks in Google Assistant"
1323,Carlos Eric Gancedo Calvo,"February 13, 2020",5," The app is great to have a task manager integrated to your Google ecosystem. It would be so great if you could add colours or labels... (In options, not every time you set a task). Thank you Google."
1324,Roger Webb,"February 15, 2020",4," Generally very good, but there should be a search facility. I would like to be able tovexportvtacks to the diary. Repeating tasks disappear until their new date - VERY annoying at times."
1325,Luke Kilchenman,"February 10, 2020",5," perhaps the best approach to a minimal to-do app. it could do with options like rearranging lists from the menu (as opposed to only tasks within lists), but it generally works exceptionally well."
1326,Samantha Smelley,"February 10, 2020",3," App is just okay. Links to Google account and stays synced to lists nicely, but...No easy way to indent tasks/subtasks. No way to search a list. Really needs a widget for your home screen to be truly useful."
1327,Samuel Gottschall,"February 16, 2020",5, Good experience so far. I've been using this the lady two years and it's definitely helped me remember things I need to get done. It's also great since I can view the tasks via my phone or laptop.
1328,Lluc Sumoy,"February 10, 2020",4," I like simple apps that simply work, just like this one. Could improve UX, or add some bells & whistles, but then it wouldn't be this simple, beautiful, little app."
1329,Robert Jones,"February 16, 2020",5, Easy to use when you need to get something noted fast. I like how it integrates with other Google apps. Could be better like what Todoist offers but for a simple task manager it's ok for free.
1330,Janell P. Stemrich,"February 23, 2020",5, Smooth and easy to use Simple design is easy to understand and learn Seamless to go between calendar PC and mobile devices. Love notifications based on location or date/time. Now if only this app would work the Google assistant
1331,Tamarind Wright,"February 28, 2020",3, Overall ok but widget doesn't sort tasks properly. I have mine sorted by due date in app - widget displays tasks randomly and doesn't allow optuon to change. Quite annoying. Also would be good if able to receive daily email summarising tasks.
1332,Dave Berry,"February 28, 2020",3," It's fine, but I don't like that it automatically removes completed tasks. When I use it as packing list, checked of items are resorted when added back -- not at all useful."

1336,Amir Tapiro,"March 20, 2020",5," Simple, Clean, No Ads"
1337,Darcey K,"March 27, 2020",5, Excellent app. No fault experienced.
1338,Garrett Foster,"April 1, 2020",4, Simple and integrates with other Google products.
1339,Ali Rizwan,"April 2, 2020",5, Slightly sluggish with the widget otherwise a flawless app
1340,Lexaplaya Omega,"February 6, 2020",4," Very good, simple to use, and gets the job done. I wish it had more options to play around with though. Having the option for tasks to repeat a certain time after marking them as done, instead of in a set interval, would be pretty useful."
1341,Brendon D,"February 4, 2020",5," Simple interface, which is good (otherwise it turns into Keep or Calendar). Super smooth and quick task entry & no clutter. Standalone app in Android, and attached to Gmail on my Windows 10 laptop: all free! Thanks to all the hard workers at Google"
1342,Prateek Harlalka,"February 10, 2020",5, I had been long looking for a good to-do app and I stumbled upon google tasks. Very easy to use and doesn't clash with my oneplus 6T's OS. Very happy! It has helped me big time in staying organized !
1343,Jon Schulz,"January 30, 2020",4," Love this app! Could be improved by allowing more customization (color-coding, prioritization) and integration of different lists. Overall it's been an organizational life saver."
1344,Guillermo Ortega,"February 8, 2020",4, Very good in general for creating task list. I took one star because you cannot longer have a dedicated Google task window onna browser as before. Now you need to open Google inbox in order to get to it.
1345,Rahul Chothani,"February 10, 2020",5," An evergreen and simply the best app for day to day quick task management. You can even add subtasks, reminders, details and a lot more to make your work easy. Google proves how great they are..everyday..Thank you Google.."
1346,Fabiano PS,"February 18, 2020",4," It's a very nice simple task manager, does what i need. Only 4 stars because notifications for the day sometimes don't show up until i open the app, which is a bug."
1347,Oliver Featherstone,"February 11, 2020",4," Really useful app, 4/5 simply because I would like to still see completed sub-tasks, greyed out would be fine, just useful to look backwards on a task as well as forwards. Very intuitive otherwise."
1348,Roger Acker-Wolfhagen,"February 11, 2020",5," I use it to remind me of jobs i need to remember. i have aquired brain injury so this is a must. 4 lists Home Routines, Home Tasks, Work Routines, Work Tasks. Saves my days from brain fog and disasters. I also include appointments under home tasks as backup reminder to calendar."
1349,Caleb Berg,"February 18, 2020",5," Intuitive interface that is missing a few features that may be available in paid apps, however for a free application this does an excellent job. I almost never leave reviews, but I felt this app deserved one"
1350,Shaan Nagra,"February 13, 2020",4, Great app. I would suggest adding notifications or daily reminders to complete my tasks. I find that I otherwise forget to open the app and subsequently don't get things done.
1351,Stan,"February 19, 2020",4," This app needs collapsible subtasks // Also needs search. For a company that makes billions from search, it's ironic that the app lacks search!!! // Needs option for ""uncheck completed"" // Checkmarking a subtask should not free it from the parent task"
1352,Rick Guymon,"February 23, 2020",4, I think the app experience works well overall. I just think it's a little bit redundant when you get notifications in multiple apps because they're synced to your calendar as well.
1353,Jorge Graupera,"February 26, 2020",3," Works well, I like the tasks and subtasks. I cannot use it because it does not connect with my tablet phone and pc with google calendar.That is essential to my workflow. So now i use Google calendar for bith."
1354,Mariano Viola,"February 24, 2020",4," It is a simple app with a nice experience, especially if used as Gmail and Google Calendar companion. The only thing I don't like is its partial overlap with Keep."
1355,Zouhair KHAROUA,"February 27, 2020",4," It would be better if you added an All tasks view separated by category, and It would also be great if the Google Calendar app showed the tasks like it does on desktop. Other than that this is a great app actually."
1356,Raymond Lam,"March 4, 2020",4," Good points: Easy to use. Allow user to order tasks, indent tasks, set reminders. Suggestions: - allow user to order ""task lists"". - allow user to attach documents to a task eg Google Doc, PDF."
1357,Abitha P,"March 6, 2020",5, I love this app. It helps me to note down and remember things.. sometimes I prepare the to list sometimes I prepare the backlog of things I have to do. Totally love this app. Very useful one.
1358,Jing Zhou,"March 9, 2020",5," simple, quick and helpful tool"
1359,Darsh Gupta,"March 13, 2020",5, It was SUPER AWESOME! I can just say this is the No. 1 World's Best Productivity App! I'm getting a lot more things done with Google Tasks than I am on my own! I highly recommend it!
1360,Павел Бондаренко,"March 12, 2020",5, This application help me remember all tasks and fix new ones
1361,Haley,"March 17, 2020",5, Does everything I need and syncs to Google automatically.
1362,Jeff Towers,"March 18, 2020",3," It's fine. Would be better if I could share lists or invite other people to a task, like I can with a calendar."
1363,Eric Kochanski,"March 19, 2020",5, Great app to keep tasks on track!
1364,Lauren Lawson,"January 28, 2020",5," I love the integration with Google calendar on my desktop. I can see everything at once, and this is the only app that has ever eliminated my paper to do list. Love it!"
1365,Kene Meniru,"February 2, 2020",5, Very flexible app and the new ability to see tasks in my google calendar is awesome. Use it everyday to help myself do and remember things. Still waiting to see entries on my phone calendar as well though.
1366,Michael McDonough,"February 6, 2020",4," Better than nothing, but not as functional as the old Google Inbox app. I wish I could snooze items. It would also be really nice to be able to reorder the lists themselves."
1367,Metin Torlak,"February 9, 2020",5," Basically it is an app that shows you the tasks. Nothing less, nothing more. There is no bloatware or anything, so it doesn't distract you at all. Just gives you what it supposed to give."
1368,sightlink,"February 20, 2020",5," Beautifully integrated--phone, tablet, laptop. Interface is simple, clean, effective. Flexible organization options, e.g. multiple lists. For me, this app is indispensable!"
1369,Zane LeBlanc,"February 10, 2020",4," I don't use a calendar app, I use this. It's been working out really well the last 2 years. Widget needs some work though to be useful and I wish there were an AMOLED mode."
1370,Wesley Mills,"February 11, 2020",5," It's a fantastic app. The biggest recommendation I would give, is that I wish you could sync it with your Google calendar in some way that allows you to keep track of when you did what."
1371,Harley Lau,"February 19, 2020",4," Great app simple to use and accessible everywhere, handy widget available as well. My main pet peeve is, why doesn't it link in with Google assistant?!?! Also repeating task would be an awesome addition"
1372,Fernan Acevedo Lopez,"February 17, 2020",4," Great and simple app to track tasks. The only thing missing is a priority system with maybe 3 levels, with that you could know which tasks to do first and also filter depending urgency."
1373,Tanmay Bohra,"February 10, 2020",3, Subtasks should be marked completed in that particular task section only ...like cross and completed (i.e in completed tab) should be the whole task. .Also after completion of all subtasks the Main task should automatically be completed..if u undestand the task subtask problem u r great
1374,Amy Greenberg,"February 19, 2020",5," I use this app with my family, but also with my team at work. It helps us to stay organized, communicate with each other, and ensure we're completing tasks on time. Very helpful and easy to use!"
1375,John Hadjisky,"February 25, 2020",4," Solid, light weight app. Noticed recent improvements in how it handles nested tasks. Ideally, would allow nested tasks to collapse and expand. Overall, does the job, keeps thing simple."
1376,Gera Way,"March 3, 2020",5," Very convenient to work with, you can do different to-do list which is very handy. And the best part that is synchronize with gmail and you can see it on your desktop."
1377,Vinay Adak,"March 4, 2020",4, Overall app is fine but if I want to change the category I press back button and the app is closed. This is the problem. Please add a button for confirming exit from from the app. Thanks
1378,Gavin Holmberg,"March 6, 2020",5, It's very smooth and easy to use. It has helped me stay organized and on top of everything! I would totally recommend this if you want a simple but effective organizer for you tasks and Home Work
1379,Evgeny Baranov,"March 9, 2020",4, Could not reveal any integrated possibility of task synchronization with my Google calendar. Of quick and easy copying of my tasks into my daily schedules. Which would surely position the Apication as a fully - valued daily planning tool.
1380,Quinn McRoberts,"March 11, 2020",5, Straightforward tasks with push reminders all backed up to your google account. Its function and simplicity at its best. Really a great app that does no more or less than what it seems to.
1381,Eric Hess,"March 24, 2020",5," Helps to keep me organized, easy to use."
1382,Sofian Agust Pradana,"April 7, 2020",5, Make easy to remain and tasking. Thanks
1383,Sheila Ross,"April 7, 2020",5, It is easy to simply list your to-do's here and check them off.
1384,Vaibhav Bhatnagar,"April 23, 2020",5," ""Tasks""! with the power of Google Calendar makes your day super organised!!"

However, it does not sync with Google Calendar android app and that's a deal breaker for me. This appears to be a glaring hole in the feature set or a deliberate move by the calendar and Tasks team. The reminders feature from calendar gets the job done very well for me so saying not this unnecessary application."

A others have pointed out, it's a very minimal app without many features -- which is mostly (but not entirely) fine with me, actually. I've tried some of the fancy ones and their usually TOO fancy and complex. I love the integration with gmail, as I get work orders via email and can save them to Tasks with a just a few taps. What I don't understand is why this app doesn't integrate with Assistant or external email accounts connected to the Gmail app. So it's okay, but also half baked."

I'm not sure yet if it has all the functionality I need for a main list manager. In particular, I wish it had a search feature for tasks. Sometimes I can't recall which list I saved a task to or a list gets very long. A search function would help me pull up the task I was looking for and solve this issue."
1389,Ranell Bridges,"February 6, 2020",5," I use this to keep lists of all types, tasks, grocery list, thoughts and ideas, etc. It's simple and efficient and auto syncs across all of my devices."
1390,Kyrylo Vasylenko,"February 7, 2020",4," Almost excellent, but I want to see an integration of Google Tasks in Google Calendar on Android/iOS, so I will be able to see my tasks in the calendar in mobile application as well as in the web version"
1391,Rosie Jones,"February 14, 2020",4, Task notifications don't always come up on time. Not quite sure why this would be. Also integration with calendar would be really excellent. Otherwise very good
1392,Zeeshan Edwards,"February 10, 2020",4," Brilliant app, I use it all the time to help me keep Organised. Could do with some tweaks here and there but generally it's a great, simple tool... What else do you need👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"
1393,Scott Burlington,"February 18, 2020",4," Really simple app. Works well, but a little bit of added features would be great. Different levels of importance or time frame would make it great."
1394,Brian Cullen,"February 14, 2020",4," Tasks is getting better, but still has someway to go. It needs to have: - a search function - a start date - filters - tags (a proper search function could make this unnecessary)"
1395,Samuel Levis,"February 13, 2020",4, Good: I like that i can see my lists on any device. Not good: I wish that i could share certain lists with collaborators. Not good: A couple of times i lost updates to lists because my phone was offline...
1396,Nicole Lawrence,"February 20, 2020",5, I've been using 3rd party apps to manage my Google tasks until this awesome app came out! Easy interface and lets me keep track of mine and my boyfriend's tasks. I love this app and it's a life saver!
1397,X,"February 16, 2020",5, The instant syncing with other google products and the ease of use allows me to maximize productivity. This is a critical tool in my arsenal and I'm grateful that it's free.
1398,David Walker,"February 25, 2020",4, Really like it so far. Not sure if I'll keep using it as I haven't had a chance to decide whether it's good. Seems to have unlimited entries and some cool features. Hopefully it will integrate with Google Assistant well.
1399,Gabriel Carcabelos,"April 8, 2020",5, It is a simple but satisfying app
1400,Juan Dickinson,"April 19, 2020",5, Simple Effective Syncs well with Google Calender
1401,Steve Culy,"January 29, 2020",4," Good app. Works across platforms, allows collaboration with other Google users and integrates well with Google calendar. List widget could do with some work, sort options and dark theme."
1402,Joshua Finch,"February 5, 2020",5," I don't know if I can boast about ""task"" but I do like the fact that it's connected to Google and it helps establish a habit by giving a reward of checking off tasks. I love Google, I would work for them if they hired me. I would make all of my colleagues use it."
1403,King Arthur X,"February 15, 2020",3, Good app for tracking your to do list. But I would like to see it integrated with v the Google calendar app and not just the web calendar. Thus should be helpful when life planning but your away from your PC.
1404,Steve Adams,"February 11, 2020",4," The app is very helpful, but adding a new category in Outlook does not create a new list in Tasks. The new tasks just get added to the original default list."
1405,Colin Baird,"February 19, 2020",5," Everytime I find a new feature that links gmail, contacts, calendar, tasks, notes I move away from using outlook. It seems so dated now. Would be great if all of Google's apps had windows 10 apps though."
1406,Adrian Franco-Olguin,"February 13, 2020",4," Great app. Just wish you could add tasks via Google Assistant. Also, would be nice to be able to assign it share a single task or even a project with someone."
1407,Adam Dunn,"February 19, 2020",5," Nice App. Needs a bit more features or a more detailed settings area to adjust notifications and/or customize the layout. Had to manually go into phone settings to adjust. Otherwise, good app"
1408,Jim Asimenios,"February 16, 2020",5, I use this app a lot! During the day I think of things that I need to get and/or things to do. This app helps me keep track and remember without relying on my memory only.
1409,Kenon Ronz,"February 13, 2020",4," Very useful tool. I wish tasks would show up on my Android calendar. And I wish the app would allow for ""commonly used times"" to set tasks as I use the same times (wake up and evening) a lot"
1410,Ian Squire,"February 14, 2020",5," Good app with categories, tasks, subtasks. For me the best thing is the desktop app on chrome. I can drag and drop tasks onto my calendar to create time and hard edges to my day."
1411,Kim Riley,"February 13, 2020",5," I love being able to attach an alert (date/time) and details to a task! This is a straightforward, no-fuss app to help keep me organized."
1412,Bruce Boyes,"February 16, 2020",4, Useful. Use it daily. Very good but not perfect. Would be nice to reorder categories on Android so I can keep the most used on top. Maybe in a future release?
1413,Richard Rosenbaum,"February 10, 2020",3, One big problem... Reoccurring tasks don't show up until the day that they are due. Future occurrences don't show. Makes it hard to plan future events.
1414,Matt Cole,"February 20, 2020",5," Great app, had me organised in no time. Really easy to use, looks great and I can easily see the tasks I have coming up over the next few days."
1415,Shesha,"February 19, 2020",4," I really like this app bcuz now I don't have 100 ""To Do"" lists all over the place & I can organize what I need to get done into categories. I actually recommend this app to all my family & friends & we all like it alot !!! 😁"
1416,Jack Dvir,"February 21, 2020",4, Very nice simple task program but I wish it worked with Google assistant. I love how it appears in Google Calendar and we can easily change the due dates that way since manually entering due dates in the tasks is more tedious
1417,Geoff Musick,"February 20, 2020",4, Great app. Please add add widget functionality that allows users to decide which sorting is displayed. I can't sort by date in the widget which is the way a lot of people sort I'm sure.
1418,Spidey Alive,"February 29, 2020",5, It's a great and simple to use app but I would like there to be an option for task that has to be notified with an alarm. So I can hear it easier and faster. I don't get to check my phone all the time so this will help. Thanks
1419,Prakash Yadav,"March 13, 2020",5, I have been using a similar vison of task which used to sync with gmail. later on all of those were available on this app with similar user experience and integration we expect from google apps. Must have app.

1421,Daniel Nunns,"March 6, 2020",5, The app works brilliantly and integrates well with my calendar and email. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is due to it not having a widget interface - would love to see this added! Edit: Widget interface was added - 5 stars!

As a matter of fact I find myself remembering the things I need to take care of just by using this app and placing the tasks there. I find myself better organized this way. And If I am in the middle of something and remember a task I need to complete, I just bust out my phone quickly place the task into the app and close the phone not worrying if I forgot to take care of something later in the day, thanks!"

Only to find out now no tasks (reminders) are on my calendar app. Booooo, no good."

Except other minor problems and inconveniences the app is ok.

1428,Bill A,"March 5, 2020",2, Very basic for a Google app! Not consistent with notifications. Setting options is marginal and not user friendly at all. Repeating tasks seems to drop off the list.
1429,Christopher Klaver,"February 6, 2020",4," On repeating tasks, it doesn't always mark them complete through the alert, so the alert doesn't show the next day. But easy to create and track tasks otherwise."
1430,William Beesley,"February 6, 2020",5, Intuitive easy to use allows me to track tasks in a simple way that integrates with Google calendars. It does exactly what I wanted to do for a task app.
1431,Miles Larson,"February 12, 2020",4," Phenomenal app. Only drawback is that it lacks any compatibility with Google Assistant. I use it every day, and it allows me to be far more productive than before."
1432,Steven Lindsay,"February 24, 2020",3," It's a solid but basic app. Getting better as more calendar /mail integration is introduced. Would love to find a full blown planning /prioritizing tool a la Covey/Moretime , but haven't yet."
1433,William Franke,"February 28, 2020",4," Good app. I would suggest having it automatically prompt you to entire a date & time, with simple skip option. Also have task reminders pop up once the deadline is past if you haven't completed it"
1434,Rajnarayanan Veeraiyan,"February 27, 2020",4, Very Good App. But the list of items showing on its widget is in wrong order. I expect the items to be listed in chronological order. Fix it and get 5 🌟

Also, I think the user could be able to set a default time for new tasks, that is, I would just pick the day and if I didn't input a scheduled time the task would be created with this default time."

New items added to Tasks aren't sorted by due date in the widget. New items populate at the top. It would be more helpful if items were sorted by due date in the widget too. That way it's a cleaner look at what tasks need to be done by date they are flagged due vs random order. I keep an entire home screen page dedicated to the widget to help keep me on track throughout the day, but it's disorderly with the tasks unsorted."

1670,"Tom Johnson, Realtor","February 18, 2020",5, One of my most used apps. As a business owner it helps manage important tasks and keeps everything flowing smoothly.
1671,Christoffer Fridlund,"February 20, 2020",4," I really like how this is integrated with the calendar, and how intuitive the interface is. The only thing I'm missing is a way to share the lists with other people."
1672,Vladimir Uher,"February 10, 2020",2," Biggest weekness is it is not synchronized with Google calendar. Second, basic convenience features that should be included, like touch-moving tasks up and down, are not."
1673,Lior Nisimov,"February 18, 2020",4, The differnt lists arent managed to their full potential and make the app little bit difficult. Maybe an intructor about how to use the app to its full potential could be usful.
1674,Oliver M-L,"February 11, 2020",5," I LOVE this app! Integrates with Gmail/docs/calendar. So handy. I wish it linked directly with Trello, but overall it's a great tool."
1675,David Yates,"February 22, 2020",3," I'm sure used to have an ""add multiple tasks"" option to save time, but missing in this version. Otherwise a wholly unremarkable app."
1676,Amlandeep,"February 21, 2020",4, I like this app. But I wish to be able to switch between lists more easily. Like switching tabs on chrome for android.
1677,Anna Széles,"February 23, 2020",5, On my phone I can add a new task with one click. Immediately it is available on all other devices from browser next to my gmails. Practical and efficient.
1678,Derek Quiram,"February 25, 2020",2," Basic, but works. Task order can be changed to sort by ""my order,"" but timed daily repeat will change back to order added next day. Every day. Re-ordering tasks daily to flow by scheduled time should not be a task."
1679,William Sparks,"February 28, 2020",3," It's exactly what I've been looking for a simple app where I can make a list and help keep appointments. Still getting used to it, might like it more"
1680,Cody Griffith,"March 7, 2020",4, Good tool to have and easy to use just wish it wasn't so easy to hit the complete task button and it's gone but I like it.
1681,Arthur Lee,"March 6, 2020",3," I wish the app would do more to highlite tasks that are overdue. Also, while the app itself allows sorting according to dates, the widget fails to display that order."
1682,Bethany Erhardt,"March 9, 2020",3," Please add a search function! I loved G tasks, but it wasn't syncing with my calendar, so I switched to this-- would love to see some of the Gtask features round out this app."

1690,Andy B,"February 20, 2020",3," Not bad because it syncs with the Google calendar, but would rate higher if there was an alphabetical sort option and if the due date showed the year."
1691,Ivor Hession,"February 12, 2020",4," Really useful app, if it had some added functionality to make more comprehensive lists and schedules it would be great, could lift some functions from Google keep"

1703,Ardo Kusuma,"February 11, 2020",4," No way to assign dates for subtasks to follow parent task, this makes ordering by due dates really messy. I still use it just because it's super lightweight."

1708,Firelight,"February 1, 2020",4, Nice app. I hoel that someday Google will make the events we create to show up on the calendar too. So this way we wont have to keep the reminders on both this app and the Google App/ Calendar.
1709,Federico Bacci,"February 4, 2020",4," The only real reason why I use this app is because I can use task on Google Calendar on the web, while it is still missing the integration with the Android app"

1718,Brandon Wallace,"February 14, 2020",4, Really good and simple. Would like additional features like colour codes for different tasks or task folders and for that to reflect in your calendar.
1719,Whitney Rawls,"February 20, 2020",4," Good app. Should integrate with Gmail by allowing you to create Tasks from email. Also, please move the ""Mark Complete"" button up from the bottom."

1721,The Kids Tell Bad Jokes,"March 1, 2020",4, I would like the choice to put non-time-critical tasks at the top and to restrict how far into the future I can see tasks. No need to be able to see things more than a fortnight away.
1722,Rebecca McCright,"March 3, 2020",5, I love that this app syncs to all my devices. I also love that I can have 2 separate accounts--one professional and one personal.

1728,Donald Joseph,"February 5, 2020",4," Works well. But, it makes no sense to have sub tasks not move to same date as primary task when primary one is changed."

1732,J Christophe Izart,"February 10, 2020",3, Great app if it wasn't for the fact that you cannot print your task list (it was possible on older version)
1733,Joe David,"February 17, 2020",3," Phenomenal app, wish it was compatible with assistant or at least auto-syncable with reminders, it's insane that there isn't a reminders app in and of itself."

1808,James Clark,"March 16, 2020",5, Awesome App! Use it everyday for writing up prep and stuff! Recommend it to any students or anyone really with jobs you get regularly and need to tick off.
1809,Eric Bellas,"March 11, 2020",4, Very useful. Would like the ability to search. A bit confusing how tasks differ from reminders in Google's ecosystem.
1810,ahmed rebei,"March 25, 2020",5, Simple features for a simple life
1811,Ryan Stevens,"April 10, 2020",2, Please add a sort by alphabetical order function
1812,Oluwaseun Akolade,"April 15, 2020",5, I really like the app it help remind things to do.
1813,Aditya Dhoke,"April 22, 2020",4, It would have been much better if he t had an alarm in it.
1814,Kushal Poudel,"March 9, 2020",3," #Bug in widget: After I create task from list view of widget, the screen freezes and I have to press the home button. Then screen unfreezes."
1815,The Brogans,"January 9, 2020",1, Garbage. I spent days moving all tasks from Outlook to this and half way through I suddently start getting errors when trying to create recurring tasks. Now no matter what I do I can't add new tasks - I suspect there's some corrupt data in the database. Back to Outlook it is.
1816,Julie Mueller,"January 18, 2020",2," Recurring tasks don't repopulate in the task list after the first instance is marked complete. While tasks do appear on the appropriate date on the calendar, they are lost amid the calendar noise. I was expecting an ongoing task list a la Wunderlist."
1817,walter brzyski,"February 3, 2020",3," Needs to have more functionality like wunderlist or Microsoft todo ie lists, sharing with others, integration with slack, very basic at its current state."
1818,Sarah Cole,"January 28, 2020",5," Simple, clear, helpful. Particularly like the ability to break up tasks into subtasks easily."
1819,Trevor Mitchell,"January 29, 2020",4," For the most part great, lately it has been missing times for reminders, that is critical, if that is resolved 5 star app"
1820,Prince Herenj,"January 31, 2020",4," definitely would've given a five star, but would prefer you add support for importing reminders from the Google assistant as well. simple to use, very helpful."
1821,Heidi Memmott,"February 5, 2020",5," I love keeping my check lists separate to reduce stress. I use reminders and look at my progress in the saved, accomplished tasks."
1822,Yvanne Grandoit,"February 6, 2020",5, I love this app! I like how it integrates with Google calendar and automatically puts my tasks on the calendar.
1823,Marion Pope,"February 9, 2020",5, Very intuitive and easy to use. Neat how it correlates with the Calendar and notes.
1824,Mary Hollifield,"February 18, 2020",5, Love the ease of making lists! Use it to track groceries and lots of other things!
1825,Benjamin Tutsek,"February 14, 2020",5," Perfect. Easy to use, can multitask with it, been using it for a year, just perfect. :)"
1826,Herman Tai,"February 11, 2020",5, Best Todo list because Google tasks is readily available in desktop Gmail as well. That means you have easy access to Google Tasks everywhere!
1827,Olga Siniukova,"February 12, 2020",5," Great app! Helps me a lot, to get the work done. User friendly interface. Stylish. Recommend."
1828,Marc Turner,"February 10, 2020",3," Task is fine, but it's sooo boring. No color variations, no accomplishment stickers, the interface is so bland."
1829,Kevin Robinson,"February 10, 2020",5," Nice and simple app to use, can we get subtasks for recurring task ? And to be able to rearrange order of the sub tasks without backing out of the main task"
1830,Dan Hartzler,"February 10, 2020",5, I live by my Google Calendar and the Tasks list is the only way I remember anything. I love how this app syncs with my Calendar task list.
1831,Adam Rafeh,"February 10, 2020",4, Could be more powerful tool. Integrations need some work into google calendar and moving and assigning different people to tasks would make it 5 stars.
1832,Matthew Silva,"February 18, 2020",5, Super simple and straightforward. I also like the little completion animation an unreasonable amount. :)
1833,Darren Kidd,"February 16, 2020",3, IMHO needs better integration with all of the other Google products in the ecosystem i.e. Calendar and Home. I don't mind it but it's inconvenient compared to Reminders.
1834,Holly Jarvis,"February 14, 2020",4," Work really well. Easy to move task around. Just wish I could ""share"" lists with other Gmail users."
1835,Josh Carter,"February 12, 2020",4," Great app, use it all the time. Would like a feature though where you could share your tasks with other Gmail users."
1836,Karen M,"February 14, 2020",4, I quite like the app but would prefer it to have goals and events linked so you can add them as subtasks or make tasks subtasks of goals and events.
1837,stephanie lehecka,"February 21, 2020",4, I use this for everything. It would be really great if i could sync my lists with google calendar. Bc i dislike using Reminders...its just not the same...
1838,Israel Quintani,"February 21, 2020",5, Great! Love it. You can do many different types of lists and connect it with Google calendar
1839,Ruger Oliveri,"February 21, 2020",4," I love google products in general, this one included. But i cannot leaves without saying that there is a lot of room to improvement and I trust the professionals on Google must be working on that"
1840,Thomas Shepherd,"February 22, 2020",5," Now that I found full-screen-for-google-tasks, it is awesome again ... ! Tasks became unusable for me when Google eliminated canvas ..."
1841,Libby Hood,"February 22, 2020",1, Looks so promising and syncs nicely with Google but does not provide reminders. Reminders only pop up after opening the app. Not a lot of point in that!
1842,Luke Bosse,"February 22, 2020",5, Use it for all my daily tasks; syncs between devices and makes you feel great when you complete a task. Has a great user interface.
1843,Victor Vazquez,"February 28, 2020",2, Please add ability to snooze or reschedule tasks from the notification pop up. Inability to do this is a large part of why I'm still opting for other productivity apps despite being invested in the Google ecosystem.
1844,Leonard Pressley,"March 6, 2020",5," What can I say, it Google once again making my life easier to manage. Easy use from the home screen widget, great sync across devices"
1845,Krutik Gabani,"March 5, 2020",4, Need some improvisation and add some tools. Microsoft to do app has more tools to add our tasks and reminders... Otherwise app works great.
1846,Lee Hendricks,"March 9, 2020",5," Simple, intuitive and great way of keeping track of spending activities and actions."
1847,Gatlin Meador,"April 20, 2020",4, Needs to timestamp my completed tasks. Otherwise pretty good.
1848,Atharva Deolalikar,"December 4, 2019",3, Few suggestions from my side: 1. Integrate with Google Assistant 2. Intergrate with YouTube (set a task to watch video later) 3. Should have more options such as image and video can be added to task 4. Should have task repeat option 5. Should have auto message feature on whatsapp which will perform ...Full ReviewFew suggestions from my side: 1. Integrate with Google Assistant 2. Intergrate with YouTube (set a task to watch video later) 3. Should have more options such as image and video can be added to task 4. Should have task repeat option 5. Should have auto message feature on whatsapp which will perform like task
1849,Christina H.,"December 30, 2019",5, I wish I could create new lists in the mobile widget on the fly but other then that it helps me stay focused on many different categorized goals. Also wish the desktop version had its own page or full size tab instead of a small side tab. *Also dark mode widget option not available at this time.
1850,daniel ami,"February 3, 2020",5, Great app. I think adding an in app search for specific notes would be very helpful but beyond that no complaints at all... 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
1851,Eu-Jzin Tan,"February 8, 2020",3, I wish it can attach files/pics. Also not sure if it can integrate with other Google services like google calendar but it sure isnt easy or obvious.
1852,Lisa Volk,"February 11, 2020",5," Like that you can keep multiple lists, and access from phone or computer. Very convenient"
1853,Terry Korte,"February 13, 2020",5, Much improved from previous version. The best feature is the integration with other GSuite apps.
1854,Kevin Stinger,"February 14, 2020",4," Fantastic app. I would tweak 1 or 2 things, but it is stable and easily syncs between devices."
1855,Linda Anderson,"February 11, 2020",1," Need to be able to sort lists easily ie by number or name. This is necessary for users that have many (50+) lists, otherwise you cannot find the list that you need."
1856,Tony Lam,"February 11, 2020",5, Use it every day. Love that it's linked to all devices. Would be awesome if Google assistant reminders could be linked to Google task
1857,Jackson Seelan,"February 17, 2020",3, To improve a lot. User interface on app and order on widget to be improved. Tasks are linked to Google account and that's the advantage.
1858,Martin Fournier,"February 19, 2020",5, It is a quick an easy way to create tasks. I also like the fact that it integrates well with google calendar.
1859,Toby Mills,"February 12, 2020",5, Works really well across all my devices. Like the ability to have multiple lists of actions.
1860,Irving M. Baxter,"February 16, 2020",5, It is very handy for keeping track of price shopping... Comparison store pricing data.. Ready at your finger tips! Thanks 😊
1861,Peter H. Smith,"February 20, 2020",4, Simole. That is good but also bad. Would be nice if it had some additional features like specifying the order of your lists.
1862,Andrew Orillion,"February 27, 2020",5, This is a really good app for keeping track of tasks. It lets you create multiple lists and it's very intuitive.
1863,James Ritala,"February 25, 2020",5, Awesome. Love it Very useful for captured things to do. It's simple and sleek.
1864,Donal Harrigan,"February 25, 2020",2," Widget needs to follow same sorting rules as in the app interface. Currently the widget sorts by ordered added to list, not date even if date is selected in the app."
1865,Richard Acquaye,"February 26, 2020",5, Before I used to create tasks in Google calendar (reminders). This is a better solution.
1866,Drew Baker,"March 4, 2020",5, Extremely simple UI. Great feeling when I dont have to tweak a mess of settings or details. I also enjoy the compatability with my Google Calendar as well as other apps!
1867,L Jeanette,"March 5, 2020",3," App is adequate in conjunction with Google Calendar, but there's so much room for enhancements."
1868,Amit Ranjan,"March 4, 2020",4, Maybe add more layers to the task adding.. and more productivity tools like goal setting etc.. so we could really achieve our goals at right time.. rest all is gud
1869,Mike Sandmair,"March 8, 2020",5," Perfect for my daily/ monthly/yearly, ""to do"" lists and reminders. I check it every morning."
1870,Arun Kumar,"March 11, 2020",4," It's so good, if an alarm option would be there. Then it is an ultimate app. I hope you will add this feature too. Thank you"
1871,Natalie Maddox,"March 13, 2020",5, I think this app is great for creating simple to do lists to help you stay organized. I highly reccomend this app!

1873,Suzy Centeno,"March 19, 2020",5, Amazingly useful! Can't live without it!
1874,Maciej Fiedler,"March 28, 2020",4, You cannot make some task a priority oder rate a task
1875,John Heinze,"January 2, 2020",1," Shame on Google for not allowing Tasks Lists to be ordered (I'm not talking about tasks within a list). Such a simple thing! Google Tasks would be perfect with the ability to sort the lists themselves. Without this feature, finding the list I want to access is a PITA."
1876,Juwanza Thomas,"February 12, 2020",5, Absolutely amazing app. Great for keeping all the little tasks we forget each and every day.
1877,Natália Mendonça,"February 16, 2020",4, Simple and neat. Great. It would be useful to move my tasks between my lists.
1878,Jim Crowley,"February 11, 2020",4," Great lists, very good integration. Give me start dates and a view that combines lists and it will be perfect."
1879,Hrobky,"February 11, 2020",4, Great simple quick to use app. Doesn't notify about tasks with due dates :( Android Google Calendar doesn't show tasks even though browser one does.
1880,Neel Bhan,"February 12, 2020",3," Needs better integration into rest of Google platform! I should be able to say ""Hello Google what are my Tasks for today/this week"" and get a response."
1881,Emmanuel Casado,"February 11, 2020",4," So many clicks to put a date and time. It would be nice if I could type ""Gym 8pm"" and automatically suppose it's for today at 8."
1882,Suzi King,"February 20, 2020",4," Would be 5 stars if you could make tick box lists like in Keep bit otherwise no problems so far. Easy to create, edit and save reminders"
1883,Jonathan Gould-Knight,"February 23, 2020",4," If only Google could commit to either reminders OR tasks and then when you tell Google assistant to ""remind me"" it would add it to tasks. Then it'll get 5 stars."
1884,John,"April 12, 2020",4, Would like to be able to share tasks with others. Would make coordinating household chores easier. Similar to how Google Keep works.
1885,Chris Bicourt,"February 28, 2020",4, A clean simple and efficient app which has proved invaluable to me just wish it had a few more features.
1886,Benjamin Hirsch,"February 24, 2020",5, This app is so good. It helps me say it so organized. Very satisfying to check off a task.
1887,Kyle Hand,"February 27, 2020",4, I love it! I kinda wish there where more features though. Maybe some feature that shows how other people are using it.
1888,Serena Chang,"March 21, 2020",5," Great platform, visually pleasing"
1889,Danny Kim,"April 9, 2020",5, Very simple and useful
1890,Jules Verne,"January 3, 2020",3," First of all, dark theme. Secondly, please add more features, things like different themes and designs. The whole idea of the app is not very complicated so I would suggest adding some flavour to it. How about notifications and connection to other apps etc."
1891,Jim Bergman,"February 10, 2020",3," still really unhappy about the changes to Tasks, this app has a clunky UI, there's no more web portal, and you can't manually order lists. The list widgets are great tho."
1892,Naeem Rahbar,"January 26, 2020",4," It's simple app to add and manage your tasks. It would be more convenient and easy to use if it's connected with Google assistant. So could add things to tasks via voice, instead of typing. Hope you will see to this really soon."
1893,Sarah Seow,"January 27, 2020",3," Simple list, syncs fast. Could do with being able to have subtasks (instead of having it appear as another task), sort and search and share."
1894,George Papadopoulos,"February 1, 2020",4," Useful app, like how it appears in calendar in Gmail, also works well. Only suggestion would be to incorporate a free text recognition such as in todoist."
1895,Justin Black,"February 4, 2020",5," Love the simplicity and the fact that I can access this in my browser along with calendar, gmail, etc."
1896,Helen Chen,"February 12, 2020",5, Very user-friendly. An app that I could make notes in a fast & easy way.
1897,Liz Boyle,"February 16, 2020",4," Very useful, especially for those of us with memory problems. It could use a few more features though."
1898,Eric Macedo,"February 9, 2020",5," Great App! Elegant interface, recurring tasks, subtasks, Gmail integration and all for free. Keep the great job!"
1899,Kailash Mahawar,"February 13, 2020",3, This is from google and I have very limited need of it that's why I use it. There are many better task manager are available on play store.
1900,Danielle Stevens,"February 14, 2020",4, Like the widgets for managing my tasks. I also like that I can set a reminder for it to buzz me. Helps me get it done.
1901,Nigel Boreham,"February 10, 2020",5," I've used many note apps and this has been a keeper for a long time. It's simple, clear and very effective."
1902,Cyril Vereb,"February 13, 2020",4," Navigation between tasks is impractical. Then again, I tend to use Tasks as a makeshift notepad for all sorts of things."
1903,Thomas Olson,"February 15, 2020",4, Very useful especially if used with Google calendar. It should add an easy method for rank ordering daily tasks.
1904,Jan Gallagher,"February 13, 2020",4, Tasks does what I need it to. Particularly helpful is automatic synching computer and phone. I wish it had more robust subtask features.
1905,Kaitlynn Stout,"February 21, 2020",5, Love the functionality of these! I do wish that the widget would list the tasks by date instead of by when I added them.
1906,Joyce Watts,"February 26, 2020",4, I like making reminders for myself but i dont always remember to go to the app to check. Maybe im missing a step that will send notifications?
1907,Maulik Ghosh,"February 25, 2020",5, Nice app to remember your task without any much of hesitation....you can also recheck whether you have completed all your task or not ....please install it now..
1908,Michael Heidenreich,"February 24, 2020",4," I really like Google tasks, but do wish I could edit and update items from a dedicated web page rather than being embedded in Gmail."
1909,Fadi Bahee,"February 27, 2020",3," I would recommend making it more complex, sophisticated, and still keep its simplicity."
1910,Christopher Steadman,"March 14, 2020",5," Very sharp and to the point, although closer synchronicity with Keep and Calendar would be a good idea!"
1911,Bella Maggi,"February 29, 2020",3, This app is fantastic because im in stage crew and I move sets around a lot and we also have to remember quick changes and once we're done we can check it off in this app
1912,Larry Montgomery,"March 9, 2020",5, Easy to use. Like that you can set a target date for completion which can be added to notifications.
1913,musicfun,"March 11, 2020",5," Awesome app, no annoying ads, very easy to use. Simplifies your life."
1914,Isai Calderon,"March 18, 2020",5, Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication

1916,Edwin Engels,"April 3, 2020",2, No sound nor vibration notification
1917,Terry Pierce,"February 10, 2020",5, Great app. Any plans for a stand alone Windows app? My list is continuing to grow. A search function would be great.
1918,Milko Gonzalez,"February 6, 2020",4, Useful app but the desktop version is lacking. It seem to cornered in th side of calendar. It was better the canvas version for deskrop
1919,Danny Helman,"February 6, 2020",5," Perfect. Great way to draw up lists and have set groups attend tasks and complete. Love it, 5 more stars"
1920,Jake Sway,"February 7, 2020",4," Very good app. It's easy and intuitive to use. The features it has are simple, yet effective."

1923,John Kodjak,"February 10, 2020",5, Great app! Easy to check off items completed. I use it for everything!
1924,Andris Dinsbergs,"February 17, 2020",4, Just the right amount of features while remaining simple to use. Subtasks should remain indented even in order by date view though.
1925,John Browne,"February 17, 2020",5, Indispensable. Syncs with calendar and email. Easy switch between accounts. Never yet an error.
1926,Param Pardasani,"February 22, 2020",4," Simple, gets the work done, need more features like creating sub-tasks for sub-tasks and labeling the tasks, etc."

1933,Deirdre Roberts,"February 21, 2020",5, Perfect for quickly adding to my to do list. I use with Google Calendar & Keep because they integrate well.
1934,Manuela Z.,"February 21, 2020",5," Perfect, one thing that could be improved is an overview page of all tasks that is downloadable as an Excel form"
1935,Mateusz Grabowski,"February 25, 2020",4," A simple app without unnecessary rigmarole, such as priorities or tags. It would be useful to share a list of tasks with another user, e.g. with a family member"
1936,Nicole Eggebeen Uerling,"February 24, 2020",4, I love this app! It sinks with my google account wherever I am and really helps me to maintain focus during my day.

1942,Mark Tippetts,"April 17, 2020",5," Clean, stable, works offline"
1943,Lari Perasto,"December 1, 2019",1," Nice, but not quite there. The widget is quite useless as its sort order can't be changed and it does not sort by due date. The widget also freezes at times. Font size selection would be really useful too. At least the app shows Google tasks and they can be updated too."
1944,Michael Rodriguez,"January 27, 2020",5," Simple app that has many repeat functions (x days,monthly, yearly) without paying monthly fee.... and a widget!"
1945,Dylan Kennedy,"February 3, 2020",4," Nice task reminder system. I would like better integration between calendar, notes and tasks."
1946,Luke,"February 3, 2020",3, Great app but soooooooo frustrating that tasks don't show up in Calendar the same way they do with the desktop/web version of Calendar. Grrrrrrrrrrr
1947,Patrick OBrian,"February 3, 2020",3, It works. Very basic and lacking in visual interest though. Why offer it and make the interface unappealing?
1948,Robert L. Brice,"February 5, 2020",4," Love it! Easy to use. Helps keep me organized. Suggestion: Add ""Priority A, B, or C"""
1949,jkelol111 [Nam],"February 8, 2020",5," Nicely designed app, wished Google would release a desktop app for Tasks though, basically the only thing restricting me from using it fully."
1950,Anish Sana,"February 11, 2020",5, Absolutely love the app. So useful and helps me keep on top of things. This is a tool I'd probably use for life.
1951,Juan Santa Cruz,"February 12, 2020",5," Great app. Allowed me to update on desktop, phone and laptop, and everything syncs immediately."
1952,Brooks Thompson,"February 12, 2020",5, Easy to use and great for literally keeping me on task. The more I utilitize this tool the better I do at reaching my goals.

1954,Will Collins,"February 11, 2020",4," Simple, functional and effective. Everything that is required of a list"
1955,Twk Terence,"February 10, 2020",4, Really good and simple to use. Would be 5 stars if there is a search button...
1956,Debbie O'Brien,"February 15, 2020",4, It's good but could be better like colour coding ability to assign connects to gmail and calendar online but would be better if all this was together in one app instead
1957,David Wohlgemuth,"February 24, 2020",4, Pretty simple to use -- straightforward -- app. Would be nice to add color labels or tags for easy tracking and organization.
1958,Kason Belnap,"February 27, 2020",5, Great for setting up and tracking to dos throughout the day/week. Wish there was a widget for my home screen.
1959,Michael Keel,"February 25, 2020",5, I enjoy this app. I would prefer more options for how to stay tasks but this out performs what I was using so I'll take it.
1960,Melanie Tanksley,"February 27, 2020",5," Love it! Easy to use, has a place for description, and reminders."
1961,Kelley Birrell,"March 3, 2020",5, I love that I can sync my to-do list across all my devices. It's so easy to use and keeps me on task.
1962,Omar Adel,"April 12, 2020",5, Great App with attractive simplicity
1963,Abi M,"January 23, 2020",3," The feature allowing you to sort tasks by due date doesn't keep subtasks attached to the main task, making it difficult to recall which subtasks belong with each task without sorting differently. The option to tie subtasks to their respective tasks would be incredibly helpful."
1964,Jesse Galloway,"February 3, 2020",3," It's decent, but definitely could use more features and integration with things like Google home"
1965,shelby drummond,"February 4, 2020",5," Absolutely perfect for work to-do list/action items. Works great on my Samsung Tab S6, paired with my Keep Notes!"
1966,Mohammed Abdulla,"February 15, 2020",1, When you complete a daily recurring task it does not show in tomorrow's list. How can I see tomorrow's list of tasks? It doesn't work.
1967,Rob Imberger,"February 10, 2020",4," Overall really good, and a far better alternative to manually setting reminders through Google Assistant. Notifications are a bit hit and miss though"
1968,Sean Myers,"February 13, 2020",4," I wish this app would have a ""complete by"" with reminders. Otherwise, it's a very useful app."
1969,Gary Poole,"February 18, 2020",5," Very comprehensive, keeps everything organized. I use it everyday!"
1970,curtis gaylor,"February 18, 2020",5, Fantastic app. It would be even better if you could SHARE tasks with other people. This would top it off!
1971,Karin Alody Chan,"February 11, 2020",5, helps me remember many important things!! i like that i can see it beside my gmail and can also view it on my mobile as a stand alone app :)
1972,Bobbie OConnor,"February 19, 2020",4, Works really. User friendly. Would be 5 stars if it could be printed.
1973,Rofie Tu,"February 13, 2020",3, I hope Google task has synchronize options like Google doc. So we can edit between two accounts. Otherwise this is the best task app to use
1974,Larry Krigbaum,"February 17, 2020",3," Nice app with some good features, but it doesn't have a monthly view which I need."
1975,Precious Anthony,"February 17, 2020",5," It's has no distractions, the user interface is really engaging. Nice and simple app that does what it's meant to do."
1976,Miles Robertson,"February 10, 2020",4," It's super helpful. There are very limiting features, but other than that it's great."
1977,Ashok Kumar,"February 11, 2020",5, Fantastic app. Lists can't be reordered like tasks. This is a shortcoming.
1978,Aalby Dee,"February 13, 2020",4, I would like to have a smarter UI when creating / scheduling a new task. But overall really nice app and well integreted in android 10.
1979,Debbe Hermane,"February 15, 2020",4, Love this app! The one thing missing is a sound notification for reminders.
1980,Dennis Lynch,"February 12, 2020",5, simple task list. allows for multiple task. would be even better if there was a widget for my home page
1981,fermnell dowell,"February 28, 2020",5," It is a great app. With syncing, it allows me to keep up with all my tasks at home and work."
1982,Tina Esnaashari,"February 27, 2020",5, Honestly I've loved all Google apps - clean interface and with the Google Tasks they show an adorable image when you've finished your tasks.
1983,Grant Miyashiro,"February 28, 2020",2," Very basic. Needs at least search and ability to arrange by date (ie newest on top, etc)"

1991,Gasser Mamdouh,"March 14, 2020",3, The app is great and does what it says but I'd like to have times tasks that encourage u to finish what ur supposed to do in the shortest time without procrastination
1992,Erik Pham,"March 13, 2020",4, Wish there was different ways to look at all the tasks instead of just a vertical list...

1994,David Geffert,"December 28, 2019",1, You can't search for specific tasks. I've had tasks disappear. This is an awful replacement for the Google Keep. I had to switch to Tasks because Keep would not alert me on my new Samsung S10. At least Keep did not delete my tasks without me knowing.
1995,Richard Lynch,"January 21, 2020",5," Had another simple list, but it wouldn't reorder or have multiple lists. This does it all so I can separate things out and set priority. Feature request: favorite list! I always want my daily todos on top."

2001,Jake Cunningham,"February 13, 2020",3," Really good, simple to use, just wish you could have joint task lists"

2005,Shreya Halbe,"February 17, 2020",5, It really helps get through important tasks without having to make a calendar or procrastinate...or like never do it. If you are a busy person. ..tasks can make it less hectic.
2006,Paul Lambert,"February 10, 2020",4," Love it but it could use an internal ranking system on a daily basis so that items ranked as A1 is first, A2' etc, then B1so on."
2007,Alex Martin-Mayer,"February 16, 2020",5," Useful, simple, meshes well with other Google products. Highly recommended for the attention-deficient in the family."

2012,Darkness And Go,"March 11, 2020",4, pretty good. wish I had the option to create new list on the widget...and different backgrounds.
2013,Joshua Gamaitoni,"March 14, 2020",5, I'm in on-the-go worker always on the move. always coming across new things that I need to do with managing a large team. This app is really help me transform my follow-up and delivery. 5 out of 5

2022,Steve Ellis,"February 5, 2020",4," Helps keep my to-dos up to date, and my calendar uncomplicated. Would get five stars if it had a print function."
2023,Mary Sweeney,"February 8, 2020",4, I check it regularly so it works for me basically. I like how it integrates with my laptop and phone.
2024,Robert Wynia,"February 9, 2020",4," Almost perfect, except can't share/collaborate on a list of tasks like you can with Keep."
2025,Brian Wheaton,"February 11, 2020",5, It works. I like that it has phone and desktop features and reminder alarms.
2026,Joe Spake,"February 16, 2020",5," Perfect for ""to do"" lists. Multiple folders feature is very useful."
2027,Geri Reshef,"February 10, 2020",5, It helps me remember what to do when it involves unscheduled tasks. For scheduled tasks I use the calendar.

2029,Paul Greene,"February 10, 2020",4, Great organizational app. Love it. Wishe they would let youchange the display order of your various lists but it's a great app.

2034,Rafael Liang,"February 12, 2020",4, Brief: Has a neat widget for quick adding; fast and intuitive experience; syncs and shows on calendar.
2035,Paul Allen,"February 13, 2020",5, Excellent app! Best way to organize and keep notes in one place.
2036,Manjinder Singh,"February 13, 2020",4, Very good app but ir would be nice if it allows to add attatchments to the task. Such as phot taken from a event leaflet/flyer or contact card
2037,Benjamin Spang,"February 13, 2020",2, How this integrates with calendar is confusing. It was much better when tasks were with emails in inbox. RIP
2038,ahmed abdulsaboor,"February 10, 2020",5," Very flexible and useful to use, tasks can be added and edited by multiple users."
2039,Adam Foster-Fahy,"February 11, 2020",4," Doesn't always open up on the menu, sometimes it opens up on specific tasks all the time. Overall good"
2040,Joe Seanor,"February 21, 2020",4," Great app, I like that I can see it on my desktop as well. Needs a few minor improvements"

2042,Aalind Gupta,"February 29, 2020",5," Manageable, minimalist app. Does what it needs to. Nothing less, nothing more."
2043,Richard Myers,"February 25, 2020",4, Very simple to use. An option to embed a web address would be nice as this is a task I have frequently.
2044,Miguel Gómez Carpena,"February 24, 2020",4," Visual experience 10/10. Functional could improve: 1. Priority, 2. Share tasks. 😉"

2057,Omar Faruk,"February 10, 2020",4," Need tasks integration with Android calendar; then I'll give a 5 STAR. Like to see google Task better than Microsoft To-do Interface in Android, iOS and Windows. I want Sharing capabilities also. Thanks Google."
2058,Lucas Caro Barriga,"November 19, 2019",3," Share functionality doesn't work as it should when the tasks are sorted by date. When you share to Google Tasks, it should create a task with the text pre-populated same as Wunderlist does rather than just adding it at the bottom of the list."
2059,Avneet Singh Bindra,"January 6, 2020",3," When using the widget, longer text list items are not word wrapped in widget mode.. this is very inconvenient! It would be great if they were word wrapped so everything can be viewed directly in the widget itself"
2060,Frieza 223,"January 24, 2020",5," Very convenient and easy to use. I love the Google interface and it's perfect here. Although a simple task, (setting tasks - to do list, shopping lists) this app does this well"

2066,Anton Parks,"February 12, 2020",5," Awesome app. I can set up reminders that repeat and future date. Very helpful, I wish you could attach pictures to the tasks"
2067,Chris,"February 15, 2020",5, Easy to set time due for task. I would love if I could have task app open automatically everyday to remind me to look at my task.
2068,Philip Lindskog,"February 18, 2020",4, The only thing that holds me back from a 5-Star is because it doesn't have a collaboration feature.
2069,Carrie Chateauneuf,"February 11, 2020",5, Awesome for reminders of any kind! No need to have post-it notes all over and lists to re-write or lose.
2070,Terry Beasley,"February 10, 2020",5, Easy to use. You can categorize each task and work from there if you like.
2071,Jeff Higgins,"February 13, 2020",3," Was better when reminders was integrated with inbox, all reminders should be integrated, including, tasks, calendar, and home/assistant"
2072,Spiro Telegadis,"February 15, 2020",4, Wish the notification options were a bit better. Other then that works well if you are on the google ecosystem of services.
2073,chris bentley,"February 15, 2020",3," Great in principle, still struggling to get notifications and reminders to appear on my Huawei handset."
2074,Jonathan Lustgarten,"February 10, 2020",4, The app is good but it can be challenging to automatically add tasks to the right list
2075,Rich Kingsford,"February 17, 2020",5, Very clean and fast and covers the essential features. Would love the ability to snooze take - like Gmail.
2076,Kofi Holdbrook-Smith,"February 15, 2020",4, Good but not great. Apart from integration with Google calendar it's features are only decent.
2077,Mike Furey,"February 14, 2020",5, Great way to organize my personal and professional life. I really enjoy the way it syncs to Gmail and Google calendar
2078,Dayton Outar,"February 13, 2020",5, Simple and intuitive. Nothing fancy. Just functionally succinct.
2079,David Liphshitz,"February 11, 2020",3," I love this app! However, - Need to add undo feature... - Need to improve Right 2 Left support."
2080,Jaini Basiri,"February 21, 2020",5, It's light and easy to use with simple interface yet it got what i wanted.
2081,Francesco Illuminati,"February 24, 2020",3, very well intergaterd into the G ecosystem but lacks many important features (ie. order tasks alphabetically). widget not supports dark mode.
2082,Ndinefo Joseph Onyebuchi,"February 28, 2020",5, Straight to function and easy to navigate. No ads and easily integrates with my Google tools
2083,Katie Kemperman,"February 25, 2020",4, Simple and works. I like that you can have multiple lists going.
2084,Dennis Bauer,"February 29, 2020",4," Pro: Design, Speed, Browser Integration into Gmail and calendar Con: many features missing: smart lists ""today"", priorities"
2085,Alona Dubin,"March 11, 2020",4," Overall I like using it. Would like to have the features on the mobile, desktop and web apps match."
2086,Helena le Grange,"March 11, 2020",4, Great app. Would like to be able to switch easier between lists.
2087,Duncan McDonald,"March 13, 2020",4, Good but limited. Used as a shopping list and for that it is fine.
2088,Scotty Jamison,"March 12, 2020",5, I just wished there was a standalone web interface for this. It's annoying having to open something like Gmail just to access my tasks on a computer
2089,Whitney Brooks,"March 16, 2020",5, Very helpful! I use it every day to keep track of my homework and it works great!!
2090,Dor Simoni,"March 15, 2020",2," Cannot be synchronised with google calendar in mobile version, just in laptop. (I can't see my tasks in my calendar.)"

2094,Bianca Flores,"December 28, 2019",4," Well, I see there's a widget now for this app which is really cool and useful for me. However, I'm still holding back that additional one star because I want the app to coordinate with my Google Calendar. Still, loving this app!"
2095,Cris Fuhrman,"February 20, 2020",2, Disappointed that a mobile app for tasks done by Google on Android does not NOTIFY when tasks are due/overdue. Also widget does not show subtasks.
2096,Margaret Lillard,"December 13, 2019",3," It's OK. I don't have the notification problems others describe. My biggest complaint is that the widget refuses to sort my tasks by date due, no matter what settings I choose. The app itself sorts fine on my phone and desktop."
2097,Logan Parker,"January 3, 2020",2, The app is kind of useless if it never actually reminds me to complete the task... I set a specific time for this task to be completed and the app never notified me. The app is just a glorified list maker.
2098,Steven Drake,"January 10, 2020",2," It would be good that's when you complete a sub task, it stays under the parent task rather than gets moved to completed. It good to see your progress you have made if a particular task have many subtasks"
2099,Bálint Szabó,"February 3, 2020",4, Useful but not easy to search in tasks if you have a lot of them.
2100,Ron McCann,"February 7, 2020",4, Useful and easy to use. Need more ability to format detail.
2101,Avi Grossbard,"February 7, 2020",4, Good efficient. What is missing is sound notification whenever I add time.

2103,Jamie Seifert,"February 17, 2020",5, Keeps me from forgetting anything I need to get done. Love how it comes up as a sidebar with Google calendar too.
2104,Yunus Gozali,"February 18, 2020",3," 1. No ""SEARCH"" function makes difficult to find task from many tasks. 2. Can't edit from web"

2106,Max M.,"February 16, 2020",4, Great app. Needs a way to select multiple items for deletion from completed list.
2107,Jonah Dahlquist,"February 11, 2020",5," Works great. Really needs location based notifications though, to reach feature parity with Reminders."
2108,Konrad Krakowiak,"February 10, 2020",4, Great app. The only thing missing is integration with the assistant.

2114,Dan O'Connell,"February 13, 2020",1," Used to have an android widget, now it doesn't. Used to have a Chrome extension, now it doesn't. Hate it when my favorite apps keep losing features."
2115,Noah Dunavan,"February 15, 2020",3, The app is great but needs further integration with Google Calendar and Gmail.
2116,Sally Merryman,"February 16, 2020",5, Never have scrap paper when I need it! But this tablet is usually nearby! Tasks rescue me as my memory is overloaded!
2117,Jonathan Bradshaw,"February 15, 2020",4," It's good, I'd like it more if it combined with reminders and keep more intuitively though. Handy for different lists e.g. work and home to-dos etc"
2118,Paul Brooking,"February 24, 2020",5," I need lists to help keep life organised and avoid forgetting to do things. Tasks, combined with calendar reminders, helps me achieve this."
2119,Maranda Marvin,"February 24, 2020",5," I love this app. The interconnectedness of Google apps makes everything flow, administratively."
2120,Jake d,"February 24, 2020",5, It's simple and provides all the functionality I need for tracking personal projects.
2121,Mark Parsons,"February 23, 2020",5," Easy to use, very flexible, I can see it on all of my devices. Let's me maintain multiple lists."
2122,Manjit Babbra,"March 2, 2020",4," Simplistic. More flexibility on reminders would help. Time Windows, e.g. Tasks for the next week would be useful filters"

2124,Yasmina Díaz,"March 5, 2020",5," It's amazing how a simple app like this can help me organize my day, both my personal staff and my work things. I can't live without it"
2125,Arthur Lampert,"March 11, 2020",5, Handy Todo lists. Supports categories and tasks without do dates. More flexible than Google Calendar.
2126,Mollie Cole,"March 23, 2020",4, Should sync with calendars and have audible notifications
2127,Khizar Hayat,"March 29, 2020",3, Drafting should be with colour marks
2128,Joe LaCoste,"March 27, 2020",5, Very helpful. Easy to use.
2129,Sharief,"April 12, 2020",1, In widgets tasks are not ordered by date They are arranged in the way u entered tasks. Pls solve this issue and give correct order sequence
2130,A Google user,"February 24, 2020",5, Visually looks good. Has most of the usual features. Obviously I like the fact my tasks are available on all devices & web.
2131,Farid Cortes,"February 1, 2020",5," I like this app, but it should be sync with Google calendar and it's gonna be perfect"
2132,Jeff Waltmire,"February 3, 2020",4, I like the availability of the same lists on whichever internet connected device I'm using.
2133,Rani Kheir,"February 2, 2020",3, Useful but glitchy. Why doesn't the app flip to landscape orientation with tablets? The widget works better than the app.
2134,Mike Thurston,"February 5, 2020",5, I like the sync between my phone and laptop through Google Drive. I often need my details anywhere from the truck to the office.
2135,Dan Davies,"February 11, 2020",4," Useful and not over encumbered with extraneous features, but it is a little inflexible."

2137,Ellis Kempken,"February 13, 2020",4," Good, but should be properly integrated other google applications (google assistant, keep, and calendar)."
2138,Sandra Jones,"February 15, 2020",4, I like the app but it seems like you have to take unneeded extra steps just to make a simple list

2194,Jeffery Shaw,"November 26, 2019",1, Not integrated with Google Assistant! Why Google would release an app like this that doesn't integrate with their assistant is beyond me but until they do integrate it...it's worse than a lot of other apps out there (some that DO work with GA). 😒🙄

2352,Felix French,"December 10, 2019",3, Why on earth do I have to manually tell Tasks to copy across reminders that I've made through google assistant. It should check for new reminders and automatically copy them across at least every time I open the app
2353,Patrick Santos,"December 31, 2019",1," I used to use an ad riddled reminding app.. but at least it worked. I get no notifications with this one. I even checked the app info & the notifications are set to urgent, yet nothing. It's useless"

2671,Mark S,"December 11, 2019",2," I don't get it. Where is the integration for Google Assistant? We've been asking this for years now. All the lack of all the other features present in other apps. Google, open any other Todo app, to get tips of what features to add to this one."
2672,Fariris,"December 10, 2019",5, Why not make task reminders non-dismissable through right or left swipe but can only be dismissed when marked complete? Or at least provide an option to toggle this feature?
2673,Vinod Kisanagaram,"December 16, 2019",1, Widget doesn't show tasks ordered by date (using it on Pixel 3). Showing tasks in the order it was entered makes widget useless.
2674,Byron TGI Friday,"December 16, 2019",2, I would give the out five Stars if I could simply rearrange - drag-and-drop my task list on the app home screen. Dumbfounding how this feature is missing from this app

2775,Vivien FABING,"December 2, 2019",1, Totally unusable for me as I need to see only current day tasks. Reminders is far better as I can see only current day reminders. Good bye Tasks
2776,Volodymyr Zabulskyi,"January 2, 2020",2," Lacks plenty of crucial features, expected more from Google. That's a type of to-do app that consumes your time rather than frees it up"

I enjoy the simplicity of the app, the creation of multiple tasks lists and it's integration with the Gmail app. However, there is room for improvement. It would be great if the due dates set in tasks notified you the way reminders in Calendar do. Better integration with other Google apps in general would be very welcome.

The app is kinda a bad app without this feature. There better There are better apps for if your looking for simplicity. There are better apps for features.

Doesn't have a reminder, only notification which it won't go away if you mark the tasks in the app. I mean at this point I'm better off with pen and paper. I like the minimalistic approach but I hope it gets updated and they solve the problems."
3814,Doug Menezes,"February 10, 2020",4, Great app for tracking to-do items. The ability to set reminders allows for creating items that are due on specific dates. Integration with Gmail is great since I mostly have Gmail open on my computer all day.

This rant is somewhat out of place, but I dont expect Google to focus at the actual user level, so the fact that this is out of place is irrelevant. Why cant i get a simple organizer? Why is it that I can get a reminder that i have a reminder, but not the content of the reminder unless I want to hear ALL of them? WTH Google, if you were a person I would diagnose you with mania. We are SO weary from feature creep, of products coming and going unexpectedly - why not spend a year standing still developmentally and focus on improving application quality? Perhaps interact directly with your users to refine your products? If you wait much longer, it will be too late... gAssistant is going deaf in installments. A third of my gVoice real-estate remains uselessly annexed. gTags is incompatible with gSites. I'm terrified to adopt any new features lest they get nerfed. You have so many departments it makes my head spin trying to determine what's relevant to my business, if anything. gOne was a great concept till I realized it was limited to ""contextual support"" avenues that I've usually exhaustively explored before asking gOne for help - $2 is overpriced when the only answer us ""email the support link for that feature"", a function I can only assume is so wildly successful that staff are too overwhelmed to reply..I am beginning to fear you are too big to succeed. Why do I never get a response to my increasing ire and frustration? I am a thoroughly disappointed ex-fanboy. My clients are not impressed by the growing lack of confidence you've inspired in me. You have a finger in a million pies...we're way past constructive criticism, I'm straight up asking what you've done for me lately beyond constantly encouraging my regret for drinking so much Kool-Aide?

Long version: I have since long been using a variety of apps for organizing my life. The only problem is that I also like integration between apps. So when I saw that Google - many of the apps I use are by Google (calendar, docs, keep etc.) - I was stoked! I really hoped to finally be able to sync my reminders, to-do's and calendar events without having to have double or even triple sets of everything. As soon as I opened the app, however, I noticed that this would not be possible right away. Some of the problems I have with the app are, in no particular order; -When setting a due date for a task, it is not possible to set a due time for it. This could be solved by setting a start and optional stop time in a calendar event, alternatively have the ability of automatically planning it before the due date/time based on when you are free in the calendar (like the make-time-for-this-function already in calendar). This would also allow for better reminders for the tasks. -Subtasks do not receive a due date (as in, they do not get the same due date as their parent tasks). When sorting by due date, this makes everything look strange. -The first time I launched the app, I had two different lists named ""My Tasks"" -When completing and ""un-completing"" a subtask, it will land as a task and not a subtask. Easy to fix afterwards but would definetely become annoying in the long run. -The menu from the bottom-left corner is obnoxious. It would look better if it popped out from the left side instead of from the bottom up. Sure, there may not be too much to show in the menu (yet), but why not put links to other related apps (such as calendar or keep). This would also make it more up to standard with other Google UI:s. Other things I would want that are not that important: -It would be nice to have some sort of sound effect when completing a task, preferrably a choice of different ones (built-in or custom files) in the settings (by the way, where are the settings?). -Add a dark mode for use in the dark. Or, even better, allow us to choose between different themes (:3). -Add a widget for quick access from the home screen. -Add the functionability of recurring tasks (for example, cleaning your room every sunday, or taking the trash out every thursday (See Microsoft's To-Do app for inspiration)). -Add the functionability of working towards a goal (i.e. studying for a test, with the test itself as the due date, and where you can customize how much time you want to spend on the different goals, after which it adds studying sessions to your calendar (fitting it into your schedule)). Okay, time for some positivity! Here's what I already like with the app: -I like the simplicity of the interface. It is easy to understand and quick/efficient to use. -I like the idea of lists. However, categories would also be nice (a sort of tagging system, with fancy colors and descriptions for each category) All in all, it's a nice initiative, but I do believe that more functions along with further optimization is needed for it to become my main app. Thanks."

Yeah, use the Google Tasks extension in Chrome, but I shouldn't have to. You could also install the Taskary app though it's no longer supported by the developer. I also can't find a way to set a default list, you know that camping list I keep harping about? It's my most used list and I have to scroll to get to it. You also can't order your lists alphabetically. Another issue for me is being able to do multiple levels down of nested tasks, it looks like this app only supports two levels; Clothing\Running Gear versus Clothing\Running Gear\Sneaks etc. The app does have a fresh look, functionality is way more important to me and as it stands it's lacking key features."

That's it. But hey, a lof of important little features can and need be added for this app to deserve 5 stars!

The interface is clean, and it works well with other google apps like GMail and Calendar, but it's missing some features which feel standard, while also not offering anything spectacular.  The whole thing comes off as a big missed opportunity; if you have to use it, I don't think you'll be angry, but for the time being I don't see why you would choose this over the other options.  Pros:  - Google Calendar and Gmail integration - Can add Due Date and Sub Tasks immediately as you're creating a Task (some apps require you to first make the main task, confirm, and them edited the main task to add sub tasks). - Can easily move Main Tasks to become Sub Tasks, and vice versa.  Cons: - Can't reorder lists.  - Can't Create Reoccurring Tasks - Can't add task Reminders, only Due Dates  If they can fix just a couple of the minor complaints Tasks will immediately become one of the best options available."

Efficient. Hooks in to Google Calendar (web) and appears on Gmail (web) add-on bar. Great improvements to consider: 1) filter/view tasks across all lists by chosen date in the app. (Also @ the add-on bar app via web) 2) A better notification system (non-configurable other than persistence and time the new day starts) as currently I get random notifications for # of tasks for the day and at 9a. Make it a proper tracker that shows the # of tasks left that updates with change. Have it show at least the first, maybe a few, task in the top list going down (and possibly with the ability to check off tasks right in the notification! ---- if not, widget would be a pleasant addition). Possibly show alert ""incomplete tasks from ""xxxx"""" in said notification until completed or date change. 3) Collaboration - set per list. 4) *Shows up in Google Calendar app as a ""calendar” of tasks just as it shows on website. 5) *if no integration with Google Assistant. Yes, please add that. -For those commenting on non-repeatable tasks: Google calendar. -For those commenting on adding a time: this seems to make sense but it is designed as a simple, clean, and quick Tasker service. Try entering time in item title, in details, or using Google calendar for very important entries. -For those commenting on reminders and other complex notification settings: try Google keep or Google calendar, otherwise either consider a different service or remembering that their are things to do. -For those commenting on too much simplicity/lack of features: this is a simple Tasker app and to make best use of it one should always be aware of. Consider having another service with details/notes/images/complicated items when you need it and using this as a simple check list. Feels good to see these things disappear! -For those commenting on widget: This makes total sense!

It is an app with huge potential of killing all competitor apps if google introduces some basic features which are missing. To start with, we should be able to assign times to the tasks, this is a basic requirement which is strangely missing till now despite so many online requests towards this on multiple forums.

However, the biggest frustration for me (and many others that I have corresponded with) is that the next recurring task does not appear on the task list after the former one is completed.  For instance, if I have a once a week recurring task on Monday, as soon as I check that the task is complete the next task in the recurrent series should immediately appear on the list for the following Monday.  As it functions now, I check off one recurring task and the next on in the series does NOT appear on the task list - it's as if the recurrent task was deleted or something - it just disappears.  Please fix this as a priority!!!"

I liked Google so much more and all the apps intertwine with each other so everything is kind of in one place. I noticed while using the app that a lot of my reminders that reoccur on a daily basis just weren't coming through my phone. I'd either have to go back into my completed tasks and uncheck it so that way that reminder would go off again the next day, or I noticed I would have to have my phone unlocked and not be doing anything for my reoccurring tasks to send me the notification. The only tasks I noticed that DO come through and happen at the time that I have them set for are not my reoccurring  tasks, but just a quick reminder to do something for that day. Overall, I don't really like it. I cannot rely on an app that doesn't send me the notification for something I need to do."

There are so many bad design decisions and UX atrocities that I don't know where to begin!  Tasks has had multi-level outlines forever.  They *added* *code* to limit the new version to one level of subtasks.  Then their method of flattening old lists leaves them fairly unusable. And the UI for moving items makes fixing the mess much more difficult than it has to be.  At least they didn't just reformat my lists without asking.  Tab to indent and Shift-tab to unindent are nearly as prevalent as Ctrl-P to print (and worked in the old Tasks web app) but for some inexplicable reason they choose to switch to Ctrl-] to indent and Ctrl-[ to unindent.  I suppose there is some small solace to be gained from them choosing  [] rather than <> or {} so at least we don't have to shift, too.  Why on Earth can't you pop out the web app?!  I've been using Tasks for year and years but there is clearly no option left but migrating all my data to another service.  :-("

Google Tasks is So simple it's NOT useful.  Cannot attach anything to a task.  Like: interactive shortcuts to Google Drive documents,  interactive shortcuts to photos, interactive shortcuts to Google Contacts, interactive shortcuts to Google Calendar, basically all Google content should be able to be interactively linked.  Every task listed should actually be a header that establishes the related relationships.  In that way a user-defined tree can be built as needed to quickly find broadly related information, based on tags, types of data, dates...    I outgrew the Google Tasks usefulness within one day of its use.   Cumbersome and poorly implemented."

That's what the tasks are for. Why can't you make a widget, you have a calendar one. I just want my tasks to show up next to it. Low hanging fruit for the developers since it's already such a simple app."

I do wish that there was a widget though so I could add a task quickly from there without having to open the entire thing AND that i could have multiple lists together, but maybe colour coded to tell them apart :)"
4633,Devon Coldwell,"May 6, 2019",3," I like the simplicity of this app and how it connects your tasks across all platforms. However, this app would be so much better if I could have a widget of my list on my phone's homescreen. Furthermore, a dark theme because everything else has one."
4634,Summarah Hampton,"January 22, 2019",5," THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEED! Very simple little app that I can use to jot down my tasks and check them off, without all the options, colors, bells & whistles. I really don't need to spend more time setting up the task than actually working on it! Love this."
4635,karanam karthik,"November 23, 2018",3, App interface and design is pretty simple and good. Though few features seems to be missing in my view is 1. Selecting different times for each tasks 2. Repetitive tasks can be auto renewed. 3. Alert tone assignment for each group can have huge impact
4636,Chris Horton,"November 20, 2018",5," Not sure why there is so many negative reviews here. The app is stupid simple and useful. I LOVE that it does not have a hundred features and is a focused check off list. Also a plus that it is integrated into Gsuite account, easily accessible from desktop Gmail or the app."

4638,Matthew Hale,"October 7, 2018",2," So simple it's almost bad. All you can do is add tasks. You can set a date but you can't even set a time, let alone a time range. Plus no repeat setting either. Come on Google! This is disgraceful from a multi-billion dollar company."

4640,Beng Tiong Tan,"November 6, 2018",3, The app provides the basic functions for to-do list. I would like to access the Google tacks from the Google calendar. Something similar to the Google calendar web app. I would also live to have a today's view to show all tasks from all lists.
4641,Shannan Kiger,"February 7, 2019",1, Disappointing. Why don't sub tasks show with their primary task and given the same date as the primary one automatically? Seems pretty basic and obvious. Would be nice if it coordinated with my calendar app... But no. Uninstalling. My note pad and pen work just as well.
4642,Evan Fall,"November 6, 2018",2, Could be really nice but lack a lot of functionality that other have. Since it's a Google app integration with other Google services would be a great but it's not. The lack of reminder functionality is an important omissions.

This is a product that accommodates many different process' instead of trying to adapt you to it's process. If you're looking for a process to use you can consider my solution. I have multiple lists to manage different parts of my life.  The lists I have are: -  ""short term"" which handles tasks that need to happen this week or next.  As with most software they. With this my process is to look at it every morning and have alerts to ensure they happen - ""long term"" any projects I hope to get to but I don't have time to fit in to my schedule at this time. Process is look at it once a month and add reminders to things that I need to think about again around that reminder date - ""Work"" specifically for work tasks and goals - ""personal goal"" where I document what I'm currently working on to improve myself. Including things like 'read more', 'stay in touch with people', 'volunteer more'   Overall, Tasks is a great tool to accommodate a system you already have in place, but if you're looking for an app to force you into a process this isn't it."

I want to repeat every Sunday afternoon to do home improvement and let the sub tasks be added and checked off but still block that time off."
4646,Thilo,"November 18, 2019",2," There's no trash for accidentally deleted tasks or any kind of undelete possibility, only a very quickly disappearing 'undo' button. Better work with backups."

4649,Mike Draper,"March 7, 2019",2," Nice clean interface, however forces itself to portrait view, which on my phone is fine, however when I am using my Google Pixel C Tablet, which when the keyboard is attached is in Landscape it makes the app pretty useless. No widget function is another disapointing lack of functionality."
4650,Patrick LK,"December 10, 2018",3," Nice simple app but confusing integration with GCal. Why is there no way to add an reminder? Also I cant see the tasks only in the calendar on the web app, but not on mobile. If I want to add a reminder I have to do that on the mobile calendar app, but can't do that on the web app."
4651,C.J. Lindberg,"October 13, 2018",4, I like this app and how it works with my Google Calendar.  I would like it a bit better if it would sort by date instead of me having to choose that option each time I open it on my computer.  Some Options would be good.
4652,Aya Diabb,"September 21, 2018",3," it's annoying that it doesnt sync to google calendar on the phone, and it doesnt have a widget on the phone either. not so practical unless used on the laptop. also the tasks need to have a reminder on specific time that we choose."
4653,Roderick McILwraith,"December 30, 2018",3," Clean and simple. Good for basic task lists but no colour coding, tasks don't sync with calendar, you can't add specific times and reminders to tasks. Not bad but with a few tweaks and better integration into the Google ecosystem this could be superb."
4654,Carl Argent,"June 27, 2019",2," More problematic than useful. Can now sync reminders but they dont appear in the calendar which disrupts work flow. Lots of problems with subtasks and how they link to parent tasks, etc. The app is trying to be too simple and missing core functionality that you need from a tasks app."
4655,Pranav Turlapati,"September 23, 2018",3," Its a great app, but the only thing that sets it apart from Outlook lists and Wunderlist is that this app doesn't have recurring tasks, meaning that you cannot create a task and make it reappear everyday even if completed the day before."
4656,Raisa,"September 23, 2018",4," It's lovely and, while I mostly use Google Keep for note-taking and to-do lists, the simple UI of this app is perfect for the more bare bone work. I do wish that widgets were an option on the phone but the way that this program is integrated into my Chromebook is great."
4657,Tobias Demetz,"April 1, 2019",3," It need some colours too! That you can change for one block (task + subtask)the colour.  You could also do that some repeats every day, and then you can always watch when you did it and when not, something like habits, habit bull."

4660,Anirudh nair,"January 11, 2019",3," Two main reasons for not getting five stars: 1) The app has some glitches i.e. it displays the wrong date on the main screen but shows the correct date according to when i saved it 2) You can't sat a time to finish the task by otherwise it is a beautiful minimalistic app, easy to use."
4661,Garret Vollo,"June 6, 2019",3," animation is too slow. The app ""Tasks: Todo list, Task List, Reminder"" has speedy animation, and is better built for creating tasks with your right thumb (you don't have to reach all the way across the screen)."
4662,Matt Hunter,"July 1, 2019",4," I've started using this instead of reminders on my Pixel, but only because of the new ""import reminders"" functionality; this is because i use my Google Home to create reminders. This would be five stars if there was a native ability to add tasks directly to the app via Google Assistant."
4663,Marcin Sieniek,"July 16, 2019",2," I preferred Reminders - how they displayed in the inbox, defaulted to today rather than no date etc. Tasks takes more work to achieve the same. I feel this app was forced on me with the depreciation of the superior product Reminders used to be due to some stupid internal politics."
4664,Tyrone Genade,"August 1, 2019",4, I like it. It is really convenient to use on my PC as I can have it open along side my email. Easy to use on my phone and syncablity is much appreciated. What would be really great if I could use Google Tasks are a widget on my phone so I don't have to open the app to see the top of my to-do list.
4665,Prima R. Bardin,"October 10, 2019",4," very simple, i like it. i dont really mind not able to view it on calendar while I'm mobile, but it's harder to organise (like moving dates require too granular attention, thus not suitable for mobile activities).

4674,Ian Meinzen,"October 29, 2019",4," This is a pretty decent task app now. The only things I would like to see is a good integration with Google Assistant (if your can add a task with it, I don't know how), and a ""smart list"" showing all the tasks due today, like Wunderlist did."
4675,A Google user,"February 8, 2019",2," it's a useful application, but there is a bug in it. The account sync feature won't stay ON. After i turn it ON and it syncs with account, in moderate time it turns account sync OFF. So every time i edit tasks i must turn sync ON. It's frustrating."
4676,Bailey Lissington,"October 29, 2018",1," Doesn't have widget support? Doesn't have tags for tasks? Doesn't have proper integration with the rest of the G-Suite and assistant? Seriously Google, you have to update this app to keep it competitive. It has the potential to be a good app"

4728,A Google user,"November 7, 2018",5," Friendly UI, simple and convenient to use. This app was the one missing piece to what Google had to offer for productivity! Would love to have functionality to set reminders for tasks and also to integrate tasks into the Google calendars as well !"
4729,Kevin Goswell,"January 11, 2020",4, Works well as a bare bones note app.
4730,Daniel Bracey,"June 10, 2019",3," It's pretty and fast but very basic. Having a 'Today' or 'Scheduled' tab would be very helpful so I can see all due tasks in one list. Also, add tasks to Google Calendar and retire reminders already."
4731,pam leitterman,"July 8, 2019",4," Useful. Subtask feature is a plus. I have multiple lists & I would like to be able to sort my list names alphabeically. I'd also like to be able to sort my tasks within a list alphabetically sometimes. If I had that feature, it would bump up my rating."
4732,Chris Connett,"July 11, 2019",2," It's a really basic TODO app. It doesn't integrate well with Google's other reminder systems.   As tasks are added, the newest tasks go to the top. This makes the list reversed from the order I entered the tasks. I really like my todo list to be backwards /s."
4733,Anthony Downey,"July 16, 2019",2," there is some appeal to this app, the simplicity is delightful but something too simple is annoying. ticktick, another note and tasks application has more features for its free side than this app. little things like, task deadlines, widgets for the home screen and more will make this app appealing."
4734,Tina Hamilton,"August 2, 2019",1, NAY to Google for changing and abandoning this app. I have been using this app to keep track of bills that need to be paid and now it is impossible to see what is upcoming in the list. You have caused me to miss due dated and that cost me money. Please return this app to its former glory.
4735,Reinielle Matt Erece,"August 9, 2019",3, One of the best. One of the features I liked is its simplicity. But it is also its weakness as it is too simple it lacks important features is the ability to set a due time not just the date and a home screen widget for Android.
4736,Helmar Freires,"November 16, 2019",5," I'm so happy that you guys added the widget feature now! Thank you and keep up the good work in making this all more useful, convenient, and free for everyone.🙏🏻"
4737,Joe LaMendola,"September 16, 2019",4," Simple, but at times too simple. Hey, Google- could you please make an Android widget for Tasks? Being able to view my lists and swipe sideways within the widget to view different lists and check off items would make this app a necessity. Instead, I often forget about it and the lists it contains."
4738,Haziq Zikri,"November 6, 2019",3," The apps have some problem and feature to improve. Can't delete some task, it will delete all my subtask. And i can't to make task at specific time."
4739,Jon Adams,"December 21, 2019",4," Too easy to dismiss a reminder and you don't see it again until next day, but I like that it keeps coming back!"
4740,Julian Sepulveda,"February 10, 2020",5, Immediately helps me become organized for productivity in my day
4741,Donovan Daniels,"February 10, 2020",5," Being goals oriented, I LOVE THIS APP"

4747,Frank Lin,"April 23, 2020",5, I find it quite usefull in adding email into task.
4748,Craig Berntzen,"October 10, 2018",3," I really like it but I need it to have a recurance setting for tasks that I have to complete weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc... Other then that its great."
4749,A Google user,"January 17, 2019",1, Come on Google . . . This app is lame! You need a better Task manager app to sync with G Suite. I'm still using wunderlist for collaboration and ease of use. Until something better comes along or Google fixes this one.
4750,Da Shek Kumar,"February 13, 2019",3, Pretty good app with decent features. Has a clean look. 3 stars because it doesn't have a widget which is a real shame. It really limits its use and productivity.
4751,Amruta Mahajan,"October 2, 2018",4," Suggestion : Please add Widgets in the next update.    . . .

I absolutely love the app but is difficult to use as quick reminder of my To-Do list when there are no widgets available. Otherwise I love the simplicity it has. Also, being able to access lists from any devices is a great advantage. Thanks!"
4752,Dan Myers,"April 7, 2019",4," After nearly a decade of using other apps to manage my Google tasks, I've switched. Just needed repeating functionality. Next, get rid of reminders (it's confusing to have both) or just auto add to tasks. Integration with Assistant would be great!"
4753,A Google user,"March 26, 2019",1," Empty from functions. After having created several tasks in Google Calendar desktop I find out that all my tasks appear without any timestamp, leaving me without being able to plan out an entire day for not knowing when the tasks are set to go off."
4754,Josh Healey,"March 7, 2019",2," Design is good but lacking basic functionality that keeps it from being a reliable solution. Will consider using once Googlr figure out how to choose between googlr assistant reminders, google keep notes, google tasks, etc."
4755,Tom McMahon,"March 25, 2019",4," Really great at organizing tasks, can also forward from Gmail, and everything shows up in my calendar when their is a due date. Wish a few more default settings where available and more integration across products, like making an Google Document Action Item a task too."
4756,Steve Peterson,"April 25, 2019",4, So far so good. I installed this app after the latest update to both my tablet and phone changed the task list usability in calendering. Only complaint so far is no widget for the home screen so I don't have to open app to see list.
4757,Vince Bush,"November 29, 2018",5, Simple intuitive interface PERFECT for To Do Lists. Works the same on phone or in Goggle Calendar on PC. Super easy to add new Tasks or add new Lists and rename or rearrange things. I hope they DON'T add any bloatware to it.
4758,Daisuke O,"September 14, 2018",2," Missing a lot of features that are in Inbox like recurring reminders, snoozing, mobile notifications, and Google Home integration. Doesn't sync up with Gmail or Keep. Particularly bad since Inbox is getting phased out."
4759,Vaughn M.,"October 18, 2018",4," Another Classic Google App. Beautifully designed of course but it seems like a shell of an app: Not as many functions as other to-do apps have (i.e. recurring notifications, location notification). Hopefully it will become a fuller more useful app within the next couple of updates."
4760,Kaarthik Arumugam,"September 22, 2018",3, App needs to have the option to send push/ persistent notifications in the notifications panel to ensure the tasks/to-do gets done on time. At present one needs to open the app to see the what needs to be done.
4761,Charles Hsu,"July 18, 2019",1, reinstalled to see if there was any improvement from initial release. still no integration with existing Google reminders. Google's fragmentation with reminders is hard to believe. doesn't leadership think this is a problem?..
4762,Dinal Shah,"November 27, 2018",2, No widget. Can't sync to gCalendar. Cant set a time for when a task is due. Won't send notification on the day a task is due. No priority level... I really hope additional functionality is coming. App is really lacking in current form
4763,Bhaskar Saha,"October 11, 2018",3, The app is really helpful but the only problem is it has got no widgets. If there would have been widgets then it becomes very easy to access your task without opening the app.
4764,Mohan Rajagopal,"January 24, 2019",4, Very useful app to stay on track everyday. The only thing i miss is a single view with the tasks from all the lists. Right now I have to switch lists to see my tasks for the day
4765,Miles Ahead,"November 10, 2018",1," No repeating tasks, no snoozing, no reminders, no time. If keep app can have all features, if Inbox app can have such features why not this app. I agree with others who need such Features and integration with Google Calendar"
4766,A Dabrowski,"November 20, 2018",4, It would be great if you can share the list with another google user. It would also be nice to see a date specific task on the mobile app. You can see the tasks in the calendar online but not in the mobile calendar app. Those two things would make this app 10/10
4767,Justin Mayotte,"June 19, 2019",3, This app works well for your daily tasks but it really should be a part of the calendar app. It would be better if it would at least sync to it. Kind of annoying to have to use 2 apps to plan out my days.
4768,Mohan Raj,"September 30, 2019",1," Web app sync perfectly with web calendar but not in mobile calendar if we set task as reminder. This is very important feature I can pay subscription if this works good. Please fix it. (Reduced rating from 3 to 1 star. Because even after 3 months, after many have given same review.)"
4769,Alex K,"April 8, 2020",5, Best task manage app
4770,Huw Bryant,"September 23, 2019",2, Recurring events doesnt appear to work or is at least poorly implemented. Once completed the task is marked completed and only reappears in your tasks list on the day it is due to be completed next so you can't look ahead to see what you have coming up.
4771,Generically Named,"October 26, 2019",3," Great app, but there is this extremely annoying bug where as I am typing out a task sometimes it just clears what I was typing. I have no idea why it does that but it's driving me crazy because there isn't anything obvious that I might inadvertently be doing that causes it."
4772,Alex Smith,"October 28, 2019",4," Anything that first pops in my mind, goes in Google Tasks first. I use it so much! But just because I cannot search, or share my lists to other apps, which are the most core features that have to be, makes anyone's productivity with app really slow."
4773,Daniel Marshall,"October 31, 2019",3," Bottom line, it needs Google Calendar integration. Great app aside from that huge flaw of a daily to do listing tool."
4774,Sss Mmm,"November 8, 2019",4," This would have been a 5-star app if it had ability to share lists with others. For that, I have to install Google Keep now."
4775,Phillip Jacobs,"November 24, 2019",3," Descent task app, does what it says for the most part, there is room to improve the UX."
4776,Ian Longworth,"December 17, 2019",3, It's missing the ability to repeat based on completion date rather than due date.
4777,David Wheatley,"February 4, 2020",5, No complaints. I use it for work. Does what it says.
4778,Nabil Khan,"February 15, 2020",4, Should be able to go to list view from widget.
4779,Rahul Prasad,"February 24, 2020",4, -1 star because calendar view is not present in mobile app
4780,Wanda Rohne,"February 27, 2020",5, Allows for setting due day and time.
4781,Big Boss,"February 25, 2020",1," There is no Search Button to find Tasks, dates and Keywords. Can you include these in the Search Function?"
4782,Erik Tuthill,"October 16, 2018",3," Missing too many features that really should be there. For example recurring tasks, or the ability to snooze a task or make the notification persistent so you have to interact with it....Overall just seems kinda half-baked."
4783,Luke Rucker,"November 20, 2018",4, Frequently shows incorrect dates for items on my list. Re-opening the app usually fixes. Still not sure what the pattern is or what exactly it's doing when the bottom of my list has a random incorrect date or two.
4784,badran mohamed,"January 6, 2019",5," Very simple, very good, and very easy to use. Sleek design with no ads and no fuss. That's a pretty easy choice if you want to avoid the bloated, ad-filled to-do lists out there (e.g., any.do and todoist)."
4785,A Google user,"October 17, 2018",4," I really like this app. Easy to cross from laptop to mobile and very helpful. I suggest making a widget, so you can see what you wrote down easier on the home screen"
4786,Alexandros Kappos,"October 14, 2018",3, The app is great. I Would give it a 5 if i could change the order of my lists. Dont care that it doesnt integrate with inbox and calendar as most people say. Share a list would be another great addition to it though
4787,Kari Jo Freudigmann,"November 26, 2018",3," The app works well except the recurring tasks don't work. Normally when you mark a recurring task as compete, it brings it to the next due date. This app just marks it as completed."
4788,Deana Duquesne,"April 2, 2019",3," I use everything Google: Keep, Calendar, Gmail. I want to use Tasks, too. But when I link my tasks from calendar to Tasks, the dates upload on the wrong day & kind of randomly. Please fix this!"
4789,sweta basudas,"November 10, 2018",4, If this app could connect to calendar then it would have been better. Neat n simple interface. Streak or score n points system would help keep user motivating. Please try to include this. Widget is very much necessary to this otherwise great app.
4790,Luka Sapundžić,"October 23, 2018",3," It feels half done: it does the job of adding your tasks to calendar, but you can't look at all the tasks at once if they belong to different groups. Adding date and time is a bit cumbersome"
4791,Nathaniel W. Turner,"March 24, 2019",3," Getting better, but the app feature set seems to lag behind the web version. For example, reminder times can be set on the web, but not in the app."
4792,Anthony David Raffa,"February 5, 2019",3, Overall it's useful but I wish there was a way you could repeat a task (daily/weekly/monthly/annually) when you set the date. I also wish I could find a good widget for it to put on my phone.
4793,Rob S,"November 7, 2019",2, So after your last update I now have an issue Sometimes as im typing it just decides to delete It only happens with this app and I'm using Google keyboard so no issue with compatibility I would assume WHY ???
4794,Harsh Sahajwani,"July 17, 2019",1, The basic functionality is missing. No reminder alarms or notifications are generated. Often deadline of the tasks are missed because of this issue. One has to manually open the app only to discover that the tasks are over due.
4795,Shekhar Sahu,"July 23, 2019",5," it makes reminders but not like a calendar or Keep notes app it is specifically made for competing tasks so on opening it first screen which you see is about your tasks, thus, reminding about your tasks remaining to be accomplished in a nutshell it's simplicity brings great focus inspite of alots of...Full Reviewit makes reminders but not like a calendar or Keep notes app it is specifically made for competing tasks so on opening it first screen which you see is about your tasks, thus, reminding about your tasks remaining to be accomplished in a nutshell it's simplicity brings great focus inspite of alots of complexity in calendar app and distractions in Keep app Thank you Google!"
4796,Jaleshya Brown,"August 24, 2019",5," So Close... I'd like to see tasks fully intergrated into the Google Calendar app. The web version is very useful, but if you switch to mobile, your tasks disappear from Calendar all together. And it seriously needs a widget."
4797,Stephen Redlack,"September 15, 2019",3," Update to previous review: Turns out the repeated task function does work, but not as expected. It will regenerate the task on the *next day* instead of right away. Adding 1 star to the review since this is functional, though a bit unintuitive."
4798,Andrés M.,"November 10, 2019",4," Great app. It helps to keep you organized, I recommend it. It needs some improvements."
4799,AvirA A,"January 28, 2020",3, a trivial thing but please make it possible to rearrange the task list
4800,John Middleton,"February 11, 2020",4, Quick and easy

4804,Wall Art,"February 4, 2020",5," amazing app experience 👌, very easy to use and include all what I need"
4805,Neil Sargeant,"November 13, 2018",3, Its a good app but I dont understand why Tasks i create from web-based Gmail show up in the web-based Google Calendar but not on my mobile phones Google Calendar. If I create a task I want it to be visible in my Google Calendar regardless of the device I view it on
4806,Caitlin Burke,"May 16, 2019",1, It would be great if the tasks showed up on my google calendar on my phone. I try to schedule certain tasks but sometimes the time needs to move based on events that day. This requires me to check both my google calendar and the tasks app and then remember. Defeats the entire purpose.
4807,Aeriuu,"April 1, 2019",1," Cannot retrieve recently deleted tasks. My tasks were accidentally deleted. In previous version online there were wayd to view recently deleted tasks on the web version. I loved using this app because it keeps my tasks synced on all my calendars, now it deleted almost everything."
4808,A M,"December 28, 2018",4," I like this app. It allows me to organize my thought and keep track of my work. However, I would like if Google Calendar app was in sync with Google Tasks app. It would be greatly appreciated if Google Tasks had a widget."
4809,Yan de Castro,"March 24, 2019",3," Nice app. One tip: you should add some widget and sync with Google Calendar (show the task at the calendar), because we do not see (if not open the app) the task until it comes."
4810,Aditya Badwaik,"May 3, 2019",2," the app still lacks lot of good features which other app excel in. The only reason I installed this app is becauae its from Google, however it disappointed me. This app is of least rating as compared to other google apps. its iterface lacks lot of todo capabilities"
4811,Sarah Kellogg,"September 16, 2018",1," Useless! No reminders, no reacoccuring tasks, why even bother making it? I downloaded bc I saw it beside my google docs as an option and thought it would be useful for when something popped into my head as I was working, but alas."
4812,Mike Banks,"September 16, 2018",1," Rubbish, no integration with Calendar, no reminder function, no notification function, no widget barely better than a piece of paper. Why can't Google produce a unified system that can be accessed across all platforms."
4813,Mircea Vlad,"September 13, 2018",2," The app looks great, but sadly I lacks a lot of features the the competitors have. Shared task lists, recurrent tasks, reminder hour and date - different from due date, list folders/groups and so on."
4814,Steve Spriggs,"October 28, 2018",3," I prefer Google Keep over this app. It has the same functionality, more features, and a widget which essential to me for my checklists. Without the widget, it's just like a pen and paper that I left a home"
4815,Fonzie Owens,"April 1, 2019",2," I didn't explore this in depth, but given the fact that this is ran by Google, I assumed that there would be a widget. Also, more importantly, it would interact with Google Assistant. but it does not"
4816,Zach Ghera,"May 25, 2019",3, Tasks is very clean and lightweight but mobile needs the same integration features as web (especially being able to view tasks in Calendar). It would also be really nice to have end times and an option for sub-sub tasks
4817,ferlinmarcini,"December 9, 2018",2," I can not switch to my other Google account on Samsung Note9. I can only access the task from one Google account that I don't often use.

4818,Bereket Tesfamichael,"November 29, 2018",3, It is Ok. But one distinct feature I would like to see is a calendar view of my tasks. I usually prepare tasks for a future dates.  (There is a similar feature in a simple app called 'ColorNote'.)
4819,Ivan Biglang-awa,"April 1, 2019",3," I really like how tasks can be made and organized, added due dates and subtasks. I like how I can see the tasks on Google Calendar on Chrome.  Please merge Google Tasks into the Google Calendar So I can see the tasks on my agenda as well."
4820,Shirin Lalkaka,"January 19, 2019",1," Too plain, no categories and no task reminders or calendars. This app is not at all helpful, its a waste of time and i advise nobody to download it. Ever. there are so many other task reminders and to-do list apps that are WAY more helpful than this app."
4821,A Google user,"January 14, 2019",4," A very clean, practicle and powerfully integrated tool for manging tasks, lists and small, but simple projects, where the objective is to know what work is in the pipeline, waiting and due today. Integration into Google Drive and Gmail —a tremendous bonus."

4824,Jacqueline Vue,"September 4, 2019",1, I had to download it so I can keep track of the task I set up with my laptop. It works great but it is also a completely unecessary app to download. All google has to do is allow for google calender to sync with task and this app wouldn't even have to exist.
4825,Vojta Miklin,"November 9, 2019",3, Doesn't support newline. It is not possible to view all tasks from all lists sorted by date

4832,A Google user,"December 26, 2018",4, great app to help you get organized on projects by breaking big tasks into smaller talks that are part of the larger task to be done. excellent tool of you are always forgetting the minor details or get really easily overwhelmed by big project stuff.
4833,Colin O,"September 18, 2018",3, Could be better. Not being able to set a time for reminder for tasks is a big problem for me. Setting only a date with no time is useless. Needs more configurability. Will wait by the sidelines meanwhile.

4839,Matthew Oakey,"November 2, 2018",4," This App is good, simple and clean. It does what it should and what you expect. BUT,,, it SHOULD be integrated with the Google Calendar app as it is in the Chrome Browser app, instead of two separate apps."

4841,Carlo Sanfilippo,"May 24, 2019",4," A great task app, it's very useful. But I would like it to be integrated into the Google calendar, whether it appears on the day of the reminder or in a tab as it is integrated into the Google calendar of the web."
4842,Tan T Chau,"September 21, 2018",4, I like it. At first its hard to use but once you get used to it. You should be able to use any task app easily. This one work well and good for practice too.

4844,Tina Goodpaster,"November 12, 2018",4," Love the simplicity of this!!. The ability to add notes and subtasks are also a plus. Basically love everything about the app. When it allows tasks to show up on Google calendar, it will get FIVE 👍👍👍👍👍from me and many others!!"
4845,Scott Parker,"May 20, 2019",4," Update: Since my last review, Google has updated the Tasks app to do more of what I wanted. Reoccurring tasks and set-time tasks were added which summed up a lot of my issues. Now, if they would only add the ability to add tasks via Google Assistant 🤔"
4846,mW4227 Gamer,"December 1, 2018",2," If I was being optimistic, I would say this is a task app for minimalists: lacks many basic functions such as searching through tasks, a widget and recurring tasks. Quite disappointed, this being from a major company Google."
4847,Carlo Morales,"February 8, 2019",3, simple and elegant. i have some requests though. 1. option to make reoccuring tasks 2. option to view all tasks of the day. so that we do not need to switch from 1 list to another.
4848,Ronald Butt,"June 28, 2019",1, When you do write a script half of them don't work. You cannot change the volume in the phone. needs integration with calendar to do take as well as clock. only 1 of these apps is needed. should be part of calendar.
4849,Reeshabh Ranjan,"November 7, 2018",3, One of the most needed feature is sharing my list with my friend so that we both can collaborate on the same list. Google Task doesn't have it. Such a bummer.
4850,Vardha rajan,"April 14, 2019",4, I am not able to sync the goals created in calendar widget with this app. Any help to make the goals show up in this app would be helpful. I hope it has options to manage the goals and viewing in dashboard stuff.
4851,Levon,"July 9, 2019",4," A very useful, simple app. It's not trying to be some universal synch app between your laptop, mail etc. it's an app to quickly built a list of daily errands and nothing more. Everyone needs to quit complaining, it's better than Google's reminders."
4852,Shubhav Jain,"June 24, 2019",3," I think if a sub-task is marked as completed and then as incomplete, it should come the same Main-task, and not form an independent task. Also, there should be an option for location-based reminder other than time-date reminder."

Since these companies 'own' any\ all info processed through their apps, I am now deleting."
4854,Ilan Åsa,"August 2, 2019",3," Love the simplicity of this but unfortunately recurring tasks are useless as they disappear one they're checked off, to never return, but when unchecked, they forever display the original due date. why even bother having the function?"
4855,James Tatman,"August 6, 2019",2, Available as a mobile app but does not integrate with mobile calendar?! Makes no sense to me. Could be so good with a few little tweaks but currently this is only half baked so I'll continue to use Google reminders until they get round to completing it.
4856,Chanakya Patel,"August 15, 2019",1, 1.You dont Show Daily or weekly Task List In Future Dates. 2.You Dont Give Priority or Colour Code Lines For any Task bcoz That Gives Difference Between Urgent and Important.

Please add Atleast 2 or 3 themes bcoz Always white Could Lead Frustration Sometimes. 3. You have Given Option For Subtask But Its Pointless becuse You have not added reminder For That one otherwise What is the point to add Option as Subtask Instead anyone can write considering task. Thats all.. Plz Try to Fix.
4857,Farzad Tabatabaie,"August 18, 2019",2, Doesn't have a freaking widget. And adding titles and details should be less front and center. I want keyboard to pop up right away when I press to add a new task.. It should be much simpler. Ux is also too cluttered for a basic task app
4858,Ivan Čarapović,"October 20, 2019",2,"Not really intuitive I really tried to use the app, but its somehow lacking features compared to others and its not as intuitive. I struggle to find how to do simple things that should basically ""just work""."
4859,Nick Pericoli,"October 31, 2019",1," Looks like a useful app, unfortunately you cannot share task lists with others - which is sorely needed."
4860,Heidi Bowie,"November 8, 2019",4," I wish I could see upcoming recurring items on the list, but I really like all other aspects of the app!"
4861,V Arevalo,"November 6, 2019",2, It would be great if it was integrated with google assistant. You can't add a task by asking the assistant.
4862,pagoothree,"February 6, 2020",1, Does Not Work on BLU View 1 w/Android 9! Will not load.
4863,Ravindra varma raja,"February 14, 2020",5, 1. PL.shkw this app in calender view also like in laptop 2 any task created incalender should also appear here..

4866,Rajesh Apte,"November 12, 2018",3," The interface is simple and good. There should be an option to put alarms on the to do items. The reminder system is for the whole day, can't set it for a specific time."
4867,A Google user,"February 10, 2019",3," Very basic features. Works well for simple task lists. annoying that if you set subtasks for a to do, they show up separately from the main task. makes it confusing to track multiple activities across subtasks."
4868,Kwame Atta Gyamfi,"March 20, 2019",4, perfect for me. Especially with the integration with Google calender. Will give it a five star if i can add date/time to each subtask. I'm waiting for another update. 😉
4869,MK -,"December 14, 2018",5," Amazing and simple, just how I wanted it. Should definitely come pre-installed on Android instead of stuff like Google Play Movies & TV. Would like to see the tasks on my Calendar too but I honestly can't complain."
4870,Nathan Daugherty,"January 6, 2019",2," the UI is nice and I like how the checked items disappear, but 2 stars because you cannot sort alphabetically. I mean, do I need to say more? It's unforgivable that this feature is not there."
4871,Daivat Bhatt,"October 31, 2018",3," It's nice but lacks critical features. Cannot share tasks with anyone else, unable to copy and paste created lists easily. Room for improvement."
4872,Chase Boone,"September 26, 2018",3," Used to have Wunderlist, but it's no longer being supported. Tried this and it was lacking lots of features. Tried Ticktick and it's perfect; it is soooo much better than this."
4873,Jay Rodge,"October 6, 2018",2," There should be following things: 1. Option to add time in the task 2. Sync on the Google Calendar on App and Web 3. There should be a list call All Tasks, where I can see All the tasks for the day from all of my lists"
4874,Shyam A,"October 17, 2018",2, I love Google eco system and I prefer Google apps over others. But Somehow this app is not designed well . No widget options and no option to make a reminder recursive which is the one of the most important feature in any TODO app.
4875,Susan Evans,"November 28, 2018",2, A little disappointing - I would really like to be able to prioritize my tasks each day.  Also accessing the Google Calendar on a desktop allows you to see and manage your tasks.  The app does not
4876,Midhilaj Basheer,"October 6, 2018",3, The app is simple to use. But there is a lot to get improved. Some fatures like reminding a task in a specific time can be added. In this app the time is not user defined.
4877,Matt Cleverly,"February 12, 2019",1," What good is it too have a task reminder that you can't set a time for reminders. A daily reminder is pretty much worthless. Instead of making new apps that suck, try adding basic functionality to the apps you already have."
4878,Michael Ferrandino,"February 23, 2019",4," Basic task app, but it's sufficient for what I need. I use it mainly because it shows on the desktop Google calendar. Missing a lot of features that other task apps have, but I don't particularly need anything else."
4879,Giovanni Quattrone,"September 19, 2018",1," Lack of functionalities and personalisation. I marked a task as complete and now it's gone. I did not want to remove it, I only wanted to keep the task on my list as competed. No app settings to personalise this app."
4880,Sean Dinsmore,"February 13, 2019",1," App fails to update list when it has been changed in gmail or calendar. Get message ""unknown server error"" wish it worked but it's unusable as it is. I'll continue to use the 3rd party gtasks until google releases a fix."
4881,Chad Schmitz,"May 2, 2019",2, The app does have a clean interface but is lacking in usability. Needed features: 1) Multiple selection of items to allow bulk changes. 2) Integration with Google mobile calendar. 3) Combined view option to see tasks across all lists.
4882,Sam R.,"January 15, 2019",4," Great app because it's linked to google calendar. I wish it was also connected to the mobile calendar app, and also wish that you could add visual subtasks when you order a list by date, which isn't possible for some reason."
4883,A Google user,"September 17, 2019",1," only works in portrait mode. can't get it to sync with calendar. 2nd attempt this fall, still won't sync with calendar. All I want is to be able to see tasks on my daily calendar, and some smarts behind that. Unloaded again."
4884,Charles Desbrosses,"June 9, 2019",3," As others said, recurring tasks do not send any notofication after the first one. This was one of the main use I wanted from it, so only 3 stars. The rest is fine to me, simple and easy to use."
4885,Germán Larraín,"June 17, 2019",3," Still needs a lot of work. Integration with Google Calendar app is critical for this app to be really useful. Also, on which day the week starts should be customizable (it is on most date-related apps and also in most Google apps)"
4886,Avanish Awasthi,"October 6, 2019",3," I love the app its already great but doesn't have a handy widget for quick overview that i hate about it, being an organizational app it must have a widget which shows the current task statuses on the home screens.... Desperately waiting for this feature on the next update... Thank you."
4887,Veaceslav Cartera,"November 2, 2019",3," I can't find any integration with Calendar. I've created a task, it's not copied to GC"

4893,Prasad Chinwal,"March 11, 2019",3, App has an amazing UI but few things are missing. ex date for task needs to be able to set while creating it. Also there is need for a time and reminder like an alarm.
4894,Caius CHANCE,"November 16, 2018",4," Needs unification of this, reminders on Google (assistant) and reminders on Google Keep. This has subtasks but not recurrence, when vice versa on Assistant. Built in reminder app on iOS is easy to open with recurrence and can be created by Siri."
4895,Gabor Biro,"April 7, 2019",2," Not as good as the old Tasks app, that has widget (sadly no longer available on Play Store, but can be found on the internet ). I can't use this without the widget. Widgets are awesome!!"
4896,David Gurak,"October 27, 2018",2," It's pretty, but reminders are terrible. No integration with the Google Calendar app or Google Assistant. This has so much potential but in reality it pretty much sucks."
4897,Fedor Ivanov,"October 14, 2018",3," Guys, the only good feature missing - is a widget, even a simple one (""add a task""). Make it and I'm sure you'll end up with a 5 stars average!"
4898,A Google user,"January 23, 2019",4," This application with minimalist design is exceptional in terms of making and managing various lists, but lacks a widget which can be pinned on screen. Hence, 4 stars."
4899,Asker Mohamed,"November 16, 2018",3," The app is very basic. It needs at least the date and time, both options. Also a widget with calendar to plug on to the phone screen."
4900,Shane Herring,"January 14, 2019",5, This app does exactly what it says. No distractions just a simple task list with the added benefit of including a due date. Syncs across devices courtesy of its Gmail connection. Love it. Thank you.
4901,A Google user,"March 23, 2019",3, I have used the desktop app for a long time as it integrates with Google calendar. I am hoping there will be an update soon with the new time based features and integration into the calendar app
4902,Fosztó Mátyás,"May 13, 2019",2," I have encountered a bug where if notifications are grouped, and I complete one, it completes all of them. Makes the app unusable. Also, my end of day tasks do not display during morning time."
4903,Eric Carlsen,"February 13, 2019",3," Why this doesn't come with a widget is completely beyond me. The app works fine, but this is the sort of thing that just screams for being used in a widget. I've moved on to other apps that have widgets."
4904,Oscar Lopez,"April 12, 2019",3," This app looks good, but is missing so many features other task apps already have. Consider this app barebones until we get more features. Its missing a widget, more time selections, labels."
4905,Matthew Shields,"October 11, 2018",4," The app is good but I'm getting a strange bug. When I sort my tasks by date, the dates don't show up properly showing the wrong date and/or day."
4906,Miloš Jokić,"July 2, 2019",4," Works good and have basic features. The only app that I found perfect for me actually. Still, it needs more features. It syncs with Google Calendar and Gmail on browser but it should be synced with Google Calendar on mobile as well. Keep up updating."
4907,Sushmith Bhatta,"November 9, 2018",3, The app is too simple to use and very minimalistic. It would be great for me if it would have the following features which are really overdue for this app. Ability to Integrate tasks with google calendar and black theme for OLED screens.
4908,Jeff Williams,"October 10, 2018",4," I wish when I told the Google Assistant to add something to my grocery list, it added it to the Grocery List I made in this app. That would make sense. It doesn't do that, though."
4909,Giovanni,"May 2, 2019",1," How come when I click repeat on tasks, the next day its in a different order!!!!??? It was tedious enough to set it up, but it doesn't even stay in the same order? That is a real shame. Please fix this."
4910,Kristos Roshi,"November 20, 2018",3," I think it was rushed and unfinished. I think Google needs to integrate this with Keep and Calendar/Reminders. Tasks, reminders, and lists should all be within Google Calendar."
4911,George Wicks,"October 7, 2018",2," Really good app on phones, but very disappointing lack of computer version, so I can't check lists on my computer. Also no landscape mode makes it hard to use on tablets."
4912,Joshua Harrington,"December 21, 2018",3," Nice, clean and easy to use. Love the calendar and Gmail integration. As a few have already mentioned, still missing some features. Would love to have a widget and dark theme."
4913,Michael Jack,"June 9, 2019",3," Really awesome to do list tool, but widget support is kind of necessary. This is literally the only thing I'd want to have as a widget on my homepage but it doesn't have one....."

4918,Vasilis Asimopoulos,"September 18, 2018",1," I fail to see the usages it keep , calendar, tasks, assistant notes and shopping list...3-4 apps doing almost the job definitely not perfect!! put everything into one app and get the job done!!!"
4919,Hannah Jane,"September 15, 2018",3, An option to add a widget on the home screen would be nice. I also think the option to add time rather than just the date would be better so that the app knows what time to remind me of the task.
4920,Jennifer Serbin,"April 2, 2019",2, The app let's me make lists but it keeps changing the dates I set so they are on the wrong day or just mixed up. I keep getting confused on what needs to he done and it can't even do such a basic function.
4921,Shubrank Mukhiya,"February 8, 2019",2," Tasks captured on mobile does not show up in Calendar. Pointless if there is no 2 way instant sync. UX: Too much finger movement experienced. Plus, no natural language processing is a huge turn off."
4922,Nick Auskeur,"January 9, 2019",2," Its very simple, which is fine. Only 2 stars as it doesnt integrate with the Google Calendar mobile app, which beggars belief really. That needs rectifying."
4923,A Google user,"December 4, 2018",3," It's good but could be better. Web version, drag and drop, reminders, priority, color coding, ... I like the minimal approach"
4924,Christopher White,"March 10, 2019",2," Pretty weak app. Why was tasks on Inbox more intelligent than this? Reminders on Inbox was great, it recognized the date/time as you typed in in this description. This is just incredibly basic."
4925,Emmanuel Izuchukwu,"March 12, 2019",3, This app should have a reminder alarm to remind the user of the time to complete a scheduled task or remind the user of uncompleted tasks. please try hard and add this feature. Thanks.
4926,A Google user,"November 20, 2018",2," Better than before, but many features missing for a tasks app. Setting a time for due date isn't possible and integration with calendar is poor (at least in mobile)."
4927,René Postelmans,"November 1, 2018",3," Nice, simple app. But it should have a better reminder system. It would be great if it could be integrated with google reminders and google home/google assistant."
4928,A Google user,"January 16, 2019",4," it's a good app, but it lacks a few features that could make it great - such as a slide to delete and a dark mode. nontheless I prefer it for it's Google connection and simple, modern design."
4929,Jon Walson,"March 19, 2019",1," Nope, does not sync into Google Calender in the app. Only desk top and when you use google assistant it will not pull up the tasks just repeats other apps and ways to get tasks done but now what you have in the desktop google calender let alone in my tasks."

4931,Steve Ferson,"September 21, 2018",2, No reminders and no widget available. What's the point in having a list of tasks to do if you have to actively go find and open the app to find out if you have tasks to do. This should be pushed to me!
4932,Weston Zentner,"November 25, 2018",1," This app doesn't let you categorize or have reoccurring tasks. This is great as a simple tool, but not for someone who organizes by areas in their life."
4933,John Budnik,"June 3, 2019",3, Good for creating tasks but I really miss the integration into the google calender (why is it possible on the desktop version and not on the mobile one?) and the option for a widget.
4934,Juanjo GA,"June 18, 2019",2," It´s simple ... you introduce all the features that Todoist already has and I´ll switch. Until that moment, it´s just a useful reminder for periodical tasks."
4935,Shankar Shankar,"June 22, 2019",3, This app has become much more useful now. Feeling somewhat statisfied for persisting with this app and not uninstalling it. List and Task sharing is the one feature i miss a lot in this app compared to other todo app. Hopefully google makes this feature available soon.
4936,Sarah Fernandes,"July 4, 2019",3, Just downloaded this and immediately noticed that it doesn't have a widget option like most other todo list apps (on android at least). Would really benefit from this feature or having scheduled tasks show up on the Google calendar app and widget.

4939,Pilsy,"July 19, 2019",5, Simplistic but (/and therefore) excactly what I need. Designed in the familiar Google design which makes it not only satisfying to look at but also easy to use. All I missed was the dark mode. Otherwise perfect if you need a simple app just to track your tasks!
4940,Craig Harlow,"February 13, 2020",5," Great app, use it often"
4941,St. Gabriel Men's Group,"February 11, 2020",4," Great, but needs a search function to get 5 stars."

4946,Jeff Armon,"July 12, 2019",3, Widgets would be very helpful here. I think notifications are not working well. I like how simple it looks. I'd like to see how many tasks I have from each list all at once.
4947,Digna M.,"October 24, 2018",4," While it is a great app, I would recommend somethings:  - Repeat tasks. - A place or label where you can find all the tasks that you have for today.  BTW, it is great! Keep working!"
4948,TSX,"March 9, 2019",3," Good lightweigh App, easy to sync with EPIM, Lightning..., but please add landscape mode so it can be used on tablets or, even better, integrate it in Google Calendar like on the web interface."
4949,A Google user,"February 26, 2019",5," Everything about Google Tasks app till now is great! A great minimalistic app to use, especially to get things done.

4950,Prasoon Agrawal,"September 13, 2018",3, I am not receiving reminders on due dates. And my tasks doesn't show up on the Calendar app on my android phone but it does so when I open calendar on my laptop. I think an option of general setting should be added
4951,Tyler Kehrein,"January 10, 2019",2," really want to love it. I do the love the design aspect of the app and you're the features it has work. One issue though, there is absolutely no features. barebones can be good but this app is 100% skeleton"
4952,Munawar Ismaili,"May 7, 2019",3, I enjoy the google ecosystem very much. I wish there would be a more cohesive app similar to the browser where Tasks and Keep are integrated with the Calendar. Also it is outrageous that this app has no widgets.
4953,Devyn Prange,"October 1, 2018",4, I think it could use a practical widget for the home screen to make the app a lot more efficient and easy to access without launching the app. Good app none the less.
4954,Stanley Rodgers,"April 1, 2019",3," This definitely needs a widget or, at a minimum, persistent notifications for tasks that have not been completed or moved/updated in terms of due date and time."
4955,Utkarsh Agrawal,"September 29, 2018",4, Great application to list the tasks. Has provision for creating tasks under different headings. It would be great if Google can add scheduler to this app. Which will let the users schedule the listed tasks for the next day or the day he selects
4956,Amanda S,"November 30, 2018",3, I love the minimalist design and it's really easy to use. The only thing it's missing for me is I can't make tasks recurring. That would make it a 5 star app.
4957,Yanis B.,"June 4, 2019",3," It's descent. However, being able to see all lists and each of their tasks would be nice. Also, syncing tasks to Google calendar would be nice."
4958,Pijus Leonavicius,"July 3, 2019",3," missing quality of life features: 1) swipe sideways in the list to move to another list. come on this is basic! 2) option to edit to which list the task belongs, now you need to recreate the task in the other list. very lame."
4959,Sirajo Sirajo,"August 13, 2019",3," For repeating tasks, changes made on one instance doesn't replicate to other instances. Secondly, a repeating task should not be placed under 'completed' until all its instances have been completed. Going back to Google Reminders for now."
4960,Andrew Jones,"August 11, 2019",3, Good app and I like that it's made by google but there are some things that I wish they would give us more control over. I still feel like it's not completely integrating with Google calendar.
4961,Prayook Jatesiktat,"October 29, 2019",5," Finally, Google Tasks is now complete with widget! The dark theme is still buggy but that is not a big deal."
4962,Nigel,"October 21, 2019",2, It's too basic and hard to manage tasks. Having a calendar view with summary of tasks for each day would have helped a lot on visualising the tasks and managing them better. I didn't like the whole flow of this app.
4963,Sharath Mohandas,"November 15, 2019",5, Great app for managing tasks. Lacking the feature of sharing a task list with other people.
4964,David Bowring,"December 3, 2019",2," Not fit for purpose. Syncs data and reverts to it's previous state, wiping all your entries."

4969,Alessio Machianovsky,"September 30, 2018",1," You cannot duplicate lists. Sometimes, for example for a speech, you need to undo everything for do it again. With this app you can't. C'mon Google! Really?"
4970,Raffaelina Ianieri,"October 9, 2018",1, Awful. Doesn't let you do very much in terms of reminding at specific times. You literally have to go into the app to check what needs to be done. Much rather would use Google Keep.
4971,Enes Ky,"January 8, 2019",4, I really like the app. But it definitely needs DARK mode. And i wanted to add date with hours but it only has date picker. It doesnt have it's own widget. It could be cool.
4972,Luigi Molato,"January 18, 2019",5, I don't get the hate. The app is supposed to be simple and it's doing a fine job at that. Not to mention it has a very neat design as all Google apps do. SUGGESTION: Enable swiping left or right to move through different task lists.
4973,Mohamed Ihab Talaat,"November 3, 2018",3," Much improved than original Tasks that was neglected for a long time. Though, it is a bit redundant, Google keep is a simple similar app with richer features."
4974,Mike McColley,"March 21, 2019",2," OK, but Google Keep is much more intuitive and logical for check box To-Do lists. Keep does lists, notes, reminders, has quick labeling for lookups Been using keep for a while and can't see any reason to switch to Tasks"
4975,Edward Estillore,"March 27, 2019",3, It would be better if it can be sync to google calendars and vice versa. task to sync to google calendars. since it would be easier to track task and manage daily task in any of the teo productivity app
4976,Amir a,"April 29, 2019",2," Doesn't cover reminders?!so seems not in full coordination with calendar.in calendar app reminders are main elements of task managing , but here tasks are, why not cover both in this useful app?or maybe combine them at all..?"
4977,Erlen Mahilum,"September 21, 2018",4," I wish this will soon have a pop-up feature --like the one in messenger, so we can check-out or create a new task while we're on a different app or is viewing a site. :)"
4978,Jay Perry,"September 27, 2018",1, Utterly useless why ?  Because it only works in bloody portrait mode !!!  It's totally unusable on my Pixel C tablet or any tablet due to a lack of landscape support.   Really Google !?!  Fix your $h!t !!
4979,John J Marchetti,"January 15, 2019",4, Basic task list app. There is a lot of potential for improvement. Allowing subtasks to be collapsed into the primary task would be a welcome improvement.
4980,Philip Arff,"November 17, 2018",1," No consistent integration with Google Assistant or Google Calendar on mobile. This app has no real value, yet! If these features are added it will be perfect."
4981,Paul Bailey,"June 18, 2019",3, The app is clean. Only a light theme is available. My major hold back is the ability to Share To this app does not exist. It really hampers my workflow. MS ToDo & ToDoist both have this feature.
4982,Seth Nichols,"August 23, 2019",4," Great app, but one main issue: Subtasks should group up under their parent task like they do when sorting by ""my order"" when sorting by date. There should at least be an option for this."
4983,Bryan Rucinski,"September 13, 2019",3," Please add the ability to receive task notification reminders!! It's weird that I can create my tasks in this app, but to be reminded of my tasks I have to make completely separate nofications in my Google calendar. Seems unnecessary! Just add notification integration here."
4984,Nichole Johnson,"September 17, 2019",3," I like the app and it's concept, but WHY IS THERE NO WIDGET TO PUT MY TASK LIST ON MY HOMESCREEN?!?! Pretty much makes the task list obsolete for me... Bc I keep having to open the app... And it's doesn't remind me about past due tasks either."
4985,Vh Vy,"October 4, 2019",2," Interface and working is good. BUT, nice and informative home screen widget is only BIG missing part of this. I am really waiting for something better innovative and productive compared to other task and reminder apps."
4986,Tom Bell,"October 17, 2019",4, It's good. Wish I could create sub task and have individual due dates for each one. Other than that it works great. Love that it shows up in my calander. Be nice if it did on the calendar app on my pixel as well.
4987,ekpekurede samuel,"October 25, 2019",3," Too keep things short. I love Google, would probably be happy if all my apps were google but I'm giving 3 stars for this because; 1. No option to link it with google calendar 2. No screen overlay bubble to be able to take notes while in other apps"
4988,Stephanie Anne Raya,"October 30, 2019",4, Great app to organize tasks. It'd be great if there could ask be a dark theme for the widget or just more widget options in general.
4989,Fabian B.,"March 2, 2020",4, Deleting messages is exhausting
4990,Bryn Gale,"March 16, 2020",4, Love how simple this app is.
4991,Patricia Jenkins,"April 7, 2020",5," Very easy to set task, and have copy."
4992,A Google user,"January 15, 2019",2," Well, this app from Google seems to be minimalistic and sleek in its interface but that's the only pro I could observe. Just a Basic app, neither provides a widget support nor a reminder. Long way to go."
4993,John Lin,"November 13, 2018",3," I like its integration with Google calendar on PC, but as an app this is too simple. May consider making a widget for it, or let it be shown in the widget of Google calendar."
4994,A Google user,"February 21, 2019",3, I like the layout but it needs labels as well as folders like Gmail has. I want all my tasks to appear in the my tasks/ homepage as well as in folders/ labels. It also need a pin option.
4995,Kosta Augoustidis,"November 4, 2018",5, I love the new user interface and love how I can create subtasks!!  The one thing I see missing is time to be entered next to the day..  that also can be connected to the calendar.
4996,Larry Seaman,"October 8, 2018",2, I accidently ticked a task as done and I don't know which it was (whether important it not) and the is no way of undoing the delete. Also no way of asking if the delete to go ahead e.g. a confirmation message. SO annoying and basic!
4997,Dale Evans,"October 15, 2018",3," Great app, But would really use it more if there was widget feature for home screen, for that reason I've still got to use Microsoft todo app, sorry Look forward to seeing an update on this,as mention as well in a previous review"
4998,Jack Bell,"January 2, 2019",4," Good app for simple task keeping. initiative and easy to use. I gave it 4 stars only because it does not have a integrated widget, which would make the app ideal."
4999,A Google user,"March 6, 2019",2, Nice clean user interface but not even basic features like repeated tasks. Maybe useful for shopping lists but not much more. Hopefully this will change soon.
5000,A Google user,"November 13, 2018",1, Does not integrate with the Google calendar app. Cannot easily set up recurring tasks and tasks that recur after completion. No good for me. Tapir apps aCalendar+ best.
5001,Gui Mellon,"October 23, 2018",3, It's missing some functionalities like reminding you at a specific time. Also sometimes it does not notify you of the task.
5002,Hamad Alam,"April 17, 2019",3, I think Google Task should have a Search Option Because If I Want To Search Something On The Google Task it's currently not available. so I hope you will add this most important feature in the next update.
5003,Norma Chang,"October 24, 2018",1," Can't add recurring tasks, removes existing recurring tasks randomly and is unstable in website. For a multi billon dollar company this app is half assed. There's more things it can't do than it can do."
5004,Bryan Glasel,"March 27, 2019",1, Why does this not show my tasks/reminders/whatever from the rest of the bloody Google ecosystem? This is such a bare bones piece of garbage I have to expect it to be shutdown after languishing untouched and unsupported for a year or so. Skip this and get an app with actual features and functionality...Full ReviewWhy does this not show my tasks/reminders/whatever from the rest of the bloody Google ecosystem? This is such a bare bones piece of garbage I have to expect it to be shutdown after languishing untouched and unsupported for a year or so. Skip this and get an app with actual features and functionality.
5005,Najwa S,"February 20, 2019",2," I can't do much here. Installed it because I add task from calendar in PC, but it doesn't even appear in phone calendar. There is no widget so I can see the task easier. So please integrate with phone calendar too and add widget."
5006,Jalal Sela,"June 1, 2019",5," This app is really awesome, it lacks a lot of features but still, the fact it is simple and easy to use makes it perfect for planning my day/week without complicating my life! (keep it simple)"
5007,Justin White,"July 9, 2019",5," Best take on todos I've seen in a while. It's simple, but not lacking in features. It would be nice if subtasks could be scheduled, or if you could share a list with someone for collaboration, but those aren't dealbreakers for me."
5008,Ilya Katun,"August 19, 2019",3," It's very simple application that is integrated with Google services like Calendar, Gmail, however it lacks functionality like by date view or taday tasks, it has no integtation with Calendar on mobile. I hope soon it will become more powerfull"
5009,Sarah Cooke,"September 17, 2019",5," GREAT APP! Love how this app is set up. It allows me to organize all of my lists, to dos, and reminders in one spot. Very easy to use and happy I can fit it all under one app. 10/10 recommend!"
5010,Syn Challenger,"October 4, 2019",3, Google tasks helps me to remember my many tasks that I do throughout the day. Only wish I could color code my tasks. I am a visual person and it would make things easier to see as a glance
5011,Jeffrey Parker,"October 7, 2019",2, Missing way too many features to be useful. * No list sharing * No viewing tasks on Google Calendar for Android (only web) * No website for viewing tasks (only through Gmail panel) * No Android widget for listing tasks * Poor integration with Google Assistant
5012,Jay R,"October 14, 2019",2, This could be so much better! I want to use this app but the functionality is way too basic. Google needs to add more features akin to every other to do list out there plus some. This app seriously lacks.
5013,Evan Fowler,"October 18, 2019",3," I didn't use this app for very long, but I was disappointed by the lack of task prioritization. if you're just looking for a simple, clean task list, this might be a better fit for you"
5014,Kevin David,"October 29, 2019",4," Really simple, minimalistic. Only thing it misses is a dark mode which is a must for me Hope u add it soon"
5015,Christopher Figaro,"November 7, 2019",4, Great and all. Just one problem. It needs to be connected to Google calendar please.
5016,A Google user,"November 11, 2019",2, Very Boring App NO COLOUR! Please add colour to tasks so it makes it easier to see through large lists!
5017,Stephanie Howes,"November 13, 2019",2, I like this app but the fact that a sub-task isn't stickied to the main task (when created and when tasks are reordered) means someone failed UI/UX 101.
5018,Lokkeshwar Sai Balachandran,"January 15, 2020",5, A Great App for Task Reminders
5019,Alex Lachapelle,"February 12, 2020",5, Great task app all good overall
5020,Carlos in Simpsonville,"February 10, 2020",5, Intergrates perfectly with Gmail and is easy to use
5021,Dinesh Kumar K,"March 19, 2020",5, Very useful application
5022,Jason K,"April 3, 2019",1," Inferior in every way to the 10+ year old canvas ui that has just been killed off. Worthless ""modern"" design that puts looks before actual usability, just like every recent Google product and update."
5023,yadiggi Digg,"March 5, 2019",4, the 4 stars instead of 5 is not being able to set reoccurring tasks weekly. i have a task app that has that now and its a shame even google doesnt. come on google get it together.
5024,Alan Roche,"December 13, 2018",2," Needs better Gmail integration. When creating tasks in the app, I don't see any way to link the task to an email - key missing feature. Also needs reminders as in calendar events."
5025,Hex Google,"December 28, 2018",3, App works great but visually it needs some work: Changing fonts & adding color/a dark mode. Adding the calendar syncing made the app viable BUT if you want this app to thrive it NEEDS to have sharable lists
5026,Marco Pagnussat,"November 1, 2018",4, Very useful starting point. Although...no time deadline (only date). And no widget to keep it directly active on the phone..but forced to open the full app
5027,Tomi Stojanovic,"November 5, 2018",3," The app is ok I guess... But it would be so much better if you integrate it with Google Keep! Also, I don't see a reason why it doesn't have a widget option (a simple one)..."
5028,Vipul Chasta,"June 30, 2019",5," Best App For Managing Tasks. There is no doubt in google products. Tasks can be easily managed using this app. Tasks can be created through mail also, some times gmail itself will give you suggestion to create a task by reading the email. So I would recommend this app to everyone."
5029,Sahil Shah,"August 8, 2019",1, I've given it 1 star to bring your attention to the fact that it should work by adding day and time itself in the task when we add it the task title itself + a small widget + ability to drag tasks to different dates.
5030,hari krishna alla,"August 13, 2019",4, its allowing to add either subtasks or to set repeat. if there is an option to link with other Google apps like calendar to see other tasks on that day maps to know traffic and bus routes to complete the task at different locations
5031,Shaunny,"September 13, 2019",3, Kinda prefer GTasks atm. But honestly TickTick kicks Ass! Beats all the rest I'm going on my 3rd year as a paid subscriber and omg it has helped my ADHD so much and to free my mind. Free version most features though; check it out!
5032,Ben Burke,"October 18, 2019",3," Not bad, better than reminders which I still don't know what's that for. Currently not able to see reoccurring tasks on my todo list. Hopefully will be updated soon."
5033,A Google user,"September 23, 2018",4," The clean interface, and ease of use are the best things. Missing features 1. A widget! 2. The ability to manually sort tasks. There are two auto sorts, but no manual."
5034,Jim Crutchfield,"November 10, 2019",1, Why isn't this app integrated with the calendar app? (This app can import tasks from Calendar but Calendar can't show tasks from this.) Why must we have two separate apps? Uninstalling.
5035,abid saifeddine,"March 20, 2020",3," Easy to use and nice app, missing some features though."
5036,gabriel gadbois,"March 17, 2019",5," very clean and simple, would be nice if the tasks could be integrated into calendar like on pc. small efficiency things, like full details in notification inatead of just it saying how many tasks etc. thanks for all you do!"
5037,ABRAR SHAIKH,"January 15, 2019",1, Very basic application with very poor appearance. As per Google's standard it is not fit at all. Required lots of improvement even though suggested many times no response or update received in this regards.
5038,Scott Wakeem,"April 8, 2019",4," Generally works well. It is pretty simple, which I like, as well as easy syncing across devices. The only thing is that I'd like more sorting option for my lists, like alphabetical."
5039,David Costello,"September 28, 2018",3," I feel the same way as many other reviewers- this app works great, but it REALLY needs some widgets and a way to tie in with Google calendar for me to truly enjoy using it."
5040,Iyobosa Evbayowieru,"February 1, 2019",4," It's a very good app. It does almost everything I want. I think the app needs a password feature. There are some tasks that I wouldn't want someone else to see when they use my phone. So, it be nice if I could use a password for some apps."
5041,Marcus Vielsted,"February 11, 2019",2," Good design and ease of use, but lacking a lot of features. No recurring task, no tagging, no color coding, no way to see all task at once, etc."
5042,Henry M,"September 13, 2018",5," Google tasks works super well with my pebble watchapp. Would put more than just 5 stars because peviously had to insert thru gmail but now can do it with this app which is much better. Like, super good"
5043,Matt Buckley,"February 10, 2019",3," No widgets and lack of precise reminders make if difficult to use as an effective task management app. Nonetheless, a clean UI and standard features make it adequate if used alongside Google Keep."
5044,Adriano Di Candia,"November 6, 2018",1, Does not integrate with gmail mobile app. In iOS the integration works fine. See below In chrome and iOS if I click on task attached email it opens the gmail app. On Android there is no such integration and it is stuck.
5045,Humphrey Makere,"June 16, 2019",1," is this a replicate of google keep?. and the fact none of your app are available in Windows stores i cant use them to sync in my device.. i hope this will end up like google+, hangout, alo and many more since your dont share to other platforms"
5046,Modern Nglide Games,"June 26, 2019",3," I would give more stars if you could share a list to another google user, seems like this app is just lacking basic functions.It looks nice, and works great if your working solo. Google is usually more inclusive."
5047,The Guy,"July 11, 2019",4," Good app for making a To Do list. Please add the ability to add colors for the heading texts, or at least make the heading texts bolder. Also please let us arrange the to dos in the order we like. Great app other than that."
5048,Ravindra Deshmukh,"July 20, 2019",1," Color customization must be added, to improve UI and better identification, color also makes the app attractive. Color must show task preferences and importance and differentiate from one another, when large number of task is there...."
5049,SHANA,"January 27, 2020",5, Simple and minimalistic
5050,Rani Dhakare,"February 21, 2020",5, Very nice and useful.export to excel file option required

5052,Leah Guthrie,"September 15, 2018",5, The only change I'd suggest is the ability to set recurring tasks without having to enter them each time they are due. Otherwise I like the ease of it.
5053,Edwin Lee,"December 18, 2018",2," It's got really basic features for a Google app. A good start but for some reason deleting the first list is forbiddened, and that alone frustrated me to no end."
5054,Steve,"September 20, 2018",1," Doesn't even integrate with reminders. Google keeps making random apps that have same functionality, yet keeps competing with itself or what, it's insane."
5055,Fadhli Suib,"May 12, 2019",3, Missing search and sort by alphaphet. I used it to store notes also. It's difficult to find old notes because i have to scroll down a lot.
5056,Brian Myers,"November 6, 2019",4, This is app is now almost perfect. The one feature I really need is the ability to create a task from Google Assistant.
5057,Andy Kennedy,"September 21, 2018",2," Usual Google half baked release. Doesn't sync with calendar, can't understand why this exists as well as keep. Confusing mess of apps from Google once again. SORT IT OUT!"
5058,Renee Pulver-Johnson,"December 25, 2018",3, Would be great to set timed reminders and ability to view all Tasks in one pane. does not integrate with Google calendar app either which is super disappointing. a good start but needs a LOT of work.
5059,Sentinel Equinox,"October 6, 2018",4, I love this app but it absolutely NEEDS widgets. Something as simple as checking off tasks on the fly would suffice instead of keeping this app pinned and open constantly.
5060,Jakob Helgi Þórðarson,"October 29, 2018",3," This is... Far too barebones. Critically, you need both time (not just dates) for tasks and reminders for them. Reminders for personl tasks lists, if not team lists"
5061,zaem ab aziz,"June 15, 2019",3," i hope google will include this app in the google calendar. just add the 4th option beside reminder event goal. and of course, you should sync with the calender. lastly, provide some widget for this app."
5062,Nick McManus,"June 20, 2019",2," It's way too simple and lacks so many features. Microsoft todo is a much better app. Only 2 sort options, no ""settings"" page in the app, no dark mode, just not usable for a heavy todo list user"
5063,Pak Ho Wong,"July 29, 2019",1," 1) Better to have a ""widget"". 2) Better to have separate ""due date/time"" and ""notification date/time"". 3) Better to have more levels of ""sub-tasks"". Microsoft's To-do app is a far better choice."
5064,arshinder singh,"August 10, 2019",3, The fact that this is easy to read and syncs with gmail is amazing. what's not great though is the lack of a widget and a timeline feauture which could integrate all of my lists. Wish this could be integrated.
5065,Tomás O'Hara,"October 14, 2019",1," The interface is horrendous, especially when considering that it is from the company developed the OS, etc.! Some significant problems: - No search capability. - Minimal sorting option - No support for landscape mode"
5066,Lord Persi,"October 19, 2019",4," I really like this app but there's room for improvement , I would love to hide subtasks and keep my stuff more clean and organized , and I would also love to be better inigrated with Google calendar mobile app so I can see my tasks there !"
5067,Juan Carlos Dunick,"October 30, 2019",1," DOES NOT AUTOSAVE In today's market and especially all Google's online online programs everything autosaves.... Except this app. Fail Google, fail."

5073,Wasim Khan,"October 4, 2018",4, Very nice app having elegant look.. My suggestion is kindly provide Priority option to tasks along with colour code to each type of priority which will be quite helpful if a person has number of tasks
5074,A Google user,"October 5, 2018",4, It would be nice if it had a widget so you could see your tasks on your home screen. Also would be nice if tasks that have due dates showed up in your Google calendar like reminders.
5075,Bryan Sills,"April 8, 2019",3," Repeating tasks are still wonky. As a user, I expect the next instance of my task to appear in my list as soon as I check off my current instance of the task."
5076,A Google user,"December 14, 2018",3," I really like the simplicity of the app and I really want to keep on using it, but it's a huge let down that it doesn't have a widget. If only it had a widget, I would rate it 5 stars"
5077,jose vega,"September 14, 2018",1, I need subtasks. This was supported perfectly both on the desktop and the app options. Why isn't it possible here? Seems like an easy function to add
5078,Michael Wilson,"November 20, 2018",1," Overly simplified task management tool that is so stripped down that it is practically useless. It's free, so no loss to play with, but useless."
5079,Stephanie Emmiline,"January 3, 2019",3," I like this app. However, it needs a few features: add a time for reminders not just the day, needs a widget, & repeating tasks."
5080,Ragesh Shah,"April 8, 2019",4," Good application. However, it would have been better if Keep and Tasks could be in single application. Tasks, Notes and Reminders all in one would be better idea. Reminders to be integrated with Calendar as well."
5081,Jordan Kicklighter,"September 23, 2018",3," Well planned UI with a few missing pieces. Needs a view for ""today,"" ""this week"" etc. that combines tasks from multiple lists. Also want a WearOS version."
5082,A Google user,"January 26, 2019",1, I think Inbox is much better than this app. I am so sorry to see Inbox get kicked to the curb. I will change my review if I decide I like this app as much as Inbox.
5083,melu varkey,"November 1, 2018",4," Plz add reminder time.it doesn't have an option to share tasks to other apps or copy from other apps..or it doesn't have a widget...even though layout and list, task, subtask arrangement makes the app very good, the drawbacks are unacceptable"
5084,Naudé Group,"February 15, 2019",3," Is there any way that you can create an app widget to add to home screen of device that syncs your tasks loaded on Google calendar to appear in a list form, as appose to physically having to open the Google Task app. Similar to Google Calendar Events/Reminders widget."
5085,Luiz Gustavo,"April 9, 2019",3," It is disappoint to see that Google Tasks has no integration with the Calendar app as the website do. Two apps from the same company that do not talk to each other, it is ridiculous."
5086,Benjamin Palfi,"May 29, 2019",3, Good start to a useful tasks app. Badly needs a widget so I can see my upcoming tasks on my home screen. I'm going to stick to reminders in Google Keep until this feature is added.
5087,Matthew J Spaeth,"June 15, 2019",2," can only have one level of subtasks, cant have subtasks on a repeating task, no way i could find to set reminders/notification style, etc. just find a different tasks app that works with your calendar, cause this one won't"
5088,Paul Maddock,"July 31, 2019",2," very basic. not sure if this is supposed to replace reminders on android or not, since remindrrs hasnt been working properly for almost one year now. abandonware?"
5089,Aaron Huang,"September 20, 2019",3," It's a nice way of keeping track of your to do list, but the app lacks many needed features, such as calendar integration on mobile and useful recurring tasks."
5090,Anamaria Acosta,"October 2, 2019",3, Overall good but would be much better with dropped features like allowing multiple levels and ability to order lists. Would also be great to be able to share lists.

5101,A Google user,"January 13, 2019",3, Useful and beautiful but have very limited options. You cannot add time in tasks. Google should take a look at it.
5102,Samson Omoyele,"March 18, 2019",3," Simple to use, great that it intergrates seamelessly with google calendar. What's missing is a simple, easy to use widget."
5103,A Google user,"February 5, 2019",2," Creating repeating tasks is a pain. Also, getting the a complete to-do list from all lists doesn't appear to be possible."
5104,Ryan Drais,"March 27, 2019",5," The addition of recurring tasks really tied this application together for me. I was pleasantly surprised that it automatically imported my reminders for me. Beautiful design, Google did a wonderful job with this app."
5105,Daniel Rowen,"September 17, 2018",3," Very minimal, would prefer more options, and home screen widgets with adjustable color/theme and transparency would be helpful.  Also a Wear OS app so I can view and check things off on my watch as you can with Keep."
5106,Zach Christensen,"May 7, 2019",3, Getting better with notifications and calendar integration. Needs a view for all list items combined. Also should be able to add tags for common categories between lists tjat can in turn be used as an option for viewing
5107,A Google user,"March 20, 2019",3," I would like to use time in addition to date. Visibility of the tasks in Calendar app should be provided. Otherwise, it's a good app."
5108,A Google user,"March 27, 2019",4, excellent and very much needed function of repeated tasks but still not sure how would a repeated task get recreated after I mark complete one instance. it should auto create a new one once one instance is marked complete.
5109,Danilo Orozco,"October 2, 2018",3," There's a glitch where when u try to sign in, it says ""account already exists on this device"" but then there's no option to actually bring you to see your tasks."
5110,A Google user,"January 31, 2019",4," The app is very good. Material design is superb. Just one comment though, kindly add a feature for time reminder. Right now only date reminder is available. Time and location reminder will make this app unbeatable."
5111,Tess Druelinger,"May 23, 2019",3, This app is the best i have found yet but i wish it was paired with Google assitant so i cxould use voice command to input tasks. It also has no widgets which does not help its usefulness
5112,A Google user,"December 22, 2018",2, Rubbish my device slipped out of my hand and marked tasks as read and there is no undo! I had to manually release input which is no fun. cant import from Google keep! or calendar gmail.
5113,Saptanshu Sarkar,"April 18, 2019",5, Amazing experience. please don't uselessly complicate the UI. Simplicity is the best thing about the app.
5114,Bas de Ridder,"March 4, 2019",1," Why bother with an extra app. So much nicer and better out there  Why not integrate it properly? And give people the chance to assign tasks to shared calendar. Half arsed job , Like Google+ and Picassa"
5115,PRADEEP GUPTA,"June 23, 2019",5, Task Priority option with color code not given. Please provide priority options with Red color for high priority task. And Don't Remove Past high priority task without completion.
5116,Masae Muller,"May 21, 2019",1," I cannot have my lists in the order I want and every time I give a due date to a task the entire list is moved out 8f seqence. I miss the ability to have all your due dates listed and sorted by today, tomorrow and next 7 days."
5117,Ben Klein,"April 7, 2019",4, Missing out on home screen widgets! Takes too many taps just to add a task! With Inbox there was the one tap reminder widget which I thought was great.
5118,Jared Lim,"July 7, 2019",4, App works smoother than baby oil now. Thanks! I'd like to suggest a feature: maybe adding a widget for the home screen might be nice so we can see what we need to do from the home screen.
5119,Rahul Kumar,"June 30, 2019",3," Its simple and clean. Very effective and has all the required features. keep it that way, just add a widget where we can vote view our task without opening the app, like you have in keep"
5120,Kenshee Dicdican,"August 15, 2019",1," Google Tasks has been very bare bones, the UI is empty and its very basic. It lacks the features that every other to-do apps have. Google, a multi-billion company, cant even make this any better?! Worse than Apple Reminders and Microsoft To-Do. 😤"
5121,Rose B,"August 29, 2019",4," I like this app, and I love being able to view my tasks on my phone and computer, but I really wish there were a widget with my top tasks for my home screen! That would make it perfect."
5122,Tom Barlow,"February 23, 2020",5," Simple to use, works well!"
5123,J. Simon,"March 13, 2020",4, Didn't like it at first but it grew on me with features I never knew it had.
5124,Kavindu Rankothge,"March 17, 2019",3, Very useful. I would like to make a suggestion. Could you'll pls add a wiget feature. It would be very useful to keep in track of my tasks. Hope you see this.
5125,Abdullah Alsanad,"December 17, 2018",2, It is impossible to move a group tasks between lists. No widget. No recurring tasks. You cannot view multiple lists on the same view (desktop's sidebar).
5126,Wayne Wilson,"May 22, 2019",3," Will update as features are added. 2. Make a swipe left or right move to next list. 3. Give option to have checked tasks stay on list, but be checked off and strike through rather than dissapear."
5127,Navneet Shukla,"December 21, 2018",4," i would like to see one more additional feature, location tagging with task list.. suppose if i visit a nearby store, the app should notify me of the list i made for that store to purchase from... Thanks and looking forward to it.."
5128,Oshur Ozodi,"September 29, 2018",3," Very pleasant design. It would be good to have ""today"" list that shows only due today tasks from different lists. And widget!"
5129,Jajati Keshari Dev,"July 29, 2019",1, 29/07 - This app is still not up to the mark. Lot of work still needs to be done. 01/06 - Doesnt make any sense to have a to-do app with no option of time.
5130,Kevin Minor,"January 15, 2019",2, I wanted a to do list app that I could share my lists across devices but this doesn't support indented lists so I can't see the lists that I created on my laptop or iPad.
5131,Milton Davila,"September 26, 2018",1," It would be great if this app, would allow us to assign tasks to our co-workers, set deadlines and help us do some follow-up. There is an app named Asana, which can give you some ideas."
5132,Ambica Gayathri,"January 24, 2019",4," I like it. It's simple, minimalistic and works for my everyday to-do list. The subtasks feature is really nice. I'd like it if there was a feature for colors for tasks and changing the theme in general."
5133,Sean Thomson,"September 16, 2018",3," So simple, no customization, basic options, awkward interface. A solid performer that needs a lot more development..."
5134,Patrick Prince,"May 27, 2019",4," Pretty solid to-do list program with it's most recent updates, such as making repetitive tasks and some tweaks to the notifications. Still a bit of the way to go, but some great progress already made."
5135,ジョンソンユージーン,"September 17, 2019",1," It notifies of recurring tasks once, and only once. I cannot depend on this app, which is a shame. What a stupid app. Google just keeps getting worse and worse, same as Amazon."
5136,Chioniso Maguwudze,"July 1, 2019",5," I love this app so much!! It has a clean, minimalistic design, works offline, and has options for reminders, etc. Please make an online version of this. I would really love having access to my tasks online. Thank you!"
5137,Jonelle Alexander,"July 25, 2019",3, like the simple-ness if the app for my use however it needs a widget that can stay on my screen. I don't always hit the app to open but a having a widget when I'm scrolling through my screens would be so much more helpful.
5138,Richard Stober,"August 5, 2019",1, Repeating tasks work very intermittently. This needs to work 100% of the time. This also needs to work with assistant.
5139,Brandon Sov,"August 16, 2019",3," Would like a widget to ease task creation. It has a nice integration with Gmail, but that's about it. Lacks a lot of functionality I would get in other task apps."
5140,Angelique Cody,"September 2, 2019",5," Amazing, I have lists for work, home, and each kid. As well as a personal and ongoing list. I can invite my partner to see the list so we are always on the same page. 100% recommend!"
5141,NGUYET NGUYEN,"October 14, 2019",4," Great app pair with Google calendar viewing in one place, most convenient. Please enable dark mode I like to work on my task list before bed for tomorrow. Also allow to set task from 10-15mins tasks instead of 30mins tasks."
5142,Dmitry Fridman,"October 26, 2019",4, Reasonably well replaced inbox tasks. Inability to see all (email and tasks) in one android app is definite frustrating and let to me essentially not checking my email apart from desktop. Miss ability to sort within specific date. Would like to have an option of snoozed tasks disappear
5143,ilyas abduljawad,"November 22, 2019",5," Love this app, easy and direct"
5144,Tom Kulaga,"February 5, 2020",2, Microsoft todo is a much better and cohesive package with more frequent updates
5145,Gusnul Pribadi,"February 16, 2020",5, Simple Use. Great Apps!
5146,Milan Drmanovic,"February 19, 2020",5, Just great! Exactly what I need.
5147,Chris McLachlan,"March 4, 2020",5, This app is great for the purpose intended.
5148,Akshat Jain,"March 29, 2020",5, Nice App... But I Am A Programmer So I Am Asking You To Add Features For Programmers Like You And Me.
5149,The Wingets,"April 24, 2019",3," First impressions are good. Could do with a ""view all lists"" option, and some widgets... there are none!!"
5150,Kyle Amidon,"March 16, 2019",2, It cannot come near being able to compete with Microsoft's ToDo or Wunderlist... App needs overhauling because it's too basic. Add the ability to share lists.
5151,Michael B.,"September 30, 2018",2," 1) Tasks do not display on google calendar app 2) No widget functionality.  Literally, two of the most important things in a task app are missing from this task app... and it's a google product. How?"
5152,Hayden Crocker,"November 20, 2018",3, A lot of potential but lacking some serious basic functionality. The desktop version also needs a refresh to match the app.
5153,Ali Habib,"October 1, 2018",4, I think this is a very good app. Widgets is the most important thing that is missing in Google tasks. Google please make an update in which you include widgets for this app
5154,Jonas Hultberg,"March 5, 2019",2," No widget. Can't swipe between lists. No compact view. Not very user friendly UI. This app needs A LOT of work, especially since they're discontinuing the old google tasks."
5155,Roke Beedell,"October 17, 2018",4," Overall functional and integrates surprisingly well, but some of the UI seems a little rushed and some basic functionality's missing."
5156,Pritam Bagade,"December 10, 2018",2, Basic feature or task reminder is missing in this app which makes it useless for me 👎🏻. There are better apps than this. Google tasks needs to add features like Microsoft's To-Do app.
5157,Doug Henderson,"May 21, 2019",1, This app is a huge disapointment. It behaves like a beginners first app. It is not up to the high standard of design and implementation I expect from Google apps.
5158,Filip Krawczyk,"September 30, 2018",3," Interface is kinda pretty but isn't very intuitive or useful. The app itself has very limited functionality. Oh, and there's no wigdets"
5159,emmanuel obot,"April 8, 2019",4," I'm getting ""unknown server error, please try again later"" on clicking ""setup account"". What could be the problem?"
5160,Andrew Kirchner,"January 16, 2019",5, Love the app on my phone and laptop. Easy to use and great in combination with Google Calendar and Keep. It would be awesome to set the reminder on time to make it perfect.
5161,A Google user,"March 30, 2019",1," The UI is OK, but there is no system integration. Microsft To-Do has better integration, reminders and options."
5162,Vyacheslav Artemiev,"March 27, 2019",1, Awful. Doesn't notifies about overdued tasks. Doesn't show tasks in Android calendar app and widget. And it after suggestion to convert all calendar reminders to tasks without a chance to undo. Doesn't have a widget.
5163,Charles Ribas,"November 24, 2018",2," You cannot set up a daily task (repeat everyday), cannot set up the time and there is no widget. The idea is good but the execution is poor"
5164,Sagnavel Sodecva,"November 13, 2018",3, A widget is a must. It is great that I can see my stuff online but for android definitely requires an update. I hoping that it will be soon.
5165,Kevinn Ernest,"December 19, 2018",4," this apps is great and usefull in task usage, but still lacks of : 1. Google calendar integration 2. WIDGET ( oh come on.. its usefull feature). other than these, i think this is usefull, simple, functional apps"
5166,Caitlin DeAngelis,"June 6, 2019",2, Please integrate tasks into the google calendar app or fix the issue with reoccurring tasks not being visible after the current cycle is marked complete. I do not have use for the app if i cannot utilize it to plan ahead.
5167,Wemar Jonker,"June 27, 2019",4," Great simple ToDo with integration all over Google's products. Think Calender, Gmail. Only gripe is that you cant use Google Assistant to add tasks. There is an option to copy reminders from Google Assistant but its just not the same."
5168,Shivakumar Mahendrakar,"June 26, 2019",5, Excellent app. My suggestion is add voice command. It is easy to talk written than typing. Typing consuming more time.
5169,Alex K,"July 17, 2019",2," There are few ""must-have"" features to add: 1. Task priority 2. Labels (with filter option) 3. Dedicated ""start"" and ""reminder"" time You force me to use Todoist now)"
5170,Martin Dimov,"August 1, 2019",4," I like this app, because you can create some lists and put tasks in them. The only one thing that I don't like is that the reminder for the task is only one notification, like you have a new e-mail."
5171,Katherine M,"August 31, 2019",3, Simple and classy yes but this app lacks features like widgets and the ability to link into the calendars like on the desktop version of Google calendar. I want to love this but Microsoft makes a better app.....
5172,Sidram Bura,"November 2, 2019",2, No repeating task option for tasks with sub tasks. Repeating tasks doesn't show as upcoming tasks.
5173,Paul Lunn,"February 7, 2020",4, Functional and useful
5174,Marc O'Brien,"February 18, 2020",4, Works well. Very handy.
5175,Cathy Crandall,"February 19, 2020",5," Works well for me, but I'm not a power user. Simple is good."
5176,Bevan Box,"February 19, 2020",5, Simple no frills list making.
5177,Blake Reimer,"March 1, 2020",4, I use it frequently. It works for me!
5178,Darshan,"March 11, 2020",5, Simple and efficient
5179,Yogev DHL,"March 16, 2020",2, There is no support for Right to Left on new task....
5180,Vladi Avramov,"October 5, 2018",3," The app works like a charm, but it's a big let-down that Google didn't make just a simple widget for it, that would be sooo useful."
5181,Nameless Guy,"January 8, 2019",2," A great app, simple and functional. Sadly it dont have a widget to add to home screen like Microsoft To-Do offer. Will stick to Microsoft To-Do for now."
5182,Vipul Rawat,"March 27, 2019",4, Two things must needed after the time update. One sync tasks with google calendar and second dedicated web app rather the gmail plugin. Otherwise this is awesome.
5183,Mohammad Hosein Nosrati,"September 13, 2018",4," When you have no connection you can't manage your tasks! I remember such a problem in Think app , I hope you fix it in future updates"
5184,Ashan Widyarathna,"November 9, 2018",3," It would be nice if it has a feature to add time as well. Need more features like reminders as well. You can do this google.. untill them am gonna uninstall this and use my go to app ""Tick Tick"" ✌️ .."
5185,A Google user,"September 27, 2018",3," Honestly the layout is not the best in my opinion. I also, don't know when this app exists when Google keep has a much more robust task list feature."
5186,Tahseen,"December 16, 2018",2, It's like You can keep a short list in a note pad noting exciting. Too plain to be a app. There many task accomplishment app out there far better with more options and most importantly multidisciplinary
5187,Martino Henderson,"January 16, 2019",3, it would be great if the tasks could be integrated with Google Calendar like Reminders are. Sharing or assigning tasks to someone is a feature that this application desperately needs.
5188,MASTER ADI,"January 19, 2019",5," simple app ,perfect app. probably people like complicated things that's why so low rating. this app is meant to be used quickly and it does the job."
5189,Biswarup Koley,"February 23, 2019",4," Very Good Tasker app but has lack of the ""Date of Creation"" like Google Keep(has), so I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5. Hope the feature would be added in future."
5190,Saurabh Patil,"January 30, 2019",4," Liked it...Keep it as it is...Light, Fast, Easy. Don't make lot of changes. Give me options to change color to some extent"
5191,Henry Robinson,"April 2, 2019",1," Seriously, how can an app be so horrible. Added task on calendar and yet on the app the dates dont match. So simple. it messes up the one thi g it's designed to do"
5192,Jamison Lofthouse,"February 11, 2019",2, Doesn't support reminders by the hour and the notification is pretty broken. It shows up as a single bar and when tapped doesn't open the app. Good for only basic to-do list functions.
5193,Abhay Dandekar,"January 6, 2019",4," Fantastic App... Helps a lot to migrate from keep to tasks. Just one thing, it would be great if we could be able to add a date to subtasks while creating them. Thanks."
5194,Johanes Surya,"November 16, 2018",1," When you dont have any internet connection, your checklist save correctly, but when connection is on, all your data disappear."
5195,Justin Lee Thompson,"December 12, 2018",2," Between Google Tasks, Keep, and my shopping list I use with my Google home Google has three completely separate note/ reminder apps and this one has the worst feature of the three."
5196,Doug Cuts,"October 26, 2018",2," Minimal functionality. Can't figure out how to Search for tasks, make tasks Repeat, or add Widget shortcuts to the desktop. So I'll stick with GTasks for now."
5197,Demetrius Maximus,"October 16, 2018",2," Lacking so many basic features. Can't set time on reminders, only dates. Dumb. Needs a widget. Needs to integrate with existing Google reminders."
5198,A Google user,"April 11, 2019",5," I really appreciate the new updates which give notifications about the tasks, In addition if the team of developers could work on the tracking of the repeated tasks to keep a record, that would be great."
5199,Idan Noiman,"June 21, 2019",3," It can import Reminders, but then it doesn't work with Google Calendar anymore. Worse, the Assistant creates Reminders, not Tasks, so with this app I can't (really) use the Assistant anymore."
5200,Nilesh Vadnal,"July 21, 2019",2, Dear developer - disappoiting part is no reminder over phone as per scheduled date and time. would be great if it pops up with some reminder buzzer along with export import in excel format to ease the use of it more flexibly.
5201,Krishna Patel,"July 29, 2019",3," I like the app, I just wish it would sync with Google calendar or have a widget so I can have it up on my phone screen to see my task lists."
5202,Nicholas Lee,"August 6, 2019",4," Love this app, especially with the latest update with calendar events, reminders etc. The one big thing missing...Google Assistant integration. I want this to be my ONE task management app and not have to type my tasks in :)."
5203,A Google user,"August 23, 2019",3," Love the app. Really needs a dark mode. The lack of dark mode, throws me out of my ecosystem which consists of mostly dark mode apps. 5 stars if dark mode comes later."
5204,César Bouças,"September 9, 2019",4, Good app. Don't give 5 stars just because it can't sort list items alphabetically. I hope they include this functionality in the next updates.
5205,Aman Buradkar,"October 18, 2019",4," This app is too simple having no feature. It should be improved. You can add feature like due and expiration date, add tags, statistical report. In return you can add premium feature."
5206,Angelo Arrifano,"September 29, 2019",1," Useless. Task recurrence is broken, once a task is completed it just stays completed I don't see new recurrent tasks showing up. I see several threads on Google support about this but no resolution from Google yet."
5207,Marilyn Haber,"October 6, 2019",2, The app is really nice but it's not amazing! Why can't we see our task's due dates on the Google calendar! I'd rather open the calendar app on my phone than on the desktop... Please do something...
5208,Phu Ngo,"October 11, 2019",4," It is nice and sync with my acc very well. however, it would be nicer if there are some widgets which I can put on the homescreen so I dont have to open the app to check my tasks ."
5209,Anoop Asokan,"April 2, 2019",2," its good interface, great smoothness. It has option to copy reminders to tasks. But cannot sync new reminders straight to the app automatically. No options to use Google assistant."
5210,Rafael Dias,"November 13, 2019",1, Is hard to describe how useless a Google task app that does not sync with Google Calendar for mobile is.
5211,Eshan Saraogi,"February 10, 2020",5, helps in managing daily goals
5212,Christian Halvorsen,"February 12, 2020",5, Great app! Does it's job well.
5213,Tsungai Mukushi,"February 19, 2020",4, Need a way to send just to other tasks users
5214,Russell Dicks,"March 15, 2020",5, Practical and helpful
5215,Rauno Põld,"April 24, 2019",1," Awesome app, except for lack of integration. It's not possible to see task in google calendar app(desktop works). Come on, you're in the same company people..."
5216,Sabarish Narayana Das,"November 10, 2018",5, Simple and Awesome. Would be nice if you would allow to mark the task as high/medium/low priority.
5217,Soumyodip Kanrar,"February 26, 2019",3, Very basic. Improve it like others. Add repeat function. Love the calender integration and it is the only reason I downloaded the app
5218,James Aled Jones,"May 24, 2019",4," I like this app. Helps me organise all the different tasks in my life, work, personal and other. My only gripe is that once a sub task is completed it is no longer associated with its parent task"
5219,A Google user,"November 21, 2018",3, I'm excited to see Google adding a to do list and having it show next to Gmail. I wish there was a widget. That's a big drawback to me.
5220,Joshua Odom,"April 18, 2019",3, The app itself seems to work fine and helps me organize my task but I like using task widgets so I can quickly see my to do list and the lack of widget for G-Task is quite shocking.
5221,shaikh salman,"March 3, 2019",4," Good app, but today uninstalling due to no time reminder available. And all task from all categories of today's date to be see in one window not available."
5222,Lesa Dowdy,"May 2, 2019",2," This app gets 2 stars because it works...but it could work a lot better if there was a widget AND it integrated with Google Calendar. Otherwise, it's a pretty pointless app."
5223,Carl Morecroft,"September 12, 2018",1," It doesn't integrate with reminders, so what's the point? Google is touting this as part of replacing Inbox. Not like this it isn't. Useless."
5224,Mr. Unknown,"November 1, 2018",1, Why the title is not showing full of details of it what is point of this app if there is a list feature in Google Keep why would you make 2 apps which are doing the same job but Keep has more features this useless app needs to be deleted I mean you just put title no details
5225,Chippy Horton-Reynolds,"October 27, 2018",4," This is a really good to-do app. The only things I would like to see are; the ability to add a time to the due dates, a widget and recurring tasks."
5226,Joyce Hertrich,"November 15, 2018",3, My #1 wish to make this perfect would be the option to choose what time you want your alert to occur. The integration with other apps and Google products is great.
5227,Kaashyap Mithra,"February 1, 2019",2, the app is clean and simple. but it'll be more useful if we can set particular time for the reminder and sync with Google Calendar
5228,Palash Jain,"November 3, 2018",3," Nice, Simple, Clean app. Hope to see a feature to view different tasks from different lists all at once also please link it to google assistant so that we can add tasks directly using assistant"
5229,A Google user,"January 15, 2019",2," the app is nice, simple but sufficient. the only thing is missing (for me) is the ability to view task in the google calendar app"
5230,Kaleb Bagby,"September 24, 2018",4, Simple to use and looks good. Just wish there was a widget so I can get a quicker glance without actually opening the app.
5231,Ronny Hippler,"April 22, 2019",4, despite all the hate for reoccurring tasks not working initially they got that fixed pretty quick and now dismissing on one device clears it on all. now just make it work with assistant.
5232,Rawnak Wasi,"October 14, 2018",4, Clean interface. Easy to use. However the app really needs a widget for home screen. Would substantially enhance productivity.
5233,Maria Fernanda Alvarez,"July 9, 2019",4, NEEDS A WIDGET and it'll get 5 stars from me. This app comes in very handy when I don't have my physical agenda near me. Very easy to use both on the browser (as an extension on gmail) and on the phone.
5234,Leandro Kemp,"July 28, 2019",3," It's a good, simple and easy to use app for tasks, but there is no widget to add to phone's home screen in order to make it easier to remember pending tasks"
5235,Jack Li,"September 5, 2019",4," Simple app to keep track of simple stuff throughout the week. Something that needs to be implemented is the ability to minimize subtask in order to reduce cluster. For side feature, dark mode please."
5236,Laina Bolen,"October 14, 2019",5," Love it. Can you add an importance filter, so I can sort by date and importance. It could be on a scale of 1 to 5, in stars etc.."
5237,Shankar Kulumani,"February 13, 2020",4, Solid app with dark mode.
5238,S De,"February 19, 2020",5, Love this tool. Easy to use and helpful !
5239,Andreas Ahlborn,"March 8, 2020",5, simple & useful
5240,Salmo Marques,"March 13, 2020",5, It's very practice
5241,Nikola,"December 16, 2018",4," It's simple, I like it. Only one problem - routines. I exercise twice or 3 times a day but sometimes I forget and it's not a do it once task, soo..."
5242,Hui Lin,"December 3, 2018",3," I hope I can add all the relevant information while I add an new task. Also, I need a reminder with time and date so I can be reminded what I should do in a more precise aspect."
5243,Joris Steurs,"January 26, 2019",1," To start it asks to log in with my google account , when I do so it says "" that account excists already"" so basically it's only letting you in if you create a new account , making it useless."
5244,Sara W,"January 29, 2019",3," This app is clean, functional and easy to use. Frustratingly it has no widget option, reminders or compatibility with Google Calendar app."
5245,Jonathan Lee,"March 12, 2019",3, It's a nice clean app BUT it really needa a widget to make it work. Please add a widget and this will be a great place to organize to-do lists.
5246,Marc Romero,"May 9, 2019",2," I really want this to work, but the notifications either don't show or show up late. Stuff that I pit in as recurring doesn't show when I open the app."
5247,keren eli,"October 20, 2018",1," I'd say one of the most basic options is a recurring task, but that's not possible here. Over simplified to the point of useless."
5248,Nenad Kitanovic,"January 20, 2019",3," simple, elegant but it would be nice to have task duration and percentage of task completion, and option do add comment and share"
5249,Avinash Kanaujiya,"March 30, 2019",1, task repetition feature is not working.. i set it for repeating from march 28 but it only worked on 28 but didnt came back on 29 or after..
5250,Davis Rana,"October 14, 2018",2," Way too basic. Please get some ideas from well though out & mature task apps such as TickTick. Also, please add recurring date & time."
5251,Chris Poje,"April 29, 2019",5," Sooo much better with the new update. Now you can add timers for notifications and you can import your Google Reminders. Makes everything a lot easier, keep up the good work."
5252,Chester Foster,"February 24, 2019",2," was not able to add a repeat to my daily task. If I was able to, I could not find it so still 2 stars. very basic."
5253,A Google user,"December 4, 2018",3," Nice looking app, but too few features to be useful. It needs better interface for adding due dates and times!"
5254,Ajeng Canyarasmi,"October 21, 2018",4," It'd be great if it has a reminder feature in it. Unfortunately have to uninstall & still using my 3rd party Google linked to do app cause it has a reminder feature. I'm a forgetful person, so reminder is a key feature for me"
5255,Steven Gilliard,"June 5, 2019",5, Very easy to use. I like that there is a details option to add to the task and can set time and dates. Great for setting reminders and being organized.
5256,R Ayudiati,"June 17, 2019",4," simple, helpful, good task/to do list. Nothing fancy. Would prefer it if it could be shown as a calendar mark too"
5257,Jack,"June 27, 2019",1," I can't repeat tasks more than 99 days, found the Android app interface looks too different from other Google apps and there is also no web desktop version apart from a small sidebar in Gmail."
5258,Vikas Prasad,"July 13, 2019",3, The app can get much better i think yoi guys should integrate it with Google assistant for example if i ask what are my task for today Google assistant should read it for me. currently it shows me google search results
5259,China Villalta,"August 24, 2019",4, Works great! I was using Google keep for my reminders but I like being able to keep my tasks and lists separate with this. Just wish there was a widget to add it to my home screen!
5260,Rahul Chachada,"September 23, 2019",4," Great app to write down our task but please add this feature that when we complete a sub task and mark it in the app, under the completed section the main task also appear along with it although all subtask under it have not finished yet."
5261,Himanshi Vats,"October 9, 2019",5," It's simple and functionable. Can you please add 'team work feature'. Just invite a friend and work on a task together, create lists together. It would be helpful."
5262,Amar Nurdin,"November 7, 2019",3," Dark mode isn't working perfectly, the text is still dark too"
5263,Chris McFarland,"December 30, 2019",5, Great way to stay organised.
5264,Gabriel Akakporo,"January 20, 2020",1, Thought this app is to notify when there's a task
5265,Kathy Portalatin,"February 3, 2020",5," Super helpful, love it!"
5266,Mayank Sahu,"February 24, 2020",4, Good app to list you tasks
5267,Rose Schultz,"March 27, 2020",5, I enjoy the reminders and being able to see when its completed. Also give me the chance to look back and see what I've completed in the past.
5268,DCJ Squared,"October 24, 2018",5, I think you should be able to share the lists with other users. Things you might use it I For is for if a person has or bought some thing already or checking off a group goal.
5269,Bilal Syed,"November 30, 2018",3, The tracks really need to be based on time rather than date. That's what Google Calendar is for.
5270,Bill Barranco,"October 9, 2019",4, Significant improvement since the last version. Almost perfect. Only missing one feature: a way to look at all tasks in a single view.
5271,Belal Khan,"February 28, 2019",1, This is an average app. I wanted to fix the time and set an alarm. But there is no option for alarm and even for the time!
5272,Mas Lax,"April 8, 2019",1," Bye bye. THe desktop version is no longer practical to be used, especially when it freezes in Microsoft Edge."
5273,harlove randhawa,"October 24, 2018",1, The app has one job and it struggles to do it. For some reason the dates are all months off until I click the task and see the actual date.
5274,Pocket Survey,"April 26, 2019",1," Nice idea, but so many things don't work, like deleting repeats and so on. Needs finishing off! Reminders do not integrate with calender and so on...."
5275,Miguel Barajas,"October 11, 2018",3," Easy to use but unfortunately you can't set recurring tasks, and won't integrate with Google Keep nor Google Assistant."
5276,Zach Loggins,"January 15, 2019",3," i would like to be able to import all my reminders from imbox or calendar to task but cant. Otherwise, if starting brand new, its nice and simple."
5277,Simon Gutgesell,"September 16, 2018",3," Great potential, graphical design and user interface, however it really needs a widget for faster usage."
5278,Quazi Asif Hasan,"November 21, 2018",5, Awesome app from google 👍 . But thats nothing new . The app is as simple as breathing . Just one request - please add a widget .
5279,Jeremy Fritzsche,"February 13, 2019",3," Would be perfect with the following features: 1. Enable swiping between lists 2. Setting to disable automatic sync when starting up or switching lists (less important, merely cosmetic since UI stays responsive)"
5280,Divesh Sood,"January 25, 2019",5," One of the best ""tasks„ app out there. Only downside being that it doesn't remind you to do a task - by the way of an alarm/ notification."
5281,Allen Keys,"March 29, 2019",2, Was very hopeful with the updates... but recurring tasks disappear once you mark the first occurrence done. Also notifications don't seem to happen in the background.
5282,Pieter Van Zyl,"October 12, 2018",3, Useful. How about recurring tasks though? And reminders? Will eliminate the current practise of using appointments in my calender to remind me of certain recurring tasks.
5283,A Google user,"March 20, 2019",3," its great you can finally create repeating tasks and they show in the web calendar, once they show in the app as well it will be truly useful."
5284,Khairul Alam,"February 23, 2019",2, the experience is fast enough but could do with a lot more functionality. Google has spoiled its consumers by being the best in the class in any field. the principal of being the best should resonate in anything that they go for and this doesn't look like an attempt.
5285,KEITHA SMITH,"November 7, 2018",2, It fails to match up the dates to the tasks on my Android but on my iPhone it works perfectly. Why?
5286,John Smith,"December 11, 2018",3, I was really hoping this app would better interact with my phone. Currently Google assistant can't add tasks and there is no widget for me to quickly see what I need to still do.
5287,Kathleen Smith,"June 7, 2019",3, Notification did not notify me in any way that I could get notified. Will continue using Reminders in Calendar app that have notified me for many years.
5288,Only Black Bros,"June 11, 2019",4, I've been using this app for about a month now and it's really been helpful to list out my Task and create different categories for different intended tasks.
5289,Andy Slusher,"June 30, 2019",5, Simplistic but functional. I really like the ability to turn Gmail emails into tasks with the originating email attached. Due dates make this a very useful app for most people.
5290,Sameezyfbaby,"July 17, 2019",4, Great app. Would be nice if they had a widget which would allow you to see or scroll through your tasks from your home screen.
5291,Aerodynamic Fish,"July 19, 2019",2," poor integration with google calendar. it only goes as far as sending calendar tasks to the app, there is not further syncing of any sort."
5292,james whitehead,"August 2, 2019",4," it's a good app, but i think it needs more platforms such as a website and widgets. i think also including deadline/late functionality would be good. otherwise just another good app."
5293,Mikaël Chola,"August 26, 2019",2, It's good and well made but the inability to share tasks with others is too big a limitation for a to-do-list app.
5294,Ricardo Toureiro,"September 19, 2019",2," Lacks obvious features like collapsing subtasks and showing shedulled tasks on the google calendar app. If you want a simple grocery list it's fine, but then you're better off with google keep."
5295,Achmad Pandu Utomo,"January 26, 2020",5, Simplicity at its finest.
5296,wanda johnson,"January 29, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5297,Cheemakurthi Hazarathaiah,"February 18, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5298,John Gavin,"February 11, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5299,Jason Galloway,"February 14, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5300,Lawrence Ko,"March 8, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5301,Alice Boretti,"March 10, 2020",5, Very easy to use
5302,Abhith EP,"March 13, 2020",4, Looks like very helpful
5303,Karan Singh,"March 26, 2020",4, Nicely done my all goals with reminder Loved it👌
5304,Marthinus Bosman,"September 29, 2018",4, So glad this was finally properly implemented. All it needs is a widget to put next to Google Calendar and it'll be perfect.
5305,Lester de Freitas,"January 15, 2019",4," Pretty simple, but pretty pretty. Fitsbinto goofle ecosystem well, only that Google Assistant can't create or read tasks."
5306,A Google user,"November 24, 2018",5," Great app, but could use some color. Different colors for different tasks."
5307,Barry Bryan,"January 10, 2019",5," I can't understand the poor reviews, I want a simple way to remember what I want to do, and this app gives it to me, without constant ad's, is so easy on the eye, and simple to use."
5308,Austin Headley,"February 28, 2019",2, Getting better but needs the ability to assign and share tasks before it can compete with other apps.
5309,kouluri srinivas,"April 9, 2019",4, All options are too good ! BUT ..... If the reminder sound has customize sound. that is so helpful to users so they can distinguish normal alerts from Google task's.
5310,Pauline Nijander,"October 23, 2018",3," Easy to use, but it could use a widget to be able to view my to-do list on my home screen without needing to load the app up."
5311,Gregg K Gibson,"April 16, 2019",1, Google needs to figure out how it wants to handle reminders. Discontinuing Inbox before Tasks or anything else could manage reminders has really reduced the value of the Google ecosystem.
5312,Sterling Floore,"January 25, 2019",5, Perfect note taking app. Easy to switch between accounts. Shows completed task. Web page for desktop access.
5313,Brooke Carlson,"April 28, 2019",2, I will promptly change this to 5 stars the minute Tasks and the mobile version of Calendar become intergrated! like this app is only mildly useful without that feature!
5314,David Puchalla II,"May 21, 2019",1," confusing. what's the difference bwtween a reminder and a task? both can have notifications, set a time, and should include notes. why have a separate app? why cant tasks and reminders appear in the calendar app?"
5315,Gideon A.,"January 4, 2019",3, Like it. It's light weight and it works OK. Would want to see an updated version capable of showing dates when completed tasks were checked as completed
5316,Giancarlo Vera,"March 2, 2019",2, Add repeating tasks and dates for subtasks would be cool. The google integration is there so as soon as you guys make the app more functionable more peope would move to this app very easily.
5317,Jourdan Lee,"December 7, 2018",4," Absolutely love the app, super simple and sleek! But please Google... Add a wide get for it for your tasks of the day and create a dark mode for it! It would take this to a 5 star app!!!"
5318,Rachel Farkas,"October 2, 2018",1, I love the idea. but the tasks will not show on my smartphone google calendar app. only on the calendar on my PC.
5319,Hari Thygesen,"June 17, 2019",3," Meh, it works but misses a lot of features of others, sadly the strongest point is that it has the best animations."
5320,Martin P,"July 21, 2019",4," UI feels still a bit clunky, and it's disappointing that it waits to sync until I open the app. But, a decent task tracker."
5321,Dave Tan,"August 4, 2019",4," It works fine as a no-frills task tracker, though people with a regularily heavy task load may want to look elsewhere. I'd give it a 5 if it had a widget and dark theme."
5322,Kim Móric Tóth,"September 2, 2019",2," The idea is very good, however I can not sync easily with Google Calendar on mobile platform. On desktop it's fine."
5323,Koffee Mug,"September 8, 2019",1, Probably in its early developments but it's not even half as good as the likes of Evernote. And until it's integrated to Google Home and other platforms it will not be important to have.
5324,Alita Masic,"September 16, 2019",5, Best to-do list I've ever encountered. I love how the UI is sweet and simple. No complicated process involved! Thanks Google for making my life more productive!😉
5325,Matt Moschel,"October 3, 2019",2, Reminders and tasks should be integrated as one with Google calendar. There should be a web interface and direct link to open reminders from the Android app drawer.
5326,Aki Pamatian,"October 22, 2019",3, I had to uninstall this. No option to create an end date for a task. I need to be reminded until when is the task due. This app will need to update important features
5327,Edgar Hnd,"November 4, 2019",3, Amazing and simple app ! Will get 5 stars when connected to Google calendar...
5328,Linda Bertiaux,"November 7, 2019",5, Easy to use! Helps me to keep track of what I need to do! Great app!
5329,Paolo Solorzano,"February 20, 2020",4, Pretty handy for sure!
5330,Ana Palacios,"February 25, 2020",5, Very user friendly
5331,A Google user,"October 12, 2018",2," It's so confusing. There are Tasks, the Shopping List, Reminders and the Events in the Calendar. Why not putting it all together and clean up the mess??"
5332,Anirban Kopty,"February 27, 2019",4," The app is great and clean but found one problem, whenever a done task is unticked, if it was in a subtask, it doesn't return to the subtask, rather creates another task."
5333,Molly Cabrera,"September 21, 2018",4, It would be nice if we could schedule Task reminders. I can set a date but not a reminder alert in Tasks.
5334,A Google user,"January 12, 2019",3," Everything about it is nice, except i wish that you could set it at different times and you could use the same tasks repeatedly."
5335,Murat Odabasi,"December 14, 2018",2," Google Tasks has been around for years, yet this native app is still nowhere near as good as those provided by third party developers. Disheartening really."
5336,Benedikt Schwartz,"October 4, 2018",2," Reminders work only occasionally, not possible to set a time, no repetive reminders; strange underperformance for a Google app"
5337,Jeff Crane,"April 17, 2019",2," We are getting there, but this app desperately needs the ability to appear in the share menu in other apps like Chrome (create a task that includes a URL)"
5338,A Google user,"February 5, 2019",3, It's poorly designed in that you can't mark an item as completed when viewing the item's details and you have to go up to the top level overview screen to do it.
5339,A Google user,"March 10, 2019",3," It misses the ability to share tasks with someone. Having shared tasks would help with households, project managements, etc."
5340,Dom Przano,"May 3, 2019",2," Needs Google Assistant integration. I installed this app for this very reason, only to find it is not integrated with Google Assistant. Wow Google, really?"
5341,Amir Sarabadani,"November 15, 2018",1," No snoozing, no support for recurring tasks. This is a disaster that I have to use because of integration with gmail."
5342,Chet,"October 18, 2018",3," I'd really love to see widget support down the line, it's the only thing about this app I don't like. Other than that it's nice and easy to use across multiple devices."
5343,Tony Y,"January 2, 2019",4," Seems alright.. one thing I would like to see is the ability to create reoccurring tasks like change HVAC filters every 3 months, or make a deposit every other Thursday."
5344,Nikos Kovatzis,"April 12, 2019",2, very poor and basic design no dark theme options.  when crossing out a sub task it looses its parrent link. there are others handling Google tasks (!) much better
5345,Kaity Fitzpatrick,"January 13, 2019",4," I like the app to use in place of of the last task manager I since I use Google for everything and I can edit on my computer too, but I wish it had a widget I could add to my home screen on my phone."
5346,SAGAR NAGARGOJE,"July 14, 2019",1," Hey i am looking for an app in which i can put recurring reminder on odd periods like, 1, 3, 7, 15, 32 days is it possible with this"
5347,Ayhab KV,"August 1, 2019",1, The app is simple and easy to use. I would have given full star if there is an option to postpone the task by minutes or hours. Please give update for the dame :)
5348,Ashley Laterza,"August 2, 2019",1, doesnt sync with Google Calendar (even though the desktop version does) and doesnt allow for you to add another user to a task (like in Google Keep) so this app is essentially useless.
5349,troy olson,"August 28, 2019",1," P.O.S. app! Terrible excuse for a task app. Google keep and this app should be one app. Cant add files, cant make changes online outside of gmail, typical google, very limited functionality making it useless. I am convinced google as a company can no longer write software or create apps."
5350,D T N,"August 28, 2019",4," I want to sort a list (like alphabet) in google tasks. Can you help me, please? Anymore, I want ""My tasks"" will be always shown all tasks with it's label. So we can know about more priority tasks! Thanks you very much!"
5351,JR Peck,"September 7, 2019",5, Easy to use and had some great features. I love the tie ins to Gmail and calendar. I use tasks for work and personal organization.
5352,Rajat Dash,"September 11, 2019",5, The app interface is nice. Google should try to add a dark theme. The app also consumes time to sync even in good internet connection.
5353,Kiril Lukiyan,"September 12, 2019",1, No way. No proper sharing. No planning. Ungly interface. Come one google. Take example from Any.do or Microsoft To-Do. Can't believe google's todo app is among the worst
5354,Partha Chowdhury,"September 27, 2019",3, Great interface but doesn't sync to calendar on phone. A widget is also needed. It helps to motivate when the task are always visible
5355,Tina Vigue-Simmons,"October 6, 2019",3, So I go 2 tell Google mail I've used years to add a task seeing I haven't used it b4 but from what I recall in previous versions it was built in to the product hence why the product u were using asked the question but it sends me here I'm not installing more stuff that's dumb
5356,Lashitaa,"February 18, 2020",5, Very helpful in planning
5357,sandi williams,"February 12, 2020",5, Works great..helps me stay on track
5358,Arvind Raj Jayakumar,"February 14, 2020",5, Simple and effective app
5359,Marion Husler,"February 20, 2020",5, Integrates well with my apps and notifications
5360,Durgesh Guptaa,"April 25, 2020",4, Need more integration with Google Calendar
5361,Noor Roslan,"March 20, 2019",4," Thank you so much for implementing the much needed task repetition, date and time option. I have been wanting to use this as a habit tracker/reminder. Thank you! ❣️"
5362,ShahrinRezal Md Saat,"September 20, 2018",3, Overall it just okay. Have all the basic stuff. It would be nice if we can add due time. More suitable for personal use.
5363,Paul Hibbert,"March 5, 2019",2, Doesnt interface with google Calendar mobile.... Ridiculously missed opportunity. i love Google Calendar mobile but mughtnhave to switch because of this.
5364,Manjeet Singh,"September 30, 2018",3," This would be great app if it would have option of reminder with alarm, reschedule task, time for to do task and time for done task."
5365,Karen Hermosa,"October 8, 2018",2," It needs additional features such as being able to set recurring tasks daily, weekly, etc."
5366,Serafim Araújo,"January 4, 2019",3," It needs the option of setting a time for the task, not just the day. Needs better integration with Gmail."
5367,Duy Quang Pham,"October 15, 2018",2, It can't be synchronized with Google calendar. It aslo don't have process bar function to check and I can't add reminder for deadline. Please add those function
5368,Sean Stevens,"November 21, 2018",3," It is a nice, simple to use, little to do list app. I just wish that it worked with the Google Assistant."
5369,A Google user,"November 25, 2018",3," Beautiful clean interface. Extremely simple to use. Needs a dark theme option and the notifications need a time, not just a day."
5370,Dont Crash,"November 13, 2018",3," Excellent start, but feature lacking. Please add an Android widget. Later down the roadmap, shared task lists?"
5371,yatin patil,"January 10, 2019",3, require time slot so that task can be time bound. time slots are not necessary to fill but it should be there as some tasks are date and time bound
5372,Nga Nguyễn,"May 10, 2019",2, a nice interface but lacking in function. didnt manage to remind me of tasks most of the time. and a tasks app that have no snooze options??
5373,A Google user,"December 7, 2018",1," It asks me to sign in to my Google account, then says it's already signed in. Can't get passed the log in screen. A pointless piece of junk"
5374,Nayl khalis saptika,"September 24, 2018",4," I think this app is great and only needs a widget functionality to be perfect. Every other list app has a widget functionality, why can't this one have widgets too?"
5375,Chirag Khatri,"January 17, 2019",3, Looks beautiful. Give an option to add reminders for tasks at a specific time in the day.
5376,Teemu Valkama,"September 25, 2018",3, Not made for daily or recurring todo-lists. No batch-uncheck. Subtasks become normal tasks when unchecking. No way to copy list.
5377,kailash kumar ubnarey,"July 28, 2019",4, Really good . but have to improve the bell of task . good app to fallow time table .I had complete My task and I Improve in my habits and get to fallow the time table . Thank you task
5378,Faris Hussain,"July 17, 2019",1, Worst to-do list app out there. Why are sub-tasks seperated from tasks when organised by date? Why aren't there folders to organise lists? Why doesn't sync with calender show up on mobile?
5379,ishwar chaudhary,"August 7, 2019",1, when we set reminder or event custom notification can not set. i need long ringtone or alarm for reminder. and also important we need widget in home screen in dark mode.
5380,David Chou,"September 5, 2019",5," Perfect for getting things done! It's super helpful that it has integrations with Calendar and Gmail, as well as the ability to have recurring tasks!"
5381,Geferman Pernia,"September 28, 2019",2," It does not notify when tasks are dated, they should place you to activate notifications. Or make a widget to be on the home screen. Or be able to synchronize tasks to the calendar and notify us of the calendar"
5382,Jeff Rouse,"September 28, 2019",4, Pretty good. Could use some improvements. Seeing tasks on Android Google calendar app. And a dark mode are both needed.
5383,Ms Fit,"October 10, 2019",5, Google tasks helps me and my team collaborate on tasks that need done in order to maximize company efficiency. We like how it is easily accessible through all of the Google applications.
5384,Yaron Tomer,"October 27, 2019",4, Setting sure dates and notification makes it very useful. What I'm missing is an easy way to postpone a tall by an hour a day or a week directly from Android notification menu.
5385,Christopher Rao Rao,"February 6, 2020",4," Simple, reliable, user friendly."
5386,Clean Ignis 23,"February 10, 2020",5, Simple and effective. Easy to use. Use it every day.
5387,Andrew Laplante,"February 12, 2020",5, It syncs well with laptop
5388,Tom Taranto,"February 12, 2020",3, needs to identify date of creation as well as due date
5389,Ryan Buckley,"October 1, 2018",3, I love the feel and functionality. CRITICAL FLAW: No search function within or between lists for tasks. Please address.
5390,Michelle Massa,"March 28, 2019",3," I love the app, but 3 stars since the dates jumble themselves around as you scroll. This needs fixed Google!!!"
5391,Ayesha Tahir,"March 2, 2019",4," There should be a widget, so instead of opening app, one can see already displayed list in hone screen. But nice work"
5392,Prakash Khatri,"March 16, 2019",2, The most important feature requires is task timing which is not there as well as alarm for task should also be there.
5393,Jentzen Paolo Javier,"December 7, 2018",5, Would love to use this but Google Keep Notes has some features that I need right now. If this app can combine both then I will gladly switch over. I hope it happens.
5394,Chandra Killa,"October 11, 2018",5," Very useful. Request the developers to update some new features like widgets, improved notifications & recurring tasks."
5395,Gopikrishnan Sasikumar,"October 12, 2018",4, Nice minimalistic app. It will be great if you can add a feature to set a time also with the date for a task.
5396,Chris,"October 14, 2018",2," For the amount of substitutes for this kind of app, this doesn't have enough features and options. Google needs to stop releasing half-baked apps."
5397,Anton Lozhnikov,"April 8, 2019",3," Great app, but I am puzzled by the lack of integration with Google Calendar on Android"
5398,Cliff Aipalag,"November 14, 2018",4," It's a good app for listing your tasks, however the interface needs improvement and customizability should be added (i.e. Dark theme, Gradient, etc.)"
5399,Ciarán McCann,"March 27, 2019",1," Useless app, Google Indox was the prefect reminder/tasks app for me and you guys killed it. Now I'm left trying to migrate to Google Keep or to Google Tasks, both of which are very poor options."
5400,A Google user,"July 3, 2019",5," done, thanks for implementing this! (Original request: ""I would love to have the option to at least set the time for a specific task. Thanks a lot."")"
5401,Ian Joy Virtudazo,"December 14, 2018",3," I think this application needs to be improve, like when the due dates of the task the app has to notify the users by popping up what's for todays priority and of course the alarm as well"
5402,Rodrigo Cañas,"January 15, 2019",2, It's not bad. It's simple. That's good. But why on earth a task app in 2019 wouldn't have a share lists option?
5403,Nathan logsdon,"April 18, 2019",3," Please please please please please please let tasks sync with my Google calendar app!!! Why will it sync on my desktop but not my phone. This is 2019, seems so easy and simple!"

5405,Brentton Paulus,"February 26, 2019",4," this app needs more love from google. its great but it could be way better. integration with other services is poor, and it needs a widget."
5406,Dhawal Mehta,"July 4, 2019",1, Old app ui was much much better!! Why did you change it Google!!! Why are you making all apps same? Google Tasks was a unique app unlike others. Now it is spoiled just like other Google Apps!
5407,Syamlal G B,"May 28, 2019",1, Not getting synchronized with google calendar in the mobile while it is working in my computer. Microsoft's to-do-list is far better.
5408,Derek Goh,"July 22, 2019",2, Nothing display on Today list. It is not working like other to do list where Task due today will display in Today list. Will it be like this or .....
5409,Hernán Cervera,"July 13, 2019",2," No tags, no attachments, no filters, no folders, no Gmail integration on phone. It really is a bare bones to-do app which lacks many basic features of others"
5410,Bakyt Niyazov,"August 16, 2019",5, The best todo app ever. So easy and intuitive. Please don't add more features. Just freeze it as it is now.
5411,Gino Williams,"September 22, 2019",5, This is my go-to app for tasks. The organizing feature is a huge plus for categorizing to-do items.
5412,Real Estate Investing,"October 16, 2019",4," Room for improvement. Very good task manager tho. Only thing is we need a drop down button for the subtask to it can be compiled. Also, color coding task would be nice and labeling. Just like. gmail does."
5413,Steve Bishenden,"October 28, 2019",3," Now the Widget crashing has been fixed, but I can't resize it to less than 3x3. I need it to be 2 blocks wide 🤷🏻‍♂️. Still can't use it, having to stick with Tick Tick for now."
5414,Punyapal Shah,"November 4, 2019",4," Its good, but can u add snooze feature which helps to remind the tasks again if notification gets dismissed"
5415,Joseph Rodriguez,"November 14, 2019",3," Alright but not the best especially if you'd like repeating, grouping or data tracking of tasks. 3.5 would be more fair."

5425,Raymond Winarta,"April 16, 2019",3," It is good, but it needs a widget. like a 2 (width) × 4 (height) widget."
5426,C. Beck Mayberry,"September 27, 2018",1, Google Tasks does not interface with Google Assistant. A free third-party tasks app I found does better than that.

5429,Minh-Tuan Ta,"February 9, 2019",3," The UI is clean and slick. However, lacking reminder is a huge oversight for a task management app."
5430,Samantha Raymond,"October 22, 2018",4," I think this is a good to do list. It'd be nice if it could have reminders set to get you to look at it. That could help prevent it from being ""out of sight, out of mind"" when it isn't actively open."
5431,Periklis Anvar,"February 14, 2019",3," Works very well, but I can't get around the fact that it doesn not show in mobile google calendar!"

5442,Drew Bailey,"December 10, 2018",1, Tasks are not showing in order after I sorted by date. Problem happens when I change an existing task to another date.
5443,A Google user,"November 7, 2018",1, No ability to create repeat tasks/reminders and no option to be reminded at a certain time of day. Seems like an app without a purpose.
5444,A Google user,"October 12, 2018",4," It's a good simple app, but needs more development like widgets and also the ability to work offline and synchronize."

5450,Jonathan C,"October 17, 2019",3, Very useful and robust app (compared to other ToDo apps that keep crashing). Will give 5 stars if a home screen widget is made/made available for the Pixel 3 XL.

5461,Christoph Sedlak,"March 3, 2020",1, No Integration into the Android calendar app or widget. Pretty useless therfore...
5462,Lyndsay Amat,"September 13, 2018",3," It's simple as is, but would be infinitely better as a widget because of its function. Please add!"

5470,Josh Bowen,"October 15, 2019",1, Widget sucks. There is no functionality that exists beyond Google Keep. It drastically lags behind other task apps. Uninstalling. Why wait for features to slowly trickle in when perfect alternatives already exist that are non google
5471,Jasmine P. Irawan,"October 15, 2019",3," It's a good app, useful. However, there are plenty of other similar apps with better, more detailed features. It's still a good app overall though."

5478,Geoff Rockhill,"March 19, 2020",4, Basic but good
5479,Boris Joffe,"March 28, 2020",2, Could be better if it supported more basic todo features and allowed 3rd party app API sync
5480,Matthew Tinker,"September 12, 2018",1," Giving it 1 star since I don't see any improvements since release. As it stands, it just adds to the noise"

5484,Mike Bacani,"September 19, 2018",3, It would be nice to set priority on task items and organize the items by priority (similar to TickTick)
5485,Ted Green,"April 7, 2019",1, Disappointed in this app. Doesn't have reminders and does not keep repeating tasks active after completing one instance. Changing to Microsoft To-Do.
5486,Vinoth Kumar R,"January 27, 2019",5, Easily the best and most simple to use. highly recommended. better than the rest and no extra ads or extra charge

5488,WolfVisser1,"November 9, 2018",5, Excellent app. I just dump all of my tasks here and I'm able to sync it across all devices
5489,EliYahu722 AM,"November 11, 2018",2, Not able to repeat tasks daily or weekly etc automatically. You must re enter the tasks again. Due to this Id say this app isnt for habitual multitaskers.
5490,Nadav Levy,"September 22, 2018",4," Nice to finally have tasks integrated with other Google product, but it needs more work. Basic thing like reminders is missing"
5491,Jakub Křikala,"January 4, 2019",2," Guys, why do you like it? Why I can't see my tasks in cal on my adroid phone? What is difference between reminders and tasks? Because reminder tells me to do someting. I dont need two different functionalities not well   integrated with calendar. Please keep it simple and integrated. Thank you!"
5492,Adriaan Vandermeer,"February 5, 2019",3, Simple and effective. I would recommend this app. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because I wish there were a widget for it.

5495,Tyler Farrell,"July 4, 2019",1," needs batch add, and sending tasks via SMS and email. all other 3rd party apps have had syncing disabled for some reason."
5496,Bikramaditya Niroula,"August 5, 2019",4, please add the option to remind the birthdays ! Since your Google calendar doesn't even notifies the birthdays. i still dint find good third party app for birthday reminder!!
5497,Raahil Armaan,"August 5, 2019",3," Needs a widget and/or Google Calendar integration asap. Love how nice and simple it is, but it lacks basic functionality."
5498,CodeF53,"September 13, 2019",2," Decent app, ticktick does everything this does and more. The only advantage this has is its link to Google calendar. Lacks a screen widget"
5499,Srinivasa Garlapati,"September 16, 2019",1, Does not allow subtasks once repeat is set or vice versa. This is a serious limitation for any real world use. Hope Google addresses this limitation soon.
5500,Arjun aadat,"December 17, 2019",5, Search button will be great addition
5501,Blake Crow,"October 1, 2019",1, Left feedback- but until this syncs with your Google calendar on your mobile device this is pretty pointless. Sticking with reminders until then.
5502,Dmi Gul,"October 21, 2019",1, After months of our requests still lacks calendar app synchronization. I recommend to use Keep instead - this is the only workaround.
5503,Chiaki Chan,"October 22, 2019",3, When we can have Google Tasks merged into Google Calendar? It is merged in desktop version already. Having Tasks together with Google Calendar would be a great help.

5516,Tom Naughton,"December 14, 2018",4," I get a lot of use out of this app and for the most part it's very useful and easy to use. However, one feature I would like to see in the future is a home screen widget"

5528,Isaac Quijano Calderón,"May 10, 2019",4," It needs a widget and from there check or uncheck tasks, that'll make everything easier and with that this app can be worthy. This is almost the best Tasks annotation app I have found."

5544,A Google user,"February 13, 2019",3, It lacks the ability to set times for reminders on individual tasks. Also not enough sorting options.
5545,Kotchaphan B,"February 7, 2019",1, Only the most important things for google tasks app should be improved is the integration between tasks and Google Calendar.
5546,Sunny borah,"October 20, 2018",3, There should be time and date notification Reminder.Because we like to get reminded of a task at a particular time of the day.
5547,Mridul Hazarika,"November 19, 2018",1, There's no option to Add Alarm for specific task. The task doesn't sync with Google Calendar. Why should we even try out this app when far better apps are available in playstore.
5548,Sadie Frady,"October 27, 2018",4, Love it but wish it had a widget to quickly see my to do list. Overall though it's super simple and effective.
5549,J Canfield,"February 19, 2019",4, Much improved. I used Google Tasks in my GCal sidebar for awhile and this is a well designed app instead of using Google Keep to organize my daily/weekly tasks.
5550,Arion Love,"September 8, 2019",1, This app is so Bad that anyone's respect for Google(which is known for software company) get trimmed. I suggests Tick tick which is infinite times better(not totally free though)and also marquees brownlee uses it too totally worth it.
5551,Trân Hồ Phước,"April 10, 2019",3," Lack of function. This app don't have Default New Task like Routine Daily,Reminder Time daily custom and long time. Learn ticktick and Chore Checklist to do better."
5552,Mohana Krishnan,"November 9, 2018",3," Great, simple interface. But no task sharing/ collaboration possible."
5553,Nathan Gelderloos,"November 10, 2018",2," Does anyone actually use this? Seems like it could be a great tool, but it's missing many useful features and integrations with other Google apps. Trying to use it more, now that Inbox is going away, but it's got a ways to go."
5554,Jerry George,"April 26, 2019",2," There is no Widget !!!! Its a task app and without widget a big component is missing. Pretty useless for me. Meanwhile Microsoft To Do app has all this including widget for their android app. Come on Google, whats going on"
5555,Wyatt Holloway,"February 7, 2019",2, it has potential to be a great task app but still needs some basic features added to make this a useful app.
5556,Jennifer Reid,"November 18, 2018",3," Love it, but IT REALLY NEEDS a widget, an option for repeating tasks, and better email integration on Android!!"
5557,Alex Maltopol,"April 20, 2019",1, Tasks with a date and time do not appear in google calendar. How is such an omission possible?
5558,Arbaz Khan,"September 13, 2018",5," Provide a widget for Google tasks. This widget will have a timeline for current day. So, I will define targets for the present day in the morning and accurately follow that timeline for the whole day."
5559,Sekar Ramamurthy,"March 18, 2019",3, Great for multi device sync and ease of use. android app still got issues around sorting by date and shows wrong date
5560,Ragavan Srinivasan,"March 20, 2019",1, Expecting better ui and management of task. No widget is big minus. refer Microsoft ToDo for sample widget and UI model. Microsoft todo also have flaws in syncing ;)
5561,Ian Lewis,"September 28, 2018",3, I set dates on my tasks but I get no notifications from the app. This is a must have feature for any task app. I'll go back to using calendar events and Reminders instead
5562,Daniel Silva,"May 31, 2019",2," This app is beautifully designed, however in the morning i have to start it up manually and refresh it to show any tasks reminders to show up."
5563,Scott Maclure,"June 17, 2019",2," Gtasks was superior, was written years ago. Too many frustrating UX factors, such as not being able to reorder lists."
5564,Lily Martin,"July 25, 2019",5, Awesome app. Would be great if it worked with Google calendar like it does in the browser.
5565,omid asadi,"July 24, 2019",3, why subtasks doesn't have time repeating setting??????????? another bug there isn't any siund notification on tasks.
5566,Paresh Makwana,"August 10, 2019",2, I had set recurring tasks. I got notification once but I do not get notifications when one instance of task is marked completed.
5567,Ken Kundert,"August 19, 2019",3," Uninstalled. Cannot add sub tasks to a repeating task, until then it's useless to me. Great idea on paper though!"
5568,Craig Thomas,"September 12, 2019",3, Not quite there yet. Need a good task manager that works with my daily flow. Big confusion between reminders and tasks.
5569,Basil F.,"September 22, 2019",1, I like the super bright background that gets you up in the morning and the astounding lack of features. I sure do miss Wunderlist. Uninstalled.
5570,Charles Gruver,"October 1, 2019",2," Would be nice if the tasks synced with Google Calendar on the Android devices like it does on the web version, and if tasks with a date but no associated time also have notifications."
5571,Charles Mullins,"October 3, 2019",3," Nice app with clean and simple interface, but doesn't meet expectations for the simple fact it doesn't sync with Calendar App."
5572,Chaitanya Deshkar,"October 8, 2019",2, Need a connection between Google Calendar and Google tasks. The absence of a widget also makes it hard to use!
5573,Dennis Ingolfsland,"February 12, 2020",5, Does exactly what I need. Never any problemd
5574,Daniel Bogdan,"February 23, 2020",5," Simple, effective, efficient"
5575,Steve Kraynak Jr.,"March 29, 2020",4, Tasks is a solid app
5576,Nathan Alllard,"December 17, 2018",4, This app would be perfect if it sync'd scheduled tasks with google calendar and had the ability to attach photos as well as time frames for scheduled events.
5577,Sadika Khan,"September 21, 2018",4," It's a great app, but you could add a widget to make using the app quicker and more helpful."
5578,Suyash Singh,"October 9, 2018",3, The app is minimal and is really good. Please add the functionality to edit time for tasks apart from dates.
5579,Moataz Mohammady,"September 22, 2018",3, Good application but why checking subtasks move it from main task.. I don't like this behavior .. sub tasks should always linked with main task
5580,Jnana Sagar,"January 12, 2019",4, it's pretty good. would like to have few other essentials features like other Todo apps. Whereas it's simple and clean UI keeps me stick to this Todo app.
5581,Robin Zeng,"January 13, 2019",1," The sort by date function is very buggy- constantly out of order, or even changes the displayed dates on assignments."
5582,George Papadopoulos,"April 4, 2019",1, Somehow accidentally managed to delete a task and there's no way to restore it. If this is not one-off issue then this app is unusable.
5583,Christiano Anderson,"November 4, 2018",3," Missing some features like better notifications, recurrent tasks and so on. Anyway, it's a good app"
5584,Ardas rKrishna Chaudhari,"November 1, 2018",2," I want features of a ""Habit Trackers"" in this app, but far from providing features of a Habit Tracker it lacks option to repeat a task. #Discouraged"
5585,Siddhartha Ray,"June 6, 2019",4, Good App. Thanks Scope for further improvement: 1. Enable word search (Google Sheets To Do List offers that) 2. Allow export to Excel / Google sheets
5586,Jenny Gibson,"June 18, 2019",3, Getting better but please can you make the recurring tasks actually recur? Once you click complete it doesn't make the new one! Thanks.
5587,Scott McDonald,"June 19, 2019",3," would give 5 stars if reminders AUTOMATICALLY saved to this app. i know it can be done manually, but that is useless, it needs to be automatic."
5588,Beth Donnelly,"August 7, 2019",2, Meh. The missing feature is the ability to text a list to someone. GTasks has this feature and will sync. with Google Tasks. Just FyI
5589,Tracey S,"August 6, 2019",4," I like the simplicity of this & the sidebar next to google calendar in Chrome, v useful. I'd like to see tasks integrated with Android calendar however & a Tasks widget would also be awesome"
5590,Shantanu PS Chauhan,"September 6, 2019",2, Its very simple and cool But i need DARK MODE and an Option to IMPORT TASKS from other todo list apps And read the feedback I've just given you If you fulfill that then I'll leave my previously using apps like Any.do or tick tick and definitely use Google tasks and give 5 STARS
5591,Rawdreen,"October 3, 2019",4," 1. Can't change the order of subtasks; 2. After finishing the subtask everything goes flat in complited list (Can't differentiate subtasks and tasks); 3. No font styles: bold, italic, so on;"
5592,Martin Fink,"October 6, 2019",2," Even though I have already marked a task a completed, I get a notification asking me if the task is completed? Also, it doesn't sync with the calendar app."
5593,Netti Junarti,"October 16, 2019",4, I love this App. But if there is widget for this would be better. So we can see the task from our home page. Thanks good job!
5594,Tamie Hamilton-Lavoie,"January 8, 2020",5, I install and use all the Google stuff.
5595,Cody Cross,"February 8, 2020",5, Really easy to use

5598,Behnam Zamiri,"March 20, 2020",1," Always show ""can't reach tasks"" and not get started"
5599,Katherine Clark,"May 11, 2019",4, I love this app! Love being able to separate my lists. One request: I'd like to be able to choose whether new tasks are added to the top or the bottom of the list!
5600,Andrea Solano,"April 12, 2019",3, When using microsoft edge on the PC the app dissapears 2 seconds after it loads and never returns! Great app but needs to work well on any browser.
5601,Andrew Atkins,"April 6, 2019",2," doesn't have any kind of sharing functionality, better to use keep unless all you want are no options for your check lists."
5602,Ozan Kulcu,"October 1, 2018",3, This is a cool app but it definetely needs a widget and a Google Calendar integration. Then it would be complete.
5603,Jojami Ko,"November 4, 2018",5, Great for simple tasks and i love the simple look of it. Just wishing a couple of things: 1) google assistant integration 2) widgets
5604,Jan Mahler,"May 10, 2019",5," i love having the hamburger menu, add task and action overflow on the bottom of the app where my hand and fingers naturally lay. Great, forward thinking UX by the Tasks team."
5605,T J,"October 13, 2018",3," Nice app, well spaced and elegant style. But not enough sort options and no dark theme option."
5606,Callum Reid,"January 4, 2019",3, This app is ok but there are a few basic features that could be added like being able to set a time for a task.
5607,Daniel Nicklin,"March 28, 2019",4, General layout of the app is easy and intuitive to use. Although would benefit from the ability to add reminders to tasks and a widget to place on phone's homescreen
5608,עידו שירת,"May 16, 2019",5," great app. Nonetheless, it doesn't have an widget feature which is a real flaw."
5609,GOD,"October 3, 2018",4," Add one thing and the app will be the best. Add reminder option also, that would be a complete deal. I love this app."
5610,A Google user,"November 11, 2018",3," It's okay but needs a way to set a due time not only due date, also there's no way to set up repeating tasks"
5611,Hanna G,"May 14, 2019",2, Could be amazing!!! I was so excited to find this app...but no widget....makes the app a little pointless. A widget of just tasks...no other calendar info.
5612,Tamal Das,"February 8, 2019",3, lot of places to improve.try to add the repeat task feature.i am not able to repeat the task every day.and its too simplistic.which is good but the features can be enhanced a little bit
5613,Srijan Gupta,"June 4, 2019",1, No use its just a list app Even when I input all the details about task such as time it doesn't remind me on time to do it. Not alot of features anyway.
5614,Josh Zheng,"June 27, 2019",3, I wish Reminders shows up in the mobile Google Calendar app. It shows up on the desktop version for some reason.
5615,Ian Gomez,"July 1, 2019",5, I dunno why people are hating on this app so much. It's amazing! It blends seamlessly into my Google calendar because obviously it's made by Google. Love it. It's desktop version is amazing too.
5616,Matias Bartolini,"July 19, 2019",2, It is a great app but google should add a widget and integration with the calendar app (as it happens on the computer)
5617,Dipen Modi,"August 19, 2019",3, Glitch I think - Can either a sub-task or a daily/weekly repeat reminders but not both! Please fix this. App is perfect otherwise.
5618,Ganeshkumar Shanmuganathan,"September 4, 2019",3, No prior intimation option from the scheduled time of task. You need to work a lot to be competitive with other task manager app.
5619,Jamie,"September 19, 2019",3," Seems to work ok. Cant seem to remove the ""completed"" status from a task if it was maked by mistake"

5627,Durki,"May 9, 2019",5, Hi! Task is a great app helpful in my daily live and i love its simplicity. However I highly regret that it offers no widget. It's my only objection - please add widgets.
5628,Kâşif Çelebi,"May 15, 2019",3, it is good in general but it doesnt turn verticel the app is only used horizontally. if that is changed with an update it eould be very beneficial thank you
5629,Tobiáš Kaláb,"November 7, 2018",4," It's really great, but some features that could be really helpful are missing, like a reminder"

5634,Ghabriel Bezerra,"March 30, 2019",4," Amazing. But if he had a Widget to remember the activities when their end came and a notification of when they expired, the app would look exceptionally perfect."
5635,Andre G. Apaid,"December 3, 2018",3, Only missing feature would be repeating tasks. Other than that it's a good app
5636,Nabeel Kondotty,"September 24, 2018",5," Google Tasks is a great app to help you complete tasks without missing. But, lacks widget for mobile."
5637,Salvador Zavala,"May 30, 2019",1, this app has not reminded me of any tasks. I'm going back to google calendar reminders which this app imported and messed up.
5638,Belinda Yap,"June 12, 2019",5," Syncs immediately after installation, simple to use.  You can do a long press on a task to move it up or down."
5639,Drew Dietz,"July 1, 2019",2, It forgets your details if you entered then while offline. I can't give it more than 2 stars for that.

5642,Ram,"August 21, 2019",2," I don't know why Google is not supporting Microsoft but this application is not available in Windows so, I am switching to Microsoft To do list and Microsoft To do list application is available in Android, Windows and iOS."
5643,Julian Ingel,"September 3, 2019",2, Lacking many features and outdated for 3 months now. They should prioritize adding option to add google keep notes and images asap.
5644,Kedarnath,"September 7, 2019",5, Loved the recent update of syncing Tasks with Calendar ( Desktop Version). I use this because of its simplicity with many options.
5645,Sol Beltran,"September 7, 2019",2, Great but pretty useless without a widget option. Pretty simple thing to add on to make this app so much more efficient
5646,Renita Yeasted,"September 23, 2019",1, No widget. It's ridiculous to have to click your way through your phone instead of tapping CHECK on a completed task in a widget.
5647,Hezi Shirazi,"September 25, 2019",3," Still Google Keep is much more flexsible and usefull. Task not shown in calendar, not many option for recurring task, and time"

5655,Andi McCormick,"September 18, 2018",2, Not fit for purpose. Needs a better reminder system other than just setting the date. Useless for tasks to be completed later in the day.

5657,Barry Graham,"March 27, 2019",3, I was excited about the new Google Tasks in G Suite but you can't create recurring tasks here yet.  This needs to be added to make this my Tasks app.
5658,Laksh Parmar,"February 7, 2019",1, If I type a long to do text I cannot scroll up and down. Scrolling down directly dismisses the task. So frustrating. 😣😑

5677,A Google user,"December 14, 2018",3," Beautiful and clean, but lacks a lot of basic features."
5678,Hemanth,"April 4, 2019",2, The old google tasks in new UI ... there are no basic features like reminders and search etc. A waste of their time to put out such a half baked app.

5702,Ronald Chávez,"December 14, 2018",5, Excellent app to keep notes about your current tasks and be able to review what you have to do and what you've done.
5703,Daniel Hale,"April 7, 2019",3, Does what it says on the tin. It would be nice if it worked with Google home so I could see what tasks I have on my home hub and to add and edit tasks.
5704,Mike Piovano,"August 19, 2019",4," The app is useless unless you can change the TIME of a task, to reflect the availability of this feature on the web version."
5705,David Wicker,"September 25, 2018",3," ADD REMINDERS, AND A POSSIBILITY TO ADD A SPECIFIC TIME IN THE DUE SECTION.... Please integrate Google Tasks with Google Calendar!!! Otherwise Microsoft tasks is just better!! Pleaseee"

5707,Mckenzie O'Shea,"October 4, 2018",3," Simple, clean and to the point. Only thing missing is a widget for the home screen. Will be waiting."
5708,Dom Polesel,"March 27, 2019",5, Finally has appropriate features such as an actual time based reminder and integration for reminders from other Google sources. Should have been launched that way from release but good on Google for making it happen.
5709,WAYNE CADDELL,"June 8, 2019",1," Keeps going vertical view instead of staying horizontal on my Samsung Galaxy View 2. Once Google fixes this it might be useful,,,"
5710,Brandon L,"May 29, 2019",3," I wish this had a widget, or if the Calendar app supported the tasks calendar like you do with reminders I would be satisfied."
5711,Iago Seleme,"June 10, 2019",3," Does about ok job, but we should judge it by a high standard given that it's a Google app... it's seriously lacking features... No way to customize ringtones, can't change the annoying bright white color..."
5712,Jonathan Tri Sakiman,"June 19, 2019",1," I expect too much on this app. Never know that google will create the bad design as this apps, only how we make the list and the view is only a LIST, nothing else."
5713,Thomas Beyer,"June 27, 2019",3," I like this app in general, but it is in desperate need of a widget. Some additional features would be appreciated as well."
5714,Aashis Shrestha,"August 4, 2019",4," I would love to have dark mode since its too bright in morning.However,things that I love about this app is simplicity and being able to sync my data."
5715,Design Creators,"August 19, 2019",3," My only problem is, it doesn't have widgets... Everytime when we unlock the we should be able to see the tasks"
5716,Mukhammadkodir Zainabidinov,"August 28, 2019",3, App is good but it does no have prioritizing and sub-tasks seen on the list which is distracting sometimes.
5717,Jack Loomis,"September 6, 2019",3," It's ok. A bit too basic. Look at MS tasks and try again. Sorry, uninstalling until it is improved."
5718,Scott Karrasch,"September 17, 2019",2, I never really found this useful. Id either set reminders with the calendar app or make lists with keep.... But nothing about this app appears to be useful
5719,Robert Elizalde,"September 20, 2019",4, Fantastic app! I use it every day. I would give five stars if it had task priority levels.

5726,Rizzy,"February 16, 2019",3," I mean, cool, you have an app that's a list of things to do, but... Google Keep exists with that feature. Seriously, this app is literally google keep's feature turned into one app. Simply put, useless."
5727,Mahathir Sami,"September 17, 2018",3," Simple is what i like. So i like this app, but can't love it because there is no widget option. Widgets come in handy for such apps. Plz implement it asap."
5728,Brian Radzicki,"May 15, 2019",2, Barebones. Tasks does not inegrate with the google calendar app. Tasks badly needs a widget as well. Theres really no reason to use this app over Notes on mobile.
5729,A Google user,"April 8, 2019",3, there is no integration on mobile with google calendar. there is barely any integration with any other google products that would be beneficial.
5730,Maria Griswold,"October 15, 2018",3, Needs a widget. I'd like to be able to see my tasks on the home screen. Or if it integrated with the calendar app like it integrates with the calendar web app.

5735,Anum Jamal,"April 23, 2019",4, Great app. Can you please include it in Google calendar app as well? can it also be dark mode? Also it will be nice to have cute visuals for shopping list (the way Google Assistant has). thank you!
5736,Korah Mathew,"November 13, 2018",3, Its needs an option to repeat the tasks.. For examples in the case periodical payments like emi's and stuff like that
5737,Manikanta th,"May 28, 2019",4, it will much better if a widget is also there showing the list if tasks on the screen instead of opening the app everytime and check the list

5747,Vishal Kumar,"December 27, 2018",1," I wanted to set reminder like i do with "" view reminders"" in assistant with some more functionality and prettier format, it doea nothing."
5748,Rengarajan Manivannan,"April 1, 2019",3, It would nice if the reminders created in Tasks synced into Calender so that we can see them in the Calender.

5752,Sharon D,"December 13, 2018",2, Very limited. No categories or locations. Can't set times or refiners and no widget. Try 2DO for the best electronic BuJo app
5753,Hachi Roca,"December 13, 2018",3, That would be wonderful if you could add a daily reminder or hour reminder. Bit it isn't like that. The design is beautiful though.

5755,Chris Elliott,"November 16, 2018",4, Would be a 5/5 if it had the option to add a widget to the home screen. Most other good task managers have that feature. C'mon Google - please implement a widget for this app.
5756,Melissa Dusseljee,"November 18, 2018",3," Simple and easy to use. If there were widgets and notifications, would be much better. Likely won't keep for those reasons....."
5757,Gabriel Ioniță,"May 30, 2019",4," After repeated task is marked as done, no other task in series is created. No widgets. No dark theme. PS: I discovered that repeated task for next task in series are created at midnight. Please add widget!"

5759,Sameer khan,"October 20, 2018",2, I think there should be a re-asking option before deteting events. I try to add new list and this app venished all my previous event without asking me anything.
5760,Sergiy Chumak,"April 11, 2019",2, Half baked. The latest update seems fixed the problem with sort by date for tasks but even worse mess created for subtasks... Does quality control exist at Google?

5765,Minesh Jethva,"July 13, 2019",1, These app has overlap with Google Keep and I Don't find any good reason to use this App.!!!!! Please add some extra ordinary features or merge with Keep. Otherwise Tasks is already dead to 500M people.
5766,Raíssa G,"July 17, 2019",4," perfect, exactly what I needed! the only flaw is the lack of a widget so I can add lists to my homescreen"

5776,Thomas K,"May 14, 2019",2, couldn't get it to open after installing. noway to view tasks in consolidated list vs. going thru each list individually.
5777,Tyson Presnell,"September 21, 2018",3, Looks promising but is pretty basic now. needs to have Google Assistant integration and widgets to be a killer app
5778,Ian Searle,"March 28, 2019",1, Recurring to-dos are not repeating. Not possible to see tasks in the calendar on Android.
5779,Павло Заморока,"October 8, 2018",2," Widget functionality is must have for this kind of app. Also it should be ""View all tasks"" screen."
5780,Justin Klingman,"October 11, 2018",1, I would like to create a to-do item and set a reminder date AND time. It's an embarrassment that you can't do both.

5785,Nitzan Shalev,"October 25, 2018",4," Clean and simple, flawless integration with Google calendar. I only wish it had a widget."
5786,Matt Ryan,"March 3, 2019",1," 1 star for missing simple features, like assistant intergation. Maybe i expect too much of goofle, like most of the internet."
5787,Jessica,"May 10, 2019",3," I really like this add-on/app but have found ""reoccurring"" tasks do not work & so I am uninstalling for now & looking elsewhere."
5788,A Google user,"September 24, 2018",2, Reminders would work if they had notifications of sort. It would be great if it was linked to the Calendar or had a widget.
5789,ravi madhur,"October 29, 2019",5, Thank you so much for considering my suggestions. Place a search icon and it'll be the perfect app. Thank you ! Thank you so much for the dark theme.
5790,Peter Duong,"June 11, 2019",3, Great app if look like the simplicity design and function and not over-done. Would be great if this app is Google Home friendly.

5792,Mahmoud Jaradat,"June 18, 2019",3," Basic task app, would be a hundred times better with the tasks showing on the calendar app on Android."
5793,Sean Schepers,"June 21, 2019",4, would be better if there was a full web version but instead you have to go into the calendar or Gmail website.
5794,Giscard Khoshaba,"July 19, 2019",5, simple feature makes this app crucial for my business. Email to Task when i can create tasks and the email is instantly added i dont forget emails anymore OUTSTANDING!!!
5795,Vinesh,"September 14, 2019",3, Feels like it is incomplete and half designed. The app has potential but needs much better integration and UX design

5797,Terry Parker,"October 19, 2019",4, Looks alright. If it is it will be 5 star. If not maybe even lower. Initial response.
5798,bhanu raja,"October 21, 2019",1, Widget is one main thing you should add as fast as possible to make user experience better. I uninstalled app because there is no widget.

5813,Roi Baer,"November 23, 2018",1," Lousy app on Android. Does not integrate with Gmail, not with calendar too. It's a piece of"
5814,Xander Hartman,"March 28, 2019",5, the new update that allows you to set times and repeating tasks combined with the option of marking a task complete from the drop-down menu takes this app up to the 5 star level for me
5815,Jasen Carter,"April 4, 2019",3, Not quite there. It has a start date but not an end date. I wanted a deadline for tasks. Has repeatable option and colaboration but again doesn't allow for closed time lines so no date for delivery.
5816,pallikonda srinivas,"November 19, 2018",4," Suggestion for a product feature. Gmail. Is it possible to integrate this with gmail? Ex: My premium due reminder email should have an option for me create a task/reminder/calendar event etc..,"

5820,Joseph & Cheryl Primeaux,"September 14, 2018",2, Deletes with no confirmation. Subtasks marked completed return as tasks when unchexked. No recurring capabilities. Very basic.

5825,Rachel Norris,"October 5, 2019",3, Works fine so far but would really like a widget so i can see it all at a glance without going into the app.
5826,Saige Swink,"November 3, 2019",4, I love Google so damn much! This app is just another awesome Google app that syncs with everything Google

5835,Kristina Miletic,"January 1, 2019",1," tasks cannot be reached, on my android app. But I can use it as a part of my Google app. I need it on my android too."
5836,Dave Wilde,"July 2, 2019",2, Finally added repeating tasks even though they are buggy. Can't believe there is no widget for this or snooze ability.
5837,Ahsan Syed,"September 12, 2018",1, Google is good everywhere so this is a real disappointment. Please make it cleaner than what it is right now. Small tasks are hard to prioritize and widget is not good.

5843,Raunaq Shah,"February 10, 2019",4, Nice and clean but should have 1. Ability to collapse the subtasks within a task 2. Set time reminders as well not just day reminder
5844,ashish doshi,"April 17, 2019",1, there must be option of find or search so that user can find task by keyboard which is very very essentially for user friendly experience
5845,Aliffan Ismail,"February 5, 2019",4," It's good. It's nicely designed, simple and neat. It does what it's supposed to do. But it definitely needs improvement."

5849,premkumar bhaskal,"March 4, 2019",2, It is not providing proper reminders for the tasks. It should be like a regular alarm reminder present on a phone.

5866,A Google user,"November 7, 2018",2," Nice app on its own, but not useful until it can integrate with the mobile calendar and/or Google Assistant"
5867,Anthony Pemberton,"February 4, 2019",2, Major flaw in this app - there is no ability to set reminders at specific times.
5868,Bronisław Werla,"November 30, 2018",4, I really like this app and its integration with gmail and calendar.   It would be great if this app had a widget as well.
5869,Aneesh R,"January 8, 2019",3," A great app, extremely minimal and streamlined. Missing a widget though."
5870,A Google user,"October 7, 2018",4, Its great but would be better if you were able to sort the list alphabetically.
5871,Husein Indra Kusuma,"November 29, 2018",5, I think will the best if this tasks give widget in the phone. It will easy to use and checklist the deadline it self
5872,A Google user,"September 24, 2018",3," could easily get there with a bit of focus. as everyone says, it's currently a beta at best."
5873,Gordon McCague,"September 18, 2018",2, This software does not work in landscape mode on my tablet. It keeps switching to portrait view. #useless
5874,Vladimir Shevchenko,"April 30, 2019",1, What a writer'weird step down. Gmail works worse with Google tasks than with 3rd party apps. This app is very barebones.
5875,Damond Nollan,"May 18, 2019",4, A couple of things that I'd love to see happen: 1) Connect Google Tasks to Google Calendar for the mobile apps and 2) Allow me to share (or assign) tasks with others.
5876,Umberto Gravante,"March 27, 2019",4," easy and useful app but would be perfect if we could see our tasks in google calendar phone app, as happens in webview from pc."

5880,Jozef Horvath,"May 28, 2019",3, I dont get notifications from this app when I set the specific hour for reminder ... earlier was everything ok 🙁 ... my notification setings are correct.
5881,Kip Ashbourne,"September 19, 2019",1, It syncs your reminders then clutters everything. Now had reminders from assistant and this waste of memory space app use something else. What a waste of time.
5882,abdurrahman açıkgöz,"September 26, 2019",2," Lacks some of basic user needs. Cant swipe thru lists, have to select from lower left hamburger menu. Does not have a proper android widget etc"
5883,It's Rupinder,"November 15, 2019",2, Doesn't work with assistant. Assistant make it's own tasks which sucks

5887,Casian KasArts,"September 13, 2018",3, Very basic and doesn't even sync properly with the desktop version.
5888,A Google user,"February 26, 2019",3," This works well, since Reminder lists stopped working properly after the OS update. Could you create a widget to show Tasks and arrange the list to always be visible?"
5889,Geoff Chueh,"June 14, 2019",1, Not very useful as it doesnt integrate into the google calendar app. Please make this better!
5890,Evan Whitaker,"February 5, 2019",2," Simple and easy to use but why does this even exist? Google Keep has a widget, is just as easy to use and is much more versatile."
5891,A Google user,"January 1, 2019",4, clean. simple. need to add collaboration like Google keep so you can work on tasks as a team.
5892,Natalie Willemse,"March 24, 2019",3," I like the app, it would be nice if you can upload a task by image, or voice note."
5893,Chengmu Yan,"December 10, 2018",1, Tasks don't save or suddenly vanish without a trace. This product is not trustworthy.
5894,Ian Miller,"November 19, 2018",3, Need a widget so people can see their todo list at a glance from their homescreen without having to launch the app.  This is a need for any todo app and every other todo app out there has this feature.

5899,Inge Bosmans,"July 18, 2019",4, could be improved but it works for me but I'm not sure if it works with Google home I cannot make it work yet

5913,Grimmity Mobile Gaming,"October 2, 2018",2, Honestly the app is useless to me without a widget. Need to see and mark things as complete things from the home screen.
5914,Praveer Concessao,"September 26, 2018",4, Simple. Good for mundane work. With a checklist.
5915,Brandon Farley,"March 3, 2019",1, Google apps like tasks and messaging are a disaster. There is no way people who build these things actually use them because they are not useful. Reminder vs task vs calendar event. not all show up on mobile vs desktop calendar. What an embarrassment.
5916,Erenmenastro,"March 28, 2019",5, Completely awesome with new update! It still needs some color like Google keep but it's a reminder app now who can you make organized.
5917,vivek dani,"November 11, 2018",2, UX is not user friendly. Too many taps to add date and sub task.
5918,Chad Thomsen,"November 28, 2018",4, Great app. Please add a time to the due date feature. Please add in reminders like google keep has as well.
5919,Chris Lu,"April 13, 2019",3," tasks made in the app wont link to google calendar, which would be its primary form of usefulness, imo"
5920,Stephanie Taylor,"January 6, 2019",5, I have done away with paper notebooks and used this app and saved many trees. I like the checkbox feature as well.
5921,Kevin H.,"November 15, 2018",1, Does not sync automatically. Unable to undo a completed task.
5922,Nate Caine,"January 1, 2019",2," Far too limited to be of much value. Also too much overlap with Google ""Keep"". What's the strategy here?"
5923,Nick Marnik,"April 10, 2019",1, recurring tasks don't work properly missing Google calendar integration on mobile Google Assistant integration would be nice
5924,Aaron Charlong,"October 12, 2018",2, Would be much more beneficial of the app could give notification reminders of tasks so I don't have to check constantly.
5925,swagath vl,"November 30, 2018",3," This app is great,but it has no daily reminding option. I would suggest add that opption on next update"
5926,Ilko Germanov,"May 28, 2019",4, I like the design and functionality. Would recommend adding recurring events option. Like hourly option.
5927,Carl Leonard,"July 16, 2019",2," Doesn't do landscape on my Samsung Galaxy Tab a 10.1 on install. Fired of my ""Must do Landscape."" rule. Uninstalled without any further testing."

5930,Brian Nacy,"August 5, 2019",2, Cannot use Google assistant to add tasks. Other well known apps allow you to do this but for some reason 2 Google products cannot.
5931,Anderson,"August 12, 2019",1, This app does not come with a widget for convenient checklist management from the Home screen. Massive oversight
5932,deniz kurtman,"August 22, 2019",2," Clever idea to separate tasks and calender apps. Thank you, it's veey functional !"
5933,Eric Palkovich,"August 15, 2019",5, its excellent! keeps me literally on task is an easy to use interface.
5934,Alexander,"August 26, 2019",2," Incredibly mediocre. Would have expected something more polished, user friendly and feature rich from a company like Google."
5935,Austin Texas,"April 13, 2020",1, Way too lacking. No import or export.
5936,Jersey Keagan Camungol,"September 8, 2019",4," I love this app because of its interface which is just simple, however could you please create a widget for this app so that I can still view my tasks even on homescreen. Thanks!"
5937,Nolan Andreas Schaefer,"October 15, 2019",5, As a college student this thing is great for staying on top of studies and assignments. Also oddly satisfying to click each item off the to do list as I complete them
5938,Anthony P.,"January 29, 2020",5, Indispensable! I use this app every single day
5939,Ajaay penny,"February 8, 2020",5, Love it. Just wish it would come in the calendar app.

5944,Yusuf Jamal,"April 9, 2020",4, Good enough to be my app but I have a Samsung and it doesnt integrate as well
5945,Lucas,"September 17, 2018",1, Completely useless unless Google adds reminders for a specific time instead of just a date.
5946,Ethan Sickler,"December 18, 2018",3," Great app, but there is no widget available for Android. Unacceptable."
5947,Christopher Berner,"November 17, 2018",1, No recurring tasks. Inbox had much better task reminders until they killed it...
5948,Trường Giang Phạm,"May 20, 2019",1," App lacks some important features: group, tag, syncs with Google calendar, smart due"
5949,Rohit Sawai,"October 8, 2018",4, Please add undo and redo option. If I accidently delete any list item then I can't undo that work. Please add this option
5950,BISWAJIT SAHU,"March 27, 2019",4," Simple and useful apps . It will be better if there is an options for tasks export , import to another google account."
5951,Michael Kamau,"April 25, 2019",4," Great app, why can't I just set reminder for Tomorrow (Morning Afternoon... Etc) do I have to use popup to select time for every reminder?"
5952,Facundo Alvarado,"September 23, 2018",5, One of the best To-Do apps out there. Extremely simple and straight to the point.
5953,Michael Brokloff,"May 6, 2019",1, been using app for a month - it crashed and will not display anything. I reinstalled - same problem Help!

5956,Piotr Włodarczyk,"January 15, 2019",1," Poor basic app, rarely updated, no integration with Keep or shopping list."
5957,A Google user,"March 2, 2019",1," there is a big problem every time I want to open app it doesnt connect and says ""cant reach tasks"" unless I use a VPN"
5958,A Google user,"September 9, 2019",1, One of the crapiest app. Need full redo on this. Sad. 😐 UI sucks. No integration with other google apps.
5959,Ira Mavi,"November 15, 2018",5, I love this app! Makes everyday tasks so easy to remember and organize.
5960,Morgan Plain,"June 4, 2019",1," Rarely does it actually notify for tasks that you set a recurring notification for. Considering this is the apps only use, that makes it objectively useless"
5961,Bobby P,"June 5, 2019",5, Love the app. It would be great if we could reorder subtasks and set tasks with subtasks to be recurring.
5962,Thomas Jefferson Estayan,"June 17, 2019",5, Still lacks some features but I love it because it's stable (compared to other apps) and helpful!
5963,James Park,"June 20, 2019",1," 4 stars if: please add toggle to keep completed/strikethrown tasks where they are (""Unhide completed tasks"")"

5966,Vineeth Joshy,"August 6, 2019",5, It would be better if we could give different colours to different lists.
5967,Ashley Dawn,"September 20, 2019",1," Wanted an app to share tasks, it doesn't. Deleted. Dissatisfied and o n the hunt for the right app."
5968,Nancy Lidstone,"September 23, 2019",2, This app would be so much more useful if it was integrated with Google calendar app like it is on the desktop version.

5975,Afzal Abdul,"November 22, 2018",4, Simple and easy to use. Would appreciate if there was a option to set time for reminders

5978,Shubham Ture,"July 26, 2019",3, Adding tasks is good and so is the UI but in terms of functionality app lacks behind some renowned apps like Any-Do and GTasks.
5979,Kamal Sharma,"October 24, 2018",4, A small suggestion.. please provide a widget for it.. as it would be better if we can see it on a side screen rather than opening it every time..
5980,chris scott,"April 13, 2019",5, this does everything i need simple and effective across mutiple platforms. and its free! thanks!
5981,Dima Mnkach,"September 24, 2018",3," It is nice, but widget is necessary for apps like this. But there are no widgets there."
5982,Mario Souto,"September 30, 2018",3, I think that the app could let me mark hours and minutes within the date and the task should appear on Google calendar's widget
5983,A Google user,"December 15, 2018",1, Using Google Keep for tasks is actually easier. This app just doesn't do reminders the way I need them for it to be useful

5991,Jonathan Wang,"July 19, 2019",4," Decent to-do list, but doesn't sync with Google Assistant."

6004,David Kelly,"January 5, 2019",3, Average. Annoying that you cannot schedule a task for a date AND time. Please fix rhis.
6005,Carl Fraley,"December 30, 2018",5, Simple and useful. I like the fact that it synchronizes with Google calendar.
6006,Keith David Opulencia,"November 13, 2018",3, Useless. Use Google Keep. Much better. Much efficient. Much useful in multiple ways.

6010,super light speed,"November 19, 2018",4, Wish you had a widget that let you show tasks either by date due or which list they are part of like keep since it's pretty well thought out otherwise
6011,Anees Rana,"January 14, 2019",1, It doesn't give notifications even on due date. No option for timing Notifications. Microsoft ToDo is the best.
6012,Karl Gruber,"April 8, 2019",4, Missing a lot of features (including from Google's own Keep) but it's a good step!
6013,Florian Riedmann,"November 8, 2018",1, Does NOT integrate with android calander. Setting a date on tasks is cumbersome and tasks do not get sorted.

6020,Dawid Wiewiórski,"June 26, 2019",4, Please give me a way to see all of today's tasks in all categories. I would also be very grateful for displaying tasks in the calendar application. After that the application is amazing
6021,Chris Day,"September 5, 2019",2," If you want something very, very basic it's fine but there are better apps out there."
6022,Melissa Major,"September 20, 2019",1, Useless. Unable to set reminders of any kind. I need an ADHD 'friendly' app and this ain't it.

6034,Rajat,"May 13, 2019",1, this app has the features that i might need but the only thing it lack for me is the attractiveness for opening this app everytime i want to save or do a task.
6035,Aravind Ganesh,"March 13, 2019",3," Really Nice and simple but could use features like widget, reveal/collapse sub-tasks etc."
6036,Steven Negus,"March 17, 2019",2, Lacking. Needs a Widget and notification access option. Also needs a projects entry so that you can group entrys together.
6037,vathsa sri,"September 12, 2018",1, What good is an to-do app if it doesn't even have a widget. As much as I like to keep my to-do's in sync opening the app everytime is a pain
6038,A Google user,"September 25, 2018",3," Almost there, Google bit doesn't quite do it. No ability to set specific times?"
6039,Brad Charles,"November 15, 2018",1, buggy...... almost every click pops the keyboard and URLs in the details seem to break the task
6040,Datta Hillur,"November 4, 2018",2, Please find checklist app developed by fitmobapps. Update like that. That app is user friendly. I expect same options from google.
