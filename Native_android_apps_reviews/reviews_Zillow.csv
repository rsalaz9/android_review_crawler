Back that it worked wonderfully. Now unfortunately I get houses that I do not want even though I specified that I do not want them such as HOA'S. Get quite understand what happened to this app obviously they are not keeping up with it I do not recommend it anymore going to check out red fin.
1,Johnny Appleseed,"April 23, 2020",4," Love this app! Love the map search feature!! I've been using the app the last week and it has been great, until today.

Now anytime it's loading the map it crashes. I've uninstalled amd reinstalled multiple times, restarted my phone and it still wont work in map mode. Seems like it could be my mobile device but other apps are working just fine. I'm at a loss, i hope it will work in the future, there's no better app for sale and rental properties than Zillow!!"

I try to open the app, everything seems to load but the map and then it crashes. And on a side note the app bugged me about a lot of different properties I was mildly interested in, but managed to let a deal of a lifetime that I had faved slip through un-notified and we lost our chance :c I can only assume some grey-washing flippers are planning to ruin the poor thing."

I'm actively looking for a home and this app was extremely helpful until the last update. Now it crashes 3 seconds after opening. I've started to use thevRealtor app, but the listing prices are higher for the exact same homes i had in my favorites on Zillow. Don't know which listing price is real."

Also a feature to exclude some neighborhoods for example I would like to search Fairfield county without having to look at Bridgeport or other unfavorable areas. It really takes up too much time trying to get thru the cities you don't like."

They have so many listings and the app and website is easy to navigate and understand. The only thing I wish they had were reviews of apartment complexes so I could see how others feel about the complexes and the management of said complexes.
6,thiago garvio,"April 19, 2020",3," it is help and let's me see different houses in the market w/o having to drive too far. However, some listings are not quite up to date. Also, there is no way to filter ""pre-foreclosure"" and ""foreclosed"" properties. They show up as available properties, without prices due to being owned by the bank."
7,TSB,"April 24, 2020",2," It has some good features, like the details and price history, which is very useful. But it's not up to date and you can't filter out foreclosures. Also houses for rent when lessed revert to an old prior sold price instead of indicating they were leased."
8,Frederick Elliott,"April 22, 2020",2, I love this app except for the fact that every single day I get a notice about a new listing in my area and it's a house that has been on here for many months now.

The person trying to rent the room keeps changing the add everyday so that everyone gets a notice. I am considering deleting this app just because of that one person. If I could block them from showing up on my end I would.
9,Marcos H,"April 2, 2020",1," There are houses listed on Zillow that can only be found if you search for them by address.

Good is a more trustworthy site than this app. My real estate agent presented with over 10 house which have been on the market for several weeks but didn't appear when a search for the town the house were listed. But as soon as I entered the address, like magic the house appeared with all of the information."
10,Kandice Horton,"April 25, 2020",2," I initially loved this app, but after the update yesterday, it will not load at all. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. No fix. Hope it gets fixed soon. I'll rate it better."
11,Michael Schmidt,"April 12, 2020",4, Great way to check real estate values. It's been helpful as I have helped some younger friends plan to buy a home. I do have one friend however who sold his house for more than twice the zedtimate. So be aware that values given are estimates!
12,James Monroe,"April 10, 2020",1," I used to be able to view the whole country map, with houses. After clicking on a zillow email about a particular zip code, that zip is all I can view, no matter how many reboots, restarts I do (it's not in the search, filters or anywhere else). Maybe if I uninstall, and reinstall."
13,"marshab 1 of 3 VCA, school board meeting","April 18, 2020",4," Love seeing properties as soon as they are listed. Don't have to wait for an agent. Can eliminate those that won't work for us. But would like it if we did not get repeated notifications for those properties not on the market any longer, for sometimes years."
14,Martin White,"April 10, 2020",5," Utilize this app weekly, it runs smoothly, although sometimes search parameters can exclude relevant results. If I find a property on another app I will look it up for review on Zillow. Information that constitutes search results is only as good as the realtors who upload the listings."
15,Tim Morris,"April 16, 2020",3, I've used this application for my rental home two different times and the second time it's just not working while trying to access applications. Can't get ahold of anyone from Zillow on the phone and there appears to be no email responses coming back to me so I'm disappointed
16,Cheri M,"April 23, 2020",3," I like it, but I really wish I could see my tags on the website as well, and an option to not show me a particular house would be awesome too. Really tired of notifications about a house I hate, but I can't exclude it from my saved search."
17,Dana Teagle,"April 3, 2020",3," Wonderful app ! but I hate the geographical map !! if you want to push one red dot you may end up pushing a totally different one because they're so close together sometimes... That's annoying. The map isn't needed, it would be better off if they got rid of it.."
18,Lopez TV,"April 8, 2020",5," Finding houses was like finding a needle in a hay sack. Zillow made it a ton lot easier to find not just the houses but land, ect. All the house information shows up in just one touch. Zillow is a very usful app when finding your Ideal home, I recommend this app to everyone."
19,Doug Krueger,"April 24, 2020",1," Update 4/24: Crashes on open since 5PM 4/23. T-Mobile confirms Zillow has issues. Love the features and design. Great job!

Moving from Colorado to North Carolina, we don't know which town, so one suggestion, please allow sorting of favorites by state and town so I can plan a trip. Exporting the list would also be excellent. Thanks!"
20,Tzahi Ben Shabat,"April 24, 2020",1," Be careful posting properties in Zillow!! They claim to be transparent but log everything you post without giving you an option to change non public data.

They claim to be transparent but log everything you post without giving you an option to change non public data. This results in an obscure POV of your property. I learned to cautious with posting on Zillow and will definitely share my story with my colleagues, friends and other home owners"
21,Kris Bock,"April 3, 2020",5, Fantastic! I love that you can set what filters for exactly what you want and don't have to sift through all the houses to find the right ones. They also pick houses you may like based off your preferences. It's easy to get a short list of houses with the heart icon.
22,Kass Pilak,"April 4, 2020",5," My favorite app of all time. I have spent more time on this searching houses of my dreams hoping someday when I decide to buy, this is where I'll come to find it. It's also helping cure my boredom of being quarantined during the covid19 pandemic. Couldn't ask for better app."
23,J. Scott Thorn,"April 24, 2020",1, The navigation on this app is god awful. Absolutely terrible user experience. Search is clunky at best. Can't continue using this to look for my house. Get some UX specialists to overhaul the look and feel of this app. It needs help.
24,Aaron Lin,"April 24, 2020",3," It was working well until it started crashing on my Google Pixel 3 phone (Android 10) on 4/23... I've tried to rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app, but nothing works... Does anyone know what's the issue and how to fix it? Thank you!"
25,Margie Nitschke,"April 12, 2020",5," I love this app, its really helped me see what's available and how fast homes are selling, etc. I also LOVE seeing the older homes in our area, their charm and beautiful character🌞!! Thank you!!!"
26,Ross Hollinger,"April 12, 2020",4," So far so good. 5 stars when you add a feature that allows to rate our saved homes from 1 to 10 (or 5) and allow sorting based on that. Also, allow us to input custom numbers for price, acreage, etc., rather than having presets in a drop down."
27,Cheryl Purcell,"April 10, 2020",5," Easy to use and gives all necessary info, photos, etc. Have had a lot of fun and education searching properties and getting to know this areas housing market through the Zillow app. My favorite way to ""wander"" this city."
28,Philip Eubanks,"April 12, 2020",3," One of the things I find most frustrating with this app is having to see houses I lost interest in after the first time I viewed it but it still shows up on the app. There should be a way to ""archive"" homes I no longer want to see when I've done a search."
29,Henna Sky,"April 18, 2020",3," Please put a Hide button for listings! It's very silly and frustrating that you got rid of it. Ive wasted so much time clicking on the same places over and over, hoping they are new listings."
30,jcott,"April 18, 2020",1," Not user-friendly. It has access to my location, but if I try to search near me, nothing happens. I can't clear old searches. I just want to page through my options. Why can't I do that? The only app worse is Truila."
31,Glen Wortham,"April 24, 2020",5, Easy to use. Price is marked so I can choose something in my range and not waste my time or yours searching around. Easy to navigate map to search listings. Many ways to search listings.
32,Kevin Yeoman,"April 23, 2020",2, This version does not run properly on my Moto G7 Power. It sits and spins never loading. On rare occasions it will load but only works for for few minutes then back to spinning. Not useful in this condition.
33,Effie Storr,"April 22, 2020",3, There need to be changes to this app. I am tired of seeing houses that that are rentals. Please let searchers not see those. Also we should be able to not see houses that does'nt have inside pictures and also houses that are fixer upers.
34,Bernard Lubinsky,"April 22, 2020",3," The new listings alert is pretty awful. I get ""new listing"" alerts many days in a row for the SAME house. This really needs to be fixed. If they can fox that bug, the rating would go up."
35,Tim,"April 11, 2020",4," Would like more search parameters. Also, a plugin that can show drivetimes from the house being looked at, to a specific pin dropped for a reference of work travel. Google maps overlay for shopping in area of interest."
36,Tracy Arita,"April 20, 2020",3," App is great, except I think it was a big mistake to take out the feature of not showing a house if you're not interested. If the feature was still there, it'd be a 5 star rating for sure."
37,Tala Chavis,"April 14, 2020",5," Very easy to navigate through, gives you tons of options. Gives you the option to modify your needs/wants in a listing/unit. Overall lovely app for finding great rentals or properties."
38,Shana Deloach,"April 18, 2020",4, This is a good tool for home searching remotely. The app functions work good now. Be careful because there are some Scammers who still manage to slip through the cracks! Consumers please be aware!
39,Manjyot Singh,"April 18, 2020",5," It works, has all the right filters and browsing is easy/quick for me to navigate through what's available. Looking forward anything done to improve ux and make things even faster/easier!"
40,Michelle Ross,"April 21, 2020",5," Love, love, love this app! It is easy to have multiple searches, alerts are useful, easy to find your Saved items. ~ Michelle, Stevens Point, WI"
41,Irma Suarez,"April 8, 2020",5," I was able to purchase my last two home by utilizing Zillow. The app is amazing. I can travel any where to look for homes and see what the going price is for Real Estate, without leaving my home! I recommend this app to everyone."
42,Rebekah DeRaps,"April 11, 2020",4," The whole app is super easy. You can filter through prices, amount of rooms, and so many more to find the perfect home. There's tons of extra bits and bobbles that make it an enjoyable and informative app"
43,Josh Hinton,"April 6, 2020",4, The map could use some improvement. It would be nice to have a feature that measures driving distances. Overall I like the format for the most part and it easy to navigate.
44,Kevin M,"April 9, 2020",3, Constantly sending me notifications about houses that don't meet my search criteria. If I wanted a house in another area I would have selected that area. If i wanted a house with less than 1/2 acre I wouldn't have selected 1/2 acre.
45,Kae Kay,"April 14, 2020",1," I use to love this App, but recently it stopped updating. Now I get zero results REGARDLESS of the City I select or search criteria I use! What in the world happened???"
46,Kim Clark,"April 25, 2020",4," Love the app, finds all the houses based on what I'm looking for. I wish I could hide the homes I'm not interested in though."
47,Adriana Munoz,"April 12, 2020",4, This app is very easy to use and makes house hunting easier. The only thing is that it is not always up to date and shows houses that have already been sold. Overall my experience using this app has been great and I recommend it.
48,Alberto Tovar,"April 14, 2020",5," Amazing app! For buying and renting. Schools for each house is great. Houses in a school district of the school you want your kids to go to, fantastic!"
49,Edward Spradlin,"April 14, 2020",1," zillow is really declining lately. each month less and less homes are listed on here. but I know they are for sale. just have to do it the old school way. I also hate when you search for houses, you get a bunch of trailers too. I didn't click on Manufactured"
50,Justsomeguy,"April 12, 2020",4," App seems pretty good, but need an option to filter out houses you are not interested in. Also, seems like other websites list a lot of houses which don't show up here."
51,Dipankar Chatterjee,"April 17, 2020",4," Useful app with nice search features. To make it more useful I recommend Zillow introduce a comparison feature allowing users to compare listings between two or more towns. Compare on price, taxes, schools, libraries, grocery stores Etc"
52,SwEddieMurphy,"April 12, 2020",2, I'll give this app a five star rating if they'd actually remove auction houses when you filter them out. I deselect auctions yet they all still show up. Please fix your app.
53,Paul Krauss,"April 24, 2020",1, There is no search button - stupid! You're stuck after select filter choices. Very annoying please fix it in your app.
54,Joe Biden,"April 8, 2020",1, App crashes every time I try to scroll through pictures of a posted listing. Connected to Wi-Fi or with Max bars 4g doesn't make a difference. Running on LG Stylo 3.
55,Tony G,"April 11, 2020",1, Horribly app. Not the easiest to navigate and is extremely slow. Often doesn't show rental property even though all settings are correct.
56,Bill Phillips,"April 24, 2020",1," Since the recent updates, this app shuts down after 2 seconds. Now it is unusable. Please fix, as we are looking to relocate soon."
57,Andrea Fisher,"April 19, 2020",2, I am unable to delete a search area i am no longer interested in. I keep seeing the same type of house over and over again. There is nothing unique about any of them.
58,JenniferLynn Jopp,"April 5, 2020",4," Their could be a few better features like exclude foresclosure, pre forclosure and auction properties. Also being able to x out or exculde hoses your not interested in and have them not show up on your search would make the app above 5 stars."
59,Emko,"April 11, 2020",4," If there is one thing i could change it's that annoyingly slow slider view when selecting a listing from the map.

It is super slow and moves the entire map up along with it as it goes up, then moves back down on deselect, super slow again. It should snap like bam, bam. The annoying slider should also disappear when i exit a listing and show only the map. Right now when i exit a listing by tapping the top left arrow button, I see the map again but half of it is being obstructed by the slider."
60,Way Worth,"April 17, 2020",5," I gave it five stars because unlike online and other apps this one is up to date, I'm currently in a inpatient program and I'm closer to getting a place now thrn I've ever been and this app is helping with that a lot I just wish I had a bit more cash to be real"
61,Jamie Snitzer,"April 25, 2020",2, This app freezes and shuts down almost everytime I open it. It started after their last update on 4/10. Otherwise it would be a good app
62,Angela Tsui,"April 25, 2020",5, The places on this app is current with the marketplace. Makes you happy to have found a home of good choice.
63,Irma Eaves,"April 22, 2020",5, Best app for locating and viewing any property. The information on each listing helps me make up my mind if a physical tour is next. Great job
64,Mei Akuna,"April 7, 2020",3," Pretty solid app, but could use improvement. It would be nice if I could sort by commute time for example. I really like the lot lines feature."
65,Rebecca Burnett,"April 10, 2020",4," Great, but I wish you could mark ones you dont like so they disappear off your searches. That would be extremely helpful."
66,Davis Frydman,"April 13, 2020",3," It is a great app, but could use a feature such as an ability to mark a house so that I know I've seen and not liked the house"
67,Rachel Collins,"April 17, 2020",4," I wish there was a filter to filter out homes that have a 3d view available. As well as, floor plans."
68,Amy Pruett,"April 25, 2020",4, Zillow is wonderful! I think the provide good information and an easy way to search.
69,Noreen Vee,"April 4, 2020",2," It used to be easy friendly, you could select exactly what style of home u are looking for. And location. Now it is ?? Homes I am not interested in! Fix it."
70,V Reed,"April 4, 2020",1, Have to create an account to really use it. Things get auto turned on. It's forcing me to only look at foreclosures now with no pics of the home. The online web page is way better! Useless app.
71,tiffany kapourellos-pitre,"April 11, 2020",4," Our realtor said zillow is about a day or so behind in real time intonation. We were using the app to find houses and would be 1 day too late on the ones we liked. However, I do like the information about the schools"
72,Michael Burke,"April 25, 2020",1," The best feature I was using during our house searching was being able to highlight an address on some other realtor website, tapping map and selecting the Zillow app and it loading right up. That feature was just removed, I have down graded to the last version this was available for the time being....Full ReviewThe best feature I was using during our house searching was being able to highlight an address on some other realtor website, tapping map and selecting the Zillow app and it loading right up. That feature was just removed, I have down graded to the last version this was available for the time being. Please consider reinstating this feature. Thank you."
73,John W.,"April 24, 2020",3, It's not intuitive how to navigate. Sometimes prices are shown other times not at all. Kludgey is best to describe it.
74,Valerie Lee,"April 23, 2020",4," Has been great! 😁 Until today, I've updated the app, restarted my phone. App still won't load...?😡 Lol... never mind I had reinstall... 😉"
75,Chance Stanley,"April 25, 2020",4, As soon as I open the app it crashes. Uninstall and reinstalled still just crashes. A great app up to this point though.
76,Jasmine Rice,"April 5, 2020",2," They really need to sort out their categories, so frustrating looking for HOUSES and the majority of things showing up being apartments and townhouses."
77,M E,"April 11, 2020",4," I wish there was a feature to dislike a property so then when it pops up on a recurring search, it is more efficient."
78,Wander Lust,"April 19, 2020",2," Terrible, website much better. App showing up no homes or 3 where website had 40+. What the heck. No way to search my zip code, and surrounding. Deleted."
79,April Jones,"April 17, 2020",5, Zillow is my go to app to search for homes! It's extremely user friendly and the large quality photos make choosing the perfect home effortless!
80,catherine ingram,"April 17, 2020",5, Awesome!!! It cuts to the chase and shows me everything for sale in the area I'm looking.
81,Dwayne S Coley,"April 25, 2020",1, This app is horrible....why I'm not able to view multiple listings & not have to click on each dot on the map is crazy
82,Vaughn Sterling,"April 22, 2020",3," Saw more listings without the app. App doesn't allow me to view a list, just the map. Much less efficient."
83,Anthony Castellon,"April 7, 2020",3, Very helpful... but there's not a lot of listings for what I'm personally interested in... but still worth the app.
84,Nina Rae,"April 5, 2020",1, This app used to work on my phone but recently I can't even use it. The screen goes black when I scroll into an appartments details and I can't read anything.
85,Stephanie Gamba,"April 5, 2020",3, I would like to suggest a feature that allows you to remove the homes you already said no to so you don't have to keep seeing them. Also please allow for a sort by monthly payments.
86,Lashann Williams,"April 19, 2020",5, I love this app. It gives you the crime rate for each residence that is listed. It is very easy to naviagate.
87,Fritt Fallande,"April 18, 2020",1, No option to delete account. You have to email them and they dont answer.

You have to email them and they dont answer. I just want my account to be deleted and theyre an absolutely disgusting company for doing this. Im reporting your app on the play store every day until you delete my account or at least let me change the email so it isnt on my main account
88,GJ Cantrell,"April 23, 2020",1," Glitchy. I'm constantly checking for updates because the app doesnt work properly, but no updates."
89,Gage Duke,"April 24, 2020",3, The filters with this app never work with any update. Other than that it's a fun app to look at houses.
90,Sue Copening,"April 9, 2020",1, If I could give zero stars I would. Not having a way to get a list view is moronic. You waste time poking on dots instead of quickly scrolling like you can on the website. Deleted.
91,Dawn Sale,"April 24, 2020",1," The app closes as soon as I open it. I've tried clearing my cache, deleting/reinstalling, restarting my phone, etc. with no luck."
92,Memes are Life,"April 23, 2020",1, Can't search for homes effectively. App redirects me to provide information for me listing a property. When I am actually searching for property.
93,Adam Nichols,"April 25, 2020",1, App was running well with no problems. Now it keeps crashing everytime i try to open the app.
94,Cherie Lewis,"April 4, 2020",5, Always easy to get to. Usually keeps up with the current price. Zillow is one of my favorites
95,Pamela Wilson-Blakeney,"April 18, 2020",5, It is packed with features that are easy to use. Provides tons of information on every property. Love it!
96,Jeff Blackman,"April 19, 2020",1," App is total waste, looking for property and the locations are not eve6 the correct location. How hard is it to get a location correct."
97,Leroy Leggs,"April 21, 2020",4, A very enjoyable app that offers great pics that allows you see the properties as if you were there in person.
98,Gabriel Albores,"April 23, 2020",1, Doesnt work anymore. Cannot open or operate app. Constantly crashes. Even after updating or resetting/restarting
99,Chidi Nyeche,"April 8, 2020",5, Always fun and easy to locate listings for sale or rent anywhere in the United states.
100,Xavier Rivera,"April 15, 2020",3, Good app. Haven't been able to find something yet. But nothing to do with the app. It is clear and concise.
101,Cat Mama1264,"April 17, 2020",3," It just stops getting any new home info after awhile ! It's frustrating. Otherwise, when it works right it is awesome !"
102,A Google user,"February 19, 2020",3," For the love of all that is holy... fix the issue with the filters. I specifically deselected showing me auctions and I still end up with 4-5 houses that are listed as auction in each town I look in. This has been going on for ages.

198,Jonah Hutchins,"April 9, 2020",1," This had got to be one of the most glitchy apps of all time. The filter setting doesn't work, and the geographical map is absolutely terrible. Nothing like the Zillow website which is actually good. Use Trulia"
199,James Kostan,"April 16, 2020",1," Not impressed, very difficult to pull up homes for sale,doesn't give you a list,like other apps do,sorry,heard Zillow was good place go buy a home.My mistake..."
200,Joshua Saunders,"March 28, 2020",3," Sort sequence is working normally again. I really wish there was a setting to disable the in-app browser. Its great that so many county assessor links are available, but none of them work properly with the in-app browser."
201,M Gibbs-Ruby,"April 4, 2020",2," It's good in theory, but even with the ""Auction"" option turned off and only the ""For sale"" option turned on, my results are so clogged with Auction properties that it basically makes the app worthless to me."
202,Eric Kennedy,"April 15, 2020",5, Things work and its nice to have a repository for real estate.
203,A G,"April 25, 2020",1, App crashes constantly. Not able to open without crashing

205,James McIntyre,"March 27, 2020",5, You guys have a great app here. Lots of information. Very good map. Upto date. Pictures. One of these days I'm going to have to make the leap to Helo Hi. Your app. makes it a lot simpler. Thankyou.
206,Anya Nicholson,"April 6, 2020",4, Great app! It's almost addictive. One constructive criticism tho....wish they showed the general location of all the homes...like an outline of the state it's in with a star where that particular town exists.
207,Jackie Royer,"April 16, 2020",5, Very accurate and make my search easier love it Zillow fun place to shop.
208,Deb Gould,"April 17, 2020",4," Quick, easy way to search for real estate opportunities!"
209,Anonymous,"February 28, 2020",3," This app is pretty good except its like it doesn't matter what filters I use it still gives me ones that I don't want, for instance I have auctions unchecked but yet half of my results are auctions. Just kind of annoying."
210,Proverbialfunk,"February 29, 2020",1, A case study in why you should NOT update apps! after last update does not show houses that are not for sale. Exceptionally bad user interface. Used to be a great app then apparently got too big.
211,Yelitza Colon,"March 7, 2020",5, I love Zillow!!!!! This app helped me find the perfect home at a perfect location with the price just right. This app definitely works I recommend this to anyone trying to find a home. Also you get quick responses with actual people I can't be any happier with my new home thanx Zillow.
212,Brenda Neagle,"February 15, 2020",4," I love Zillow. The only improvement that I would make is if looking at the listing section, you need to pick a town. There should be an option of And surrounding area. This does it for the map option not sure why not for listing."
213,CiCi Love,"February 28, 2020",4," It's an alright app. It doesn't show every listing so be sure to check other apps, but overall good. Applies your filters and help you get the best bang for your buck."

Incorrect realtor information such as my realtor is noted as having only 1 closing in the last year when she has had over 19. This caused her to lose a listing due to a seller believing Zillow facts over real people 😡 This app is garbage and not worth your time. Contact an actual real estate representative ( I recommend Berkshire Hathaway) to get all the real facts and accurate listings.
215,Matt L,"April 23, 2020",2, App keeps crashing upon opening. Can't even use it.

217,Brandy See,"February 16, 2020",4," Great app for buyers. Couldn't figure out how to shut off foreclosures, which was annoying. *It's a sub listing under ""for sale"". Overall great though."
218,away withwordz,"February 26, 2020",1, I'm assuming that since Zillow is now in the market for purchasing homes they have intentionally created bugs in the new update. I can't think of any other reason a perfectly working app now sucks.
219,Jerry Brown,"April 23, 2020",1, App crashed since update today. Cant do anything at all.
220,Travas Moore,"April 23, 2020",4, It's Ben grat I have had no problems out of the website it's easy to find what I'm looking for without hassle s
221,Sweetz 2Chic,"March 6, 2020",1, No listing ever on apartment in the price range or area I put in but I can go to hot pads or another app and find so many apartments and houses. The app just does me no good maybe it's a bug or something I dont know but it can be better.
222,Heather Herche,"March 22, 2020",2," No matter what all my searches show houses I've tried not to. I deselect foreclose, still get at least 40 mixed in. I deselect townhome, still get a ton of those as well. It's nice that it's free, but I have to sort my own already sorted results."
223,Maya Post,"April 23, 2020",4," Hi. I love the app, but right now it keeps crashing when I open it. Anything I can do to fix it?"
224,Ian H,"February 17, 2020",1, Horrible...this app is lowering the price of my home while home with the same square footage are significantly higher. The comps in the neighborhood affect all homes so the values should be roughly the same based on home size.
225,Wrench Aholic,"February 13, 2020",3," I would love an option to filter out auctions and foreclosures. Also would be nice if there was an option under manufacturer/trailer homes ""for sale with land"" or ""in a park with fees that go up and up""."
226,Austin Gardner,"March 3, 2020",1," I have had so many issues with this app, it doesn't show any houses in my area, itll show them 200 miles away but nowhere near me, then family with pull it up and have 6 results, 10 results. Its inconsistent and trash"
227,Bob Diaz,"March 8, 2020",4," I love how this App works on my iPad, but the cellphone version doesn't have a list view. This makes it hard to see what's new. Please add a last view!!!!!"

229,Dale Johnson,"April 12, 2020",5, Very reliable And easy to navigate keep up the great work zillow
230,Elvis Diaz,"April 4, 2020",2, Filters don't work. You still show auctions and preforeclosures even when they are not selected. I still get manufactureed homes when not selected.
231,christian ford,"March 19, 2020",5," I've been using Zillow to help me narrow down choices for my new house, apartment, neighborhood, or just browsing house and apartments in general. Things of that nature. Because of Zillow I have an apartment and am looking for another one through zillow!"
232,Bob the Builder,"March 24, 2020",5, I love looking at houses and the app makes it way easier to look at them. You just put in a few things you want and it'll pop up. The houses are amazing just like this app.
233,Jack Paris,"April 5, 2020",5, It easy to find great apartments for good prices!
234,devin turner,"April 17, 2020",5, Great but PLEASE ADD A FILTER FOR 55+ Communities as they clutter everything and genuine options get overlooked
235,Alain Charles,"February 16, 2020",3," The words ""recently sold"" in real estate should not apply to more than 6 months ago, much less 1 year+. A search that is meaningful should allow date and radius selection."
236,Janet Young,"February 14, 2020",5, I really enjoy looking at the houses listed in the app and it is very easy to use and gives me the information that is needed to decide what fits my families needs so that I can make a decision without a sales person leading me into a decision. Great job
237,Sheila Marie Grandberry Sawyer,"February 22, 2020",5," Great app! It is nice to see the ""zestimate"" that seems to fall in line with appraisals which let's the buyer know right away when the property is price correctly."

239,Black Dog,"March 27, 2020",4," Like the app and all, but could yall add an option to filter out homes with pools? Yall have the option to include home with pools in your searches, but not to keep them out. It's dissappointing when I like all the photos but then see a pool in the backyard."

246,Sharon Poley,"February 24, 2020",5, I really like the Zillow app. It gives me a chance to look at different properties out there with much needed information you need to know before buying or selling any property.
247,Karen Tremblay,"February 25, 2020",5," Easily found a lot of great houses on this app. Mostly very user friendly, took a few tries to understand how to use certain things, but it got easier quickly"
248,Lando Cal,"February 29, 2020",1," When doing a search of houses for sale, continues to show auctions even when you toggle the auctions option off, cluttering the map view with unwanted listings. Fix your app, or at least give the option to hide listings!"
249,Chris Giles,"March 23, 2020",4, Good app as far as features and usability. Just it's the same listings as most big apps. Yet I found additional listings on smaller less known apps. Won't say who so my review doesnt seem bought. Still a 4 though.
250,cleve rich,"April 20, 2020",5, I love the App! The best app for house shopping hands down!
251,you !,"April 25, 2020",5, It was good and I found my dream home and great buyers on this app!
252,Angie Lloyd,"February 11, 2020",4, The app is pretty good for browsing on my phone. One thing it's missing that is on the web version is the option to view lot lines. That comes in very handy when house hunting.
253,Rose Davis,"February 29, 2020",5, I like the map feature to locate a listed home. I'm glad you have corrected the picture clarity there was a time when the pictures were so out of focus. It was difficult to use your ap then.
254,Gary Sample,"March 2, 2020",3, Difficult to understand. You get dots for houses and sometimes you get houses with prices so you don't waste time looking at something completely out of your price range. Then the next thing you know they are all gone and you can't find them again.
255,vaX Cymaticka,"March 13, 2020",4, Great tool for real estate investors. Would like to be able to view my saved homes by tags that I've assigned to them. Seems easy to implement. Thanks!

258,Brooke Lang,"April 1, 2020",2, They are quick to post new listings but are incredibly slow at updating. They will still list a house for sale months after it is sold and no longer available.
259,Anne Mendoza,"February 22, 2020",1," When I apply filters it will give a number for the results. I click to view those results and the map is blank. Website is great, but the app has never worked for me."
260,Bryan Hubbard,"February 26, 2020",2," App notifications are annoying. Don't get me wrong, I like being notified of new listings. But I hate getting buzzed for the same house over and over again."
261,Searah Legates,"February 24, 2020",3, I keep seeing the same homes over and over. There should be an option for not interested or something. I do however love that there is an option for no hoa or a price range. That's helpful.
262,Brandon Edmisten,"March 5, 2020",4," Charging sellers, though profitable, will cause other apps to pick up cheapo sellers that don't have to pay anything on another home buying app, or just leave a sign in the yard, shrinking your selection of homes for show. Larger selection of homes is what attracts people to this app."
263,Kenneth Davis,"March 17, 2020",1, Tons of mobile homes listed as homes Tons of apartments listed as homes Tons of auction houses when you soecifically filter that out Tons of agents with incorrect lot sizes Sending in a report takes about a week to fix Ive sent in a lot of reports but im tired of doing your legwork.

265,Miss Teri,"March 6, 2020",1, DO NOT USE THIS APP! Can't start an account to login to remove Zestimate feature. My agent told them to fix YESTERDAY. Crappy app undervalued my home by 200k and apparently there's no way to fix it unless THEY feel like it.
266,Beatrice Eggers,"March 6, 2020",5," I can see most pertinent information on each home - having a dynamite Realtor gets me the rest! I also love that I get updates (often) for sales, new listings & others that I may have missed in my search."

268,Austin Holm,"March 22, 2020",4, Good when just looking at housing market. It also allows for great insight on different area. The rental tab isn't as helpful but gets you started.
269,Jimi Bellido,"April 2, 2020",1, This is the worst app. The Zestimate is pure fiction. You constantly get bombarded with notifications and there is no real actual real estate data presented other than advertising for agents etc...

275,LaTonya Jackson,"March 12, 2020",5, This app gives me lots of choices as I maneuver through house hunting. It also help me visualize how I would like my potential home could feel inviting by letting me see how I can bring my ideas into fruition.

Ask it to not show auctions, shows em. Maybe Zillow needs to throw another lavish corporate party instead of making its software work proper!"
283,Jessica Rudolph,"March 2, 2020",4, Great for the most part but it really needs to pay update its listings because almost half have been already on contract or sold but says there still available.

286,Konrad Waszczeniuk,"March 13, 2020",4, I love the app but my one gripe is the price slider. Can't get the control I'd like. Would it be possible to make it like the website where you can just type min/max in? Thanks!

1078,Katelyn Engler,"January 16, 2020",4," App is great. Runs smooth and can easily choose an area to look for a house. The only issue is Zillow doesn't have the best range of available results, but still better than most sites."

1089,Ted Durkalski,"January 23, 2020",5," Easy to work with. Very good information regarding property descriptions and monthly costs for mortgages and taxes. Photos of homes etc are extremely GOOD but nothing beats being ""Up close and Personal"" when buying a home. Was see"
1090,Samira Zamel,"January 24, 2020",1, I get alerts and constant notifications for homes not in my search criteria. It's out of control and I've changed my settings over and over. Customer support link doesn't work. It appears the only way to stop it is to delete the app
1091,Dr. Jai Langston,"April 2, 2020",5, Simple and Highly Informative
1092,Matt Irvine,"December 25, 2019",1, Broken app - doesnt show listings. Been broken for over a week. Tried uninstalling and re-installing and that didnt work. I would imagine Zillow is creating some horrible experiences and hurting sales with this glitch.
1093,M Vargas,"January 16, 2020",5, I enjoy this app because it is informative and I get to see areas that aren't close so I don't have to waste gas and money. I was even able to secure an agent. I would definitely recommend this app to family members and friends.

1101,Monica Stenmo,"November 30, 2019",4, Love everything but would be better if there was a way for me to disqualify homes. I keep on clicking on the same home that I have already disqualified because the is no way to mark that I am not interested.
1102,Da Burr,"December 1, 2019",4," Not always up to date but that could be the landlord's fault. Good and bad that search realigns itself according to view, makes it harder to organizes search Overall useful."
1103,valorie Raica,"December 17, 2019",2, Put in all kinds of filters cannot get anything. It also cannot find my home. My bank said to use this app but right now; it is not working or helping. Why cant it find my location? It is on.
1104,Carina,"January 10, 2020",3, I like the drawing feature and the ability to search by if a home has a finished basement or not. I would rate 5 stars if it had the ability to not show foreclosure/auction homes in my search.

1118,Seth Jacobovitch,"November 16, 2019",4," Easy to use, very informative, One issue with the app is that it doesn't change screen orientation on my Galaxy Tab S3 when the tablet is on its side whenever I click on a property listing."

1120,Mary L,"January 22, 2020",1," Zillow is pathetic. I don't use the app, it's awful. I go to Zillow on internet. The new platform ABSOLUTELY stinks. You ought to be able to do better than that! I used to be able to see homes in Canyon, Texas, now it always claims NO HOMES FOUND! RIDICULOUS!"

1128,ibrahim berjawi,"January 13, 2020",5," So easy to find a home to buy by choosing the way that you want, giving you the location that you exactly want and price that you need, thats for now but i wish when i decide to buy a house everything can be as easy as my first impression"
1129,E Rice,"January 14, 2020",5," Love using Zillow. It has helped me with rentals and home sales. Prices aren't always accurate, but you have to start somewhere."
1130,Ron-Jon For most of the time,"January 14, 2020",1," On my home network, download the application twice on to my cellphone, opened the application and it states ""can't load the homes because of no wireless network. Even though I just downloaded it twice."
1131,Doug Hyun,"January 19, 2020",1, Good app but the reference picture for the property is a satellite photo instead of the house. Can't tell them apart without opening each property. REALLY WASTES TIME!
1132,Sheri E.,"January 25, 2020",1, Seems the info on the listings is always outdated and the search processes are a joke. Including the draw feature. It is never working. The map is so hard to see on a phone.

1151,Lorene Hintz,"December 30, 2019",4, Ive listed our home. There are several save and lots of looks. I wish I had the ability to contact the people that saved our listing to have them make an offer. Frustrating to have many looks and saves but no contacts or offers.
1152,Darryl Wendt,"January 19, 2020",1," No matter what I do for search options, most listings are advertising for auctions or homes outside the price range I selected. I have auctions turned off. Makes finding a potential listing frustrating."
1153,Detroit Kid,"January 26, 2020",1," Unintuitive, harder to search new home than competing apps like realtor. Back button takes you completely out of app instead of one step back. Zillow may be a good service but the android app needs work."

1163,Dora Massengale,"November 24, 2019",5," I love how this site is so easy to navigate thru. It's like having your own realtor, but without the pressure and driving a lot."
1164,Jsnake 29,"December 4, 2019",5," Best app ever. You can put filters in about what home you want, but they have a single story homes only feature. I definitely recommend."
1165,Tyler Hester,"December 16, 2019",2, New update is absolutely horrible. You have to click on dots on a map instead of having the option for a list of homes. Uninstalled ... please fix
1166,Michaela Whitmore,"December 28, 2019",2," After uninstalling and reinstalling, the app won't show any info on the listing, after swiping up to open the information everything is just black, only scrolling pictures really doesn't do me any good ..."

1171,What Why,"December 17, 2019",1, Terrible search engine for available housing. Zillow doesn't invest enough time updating the current status of the properties. I will no longer use Zillow.
1172,Don Allison,"January 5, 2020",1," Can't stop the emails after you start receiving them. You click on unscribe and it takes you to a place that you can't do anything, especially subscribing! It's a cheating app!"
1173,Zhijian Luo,"January 7, 2020",5, It is really Convenient to check the listing information in my housing searching. It is fun to check the housing value when we bypass an interesting property.

1197,Alex & Jo in Canada,"January 3, 2020",2, Works only for UK ! I got this suggested and I installed for listings in Canada. None available. It's only for UK and they don't mention that in the app description.
1198,Kevin M,"December 30, 2019",1, It's ok but it is hard to quickly go through houses and it seems impossible to ignore houses you have already seen.
1199,Bruce Gotohell,"January 15, 2020",5," Works well. I like the ability to draw a ""ring"" around the area I'm interested in. Fast, smooth and stable. No issues."

1208,Jason Owen,"January 15, 2020",1, So many old and outdated listings. Rental listings are useless. Foreclosures are also useless. This website/ap have really taken a downturn in the past several years. Deleted/unsubscribed.
1209,B. Kyle Bailey,"January 17, 2020",4, I like that often it is possible to see past sale prices/years as well as tax appraisals. A bad issue is many homes listed for sale/foreclosure have already been sold weeks or even 1 year.

1237,Heycrack Head,"January 9, 2020",4, There should be a minimum requirement for information regarding the listings. HOA/tax information should be listed 1st and be mandatory. If it's not filled out then your listing doesn't get posted.
1238,Mark A,"January 14, 2020",2, Why does this app crash so much? In 4 mins it crashed 3 times and is slow as is. Better just get on a computer to look up listings.

1255,Brian Sartain,"December 7, 2019",3, Good app but the city boundary lines for my town are incorrect so my home is not showing when searched. This could be a major setback
1256,Charles Malo,"December 12, 2019",4, Great app but i wish the dark theme only applied to UI not make map blue. Also would be nice if we could toggle house prices in or off on map and filter by pet friendly
1257,Lynnette Smith,"December 13, 2019",3," Easy to use, often outdated listings....needs some way to verify listings are still active and accurate."
1258,Janis Berryman-Poon,"January 10, 2020",4," You give a very good view of house and the immediate surrounding area, is for sale. More infomation about the trailer park lease or phone number needs to be stated in ad where trailer is stationed for sale."

1292,John Arial,"January 10, 2020",2," Im so tired of Zillow not updating thier listings, putting houses that dont have correct addresses, ita quite fustrating when your truly vested in buying a home. In this day and age, it could be a lot better of an app and site."

Then the Zillow guy will connect you to a different realtors if you've asked questions about different houses on the app. Expect tons of calls/texts."
1310,David K,"January 27, 2020",1," App is pretty good but NEVER NEVER contact a broker through the app, neither email or phone. These people are leeches and won't stop trying to contact & bother you. If you find a place in the app find the real broker outside of Zillow, and contact them directly."

My questions definitely were never addressed and when I continued to request the information through the texts they have been persistent about, they ingored the request."

I know someone has to make the listing and then match it here on Zillow, but this was a deal breaker for me. The app doesn't have many bugs and is a great idea, more accurate listings would be great."

Saved a few dozen houses that we were interested in and made contact with a few realtors. After our walkthroughs we decided they weren't for us and came back to the app to check out more only to find that no matter what selections we made to search for, our results came back as 0. I tried several times throughout the past few days to try and find anything in any of the states and the only time something comes up is when it's for a mansion, which needless to say isn't what we are looking for or there wouldn't be a problem. I tried uninstalling the app a couple of times only to run in to the same problem. I know it's not a user error because just about a week ago I was getting hundreds of hits in my searches with the same criteria, and I know it's not my phone because the other apps that I've recently been using in place of Zillow have worked perfectly fine. This is quite clearly a conspiracy."

The only downside which I didn't feel deserved to be knocked down on ratings is that sometimes houses are listed for sale and they're not really for sale so that can be disappointing but otherwise we found our home.

This app ends the need to utilize multiple MLS sites or resources to find properties that are not only in your target area, but throughout the entire country! This is a one-stop-shop for sure! NO COMPLAINTS! I have been using Zillow for YEARS. Starting off as a Licensed Real Estate Agent, transitioning to Contractor/Investor/REO & distressed property ""flipper"" & eventually landing into the world of interior design, historical restoration and renovation, custom painting and property customization, I cannot say enough good things about this app! The property value and CMA information is reliable and accurate. It's an absolute go-to when it comes to keeping my clients budgets in check and their personal final financial investments below their area and their homes individual market value. This allows me to confidently educate & ensure my clients that after all renovations & customizations are final, they will still have equity in their home. This allows us all to stay within the lines of what areas allow what type of extras, and the best part is if we decide as a client business team they're wants exceed the value of their neighborhood, Zillow allows us to list their home as a FSBO, and find a Target area where their taste and there wants and preferences allow for the value of their homes individual Market :-) 2 thumbs up and five stars! Zillow is a real estate lovers Bible!

It's super frustrating that you cannot quickly swipe through photos for a place on the map without ""entering"" the listing page, which of course unless you have super fast LTE everywhere, is super slow. Again, Redfin does this. Will be uninstalling shortly and just doing everything in Redfin. As a tech company, when your only capital cost is investing in developers to make your app best-in-class,  and you fail at that--what's left?"

A Zillow 'VA specialist' took all of my information over the phone, found my VA Certificate, ran my credit, and said I had one small item on my report that needs to be resolved... but everything else looked good, so he said there would be no problem getting my pre-approval. He also said the VA would take care of resolving the credit issue free of charge, so they would be calling me soon. He said they would leave a message, but to get it taken care of ASAP. Then, he told me we would hold off on the pre-approval until that was done because resolving it would be fast, and it would help me qualify for more. Well, this morning I woke up to an email from the VA denying my loan! Unbelievable! The man did 'nothing' he said he would do, and he never gave me a chance to do what I needed to do!

It's crazy how a search using the exact same parameters on Realtor may turn up 100 listings - while on here you might get 5. The information provided about homes on this site is minimal - whereas others give you every detail about the property (heating, cooling, roof type, flooring, foundation). I know all these real estate sites pull their info from the same MLS but it's how much information they provide from the MLS that is the big difference & as far as I can tell, Zillow provides the least of all. Using this site would be like reading the newspaper but only getting the first 10 words of an article. You are better off using a site that spends more time & effort on it's function than on advertising. Uninstalling because frankly when one of the dozens of ""notifications"" I get from Zillow tells me an address to check out - I go to Realtor or Truvia to look at it because there will be more detailed information."

2595,Aaron Martinez,"September 20, 2018",4," This app is very helpful so far.

What a pain in the a$$. You drive around looking for properties and just try to navigate with a zero street address. Forget it you cant navigate to it with google maps through the app Listen Zillow.....put the coordinates in for the address please instead of a bogus zero. Totally worthless app when you are driving around for property. I've wasted so much time. Great for every thing else just forget the properties with a zero instead of an actual number.

Once the premiere app for locating and sorting real estate for buyers and a showcase that was easy for buyers to see your property for sellers. The changes made have been distructive and has made the app practically useless. Developers of this ap have removed features that made this app important. I am forced to look elsewhere.
2718,Yea No,"December 5, 2018",5," It's such a beautiful app, much better than browsing the web on several different sites trying to find the best listings. They're all here. Easy to save the ones you love and keep tabs. Perfect app, can't wait to do more searching, prayers for finding a great deal."
2719,Jane Norberg,"February 24, 2019",1," Not user friendly. If you try to 'view homes' or 'show all' you selected, it just shows a map with dots. I'm sure after 20 minutes of our family looking for a way to actually view homes there must be a way, but it shouldn't be that hard to search."

2745,Lisa Rababy,"January 3, 2019",5, Great app. Makes it easy to get a feel for the homes and the areas they are placed. I have used this app as a seller and a buyer. Nice tool to help find the current values of homes and for watching the market. Easy to navigate as well.
2746,Tasha. annd,"May 9, 2019",3," love the app, i just wish there was two features added to it. 1) the ability to input a list of cities rather than circling an area that has cities you're not interested in. 2) the ability to ""not like"" houses so they dont continue to pop up when you search"
2747,Tatum Feland,"March 17, 2019",1," It used to be really good; however, my results are very limited even if I have less filters chosen.

2751,RobinMoon1515,"December 22, 2018",1," Well I've heard good things and Zillow is obviously popular, but I knew more than the app did about availability.

2752,Christine Bower,"December 18, 2018",5, Great app if you're looking for homes. For me I'm looking in different areas to check where I can get the best house for our money.

2753,A Google user,"March 22, 2019",4, generally super helpful for searching properties before you actually go see them. the only downside is sometimes zillow doesn't consider unique characteristics in the valuation. for example: a waterfront property is compared with all properties but the valuation doesn't show the difference..
2754,Suzan Ireland,"January 4, 2019",5," It's so convenient to see location, exterior, interior, amenities, schools, contact info, tax info, price, and how long the property has been on the market and if it is even on the market. All this and I haven't left my home or even had to speak to a human being yet. i highly recommend."
2755,Elyse Anderson,"April 13, 2019",2," I really liked the app when I first downloaded it. Now with this recent update it's so slow I cant even handle it. Also, the lot size should be posted on the initial info next to square footage, would save a lot of time."
2756,Conchetta Brewer,"May 15, 2019",4, I love the zillow app because it shows the street view and the photos of all properties. Although sometimes you have to figure out how to see the photos. It also allows the in rentor to give a full description of the property in writing.
2757,Camille,"June 4, 2019",3," It's ok so far, but it needs to have some more filters for rented properties, such as pets allowed/pet rent. It would also be nice to know of available street parking, un/furnished, and whether a property is in a trailer park."

2771,Colleen Rice,"January 10, 2019",3," I like Zillow but can't sort homes by whether or not they allow pets. It's one of the most important factors in whether or not my partner and I can even view a place, so I don't understand why they have it as an option, but not one you can filter through."
2772,Jenn,"March 17, 2019",3," This app is good but not great. You really need a way to filter out the 55+ communities. As a 30-year-old looking for a home on a budget, the only recommendations I ever get are communities I can't live in. Fix this please--it can't be that hard."
2773,Gabrielle Taylor,"December 31, 2018",5," I enjoy getting real time updates on searches I have setup. Some of the searches aren't perfect results but I can at least get an honest idea of what is available on the market, what what to expect in what side of town."

2780,Andrea Bell,"January 12, 2019",4, Overall a solid and useful app. Would be a definite 5 if not for the time wasted on previously rejected properties.

2784,Karrie Licatesi,"January 17, 2019",3," This app is awesome aside from one REALLY annoying part. Surely it is simple enough to add an ""are you sure?"" question for realtors entering in the acreage. They need to be forced to double check their decimal point placement. It's kind of a big deal!!"
2785,Tammie Mitchell,"November 28, 2018",5, I enjoy this app! I am able to search and compare housing prices around the US. I like the fact that you are able to save your favorite homes and Can refer back to them later. You can also get alerts when homes in certain areas list. Great app!
2786,Nizar Dassouki,"January 15, 2019",4, great application for finding available homes for sale. When looking at a property i like to see the orientation of the house highlighted. Many of the foreclosed home does not have accurate contact information or up to date.
2787,A Google user,"January 22, 2019",2, Not good for apartments. Couldn't filter for one of my top priorities: on site parking. Keyword search did not reliably return apartments with parking. Not useful. Okay for houses but you cannot turn off the email and mobile notifications. Any new activity on the app turns them back on.
2788,C C,"October 6, 2018",1," When shopping for a house I do not appreciate my results inundated with mobile homes that are misleadingly labeled ""new construction"". This should not be allowed. They should be labeled as MANUFACTURED. Until that is changed it will continue to be a one star app for me."
2789,A Google user,"January 9, 2019",5, This a good app for relocating to another area or for first time buyers or renters. Being able to draw on the map possible areas you are looking for is extremely easy and helpful. Thank you for this user-friendly app.

2795,blue eyed redhead,"August 21, 2019",4," I love this app! It's really useful and it's so much easier then going online and searching from there, but the one thing that is a little disappointing is that not all of the available houses show up when I search my zip code or city. When I go to the website it shows WAY more options then the app."

2878,Jenn Smith,"February 23, 2019",5," As far as viewing and looking at places to rent, as my situation is as now, this is an amazing app that allows me to literally view all kind of prices of various locations nationally, and I am starting to realize how many options I have when willing to travel."

2881,A Google user,"November 28, 2018",1," This sucks! I'm a landlord and trying to post apartment listings. The app keeps forgetting my password, won't let me log in, etc. It's also REALLY not set up for landlords. It's easy to find listings as a tenant, but that's it."
2882,Ta Mc,"April 1, 2019",2," I used to really like this app, but with last update it not very user friendly. All info crammed into a small icon, listings no longer include link to map and it is harder to see/find expired listings saved to your favorites. Wake me up when you fix it!"
2883,Audrey Vanderlinde,"September 25, 2018",5, I love watching the different homes available. I get notifications for areas I'm interested in.

2884,A Google user,"November 23, 2018",2, I didn't like that format of the app. Sometimes it felt hard to search through all the information. I would put in my preferences and itd default back to before I set preferences. Was underwhelmed by this app. I prefer the online site much better.

At this point, I currently have to be out of my home before the end of the month. Zillow is helping to ease the tension slightly by providing me with the tools necessary to easily calculate the amount of money I need for rent, and a much more expedient manner of applying towards these places for a rental property of my own. Thank you for all your help Zillow, thank you for the help with this application."

2967,Melanie Peterson,"September 1, 2019",3, Great app but NEEDS a few feature changes: being able to hide houses you've seen and aren't interested in; hide auction/foreclosures; a better system to sort out twin homes and townhomes when you search for single family homes; more features to filter by like garage spaces and fenced backyard
2968,Larina Hollins,"September 5, 2019",4," A bit difficult to decipher between the regular site and rental app. I logged into one and it kept giving me a problem with logging in. Once in I will admit much more simple and easy to navigate, as well as great customer response for questions."
2969,Mark Spriggel,"September 17, 2019",1," Need to be able to mark properties you don't want to see again. If I've ruled a property out, why would I want to have it showing up on a search? Very annoying. You have a heart for properties you like, you need a 🛑 for properties you want to stop seeing."
2970,Sarah,"September 18, 2019",1," Please make the new dark/night mode optional. It makes the map very hard to look at due to more contrast. Also, it would be a great improvement to be able to save the customization of home type. It is frustrating to have to deselect certain types each time the app is opened."

2980,Stephan Halasz,"March 2, 2019",4," pretty good, however it should stop recommending homes on less than an acre, when my criteria is clearly 10+ the app filter works fine, just apply it to the emails as well. I'm sure it's for advertising kickbacks from preferred listers, but why waste people's time. it's worth money to us ya know?"
2981,Dave Sheranko,"January 4, 2019",4," Arguably the best real estate app out there with the exception of fake listings. Lots of listings include fake prices and say something like ""the listed price is a hypothetical price for similar properties"". If Zillow did a better job at moderating their listings, I'd up my review to 5 stars."
2982,Nancy Shishilla,"January 2, 2019",4," new to using app,however I'm finding it difficult to go from one house to another while trying to scroll through. I do enjoy your Zillow app.,I find it quite interesting and enjoyable."
2983,Mr G,"February 14, 2019",5," I use this to find investment properties and to advertise houses for rent. I only wish it had more capability to search and filter by more data points (ie rank by price per sqft, ratio of rent estimate to price, etc)."
2984,Jane Watts,"March 3, 2019",5," When I see a house for sale, I can almost always find it on Zillow. Gone are the days of waiting for an open house before I could look at a house. Zillow has made it super convenient to tour homes not only in my area, but all across the country!"

2986,Megan Drake,"April 28, 2019",1, couldn't get back to the app after sharing a link to houses i wanted to show someone. the app could also use a bit more hand holding as i couldn't figure out how to see listings after putting in search parameters. just going to use the online site.
2987,matthew walker,"May 10, 2019",1, App used to work but now doesn't show any results in an area where the website does. All my software is up to date. i have uninstalled twice and reinstalled with no help. I guess this app has become useless now.

2989,Maggie Furcsik,"November 27, 2018",5," Good app. But not a wide range of rental home and sometimes not very accurate when you try looking for homes in your location. It misses quite a few houses for sale, rent, foreclosure e.c.t. Other than that it's a pretty good app"
2990,Mz Kim,"March 1, 2019",3," like the app a lot have used it for years, and although it's probably not zillow's complete responsibility but Agents should be required to post clear pics of entryway, all rooms, bathroom(s) garage if applicable, & bkyard. A pic of the kitchen/dinning area of a 3-4 bdrm is not sufficient."
2991,Sarah Thompson,"March 23, 2019",1," I used to love this app but recent updates have made it no longer functional. Now, when I open the app, it looks like there are only about 7 homes for sale. All of my filters are turned off and I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling."
2992,Heidi Shoemake,"March 9, 2019",3," Good, but could be better. Why can't you hide houses you have already viewed? I see the same houses over and over and I can't get them out of my results. I swear an older version had that feature. Please bring it so I can stop wasting my time!"
2993,Jackie Jack,"March 27, 2019",5," Zillow is an easy to use convenient app. They provide all the pertinent information and photos, both street level and aerial. I know what to expect prior to going to look. All the facts and figures are laid out. Plus, schools and community information which play a role in my decision making process."
2994,Mackenzie Roach,"March 21, 2019",2," Used to love this app. Recent baffling UI changes give you less info at a glance and make you scroll through everything to find what you want (it used to be collapsed and you just expanded what you wanted to see). You had a great thing guys, change it back."
2995,A Google user,"May 14, 2019",2," not updated often, homes are sold and not even marked as pending on Zillow. Also homes are on the market for days, already listed on other real estate apps but not on zillow. if you're looking in a hot market you have no chance of getting to a property first."
2996,Mikey James,"May 21, 2019",1," in the middle of browsing a glitch occurred which caused the majority of the search results to disappear, even after removing all filters. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and no change. Customer support button is unresponsive."
2997,Sean Covely,"November 29, 2018",3," The app and navigation itself is user friendly, however many homes visible on the main website and emailed to you aren't visible in the app. The app is good for people passively browsing, but any remotely serious home search should be done elsewhere or online."
2998,Deanna Johnson,"December 5, 2018",1," Couldn't get the app to display the same listings as the website, same search filters. Website said 4 pgs, the app said No listings.

2999,Hannah Glass,"April 13, 2019",1, they revamped everything and took a great website and a great app and made it unusable. half the houses I looked at were the right address wrong house picture and you can now no longer see the pictures of the inside of the house. What's the point then? I can drive around town and do that....
3000,Kellie Schmidt,"April 30, 2019",4, Use this app frequently and it works very well. The only thing that kept me from giving five stars is they took away the ability to hide a property you have viewed if you no longer want it to show in your results. That was a great feature for frequent users.

3002,Steve Bruening,"June 7, 2019",4," Great app. Would be nice to be able to turn satellite imagery on and have it stay on unless i turn it back off. Kind of annoying to have to turn it on, and you seem to like to keep moving where the setting is."
3003,Elias Trejo,"June 6, 2019",4," I liked everything about it, however it would be 5 Stars if only they hadn't take the Distance feature off, I like to set my search by mile radius to find an appropriate commute, Now that feature is gone, PLEASE BRING IT BACK !"
3004,Monica P,"June 2, 2019",4, i really like this app. it always shows & describe info about the homes for sale with the price & insurance & taxes & most of all the morgage payment just so helpful. keeps on whats new on the market & other updates & very helpful thanks all of ppl. that makes this app what it is .

3009,Kevin Stuart,"September 14, 2019",2, You can't edit your renter profile easily. Also there's quite a few format issues with the Apps graphics and text overlapping themselves. To me it feels like the interface is not a completed part of the app. As if they stopped updating or improving it. I'll stick to Trulia until they improve this.
3010,Alexis Steele,"September 25, 2019",1," Kept crashing my phone itself. Anytime I got a notification of a new house near me, I clicked into the app and ""updates"" section. Second I click it my phone restarts completely. The app literally crashes my phone and I have a new phone. (Galaxy S10 E)"
3011,Dena Bowden,"November 25, 2019",3," Sometimes I look for days and hours on end, then I finally find the perfect house, and when I go to look at it somebody already lives there. I wish Zillow would take the houses off of their site once they're sold."

3019,Oscar Taylor,"April 13, 2019",2, This app is clunky and slow. It really shows that your IT department is lost. where is the part that allows you to search for office spaces. where are the commercial options? simply lost.
3020,Lynn Sterud,"April 27, 2019",4, I like most of the app features. I wish there was a check box for single story. I also wish i knew how to look for master bedroom on the main level without scrolling through lots of other information.
3021,Arielle C,"November 27, 2018",4," It's amazing for finding houses, but the tools using to narrow your search will sometimes not work, especially the tool allowing you to choose what type of home(condo, house, etc) you're looking for."
3022,Kevin DeBenedittis,"October 20, 2018",4," Even though the information on my own home isn't correct at all (it's not even my house. It's a house down the street) I still like this app. It's fun to be able to go see what a house for sale, that you've driven by, is all about."
3023,A Google user,"September 28, 2018",5," I wish more homes were included on the site. Remax, and other apps are harder to navigate. Remember when you could pick up a home buyer brooklet with all the homes listed, no matter who had them listed? Something like that."

3026,Carol Mulvin,"October 30, 2018",5, I love this app. Zillow itself has issues and it freezes up on my computer. The app doesn't give you any trouble. Everything you need is right at your fingertips. Now if only realtors would call me back ;)
3027,Sharell Davis,"April 10, 2019",1, this app is horrible. it gives you listings that fit your criteria but they're just dots on a map. you get details when you click one but it may not be what you want and the dots are clustered together so you end up clicking the same one. no way to just view a list like the website. so frustrating.
3028,Mary Jo Snow,"January 21, 2019",5," Seems very easyto complete the profile. Need to move in the next month. does the app make me happy, Yes Is the content of the app in English, Yes it is. Does the app description match the app experience. Yes it does thus far."
3029,Elizabeth Bowman,"April 9, 2019",5," The features of this app are easy to understand and use. I love being able to save homes that I like to check out again later. i wish there was a way to do side by side comparisons though. Overall, I love this app."
3030,Jo Curtis,"April 6, 2019",4," great way to search for all available homes - both those listed by a professional realtor and those by owner. Easy to scan many homes, gleaning those that might fit. I wish there were a way to exclude a home in which I have no interest even tho it fits my search criteria."
3031,Paul Diemer,"December 18, 2018",3," used to be really great to use, but the recent update makes it much less use friendly. the map is harder to get to and use, which was one of it's best features before. too bad, i may have to switch to the other app now."
3032,Zbytovsky Customs,"May 12, 2019",1," hate this app it half the time it doesnt remove or show houses that are actually pended, which other apps are actually showing pended so it's not like they don't have the ability, the search sucks and I'm tired of this app. I will no longer be using and use other services instead."
3033,A Google user,"October 25, 2018",3," I had written a bad review and am changing it. Zillow is now sending me properties to look at within my parameters. I appreciate the information. I don't know what went wrong the first day, but it's working as I thought it should now! Thank you much, much better!!"
3034,Thunder Lizard,"March 21, 2019",4," It works wonderfully for what it is, there is one bug I've noticed however. When you go to a house and the go back to the map you cant swipe back to the house you were viewing."
3035,Sarah P,"February 11, 2019",4, Sometimes the app doesn't show the full set of listings that I see when switching to the browser-hosted site. That has definitely happened a few times now but the ease of using the app itself is otherwise fantastic.
3036,Liliana Uribe-Navarro,"May 28, 2019",5," this is one of the best search app out there when looking for a home, or apartment. I enjoying this app it's simple and easy to use. it gives you the homes in the area you are looking for and competitive pricing as well."
3037,Lani Y,"May 27, 2019",1, I had to uninstall the app again. it keeps crashing and freezing my phone. Not to mention I'm unable to search in another state without the app crashing. the app doesn't update at times. I'm over using Zillow. not worth the burden.
3038,Audrea Mann,"June 11, 2019",1," Don't get me wrong I like this app. But now I can't even see the updates of new homes. I just get kicked off to where then it says the app unexpectedly stopped, then open app again and/or report problem and so I do both and nope nothing, it still keeps happening."
3039,Rick Glanton Sr.,"July 2, 2019",5," whenever I use Zillow I don't have to worry about signing in and communicating with an agent before I've had a chance to review some homes. I'm always welcome to view homes and then make a rational decision from there. Zillow helps me to do that, very pleased!"
3040,Ariana Grande lover,"July 7, 2019",5," Great app tells u where houses are that u might like from previous searches and, it has a filter so u can customize ur search as well. It is also used by realators so if something is sold zillow would be the first to know. Being that I have a realator friend this is correct."

3050,laura roe,"January 1, 2020",5, Best real estate app out there!
3051,Joe Roberts,"February 17, 2020",4, Good experience and you find great prospects in your price range.
3052,Mohammad Rizvi,"October 22, 2018",2," I loved this app, until they got rid of the hide listing feature. Then it just got too cluttered and annoying. I tried another competitor app and it was loads better. I'm disappointed and won't redownload unless they bring back the hide feature."
3053,Adam Pedersen,"May 15, 2019",2," Some proprties are shown as off the market (grey) when browsing that are actually for sale and change status after you select them (zoomed in). the properties show correctly on desktop, which makes this app too broken and unreliable to use."
3054,Jonathan Herdina,"November 17, 2018",4, I like the app a lot. One thing I would like to see added is the ability to x out or not see results from the saved searches. I don't want to have to scroll through 6 of the same results that I have no interest in.
3055,Morgan Stone,"April 25, 2019",4, i LOVE this App! Sometimes it doesn't show houses in a requested area. Then I'll try a 2nd or 3rd time without changing anything but later on it will load homes for sale. It's a fun APP and it entertains me for hours
3056,shannon williams,"November 11, 2018",5," I love the variety this app provides . I would even call this motivational as well as inspirational . To the creators and managers, I wish that you guys would only show homes with more details and pictures of listings . Thank you ."
3057,Ian Lovely,"December 15, 2018",5," App is good, I definitely think Zillow does some home cooking, some houses for sale are hard to find or don't show up on the map at all for sale unless you click on them, and other properties show up constantly."
3058,Aerin Bland,"September 22, 2018",5, Easy to use! Zillow is my first choice when looking at properties for sale. The pictures make it easy to scroll through a property of interest. I like that it takes your interests and makes recommendations for you.
3059,A Google user,"December 2, 2018",4," App for Android. Crashes often on my Galaxy3. The same app for Apple has street names displayed when in map/satellite view. Perhaps it is a setting I have neglected. Overall ok app. Besides, most other RE apps are even worse, so Zillow stands out."
3060,Shona Shona,"September 28, 2019",1," I'm frustrated and have to give 1 star now.

I've been in touch with Zillow a few times asking for help to fix the problem I'm having with the app. They've always been friendly and TRIED to help, but we've gotten nowhere. I have wanted to receive ONLY listings for a particular town, but the app sends me listings for a town that is nearby instead. A town I HATE may I add. So the notification emails I receive of listings is COMPLETELY useless to me. Otherwise nice app."
3061,Jo Anna,"May 10, 2019",1, Why is the app limiting me from searching houses? Feels like I got blacklisted (I backed out of a house that had immense hidden structural damage) and only one house shows up in my search in each town I search. It's impossible that 50+ houses got sold in each town overnight. What is going on!?
3062,Hil Pastorius,"May 6, 2019",2," it used to say if a house was pending sale or contingent, now it just says that all houses are for sale, when I ask my realtor now, it seems like half the houses they have listed for sale are already pending sale or contingent. it used to say this, now it does not"
3063,Annette Ussery,"April 27, 2019",1," this app is stuck.. trying to open listings in updated listing in Bricktown, Nj, it shows 38 but only Shows 1.. overall the app. is good except its frozen on 1 listing when it posts 38, it would be nice to see all in my desired price range for my next purchase moving forward."
3064,Sarah Donofrio,"December 14, 2018",4, Overall love it. Sometimes theres some wonkiness in what I expect to happen (e.g. I click on a house and swipe and it swipes more houses in the area not the house I clicked) and some upgrading that could happen in the overall swiping to look around experience but well done app

Your app and email integration is trash."
3066,Merna Kerss,"October 20, 2018",4," It's useful, not sure how current the listings are but it gives you a good idea of the neighborhoods and really like the satellite feature and the ability to zoom in and zoom out, also great Street view."
3067,C Thornton,"March 30, 2019",1," I like Zillow, but this app was hard to use. For some reason, it kept sent me notices about new house around the country, instead of the city I was interested in. I also could not find how to edit my preferences and saved searches."
3068,LaVar Johnson,"October 8, 2018",1, None of the peoperty we looked at on this app was available when it said it was. Availability dates were way off. Drove from realtor to realtor to be told the same thing. Zillow only updates once per month if that. The houses we looked at still had people living in them!
3069,alysia wilson,"February 26, 2019",3," please add a button to rule out houses that are not something the user will want. The app needs a dislike button. i end up looking at the same house and going oh wait no, this place is NOT for me, but there is no way to filter it out... give us a swipe left option!"
3070,A Google user,"December 15, 2018",5," I love this finder app above all others because it is up to date a and has a wide variety of pictures of the apartment, house, condo, that I am trying to view. This helps me make my decision a lot easier."

When I tried to contact the agent for information about a house they start calling a crazy amount of agents.

I'm not moving anywhere anytime soon (obviously) but, I love to look on this apl for differe t housing in different states. I actually plan on moving to Virginia or Arizona and....This app helps a lot. I love it...thank you."
3073,Alexis Jackson-Walker,"May 30, 2019",2, I love the app. But I dislike that when I go to view the homes I discover that homes were sold months ago. Or the prices you list for some of these homes are almost 20k - 50k more when I get to the home site. Zillow please try and update your information more regularly.
3074,Karol Stewart,"June 16, 2019",3, for the most part pretty good. Don't the map isn't The the top any more have to scroll to far to get to it. &when you use updates you have to scroll to find updates as they use to be at the top. not impressed with the current upgrades!
3075,Emily Israel,"June 25, 2019",4," This is a great app for getting an idea of what is on the market, thank you. One recommendation is for there to be an option to filter out places with a pool. Sure, most people want pools in a SFR. I am in the minority of who do not want pool responsibilities."
3076,Amanda Sampson,"June 30, 2019",5," Useful app for looking for homes for sale . Sometimes is finicky when hovering over a place and i have to zoom in to see more homes actually in that area that don't show up when zoomed out. Otherwise, it's perfect. My go to resource for browsing homes."

Im not the type to review apps but this bug definitely needs fixed."
3078,Morgan Graham,"August 7, 2019",1," I dont understand why there's a way to check off the type of property you're looking for when so many are misclassified. I have to scroll through so many ""open land"" postings when I'm trying to look for houses that are already built! this is annoying and really unnecessary."
3079,Dan Martin,"October 2, 2019",1," This app is infuriating. Every time I open it I have to reset all my preferences. Here's a hint for the developer... If I don't want an apartment now, odds are I won't want one in 10 minutes either. Saved searches do nothing."

They're are not my photographs and they look like a bunch of junk all piled onto shelves saying that it's a pic my listing. Either remove the photographs [which I cannot do]or I will remove my listing and post negative comments on Zillow for the rest of the time I have a telephone or computer to do so.
3081,Shayla Wallace,"October 27, 2019",3," It was fine until I tried to filter for ""for rent"" properties only and all it keeps showing me is ""for sale"" properties. Its frustrating. Im trying to move and I can't use this app to assist and help make this an easy transition find."
3082,Holly M.,"October 29, 2019",2, App Sucks... I had better luck just going to the site online.

3083,Marie Hicks,"December 25, 2019",4, Most times easy to use
3084,Lindsey Baker,"January 15, 2020",1," Never loads, I've deleted it and downloaded it over and over but it always says there's nothing in any area that I'm looking in. But every other app works great"
3085,Sameh Bekhet,"March 2, 2020",5, very good for the family looking for Home
3086,Amanda L,"April 7, 2019",2," Extremely glitchy. I have to close it and start over all the time. Some listings will be missing, photos take forever to load, filters don't always work properly. Not a great app."
3087,Zakia Bilkis,"November 23, 2018",4, It is good but it gives me results for surrounding areas even if I put the city name. No way to change that. Also recent update removed the ability to hide the ones I don't want to see. That's very inconvenient.
3088,Patrick Bunch,"December 13, 2018",5," So far so good. Wish it had a spot to tell landlords about having a Service/Therapy/Companion animal and the type and size? Most places would need to be ""pet friendly"" to offer a place for them to be outside and do their waste thing!!"
3089,A Google user,"February 3, 2019",2," There's key things this app doesnt tgat hinder its use. For starters the sliding price scale should be the # and ""lower"", not ""higher"". Renters would appreciate notifications to include dog or cat acceptance. Wasted time looking could be avoided."
3090,A Google user,"March 14, 2019",4," filled out everything and Zillow app deleted the ""X""in final check box - did not get the property. Recommend using a laptop or tablet. Zillows response was i needed to verify? i did - they charged my credit card- if i failed to check all box and complete forms why did they charge my credit card?"
3091,Laura Owens,"October 30, 2018",5, What a convenient way to experience an initial look at potential residences. The photos are clear and the data is generally quite inclusive. Open houses pop up on this site. Zillow is THE homebuyer's tool. A great resource.Thanks.
3092,Kelsey Spencer,"April 27, 2019",1, We updated our house description on the official MLS website that Zillow pulls information from but Zillow hasn't updated and it's been about a week. It only updated the photos. My husband emailed them but we got no response and no resolution.
3093,A Google user,"October 16, 2018",5," All of the homes/property I've seen on Zillow are beautiful. I'm never disappointed. I love that I can use filters, and they notify me with any updated information, new listings on my saved searches, and many more convenient features."
3094,Kaitlin Costa,"May 8, 2019",1," Since the newest update, there are no homes when I search. I have never had this issue before. regardless of how I update my search, there are no homes listed. I will increase my rating when this issue is solved."
3095,Kim Cartwright,"October 23, 2018",3," Want to love it, but freezes up so often it's ridiculous. Also, want to be able to search for custom number acres like in the website. Wish every property listed water source, septic system, elec system, hoa and specific CCRs when lots have them."
3096,A Google user,"October 14, 2018",2," Removed the ability to ""hide"" the homes you aren't interested in. My list is so overpopulated with homes I've already looked at and ruled out! Sorry Zillow. I used your app for years but I can't sort through these same 50 houses anymore. Fix it please!"
3097,Tina O'Donnell,"January 25, 2019",4," Very helpful app. it would be nice if they added a ""don't see again"" type of feature. when the same houses that you have no interest in keep popping up... that can be annoying after awhile."
3098,miles kimmins,"May 11, 2019",2, Not good for renters. The application fee zillow charges you isnt worth paying because all listed apartments are provided through a third party. Meaning you have to got to their site to apply and put in your info again as well as pay their fee as well. Just stick to craigslist.
3099,Jace R,"May 11, 2019",1," Not worth your time, folks. Two reasons for my 1-star. 1) The app updated into a buggy version that doesn't show 95% of active listings. 2) I previously left a review saying as much, and it got deleted. I'll be uninstalling now."
3100,Christine Black,"March 26, 2019",5, This app makes it easier for first time home buyers to not feel pressured. I don't know exactly what I'm looking for bit with this app I can look through and take my time figuring it out. Home buying is a huge commitment. The less pressure the better.
3101,Stacy Thomas,"March 23, 2019",5," Awesome app. works perfectly. never bugs. free. no ads. no adds. lots of features. I moved into a great, cheap, roomy, clean place right where I needed it."
3102,Jacqui Geissler,"June 9, 2019",1, The listings aren't accurate and you get two completely different prices for rent. like a place will be listed at $850 and then once you click on it Zillow gives you what the actual rent will be like $1300. This happened two years in a row now. Thank you for the exact opposite of help.
3103,Mary J Moten,"June 10, 2019",5," So far, Zillow has been a great app! It makes house/home shopping so much easier for the renter/buyer! I highly recommend Zillow to everyone looking for a great house hunting experience!!! You will find what you need here!"

3105,Dave Gerton,"July 12, 2019",2," Not even sure why this is a thing. If you have a web browser, and you do, you'll get more out of that than this app. It has less filtering capabilities than the web app. For instance, got a pet? Then this app is a waste if time, because you can't filter out the properties that prohibit pets."
3106,Keera Alston,"August 9, 2019",1, commute time!!!!! i especially liked this feature. since not only does it keep me within the app instead of toggling between it and Google maps. it also prevents me from seeing houses I'll fall in love with that way to far is a commute. please bring back!!!!
3107,Emir Batista,"August 27, 2019",5," The houses options are amazing, plenty to choose from. Its very user friendly and displays almost every need that you look to buy a new home. I am definitely more than satisfied with this app."
3108,Defendar,"September 27, 2019",4, Easy to navigate and very detailed for the most part. However needs better details on bathrooms and garages. Like soaker tub or not? Garage ceiling height to determine car lift possibility. All things the agent can tell you but it would be better if it can be sorted by those things before hand.
3109,Shiny Mew,"November 12, 2019",4, I love the app because it helped us find a new home and has many filters for homes

3113,Blank Stare,"January 11, 2019",2," You can set multiple options to filter property but it always just shows empty land. Furthermore, zillow will then email you 3 times a day with recommended homes, but they are all empty land as well. Looking for a 3 bed/2 bath, well forget that here are 100 1/10th acre lots for $300,000."
3114,Ashley Houston,"March 2, 2019",5, I love how you are pracrically in the house! I can dream of the exact style I want and find it in my city. I also like the fact that Zillow lists the schools near the houses. Great for research purposes and overall satisfaction!
3115,Michael Smith,"January 29, 2019",1, why would you take away the hide feature? it allows you to tailor your search for what you want and get rid of the houses you've already looked at instead of clicking over and over again highly frustrating.
3116,Salim Zubair,"April 19, 2019",3," i like the app and it is intuitive but i hate the notification it send every minute. My phone will be constantly buzzing all day long, also draining my battery. Fix the notification system to be less annoying!"
3117,Asia Hopkins,"May 17, 2019",4," This site always lets me know when there are price reductions on my favorite homes. The reason I didn't give a five star is because the area I desire, zillow doesn't list alot of home with my specifications like other sites. Overall, Zillow is a great site to find your next home."
3118,G Kluk,"April 13, 2019",1," wish i never updated from old app. This is clunky, and no longer displays lot lines or street view. Seems they dont want us to have this information as a way to get us to contact a realtor. Im dumping this and finding another way to look for my next home."
3119,Elaine Botsford,"May 20, 2019",4, there must have been a recent update because i use to be able to know what was new and what has been recently changed right away without scrolling thru alot of properties looking for an orange label. i reset to new and they are not new! go back to the way it was please
3120,Tonya Moore,"December 28, 2018",5, A very helpful. Zillow does all the work. I like that they are not intrusive like other home finding apps. It shows you the property and you decide if you want to contact the realtor or not.
3121,Ashlee Kenny,"May 12, 2019",4, app was working great until a recent update happened and now the homes flr sale in my area never update. all my content i see is from last week with no change. i went from seeing hundreds of homes for sale vs 4 now within the same price range.

3127,Melissa Corbin,"January 17, 2019",5," Awesome customer support for the app. I thought you couldn't filter for pets allowed, and sent a request to customer support as a suggestion. They responded in minutes on how to do so. Anyways, very pleased with the app and support."

3137,Adam Reznik,"July 18, 2019",1," The previous version had a better GUI for viewing the map, lot line, and satellite views, as well as viewing photos. New version mashes all those together. Not user friendly. Also, Android app cannot upload home photos? Only on desktop? In 2019?"
3138,Chris Murone,"September 19, 2019",1, Latest update forces dark theme if your phone is in dark mode. The colors are awful and it makes it impossible to use the map to find houses. This feature doesn't need to exist at all but at least allow the user to toggle it off and fix the color scheme to be usable.
3139,Megan Roberts,"October 10, 2019",2," I LOVED this app until recently. Now, everytime it opens, the app freezes. It is the only app on my phone doing it, so I know it is Zillow. Which sucks, because this was my favorite app to search on."

3149,Franke Sauer,"January 22, 2019",4," overall a really good experience. my go to site/app. User interface isn't always super intuitive but once you get used to it you can get what you need to get done, done."
3150,Erin Sayers,"May 23, 2019",2," I have been using this app for years with no problem, but recently, it only shows one house when I search my area. It's very frustrating as I prefer Zillow over other real estate apps."
3151,A Google user,"October 18, 2018",5," Even though I mostly love to browse, it still gives me a solid idea of what houses are in an area, the price, etc. and I love the filters. Just what I need, very intuitive. 10/10"
3152,A Google user,"March 8, 2019",4, Only thing I don't like is the Hide Property option is gone. It was a handy tool if I wasn't interested. I hate weeding through the same stuff I already know I don't want to see new properties that interest me.
3153,Paul Whitfield,"May 4, 2019",1," search filter not working. searching for houses under $400k. but homes are not showing up that are under $400k when I ""view all"" with no filter. i wonder how many houses i have been missing every time i have used the price filter?!?!"
3154,Kevin Ramos,"May 19, 2019",3," Well after the new update one of my favorite features was removed, which was the option to choose an adress and select how far away the homes were from it based on time ex.30mins. It was a really usefull feature."
3155,David Montoya,"May 15, 2019",1, The search is no longer accurate. I have saved homes that do not show up when I do general searches in an area. When I use my computer the search results are different from the App.
3156,Clarissa Bushka,"December 1, 2018",4," I love browsing available homes across the country. Would love it if there were a feature that shows you homes based on homes you have ""liked"" or ""saved"". But other than that,it's great!"
3157,bearyteri abell,"November 7, 2018",3," Best app and most frequent that I use. Has everything! THAT WAS MY REVIEW. UPDATED: I cannot seem to share anything and visa versa. As well, stuff is missing and to top it off, I cannot find ANY HELP!"
3158,Renee Guthart,"April 1, 2019",4," Easy to use app and very helpful on several moves, but you used to be able to hide houses you didnt want to show up in your feed and you can't anymore, which makes searching through them much more tedious."
3159,Fly By,"October 1, 2018",3," Many times when I search for ""houses near me"" it gives me nothing (as in zero) although most of the time I check off ""for sale"" on the filter. I prefer ""Redfin""."
3160,Dawn Clegg,"May 10, 2019",1," After the May 3, 2019 update nothing works. I can't view previous homes, my searches come up empty. Even the home I live in mysteriously doesn't exist...do I still have to pay for it?? 😂 please fix this app, we're looking to move."
3161,Jo Vic,"February 22, 2019",5," Great tool for the house hunter. Lots of options in the search tool. The market updates, status of properties, seems to have improved from years past."
3162,Brenda Westerberg,"April 1, 2019",5," The Zillow App is super easy to use. For the most part, you can find out anything about any home you want. You can check the ❤ when you want to save a home as a favorite and then you can check back on that home later. Love it!"
3163,Jessica Shinnick,"September 26, 2018",4," Not always accurate, so you have to check with a realtor, but I love it all the same, very easy to use and get info from. Pics and map function are great, so are the filters."
3164,Shannon Davenport,"May 16, 2019",3," Filters are not working. I can see the various filters to sort by but if I try to sort newest the app will only show me one, sometimes two, homes. Its very frustrating. I hope it gets fixed with the next update."
3165,Nick H,"December 3, 2018",5," Very useful application that provides all of the information I need when I'm looking at listings. Excellent design, easy to create filters, and almost instant search response."
3166,A Google user,"December 31, 2018",1," I've deleted and downloaded it several times and I can't save homes. It keeps saying ""Favorite could not be saved. Please check your internet connection"". I am connected or I would not be able to write this review!"
3167,Colin Goldson,"December 2, 2018",5, Love the total package description when it comes to the details of property. I will say however that with very little pictures in some of them it seems like their is something to hide!
3168,Suzanne May,"February 12, 2019",5," I enjoy this app very much. The only thing I would like to see is enhanced search capability as I have difficulty knowing which keywords to add to get what I want. For example, single story 4 gated community for otherwise. Would love to see tuggle boxes instead"

3170,Carrie Dietrich,"June 10, 2019",5," This is a handy app to have when you're looking for a new home. I figured my way around the information fairly quick. I like to search using the map then after I search my targeted area, I ""search all"" to see what is gor sale nearby as well."
3171,Rachael Patrick,"June 11, 2019",3," I love the app, but really wish there was a way to sort by what kind of pets are allowed. It's very discouraging for my search to turn up apartments that are otherwise perfect but don't allow dogs. ""Pet friendly"" is too broad."
3172,carolina breakell,"June 14, 2019",2," If I can't sort by pet friendly this app is useless to me, and extremely frustrating. It sends me ""results"" every day that I can't live in because I have a dog. That seems like a pretty basic and common filter to need."
3173,Townie Wilkinson,"June 22, 2019",4," Easy to use app. Well designed and is a great tool for house shopping! It would be great if you could filter out ""Adult Communities. I get excited when j see a nice place I could actually afford, and then get let down because I'm too young."
3174,STKinJax,"July 1, 2019",5, Better than the website. With the app you can select and deselect properties much quicker than the website. Plus you have the full screen view whereas 50% of the screen is covered with featured properties and ads on the web version.
3175,K Mille,"July 5, 2019",5," Zillow is a wonderful app. It has opened so many doors for me😜. It has allowed me to travel locally and meet up with new people. Its teaching me how to work the cold market🥶🥶🥶😆, new interior design trends, the real estate game etc."
3176,Tiff Howell,"July 7, 2019",3," I really like the concept of the app, ease of use, and options. My biggest complaint and why I'm only giving 3 star's is because it doesn't seem to be updated enough as far homes still on the market or newly listed."
3177,Simon Borrou,"July 8, 2019",5," Excellent tool for finding neighborhood values of a house that I'm intrested in, good way of finding reasonable comps in value, and nice links to the County website for tax and ownership information ... only drawback is listings are not updated fast enough when they're sold. 5 stars!"
3178,Nikky Affolder-Walker,"August 18, 2019",3," I used to really enjoy the app. not so much anymore. For some reason I rarely see homes on the map anymore, though houses that meet the criteria will show up in other areas. I liked being able to see locations on the map before looking further."
3179,Paul West,"August 26, 2019",3," App does what it's supposed to. One big flaw is that in addition to the ability to mark a property entry with a heart to save it, why not have a way to mark a property as already been seen but rejected (not interested)? As it stands I get sick of looking at the same houses over and over."
3180,Silvia Martin,"September 18, 2019",5," It takes getting used to....but you can find houses for sale. They are disguised as ""open house"". Clever. I like being able to search icons (homes for sale) right on the map! Very smart Zillow! Zeway it should be."
3181,Lonnie Hicks,"November 7, 2019",2, Outdated info sales status
3182,Tracy Barnett,"November 6, 2019",5," Love the pics, and also extra information that give a better undertanding about the district areas."

3191,Jane Krueger,"April 10, 2020",5, We've found so many potential houses to look at/to buy!
3192,Sheila Keim-Goddard,"April 19, 2019",4," Mostly positive. The thing I dont like is when I put in a dollar amount to seek properties, if its not over $100,000. it says there are No Properties, change your criteria. I usually have to put in the Higher amount then do alot of sorting."
3193,Rachel Johnson,"May 9, 2019",1, I have an Android phone. For some reason it wont show ANY houses for sale. its very frustrating since I've been using this app for several weeks and have never had a problem until today.
3194,Michael Schrader,"April 25, 2019",1," app lists my ""owned house"" as a different house. this changed recently and was not the house i set up as my house a couple years ago. share the same address but different city. tried fixing but it says my ""real house"" address is not a real address.... come on.... get with it..."
3195,Judy Yen,"October 25, 2018",5," Great app to get general overview of the community, market availability (seller vs buyer's), surrounding neighborhood, open house schedule, tax rate, all in a concise, consolidated format. Well done, thanks, Zillow!!"
3196,David DaSilva,"December 29, 2018",3," This is an okay app, the only issue I have with it is that there isn't a filter for 55+ only communities. Not all places list this so I will get really excited about a place only to call and find out I'm ineligible."
3197,Giovanna Weber,"March 21, 2019",1, I don't like the new app update. It was really nice to be able to adjust the monthly mortgage rate based off of the down payment and how long the loan term was for. The estimated mortgage in the new update is misleading.
3198,Doug McLean,"April 24, 2019",5, It's been a great tool that allows me to look at potential relocation properties. Additional information articles on various topics for buying or selling has also been insightful.
3199,A Google user,"December 8, 2018",5, It is a great app. It helped me quickly search areas of interest and save any listings I wanted to remember and easily share them with my husband and family for opinions.
3200,LJP M,"November 4, 2018",5, This is an amazing app for finding great homes. The only suggestion I have is to broaden the app out of the US and into other countries like Canada or Italy or England or something like that. I'm sure others would love it too!
3201,Tim Osmond,"May 15, 2019",4," almost easy as the desk top version with one exception. when you attempt to plug in adjusted down payments in the mortgage calculator, everything is blacked out by the pop up calculator, you cant see the numbers being inputed only the calculator view."
3202,Stephanie Britz,"September 25, 2018",5, I love this app. It is very helpful. Sometimes the price and estimates are so far apart I don't really know what the value really is. I have looked and used this app. For a while. I do love it.
3203,Andrea Gackle,"December 30, 2018",1," Generally great for looking and it helped when I was looking for a house, but the change to not having a choice about landscape/portrait ruined it for me."
3204,Marielena Gonzalez,"April 20, 2019",1," in the beginning it was working fine but after a few weeks, it was not showing anything, I uninstalled the app and installed it again but still not working, way easier if you just go to Zillow through Google."
3205,Georgia Demetriades,"October 28, 2018",1, Cant get the search to work in a specific area on my android. Did same search on friends iphone and listing appeared. Uninstalled and reinstalled with same results. Allowed zillows to access all info on my phone. Very very very frustrated with your app.
3206,L.J. D.,"January 31, 2019",5, Love looking for homes in the area we are interested and moving to. I can mark favorite check back on them and make a list for when we go to the area to actually look to purchase. It's a great app
3207,Lauren Hammond,"October 30, 2018",4," Love this app. I just want to see more filters. It's hard to find a place I love, only to scroll down on the listing and see they only allow small dogs (I have 50 lb dogs)."
3208,David Copeland,"April 27, 2019",1," You can't edit or delete saved searches from the app. Their help article from Dec 2018 says to go to the Updates tab, click Edit, and then select which searches to remove. There is no Edit button, and the help article is closed to comments. Cool."
3209,Paul Newman,"February 16, 2019",2, stupid ass search engine.

I put my search parameters and the distance I was willing to travel and it kept saying 3 results even though my filters were wide open. turnsd out you have to zoom out on the map prior to entering in your filters. How is that even relevant? What an ANNOYING and dumb feature. I'm about to use Trulia instead...
3210,Christopher Squire,"January 21, 2019",4," I like the app. It is easily navigated and since I can save land, I can watch them. see when they go sell. My only complaint are the dozens of notifications."
3211,James H,"May 22, 2019",1, Still no homes for sale on the map even after the latest update! Fix this problem please! I've uninstalled and reinstalled it from my galaxy s9 several times and it still doesn't work! Still not working properly same as last update! 5/22/19.
3212,Abdul,"October 27, 2018",5," This app is an EXCELLENT place to find a home! It is very easy to through all the listings, as well as look up homes based on location! Really like it!"
3213,Colby Morrison,"December 17, 2018",5," Man I love just looking at all the houses for sale and dreaming. I'm not in a position to buy a house yet but it's a big dream of mine to buy, renovate and rent houses. And this is the best and easiest app I've used!"
3214,A Google user,"October 9, 2018",3," Not very user friendly. Would be nice if a list displayed, and if instead of $xx and up, it was $XX and lower. Search results are cluttered with houses way out of my price range."

3216,Liz King,"May 25, 2019",5," Love this app. Easy to navigate, has enough options to really narrow down to the homes you want to see. Also love the detailed info given about property, for example taxes paid and last sold. Can easily avoid quick flip or overpriced homes."
3217,kathy braunlich,"January 24, 2019",3," I love the app. I only have a problem with the zestimate. One house said the zestimate was 144,000 and two days later it said 124,900. That has happened a couple of times."
3218,Cathy Fleming,"May 11, 2019",5, I love using the Zillow app to look for homes in areas I'm interested in buying a home! All you have to do is fill in what kind of home and the area you want to live in and they'll show you every home they have listed! You'll love this app too!
3219,A Google user,"January 21, 2019",5, I have used Zillow since 2016 (apartment hunting) and again since 2018 till present in my search for my 'everafter' home in a rural community. Zillow has improved 100 fold since then and continues to outshine the rest of them. Keep up the good work!
3220,Tily Chao,"June 21, 2019",5," This is a wonderful app for house hunters or people looking to rent. It's easy to use and has all the extra information that users will find helpful, such as estimated price of the property, trend, and the ability to save favorite ones."
3221,Jacob,"September 26, 2018",4, Too many emails and no way to turn them off in app settings. Creates an email mailing list every time you save a search or select a favorite. You can unsubscribe but you get re-enlisted after each new saved list or favorite.
3222,Scott Drumm,"October 25, 2018",1," The app works, but the data is out-of-date. Homes listed on Zillow are already under contract or even sold in the MLS. Using Zillow was a waste of our time."
3223,A Google user,"September 16, 2018",5," Great app for looking at the local real estate market. Actually does a good job of recommending houses to me, and will let me know when a saved house comes on the market!"
3224,Andrew H,"June 6, 2019",2," This app is worse than the website so I don't know why they would push customers here. You can't choose 1.5+ bathrooms, you can't view a ""list"" of home but only the map. It seems like very basic functionality that they have decided to remove."
3225,Patrick Russell,"June 9, 2019",4, I review this almost weekly to look at certain geographic regions of the US. I am impressed with its quick switch to various listings and photos. I especially like and use its Google map references.
3226,Kimberly Ryan,"June 7, 2019",1, constantly have to restart my phone to get the app to fully restart and actually show more than 2 houses for sale. and don't even bother trying to see open houses. this app used to be good. now it's a joke.
3227,Daniel Nourie,"June 16, 2019",1," Doesn't work after update. Many other reviewers have said that since the update it doesn't list houses for sale anymore and the only response is ""email us"". Can you all fix it? Used to be a great app"
3228,Barbara Carson,"June 17, 2019",2, It's ok. But I'd prefer the former app because it let's me find the distance between areas. This updated version will not let me go back to houses I'm looking at within my email without completely going back to my home screen.
3229,Robert Mac Nally,"June 28, 2019",1," I dont know what happened to this app. It used to be fantastic for looking at what could be my next home but now anytime i try to use it, my phone locks up and needs to be restarted. When that issue is fixed, or if it is, i will amend this comment."
3230,Denise Cold,"July 26, 2019",5," Has features like lot lines that are better than other apps, wish it had more detailed filters like multi-family (4-plex, duplex) and style (ranch, tri-level) but with the draw feature, you can really narrow down neighborhoods and get instant updates."
3231,Kim Johnson,"August 20, 2019",2," Zillow was pretty decent until a glitch caused anything for sale to not load. Support had me un/reinstall the app. My original account disappeared along with all my saves/likes. Not starting over again so uninstalled. Was a solid 3, maybe 4 prior to this."

3233,Otis Humphreys,"September 8, 2019",3, I appreciate the data given by this app that similar apps do not. I would like to see them add additional filters for buyers like pending/not pending listings so i am not nothering my broker about listings that are no longer available. This is the only reason I use Redfin first.
3234,Deanna Juarez,"September 27, 2019",4," Helpful app The only thing that frustrates me is that when I get a notification of a property (s) for sale, the property is not in my area of choice. I've tried several times to change the area but it never takes."

3250,A Google user,"February 10, 2019",4, love the pictures of the houses and street view. Give me a chance to see more of the places also I can show my wife and our family and friends. We save the one's we like and to pick a few so we can go veiw them to see the areas and etc. thanks Doug 👍
3251,Stephanie Range,"February 5, 2019",4," Works great. My only issue is that there seems to be some disconnect in regards to what properties show up between my 2 devices, even when the same filters are checked."
3252,Erika Stanley,"January 4, 2019",3," Mostly great when it works but can be glitchy. Problems with property info being missing, especially on condos - no HOA data included here even though it's available on other sites like Redfin."
3253,LaKeisha Stith,"October 16, 2018",2," The apps okay. It just doesn't have a setting that alerts me for homes the areas I am interested in. Also when I go on another home app, there are a lot more homes available in certain areas that Zillow doesn't have."
3254,Enrique Lopez,"October 24, 2018",3," The app is good. But it would be great if it wasn't for all the notifications about new locations, and then it turns out to be a ""New Construction"". Its annoying and I slid I wanted to see those I would go to those types of websites."

3257,Andrew Woods,"September 26, 2018",1," I used to rely on this app. However, recent updates have made it unusable. I get stuck in a loop of confirming that I am not a robot... never getting to the actual property listings."
3258,Rick Gross,"March 1, 2019",4, A great way to see homes in the location i'm interested in and organize the ones that interest me. Its filters work well. My only issue is that needed information is lacking on some of the properties.

3261,Kristine Reilly,"December 27, 2018",5, I love this app. I like the mortgage calculator. I like the fact you can play around with the downpayment to be able to see around the monthly amount you would need and pay.
3262,Trauge W. May II PoorBoy Racing and Fabrication Co.,"November 7, 2018",5," I love it, but it needs to be improved by a ""on the moment"" updating on house's on the market and pending. Overall only site I use to find my next house!!"

3265,Noah Klausing,"May 7, 2019",3, I really wish Zillow had a filtering option where you can search for a rental home by date availability. Such as a home that's available starting on a later date or after. It would really help out....

3273,Toni Rush,"July 11, 2019",1," I will not use Zillow anymore! Zillow is so complicated now, I hate using it. you can't just go in and look at homes anymore. listed a house and I can't find the listing, I put in a specific question in help center and 10 pages of answers came up none of which matched the question."
3274,Ryan Terry,"August 5, 2019",2," The app has great features and a lot of helpful information. However, when trying to look at specific addresses, Zillow won't allow me to search just that house. Instead, i get 500 houses within some vicinity of the address i put in."
3275,Christopher Garcia,"August 26, 2019",4," Great tool to check surrounding homes and the neighborhood.. Love the Arial view. I would use it more often if it were able to show property lines. When searching for a home, the ability to set parameters and or EXCLUDE Counties would be AMAZING!!!!"

This app is soooooo helpful if you're really in of need help: you're moving, you Need to find a place, use this app, relax, you'll find something really cool and in your price range!!😃"
3277,Danielle Rosa,"September 1, 2019",5, Very helpful... the only thing is that the app doesn't give the option to search by owner or agent. Would make my life easier lol but overall it's the best app as find rental homes. Thanks! I highly recommend this app!!
3278,Angelica Aquino,"September 4, 2019",4, Shows amazing listings. Easy to use. Allows you to put the parameters you are looking for. Wish areas you were looking at were easier to navigate though. But overall an amazing app.
3279,Maddog 1,"September 11, 2019",1," Not sure what is going on, but no houses show up in my searches. I cleared the cache, set the search to default, and even deleted and reinstalled the app, but it still isn't showing any houses.it has been acting like this for a while now."
3280,Rebecca Duggan,"September 14, 2019",4, Great app. It does not get 5 starts because when it sends houses it thinks that I would like they are far from my search filters. Half the ones it sends me I don't need because they are too high or don't have enough bedrooms and so on.
3281,Pablo Noriega,"September 15, 2019",1," Many many issues with the listing of my property map view and the actual address I've put on the listing!

3283,Shane Dillman,"September 28, 2019",1, It would get five stars but the reason it doesn't is because when you search for houses by price and you put in the preference of low to high it gives you a blank price for low when I believe a price should be required to give a more accurate search.

3307,Jordon Toran,"February 12, 2019",1," once you plug in all of your filters, it doesn't create a list of homes that met your criteria like the Realtor app does. it just removes the ones that from the map. and clicking on individual homes on that map is EXTREMELY tedious"
3308,Will Graydus,"May 19, 2019",3," The filter options on the app are mich more restricted than the ones on the website. I had to delete the app in order to show houses with 15 acres or more, otherwise i was limited to 10 or 20."
3309,A Google user,"October 9, 2019",5, Love the app. Just wish there was a way to filter houses based on school ratings. Having to manually click on the houses to find the rating is a little time consuming but otherwise its a great app.

3321,Brette Strodemier,"June 20, 2019",1, I get the emails and now when I click a home to view the photos and details it takes me to a list of suggested houses and not the one I clicked on to view from my email.

3363,A Google user,"March 11, 2019",4," Mapping depends on realtors to be accurate and honest. So, it takes a lot of additional research to save time scouting properties in person."
3364,Janine Bruce,"May 18, 2019",1, Home values are totally inaccurate. Houses are removed from the for sale list if their status changes. Searches continually show homes that are not included in any search parameters including wrong location. Too many bugs to list.
3365,Megan Lail,"April 29, 2019",1," Been awaiting the update but problem is still not fixed! I downloaded this app to easily access specific homes sent through email. Still, when you click through the email, the app pulls up the whole map rather than the listed house. Useless!"
3366,Jeanette Redmond,"September 21, 2018",5," Good, but I wish for floor plans with dimensions to get an idea of flow and furniture fit. Check out the Swedish site Hemnet.se they have floor plans and options to redecorate online by changing colors and more in some cases."
3367,timtimgregg,"November 17, 2018",5, This app is pretty legit! It makes finding spots PDE. You can circle areas on the map and it will only show you houses in the area. I'm about it.
3368,Ellen Levett,"June 14, 2019",4, They have incorrect info and i cannot connect with anyone to fix it. There is no customer support. After several hours going in circles i finally got a working email link. i got a response. I think it will be fixed.
3369,Darla Hughes,"June 22, 2019",5," I love being able to plug in what I want (4 bed, built after 2000, 1/2 acre lot or larger, etc) and Zillow does the work for me. Narrows the field so I don't have to search through tons of houses I DON'T want!"
3370,Sam Boustani,"June 29, 2019",2," Zillow never has accurate HOA fees because agents don't include coop and condo fees, or they can't because it doesn't have a field for it.

3371,Shara,"June 30, 2019",5, I love all yhe options available and filters. also showing the ratings for the schools near my potential home gets 100 🌟. they give their est on the worth and help you figure out what you may be paying for mortgage. the app makes buying a home so much easier
3372,Jo Obrien,"July 2, 2019",3," Great for finding and listing rentals. As a property owner, attempting to update the listing doesn't seem to work. also it seems the only way for candidates to contact me is thru Zillow. I prefer direct contact"
3373,Dolores Hayes,"July 5, 2019",3, As a landlord i like getting an idea of housing pricing in areás i research. i do not like the emails i receive of Homes Selected Especially For Me that do not meet my default search criteria. Example: Zillow suggests single family homes and all i look for are multifamily buildings.
3374,Ross Saur,"July 5, 2019",3, Zillow is pretty good as far as its listings but losing the ability to filter by pets for rentals in the app is incredibly frustrating. I'm sure it generates more clicks for percieved traffic but mostly it wastes my time.
3375,A. L.Auburn,"July 4, 2019",5, good pictures. lots of info. mortgage calculator allows you to add utilities so you can really get a good idea of if you can afford it. Extensive filters. Accurate mapping. Nice app overall
3376,Lori Jaykus,"July 6, 2019",1, Not accurate! I spent hours and days trying to locate a property listed on this app to find ALL the information totally false; missing out on numerous others. I was only looking to give myself options and this app almost cost me my dream.
3377,Robert Reich,"July 20, 2019",1, it is such a great app all I see is a white page with a Google map pin on buildings or outlines of same no road names or any pertinent information One mic need or want to make a decision as to whether or not they want to buy or rent said location. total waste of time
3378,Scott Chapple,"July 16, 2019",1," after the last update, I can not get any land,lots for sale markers anywhere. Reset the filters and still nothing. Re install the app..still nothing.

3380,PickMeToWin,"August 30, 2019",5," First isn't always best, but Zillow has the edge over the other home hunting apps. We are looking for our retirement home and Zillow makes it easy to search and compare location options and so much more."
3381,Shawn _,"September 10, 2019",1," Puts out a fake update every few days that doesn't actually change anything just so you will see the app listed when you go to update things. No way to save houses without getting data mined, so I ended up just making a Markor file with addresses of places I was interested in."
3382,B G,"September 14, 2019",5," Great app. Clearly shows both homes and property for sale by realestate agencies and by owner in a defined area with pics, satellite view, and descriptions. Extremely helpful when searching for property."
3383,Mark Jones,"October 2, 2019",5, Update: great program thanks to the new update everything is fixed. 5 star for customer service and fantastic App. How do you turn off dark mode? It makes the app hard to use and serves no purpose. The map is hard to see and find things on now.
3384,Loka nine,"September 19, 2019",1, Missing tons of services allowed on the browser and from a computer. Cannot just apply for a house rental straight from the app which is super frustrating. Has all kinds of houses for sale or rent that don't appear in the phone app system.
3385,Nicholas Crowe,"September 29, 2019",1," When I search for a listing, it automatically selects all types of homes (houses, townhomes, condos, etc). In the past I could save my search of just houses so I didnt have to set up a new query every time I use the app. Quit pushing your poor updates."
3386,Maureen R,"October 22, 2019",2," Gives me listings in Kentucky. I wanted Tennessee, mainly around Knoxville. Theres no way to rid unwanted areas. I put my limit price in the filter and it gives me houses way over budget. $21,000,000? Really? It's very disappointing. And it could use a crime meter in areas like other apps have."

3393,Cheryl Reams,"February 11, 2019",5," Zillow is easy to use, helpful and I like the map feature. It's a little hard to draw the line on the map but I'm still very glad to have that feature :) I would also like there to be a feature to look for open houses."
3394,Mia Mini,"May 17, 2019",2," Clicking the link from an email notification should take you to THAT property, not to a map covered in red dots. How are you supposed to find it if you're not already familiar with the area?"
3395,S M,"September 20, 2018",5, Its very informative and and easy to use. I love that it tells you what schools are near the place so you can check the reviews to see if it will be a good school for our kids. Its very helpful
3396,Ed Dight,"August 11, 2019",2," doesn't sync with searches from my laptop even on same account also. exact same search criteria on app and computer results in dozens of hits on computer and only 2 on app. also, have found dozens of houses that are auctions while expressly having auctions hidden on preferences."
3397,Pam Daniels,"May 10, 2019",5," It't great to be able to pick a town or just an area, it not only tells you a price on a house or condo to buy or rent. Also taxes and other estiments are all included on Zillow."

3399,Barbara Lee,"May 18, 2019",5, We're looking for property in a number of areas for our retirement home (when the time comes) and Zillow gives us a chance to explore option countrywide. Love it. 😊
3400,Sheila Miller,"May 16, 2019",5," I love this app. I can find land ,home or an agent with just a tap. we have not found the land we are looking for yet. but I won't quit looking with Zillow."
3401,Michael Philbrook,"January 9, 2019",5, I've followed Zillow for several years and i love it. The app is very accurate and the listings appear super fast. Data is always reliable. Great resource!
3402,A Google user,"March 10, 2019",5, I'm enjoying the app. It allows me the option to drill down on surrounding homes to see comparable value & not just the homes for sale. Nice!
3403,Aussie G,"February 11, 2019",4," I did find a lovely place. My only qualm would be that there is not a good pet filter for the app. Yes, I can type ""pets"" into the filter, but it doesn't show me all my options."
3404,A Google user,"February 9, 2019",4," nice app, slow to load, doesn't have some information correct such as taxes, HOA fees... would be nice if you could save the open houses so that they are there when you go out to look"
3405,A Google user,"October 11, 2018",4," Pretty self explanatory. Look for houses wherever with somewhat accurate pricing (#inflation), save the ones you like, and apply when ready. I have yet to follow the last step, hence the 4 stars."
3406,Mary Sugg,"April 21, 2019",1, zillow has always worked great on my tablet. The update I believe made it impossible to use.😧 I have to uninstall and install it again. I hope it works. 😞
3407,A Google user,"February 24, 2019",5," I use this app daily! I find it easier to use than all of the competition, and the pictures are larger. Makes home shopping easy and fun!"
3408,Debbie Ardis,"February 23, 2019",5, Zillow is awesome. I've bought and sold homes on Zillow. They allow you enough space to say what you need to say about your home and people who are interested want to see all that you have to say.
3409,Carlos Rodriguez,"February 20, 2019",5," I really like the app it is easy to use the only complaint and a recommeded fix would be some of the addresses do not match the location on the map when you try to do a ""street view"""
3410,PRgabo,"October 14, 2018",4," Good app overall. Sometimes it will not filter out houses by price range. For example, you might set a max price of 200k, but still see 400k houses."
3411,Fred Sinclair,"October 3, 2018",5, Love It! Easy to visit and view potential properties. It has all the information listed. However the agents don't respond back in a timely manner.
3412,Scott Bond,"April 17, 2019",3, Something happened the last update. I used to be able to send links. Now the links bring up bogus addresses or blank maps in the Zillow app. It was fine until this last update
3413,Jan Price,"November 21, 2018",5," Whenever I travel this app allows me to look at housing in the area as at some point I need to move to warmer climate. I am retired and like everyone,suffering with both types of arthritis. So this app is most helpful to me"
3414,Timothy Paul,"January 10, 2019",5, Keeps up with my favorite listings. Sends me new listings as they come in. I enjoy app notifications and email notifications. I can search for more than one city and receive notifications on listings for both.
3415,Nicholas Wilson,"June 2, 2019",1," Use the app and get around 75 listings at the most, use the website and get hundreds. Why use the app and limit the options, can't even use the website on my phone until I unistalled the app first. Zillow is Great, the mobile app is not."
3416,Courtney Crawford,"January 5, 2019",5, I love Zillow! It's so easy to use and allows you to search for homes based on the school district you want to be in. That is very important to my husband and I.
3417,Janiece Barbour,"April 7, 2019",5, It's an great way for you to see what's avaiable. Your able to find the specfic bedroom and bath that your looking for. This app has been very helpful in locating what I'm looking for..
3418,A Google user,"November 6, 2018",5, Just installed app and amazed at what's available and the speed of finding listings. I would recommend this app to anyone starting a property search or just browsing. Nice job Zillow!
3419,kimberly helfman,"October 12, 2018",3, I wish you would bring back the option to delete properties that you don't like. I also wish that you would have the capability of selecting which school ratings you prefer to see such as the area has poor schools they don't show up in your search
3420,Emily Dillner,"September 16, 2018",5," I really enjoy this app, I just wish it still had the ability to ""hide"" listings... I can't seem to find that anymore. But it's still really great and helpful!"
3421,A Google user,"January 6, 2019",3," App is user friendly for the most part. However, I have to switch to my laptop to contact a builder or agent as you cannot see or thoroughly review what you are typing. This restricts my use."
3422,jason parks,"September 27, 2018",2," This app keeps asking if I am a human and presenting captcha verification. Even once verified, it keeps asking. Even after I close the app it asks. Please correct this issue as I use this app alot. I currently uninstalled to stop the issue."
3423,Fred Kreitz,"May 26, 2019",5, Zillow is how we found our current home. Zillow showed us that our house was available before our hired realtor knew about it. That's how great this app is. I strongly advise everyone in the home buying market take advantage of this app.😉
3424,Bob Moore,"December 22, 2018",4," best for a quick lookup of a home with good information and usually good photos as well as access to satellite, lot line and street views. my only problem is narrowing searches to the neighborhood and criteria that I want."
3425,philly heretic,"May 12, 2019",3," Good compared to other apps, but it is really buggy at times. Also, a lot of the listings have false information. The PC version is superior."
3426,Todd Yamashita,"December 24, 2018",1," Customer support link in the app is dead and ""network error"" is persistent throughout (though it's clear I have connectivity). Please give your Android version some love because when the app works, it's great."
3427,Jacob & Barbara Bartlett,"July 11, 2019",5, really nice to see what's available but i wish it were a requirement for Zillow for the user to post atleast 40 or 50 pictures of the home that they are selling. I hate only seeing 10 pictures. I automatically ignore those posts and start looking elsewhere!
3428,Jessica olivero,"July 1, 2019",2, for some reason it keeps saying can't downloaded homes check internet connection. I have checked everything and and made sure all internet was on. Still won't let me see homes. I have tried to click on customer service and it won't open that window either
3429,Andrea Wein,"July 28, 2019",1," This gives a huge advantage to the landlord to just take the best of the applicants and no one else ever. There's no incentive at all for a landlord to actually use a FCFS basis but it sets up the tenant so that if you aren't the best of the best, you're never able to rent anywhere."

3434,Karen Starnes,"September 2, 2019",5, I have tried several apps for finding rental homes and even homes for sale and this is by far the best one I found yet. It gives you different search parameters that really help to narrow down your choices. You will be pleased!
3435,Praveen Meka,"September 7, 2019",4," Great design and very customizable to find the nearest match. I wish there was a way to filter by the direction the house is facing (North, South etc.). Other than that, it's an awesome app."
3436,Wolfgang Mclain,"September 14, 2019",4," Not five stars because I have yet to find the throttle for the rate of notifications, other than that it is both amusing and helpful for finding a new home withing your price range and ideal neighborhood."

3444,Jeniece Mitchell,"February 3, 2019",5," I used Zillow often to track homes in my area that are up for sale. This app is helpful in figuring mortgage rates, determining a suitable neighborhood location based on your personal needs/desires, etc."
3445,David Martinez,"May 16, 2019",4, it has a lot of great information and is easy to use. my one improvement would be removing the price slide bar and replacing it with a numeric dropdown.

3456,David Strickland,"February 24, 2019",4, Works pretty well. Only received 4 stars because there are occasional glitches in operation. Usually a simple force close and reopen solves the problem.
3457,Sarkis D,"April 13, 2019",1, listings are not currently updated and most of the time the house listed is not available and the listing agent is not available. it's only to connect you with another agent to sale you different house not the house you actually were interested in the first place.
3458,manford mann,"March 19, 2019",4, I would say it's easy to use except when going back there should be the words back showing the way. Some times you can lose the whole site and have to start all over again. But the rest is great.
3459,Jermaine Pennie,"October 6, 2018",4, This app is good yet not 100% what is a big benefit are features like drawing the area and the verified source. Yet it would be better if you can add a utilities feature for renting.
3460,jesse wood,"February 1, 2019",5," First off, this is the only app that I have ever felt compelled to actually take the time to rate. It is simple but covers all aspects of renting/buying property. Definitely the best app at doing what it does. 10/10"

3463,Emelie Blair,"January 14, 2019",3, I adore this app. the interface is wonderful and it has more listings than any other realty app I've ever used. I only wish that you could type in your budget rather than use a slider.
3464,Desiree Robinson,"February 24, 2019",4," Great for finding a house to buy or rent. It has a feature to favorite a listing, would be even better if I could hide a listing that I dont like so i dont have to look at over again."
3465,Kat Bell,"April 1, 2019",2," This app was fine in the beginning, but now the filter is not working. The location is not accurate even after it's corrected and saved, it continues to show another location."
3466,ERIC POTTS,"December 18, 2018",1, I hate how difficult it is to get a Satellite view of the map. I personally wont use the app sometimes just cause of frustration trying to get a Satellite view of the surroundings.

3468,Anthony Johnson,"October 27, 2018",4, This app is really easy to use and a great research tool. May need to update more frequently to reflect home statuses and price changes.
3469,The Alchemist/Jackal,"June 5, 2019",4, Very helpful with detailed info to assist in a great buy. My only gripe are the repeat virtual house imaging for homes under construction. But even this has its place.
3470,David Pardo,"June 9, 2019",5, The app continues to give me updates and easy to use. Selling home and it allows me to see how many views and people saving my home so keeps me updated and notice other similar sites doesn't have that option. very happy with zillow.
3471,Sarah Hackbarth,"July 8, 2019",2, frustrating that you cannot filter out style of homes.... for example.... split entry aka NOT handicap accessible.... It would also be great to have a hide feature for properties you do NOT want to see... or have looked at and don't like.
3472,Ryan Lynch,"July 10, 2019",1," Used to work fine, now houses don't show up. i put in the entire city i am searching in, and it shows 1 house. Redfin shows over 100. Suspect its not showing all listings, as i can see more on Zillow on my PC for same search."
3473,Carey Slocum,"July 21, 2019",5," I love being able to see homes for sale or rent while lounging around at home. There's pictures, prices and a way to contact the realtor. It makes my husband and I get more and more excited about our first home purchase! Thanks Zillow!!"
3474,Javier Gonzalez,"July 25, 2019",5," As a potential future homebuyer, it is good to know that Zillow can be able to give me a good concept of owning and buying in a house. The app overall is very easy to follow and understand. The interface is very quickly learnable and mininmalist."
3475,Sarah Yang,"July 31, 2019",1, Zillow has been great till recently. It keeps saying network error and it cannot display houses. I tried uninstalling and installing again but the same message appears every time I try to look up the area. Please fix this ASAP..
3476,Julie Robertson,"July 20, 2019",2, What's happened? I started getting notices of homes for sale near the locations I was looking. But that lasted only a short while. Now I get more notifications on homes that are not even close to my saved searches. Not even the same states!
3477,Dawn Clodfelter,"August 22, 2019",5, I would like the house that was I sent to me as a email to open without having to search for it in the app. Changing price points etc. But other than that it's a great app.
3478,shannon Shannon,"August 25, 2019",5," Not the most frequently updated real estate app, but definitely the most user friendly. Great launch point to use when starting to look, and discussing preferences with your realtor."
3479,David Tuangswang,"August 24, 2019",4," There is a lot of things that don't function correctly. Such things include signing in using other apps, uploading pictures, etc. This app is probably optimized to work better on iOS devices."
3480,Demarcus Peterson,"September 6, 2019",5," Wow! Talk about easy! With just a few clicks under the search filter tab, choose your home size, bathrooms, etc. Plus, get notified of newly additional rental homes. Makes it extremely pleasant, (mentally) looking for a home!"
3481,Dan Hewitt,"September 14, 2019",1," It's a nice and convenient idea, however it is ruined with advertisers selling apartments listed as houses. I have complained to Zillow about it twice and received no response. Zillow is dead in the water."
3482,Samantha Fawcett,"September 16, 2019",5, I love this app!! Makes it almost easy to find homes! My daughter husband and I are looking and this app makes it easy to access the homes we looked at and like all you do it save it with the <3 button
3483,Name unknown,"September 18, 2019",1," When you keep changing the user interface without warning and without and care for continuity, the result is a poor user experience. Please put more time thinking about what experienced users lose and not put so much in to shiny new things!"
3484,Gregory Cook,"October 18, 2019",4," I like the app, especially the map drawing/list function. But there needs to be a option to exclude houses that are on leased land. And for that it's not a 5/5"
3485,Meizhen Culver,"November 3, 2019",1," After I installed the app, I couldn't see the hours, only the locations of the houses."
3486,Tamara Smith,"December 14, 2019",5, This app shows things other home apps doesnt. Its more in detail
3487,brian McDonald,"December 21, 2019",4, I love this app and the Realtors are very helpful and respectful they're there to help you find a house
3488,Ray Aguilera,"January 3, 2020",5, Keeps realtors from too much contact
3489,Thomas Stalcup,"January 6, 2020",5, Easy to use. Great app.
3490,juan cardenas,"January 8, 2020",5, I love the detail information on properties
3491,Carl Luss,"January 27, 2020",4, Difficult to find saved searches.
3492,Chad Kloefkorn,"March 15, 2020",1, impossible to see your saved searches instead of just new additions
3493,Joseph Castongia,"April 19, 2020",5, Very easy to use
3494,Mitchell Thomas,"September 25, 2018",3," I like the app, but it only works in tablet mode on my Samsung Chromebook Pro, but I'm also on the beta channel so that could be part of the issue..."
3495,Vin Ruff,"November 21, 2018",1, I deleted this app previously then later reinstalled it... before a bunch of properties with pics came up(very nice).Now all I get is a bunch of dots on a map to click on- not good at all. .now I'm deleting it for good
3496,Classic Rides,"May 11, 2019",1, as of the recent update I can view any Homes not even the ones I have saved. I use this app quite frequently but if this persists I am more the likely going to have to get rid of it. what's the point in having an app that wont work properly.
3497,Jurnee Hall,"January 3, 2019",1, absolute worst if trying to find a place to rent. I've literally searched for the last 2 hours in ever single county around me and my job and there is literally 0 results. Not to mention it continueously exited the app and had countless errors it's stupid.
3498,Kathleen Walters,"May 14, 2019",1," this app worked great at first. now it won't show any homes except maybe two. I tried to delete it and reinstall it, but it didn't work. really frustrating"
3499,Manita Shrestha,"September 18, 2018",1," It dint list the apartment in the way I want it.. it was in all in dots in map, and I had to click on one and one to view them .. I don't know I just don't find it user friendly."
3500,Jane Crosby,"February 3, 2019",5," I love your app!! It's nice to go in and see the houses in your neighborhood or areas you're interested in and see the prices, the selling history, etc!! 👍👍"
3501,Vicky Justen,"May 19, 2019",2," There are times that this app does not show what is available. If you can refresh, it might work, but not always. There are at least 2 other apps that perform better"
3502,Chavo Rivera,"September 22, 2018",4," It's a great app but most of the pictures are not current as when you show up to a dress it looks totally different, but overall it's helpful"
3503,Joe Morgan,"November 4, 2018",5," Perfectly set up for easy browsing. Definitely worth downloading the app. Notifications keep you updated for the good deals out there. Lol, people are going to think this review was set up intentionally"
3504,Jupiter,"April 19, 2019",5, Zillow always have what you are looking for. I look up properties everywhere and I easily find them. You always get all the information you need. And it is so easy to use. Thanks Zillow!!!
3505,Mariana Hayes,"May 8, 2019",5," love the app, however, showing photos vertically instead of horizontally where one can see one at a time, it's an issue."
3506,DJ NEON!,"September 30, 2018",5," Simple to use interface, well designed with many useful tools. If your in the market for real estate, this app is second to none!"
3507,Nathan Haynes,"February 26, 2019",1," The amount of emails sent to you every day is ridiculous. I unsubscribed, but it said if i take certain actions in the app they'll email me again. Uninstalled. Not interested in getting 40 notifications a day."
3508,Tom McKain,"March 27, 2019",1, why in the world did you remove opening up the house you were sent in an email. I don't want to see 100 homes in my search radius to try to find the new listing! Please change it back! May quit using Zillow if stays that way.
3509,Alan Lehman,"February 6, 2019",1," It worked well for a few weeks. Now i just get ""network error"". I've tried rebinding and reinstalling. Other apps work fine. there had been no response to my request for support."
3510,Danny Chajon,"January 30, 2019",5, Zillow is great! We found our lease using the app and plan to use the app when we're ready to buy. This is a much better way to find a rental than Craigslist.
3511,Lela Robinson,"April 14, 2019",5, This app is very helpful and accurate. Zillow made places like RentMax obsolete which is a good thing for consumers! We shouldn't have to pay for rental or house for sale listings!
3512,Raymond White,"April 7, 2019",1, The new layout is bad. When you are looking at a home you can't see the square footage anymore. It will show how many bedrooms but hides the bathrooms. The app is not worth using.
3513,A Google user,"March 1, 2019",5," Even though we weren't able to get the house we were looking at, our search continues to be easy as this app is easy to navigate and the information is amazing!"
3514,Reybel,"October 6, 2018",1," The application is well developed but without the prompt update of its contents, it is not longer a good app, it comes loose the main reason for what was created."
3515,Curtis Jones,"September 22, 2018",3, Does not give the correct responses to my search. I would also like more searchable fields. I want to be able to tell it to two car garage. I want to be able to tell it central air.
3516,kristen lyon-flanders,"April 22, 2019",1, whenever I did a search would not show all listings. sometimes it would not show any listings even though I knew that the property was for sale or rent.
3517,Larissa DeLong,"October 13, 2018",3, Worked well until it updated.now it went allow me to search for homes. Keeps saying there is a connection error and to check my network but I have 4 bars and tried it on WiFi and it still didn't work
3518,Emmett Vorisek,"November 28, 2018",5," Comprehensive set of filters, detailed and we'll presented info. Haven't used it much yet though, so hard maybe there are some faults I haven't bumped into yet."
3519,Rick Tedford,"March 13, 2019",5," I have used zillow for years to keep track of rental properties for purchase, sale, and rent setting. it's been very dependable."
3520,Alex R,"June 2, 2019",4," Easy to use and provides a good insight to what options are out there, but a lot of really good places to live are not listed. In other words, Zillow should not be your end all be all place to search for a place to live"
3521,Chris Kuhl,"June 16, 2019",5, So easy and accurate! Our house sold within $700 of the Zestimate. And what an amazing resource when searching for our next house. Didn't have to sign any contracts or pay thousands for a realtor.
3522,Keato B,"June 27, 2019",1," Oh my God. So glad to have this app I downloaded SPECIFICALLY to write this review!!... And will DELETE immediately afterwards.

So glad to have this app I downloaded SPECIFICALLY to write this review!!... And will DELETE immediately afterwards. HEYYY NOTICE how I said I was REQUIRED TO INSTALL this app in order to be able to REVIEW it..? Yeahh. It'd be super considerate of you NOT to show up on (at LEAST our andriod people's) homepages, much less ""recently used apps"" screen when we NEVER EVEN DOWNLOADED THE APP ONCE IN THE FIRST PLACE, and only ever looked at it on our respective go-to web browsers. Thanks."
3523,Julia Bauer,"July 18, 2019",5, not as easy to navigate as the desktop version but still useful on the go. sorting out just the houses and land you are looking for and not showing stuff you could care less about and no pressure unlike a human realtor is a big plus!
3524,Christian J,"July 26, 2019",4," Overall a good app. Search needs to allow to enter exact lot size requirements (only allows you to specify ""greater than10 acres"" (which too few). Also, the ""saved searches"" feature is not very intuitive (to review/edit all saved searches)."
3525,Crystal Singleton,"November 4, 2019",5, This app is nice but the prices are not what u think it is do ur research before signing ur name on the dotted line
3526,Thomas Acevedo,"August 5, 2019",4," Great way to look up quickly the houses up for sale near me.

Wish it included all pertinent information like h.o.a. fees, lot rents, and taxes or assessment fees. Some listings dont have any of that inmorpant info and is need to make a decision on houses I can afford. It's a good app. Listings that only have 1 or 3 pictures is a waist of time."
3527,Rob Litecky,"August 12, 2019",3, Wish the sort option pane froze and followed the user when you scrolled through houses. cumbersome to scroll back up to change filter. Wish the single home feature was still in the app. Single home is key for many in hot climates. Also important for elderly.
3528,Rick Lovier,"August 31, 2019",5," Having found our first house through Zillow, we are busy looking for our new home here. Love the map and satellite views. The photos are always good . I would love it if there were floor plans with measurements for each house though 😊😊😊"
3529,T. Miles,"January 12, 2020",3, Why is this app showing me homes that has already been sold?
3530,Patricia Sackett,"February 24, 2020",4, I like the level of details given
3531,Ty Fincher,"March 20, 2020",5, Overall best property app
3532,Patrick Jewell,"April 23, 2020",1, Didn't load. Website works a lot easier.
3533,Robert S,"April 23, 2020",1, Crashed 4 times within 15 minutes.
3534,Chris Lindsay,"February 23, 2019",5," Easy to use, and user friendly! Made it easy to contact real estate agents, and made the whole process much easier and less intimidating."
3535,Lisa Rapp,"September 20, 2018",3," What happened to the feature where a user could ""hide"" a listing? There are so many that I'm not interested in clogging up the map. Please go back to letting us hide listings we're not interested in!"
3536,Hollyn Hendershot,"May 19, 2019",5," nice photos, even showing defects in places on line. you can zoom in and if they are willing to do this (show the real deal) then I feel I can trust them to be upfront."
3537,kt Ebb,"September 20, 2018",1," Kills phone battery spying on you with cookies. Difficult to opt out, violates FDA regulation with deceptive opt out options that make it confusing for the average bear. As a result, deleted app and will no longer use your product. Good job."
3538,nvsikaya windland,"April 25, 2019",1," ""No internet connection"" it says me every few seconds. I'm on wifi, what da hell! Reinstalled it 2 times, no changes. Hate this app, had to switch back to browser."
3539,Ramiro Tijerina,"December 11, 2018",5, probably the best app for looking for homes on the market. easy to use. pretty straight forward and even gives you an estimated price. very good app.
3540,Geo Heff77,"March 22, 2019",5," love shopping on this app. See they have an update... uh oh!! maybe i should wait till i comment??

3541,YoLonda Thompson,"November 20, 2018",5, Finally a app that you can search for a house in your area for free! And the homes are beautiful! And you get to look at pictures. Thank you so much for this.
3542,Elizabeth D'andrea,"May 18, 2019",5, Great app for house shopping. Quick to load and the data history for the property is great. Gives you quick and accurate information! It is my go to house shopping app

Give me back my dislike button and I'll jump mt rating back up to 5 stars Updating mmt review and lowering the stars since it seems like no one cares. Maybe a 1 star will get someone attention.
3544,Gil Ceniceros,"March 8, 2019",5, Easy to scroll around in areas of interest using filters to only look for properties that might be of interest to me. Love it!
3545,"It's Vlad, not Vladimir","April 12, 2019",5," Very useful and well put together App! Im glad i found such App, because i need to rent an apartment ASAP, and Zillow is the trustee when it comes to helping me find my appropriate mancave!!"
3546,Kyle Kleinknecht,"June 11, 2019",1," Worthless since you removed the ""distance to"" feature. Easier to just search websites like redfin etc. Bring back the feature everyone needs to know how far houses are from their jobs and I'll change my review"
3547,Eliza Zahm,"January 5, 2019",1, Awful to Run. The website runs better and gives you more filter options than the app. Half the time the ads for homes listed aren't even correct and half the rentals are run by slum lords. Use other apps like Zumper or Hotpads.
3548,Dylan Shaw,"May 7, 2019",1," I have always loved this app... but recently has started giving me network errors and only lets me do direct address searches for houses, won't let me just browse the area."
3549,A Google user,"January 1, 2019",4, Great information including all public records in one place. Easy to navigate not too bogged or cluttered with advertising. Thank you!
3550,Andrea Carter,"April 16, 2019",5," This app is super easy to use. I have not found an apartment yet, but that's really more of reflection on the rental market in L.A. than the app."
3551,Julie Jacobs,"March 3, 2019",5, Great app. Helped me with home searches in the past and is helping me now! I do wish you could search for larger amounts of land and exclude mobile/manufactured homes.
3552,A Google user,"September 26, 2018",5," User friendly app! Easy to navigate & listings update in real time (no need to constantly go in to check, since notifications are right on point)."

Thanks! I hope you you find this useful as I do.
3555,Michael Forte,"January 27, 2019",2," App is super buggy, tried using sharing to shop for homes and it never works. Wouldn't even let me save homes on my own account, had to clear app data, but still doesn't share with my partners account."
3556,Shiva Best,"October 20, 2019",3, Fine app up until you need something from Customer Support. You literally can't get to Customer Support from the app: the links are broken. Same problem if you try to unsubscribe from an email blast they send you.
3557,Alex Briggs,"March 29, 2019",1, New version is almost unusable. Why hide the useful information under layers of difficult to interact with banners? Seriously a step backwards. Please revert to old method for displaying property info.
3558,Tessa Rae,"January 23, 2019",1, Loved this app until it went on the fritz and wont load anything and keeps saying that the internet connection is bad when it's perfectly fine for every other application.
3559,Kate Lungul,"April 6, 2019",1," Before this recent update the app was superb. NOW it stalls, freezes, and turns the screen black. When you scroll around on the map it's super slow to download available houses, and constantly stalls. Horrible"
3560,Devin Staker,"December 25, 2018",5," Great app for finding a rental or home purchase! I've used it for both and it's always reliable, accurate, and fast!"
3561,A Google user,"February 22, 2019",4," Couldn't search for duplex, half duplex, etc. Had to sift through everything for sale in my price range. Kinda liked the Zillow I was using ~2016-2017 better, more user control."
3562,Brian Whitbeck,"May 19, 2019",3, Loads too much. Let me pan around the map before you load all the houses. keep seeing spinning circle while trying to get to a new area of interest.
3563,Bethany Joplin,"December 17, 2018",5," App.was awesome for finding local listings. Ben Lyons helped me, he was very good to us. Showed us the place multiple times, and was very patient with us through the whole process. 😀"
3564,A Google user,"December 10, 2018",5," Hands down my favorite app for finding rentals! Simple UI, reliable data, and very few (if any) interruptions. Also, the best app for some leisurely home browsing."
3565,Alex Burns,"April 4, 2019",3," When I get an email about a new listing, I feel like clicking the address in the email should take me directly to that listing. I dislike having to scroll down through all the updates to find it."
3566,amy titus,"February 20, 2019",5," They stopped giving me the ""see on map"" option online, so I got the app. The map option is there, so, good. a bit easier to navigate than online."
3567,Wendy Volpe,"May 29, 2019",1," the rentals are inconsistent. I'm really interested in an apartment and have no way to verify the realtor knows I want to apply. The app says I can call now, but there is no phone number. it's just confusing"
3568,Mike Brackett,"June 1, 2019",1," TOO political. I uninstalled app after getting a VERY, VERY, VERY, DISTURBING Email. survey asked if this app contains inappropriate ads. It offered me two options. No, or not sure. I wanted to choose yes but it wasn't available."
3569,Rob T,"June 22, 2019",2," Once upon a time this was a great app for searching. As of recently, they do not show available housing within my area. I have found sold houses where this app did not indicate it was for sale. My recent search for property showed zero results. Not acceptable"
3570,Alonso Cisternas,"June 19, 2019",3, Mostly enjoying it. my only complaint is not being able to see which properties I've submitted request for applications to. it would help me keep track of who I've contacted and what I might need to do next.
3571,timothy rogers,"June 25, 2019",1," it seems no matter how many ways I place my settings on this app, it shows me no houses or anything. I asked to have this fixed several times before and it keeps on going back to not working. I'm done with it."
3572,Lorri K.,"June 30, 2019",5," Zillow makes finding the home & land you dream of, SO easy! There are tons of pics, from different angles, and info to let you know exactly what your getting. I LOVE this app!! GO ZILLOW☺🙃"
3573,Sandra Puga,"July 4, 2019",3," It seems that app is not updated in a timely manner. App still shows homes ""for sale"" when they should be in""pending""or""sold"" status. This makes it very difficult when trying to purchase a home."
3574,Tomiye Gregor,"July 23, 2019",4, have great options and many different homes! I have looking for a couple of months to see what's out there and never get any pressure!! when I am ready I will definitely use Zillow to find my forever home!!
3575,Brazen BNO,"August 3, 2019",1, The app is annoying. I used to be able to just scroll and view listings. But they're trying to force this annoying map view where I have to click on every little red dot to view a house. Horrible.
3576,Joe Arena,"August 7, 2019",1," The app is failing to search entire towns in many instances, and instead is only showing listings for a small portion of the town. For instance, when entering and searching for Mahwah, NJ, zillow only shows homes for part of the town. Trulia does not have this issue."
3577,Beverly Cortes,"September 8, 2019",5, It always keeps me updated with the value of my home. It's easy to locate other properties. It's simple and easy to use. I live getting my home repor6every month.
3578,Tammy Wedge,"September 12, 2019",5, I love that I get daily updates about new listings because it's hard for me to take time and look for myself due to my work schedule. And the variety of homes is a nice feature along with the full descriptions.
3579,Cooper Wright,"October 3, 2019",1," Great app but non existent support. I have used this app on my old android phone with no problems. Now with my new phone, I get homes shown but no map. I have called support twice, no answer."

3586,A Google user,"December 4, 2018",5," Very helpful, easy to use, the variety of search filters make finding what your looking for quick and easy."
3587,Helena Smith,"January 12, 2019",5, This app is amazing! Buying and selling my home was such a great experience because of the knowledge I gleaned from this app. Great app.!
3588,Jamie Jade Dahmer,"April 24, 2019",2," i get emails for a saved search, and when i click on a particular listing, it opens the app to the map, and never shows me the listing i clicked. stick with the website, it works better."
3589,John Sumner,"October 7, 2018",1," All around great app, except for the fact that even if you unsubscribe from all emails, it automatically resubs you if you save or share any house."
3590,Joseph Baker,"May 21, 2019",1," experiencing same issue as other users, Zillow app stopped showing any homes for sale on map on google pixel 3xl. fully updated app and OS. it has been like this for at least a week."
3591,Greg Laskey,"March 30, 2019",1, new listing deails ui is awful. i don't want to have to scroll through all of the information. i liked how all the sub menus were collapsed and i could only expand the info i wanted. now i have to scroll through all of it to find what i want.
3592,Ernest Moore,"February 5, 2019",5, Great app. Super easy to navigate and find your next home. Offers several different agents to contact. Must needed app for every potential and current homeowner.
3593,Tonya Freels,"May 5, 2019",5," Zillow helped us find our new home, the detailed information along with the photos is everything you need to narrow your search. The updates are super helpful for your saved homes."
3594,Caral Talbot,"October 21, 2018",2, It doesn't show a list for me to look through. Just a map that says how many results but you can't see them . And if there is a list you don't make it easily accessible
3595,M Sch,"February 1, 2019",3, Star deducted for the amount of emails I get on a daily basis. Another star deducted for difficulty navigating to saved searches to stop previously mentioned emails from being sent. 50+ emails a day.
3596,Dave White,"September 18, 2018",4, I like the photos of the homes and notification of price reduction. Very easy to sort through the selection of houses.
3597,Sam Stafford,"October 17, 2018",1, This app just decides one day to stop showing houses and no matter how much tinkering I do I cant fix it. Happened to my friend too. Fix this problem!!
3598,Jerry Hanna,"November 24, 2018",5, Very helpful tool in so many ways. I love how you can narrow down exactly what your looking for. It saves you so much time. And we all know how important our time is.
3599,Novia Williamson,"October 18, 2018",4, I do enjoy the app however some times the properties that I do like when I contact them they were already gone so you guys need to check to make sure that the properties that you have are still available.
3600,Tamey Rearick,"October 12, 2018",4, Zillow is very user friendly and provide better detail about each property. Only thing I would criticize is that there are homes still listed that have actually been sold for years.
3601,A Google user,"January 12, 2019",5, app is very easy to use. the details of the property are useful. the area maps are detail and accurate. makes home buying fun even when you are just looking.
3602,Paula Cavoulas,"February 24, 2019",1, it is not pulling up any homes in areas that I know have listings. I have t used for a while and now when I try nothing. uninstalled and reinstalled but still no listings.
3603,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",3," I found it difficult to navigate. The programming had trouble separating listing, buying and renting initiatives of the user."
3604,Sheila Jane Jones,"March 30, 2019",5," All the information you would spend hours trying to gather is here, all in one place, at a click!

You can even evaluate the neighborhood, in a way , by the prices of nearby homes, satellite pictures, and even the view out the windows of the house! Zillow is a terrific resource for someone shopping outside their own area."
3605,Jill Loddo,"March 16, 2019",1, This app is so frustrating to deal with i had to uninstall it. It will not let you view your filtered results properly. You're better off using just the website.
3606,Rhea Ann Snow,"October 10, 2018",1, It keeps crashing every time I click on a home to view the details. I don't know how to fix it. It used to work right but now it doesn't. Super frustrating!!!
3607,Krista Wilkins,"November 17, 2018",4, I like the fact I get a chance to check out properties in different states. Personally I would like to move somewhere that I think I'd feel more safe. Zillow has allowed me to do that. Once my life is back on track I will be purchasing a apartment or condo through Zillow.
3608,WhoKnowsWhoIAm WhoKnowsWhoIam,"May 8, 2019",5, very easy to navigate. keeps you updated on new listings. was able to find a beautiful house to rent in my price range. very pleased.
3609,Alistair Baty,"June 1, 2019",4," Great app, but the interface could be more efficient. I wish they would put a layer button on the screen for quick access to switch on satellite or maps or boundaries etc."
3610,Maria Benincasa,"May 28, 2019",3, For the most part this is a pretty good app for finding properties. One downside is that even though I've set a max budget for a property Zillow keeps recommending properties above my budget sometimes.
3611,phirewood314,"June 13, 2019",3, Fairly easy to use. There is a problem with getting the most current info. If realtors want us to use this app they need to keep it current.
3612,Julie Burnette,"June 14, 2019",5, I abouslty love Zillow this app is up to date on the homes in my area that are for rent. I love how they list the most recent homes that came up for rent. Thank you for helping my family find the home that best fits our needs.
3613,Brianna Provence,"July 5, 2019",5, Zillow has always met my expectations. I like that you can search a whole state not just the city. You can also remove the boundary and look outside of the original search which is nice.
3614,Michael Nappa,"July 14, 2019",5, Fantastic app for a first time home buyer. You can really narrow down the results to perfectly suit your requirements and wishes. 6/5 Stars
3615,Susan Allen,"July 14, 2019",4, Good guidelines for narrowing in on possible properties for lease or sale. Wish the comps could show up too; to see where estimated value comes from. Condos are not comparable to single family homes. Keep making improvements.
3616,luis vazquez,"July 25, 2019",5, The Zillow app is easy to use and comprehend. I also like the fact that I can sent links of the house profiles directly through my phone message system. (with other apps I have to screenshot everything) I really like this app it's fast and reliable
3617,Nhimmy Nguyen,"September 7, 2019",3, Good app with good selections of properties. Need to see land lease info for all of the mobile house. Also lots of times apt management doesn't reply to info request message or when scheduling a tour for apt.
3618,Jimmy Pruitt,"September 14, 2019",1," Terrible app, can't delete it fast enough. I would highly reccomend Redfin 10 times over. Even worse, once you create an account, you can't unsubscribe to their random unwanted email blasts they constantly send. DO NOT install and create an account"
3619,Jim Fite,"September 26, 2019",5," Love this real estate app. The search feature is robust, and the ability to save favorite properties is a useful feature for comparison shopping. I can and have spent hours on this app."
3620,Perry Meador,"October 15, 2019",5, Its great easy to use. Like the location map with each property and the detailed descriptions of each property. Also all the pics of each property.
3621,Gloria Chacon,"October 24, 2019",2," The app would not let me log in with my Zillow account. It kept bouncing me back, to log in with my Google account. Sorry Zillow, you're not getting my permission. Also, Zillow website has more features than the app."
3622,James L Smoot,"November 13, 2019",4," Very informative, great help with planning to rent or purchase a home."
3623,Super Man,"December 6, 2019",5," Always an adventure looking for a new home on this app, very convenient and simple"
3624,jerdian smith,"February 3, 2020",5, Every easy to use
3625,Picasso Artsy-fartsy,"February 4, 2020",5, User friendly and educational
3626,Brian Truskey,"October 28, 2018",2, The app won't show most of the properties available. Comparing it to using Zillow on a web browser. Some sort of glitch I guess.
3627,Karin Norvell,"January 5, 2019",5," Gives me a good preview of houses and their prices a available in the areas I am looking. App responds well, pages load quickly and filters are good."
3628,Adrienne Reed,"March 2, 2019",2, This app is great except it's missing one major filter. There's no option to filter rentals that allow pets. I can't use this app at all because of this one issue.
3629,Susan Fowler,"January 21, 2019",5, Found one condo in Tucson over Zillow. Now starting a search for Daughter in KC. Love how its national. Great features. Starting to like the app better than website. Like the commute feature and ability to make my own tag lines.
3630,Mike Bojic,"May 10, 2019",3," Could definitely use some work.. I can't view messages from potential landlords because the email I receive cuts off the entire message and theres no place in the app to ""view messages"""
3631,Tj Kennedy,"May 1, 2019",2," not sure if anyone else is having this problem, but when I go to click on the ""more"" button to alter my search, it causes my phone to restart."

Also info of schools around ur area for children. also gives you all info of what the house has inside and out, just wished they put more pictures of the house and land instead of repeating the same ones 2 or 3 times other than that its a good app"
3633,Daniel Farnes,"March 13, 2019",5," Easy to use, great features and functionality. The only thing I would change is having a list style results finder as well as the map."
3634,FoolishFairy Photography,"May 11, 2019",3," fun and easy to look at houses anywhere. filters dont always seem to work, though. it shows me a lot of houses outside my filter range."
3635,Jasmine Hollerway,"May 22, 2019",5," App is great, but the listings need to come down once they are rented. There's got to be a way that issue can be alleviated."
3636,M.D. Smith,"December 17, 2018",5, Love this app 'cause it's comprehensive with every tool needed to engage in smart & thorough research and follow through regarding investing in real estate ( e.g. home ownership or wholesale real estate investing)!!! 💞🙂
3637,Stan M,"January 23, 2019",1, The app does not come close to displaying the same amount of houses that you find on your website. and yes the app is fully updated...
3638,Isaac Bishop Junior,"November 5, 2018",4," Good, but Zillow, in general, could be better. For instance, the ability to separate houses by 2+ story, or ranch."
3639,gail Lilley,"April 5, 2019",3, App works fine but I changed a price on a home I listed and it's not updated on Zillow. Alot of people use this app and its important that the pricing reflects what is entered into Bright MLS
3640,John Flanagan,"October 11, 2018",3, The app Cuts me off and closes. Also needs to be updated more often. I would also like to see more options as far as acreage goes like 15 and up or 20 acres and up.
3641,Cliff McAtee,"October 26, 2018",5, This app came along at just the right time and has provided exactly the right information that we have needed as we seek out a house. We highly recommend using this app!
3642,A Google user,"November 20, 2018",5, I really like the fact that they notify me when new homes become available on the market! And I can use it to view homes in other places too not just where I live!!!
3643,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",5, I like this app because it is making my search for a apartment very easy . I like the way I can contact the management and look at the places I like.
3644,Carlos Cotto,"April 13, 2019",5," Able to see price and what is available for rent, sale before I just click on area so helpful only issue it doesn't update at times not a big deal i just reset and check out homes."
3645,Edward Kdonian,"November 23, 2018",4, I feel that the was actually more useful in the older version of about 2-3 years ago as it provided the information in a much more usable manner.
3646,M Martinez,"November 7, 2018",5, I'm able to get information on properties in different areas. It is easy to use and it shows in the map the location of many properties that are availables.
3647,Jasmine Harris,"January 7, 2019",5," easy to use app, helpful in finding properties for sale. great search feature with excellent filters to narrow down your search to specific details."
3648,Sam Garfield,"June 9, 2019",4, Good app for starters. Values are based on area average sales price and can be misleading. Working with a Realtor is a good combination.
3649,Brayten Hawkinson,"May 28, 2019",4, great. just kind of inconsistent with photos. my girl and I were on the app at the same time and different pictures were only available for one of us. but an overall awesome app!
3650,Ellen Darst,"June 24, 2019",4," I think that app does a good job with house and property pictures. But the maps are sometimes just wrong. Wrong location, wrong address, and skewed lot lines. If I were the seller, I'd be upset by this."
3651,Phil L,"June 28, 2019",3," i used to be able to just click on the emails sent to me and view those properties click on them now and just directs me to random properties, hopefully a new update will fix this!"
3652,Briana Leu,"June 28, 2019",3, the new layout of the app is frustrating. You now have to scroll through everything instead of opening what little information you wanted. Where is the mortgage calculator???

3654,Cindy Busch,"June 29, 2019",4," very informative - would be helpful if we could delete the houses not in our price range, so we won't be seeing the same houses over and over again. just view the new houses that have come on the market"
3655,Rachel Gutierrez,"August 4, 2019",5," So easy to use, the walk through feature is nice. And when you want to tour a house contacting someone is fast and easy as well."
3656,Max,"August 11, 2019",1," The app does fine doing what i need to , by looking up home values. What i don't understand is why we need email to log in just to ""play around"". Ridiculous!"
3657,Alexander Guzman,"August 26, 2019",2," Works to look at new places, but notifications are terrible. It doesn't matter what filter you set in the app, you will get notified for something else. Waste of time to activate notifications for new properties in the market."
3658,Joel Pike,"August 28, 2019",1," App keeps changing and more difficult to use. I use satellite view often ,but now can't even find option to turn on. It use to be right on main few!"
3659,Devin Byrne,"September 2, 2019",3," I like the App but I keep getting notifications for ""new"" listings that aren't new and I can't flag houses I don't like so I can stop seeing them. The houses I don't like don't meet my needs or are ugly or are in a 55+ neighborhood."
3660,Jay Townsend,"September 12, 2019",5, Great app for finding houses for sale. Like the mortgage calculator and the price and tax history. Usually good pictures of the homes inside and out.
3661,Elsbeth Maidment,"September 26, 2019",2," Can't remove saved search... keep getting notifications about an area I searched over a year ago... no way to remove just that search, have to turn off all notifications. Now I can't keep the search i want to get notifications for :-("

Oh, but there are certainly many places all over the screen to ""contact"" Zillow in order to claim ownership, set the record straight, blah, blah. It didn't used to be like this; methinks Zillow is trotting out this ploy in order to infiltrate people's privacy even more."
3664,Erin Stringfellow,"September 28, 2019",2," Missing key features that are available on the web version, such as walkability scores and an estimated commute time. Without those, the app is useless. Will be uninstalling."
3665,Kelly Byrd,"October 17, 2019",5, I love how you can look at different houses interiors and exteriors !!! Also you get more details on the house and can see how the houses pricing is fluctuating!!!
3666,Mauricio Flores,"October 28, 2019",5, It's really easy to use and you have right on your hands all the updated information you need to inform yourself about properties in the area you are looking in. And the notification are really useful!

3675,Janet Leonard,"March 7, 2019",1," Every time I enter a different City and State in the search bar, it only shows me my neighborhood. This has been happening ever since I gave Zillow allowance to my location. now it can only show the houses for sale in my location. How do I undo that approval?"

3678,Margaret Milburn,"November 26, 2018",5," I absolutely love Zillow. Even though we're not ready to purchase another home yet, I use the app to see what's available for what prices in different parts of the country."
3679,A Google user,"November 8, 2018",1, The app keeps telling me that I have no network connection? Even when I'm able to access many other apps on my Android simultaneously. Disappointing.

3681,A Google user,"February 21, 2019",5," I have always had a great experience with Zillow. Best home buying app since Trulia NEVER EVER works and Remax is too busy. Love Zillows layout of the homes information, stats and photos."
3682,A Google user,"February 1, 2019",3, I've been using this app for awhile. I don't know if listing are updated regularly. I have seen some places I've searched still in lists that are already rented or sold.

3684,Philip Bertenthal,"October 22, 2018",2, Very difficult to navigate. Couldn't find how to delete a search and not all homes showed up on search. I like the Zillow website. This app not so much.
3685,Caliope,"May 7, 2019",1, Hard to use. Difficult to narrow down a search. Tried several times to locate rentals and it still shows no rentals in my area on my app. When I look up rentals on my PC the rental show up. Do not download this app.
3686,Jack Bears,"May 13, 2019",2, very difficult to navigate. shows homes outside filters. Now just shows satellite photos and says zoom in to see houses. Have used app in past without problem.

3696,Forrest Deetz,"September 13, 2018",4, Like the app a lot and its very helpful but they got rid of the hide button so have to do a lot more weeding every time I go one. I should be able to dismiss a property if I have no interest.

3699,Reginald Paschal,"November 15, 2018",5, The Zillow app is better than we thought. The pictures for each home is just like on a PC. So we would recommend this app
3700,Kayla Davis,"November 30, 2018",3," I liked it better when we could search "" off market"" and "" make me move"" homes. Now we are forced to look only at the most expensive it seems."
3701,Frank Wais,"March 10, 2019",4," Great except there's no way to delete the local homes that keep popping up, I don't want to see local homes, I'm trying to get out of state and they just keep popping up homes for local area."

3703,Robert K,"December 13, 2018",1, Zillow doesn't need access to everything on my phone to do simple home searches So I'm deleting it. I don't care why they think they need access to my contacts or SD card they aren't getting it.
3704,Beez are coming,"November 20, 2018",5, I love it! Its easy to use and you can find houses for sale or rent and aparments at prices that fit you! 10/10 recommend to move anywhere especially if you're out to leave tahlequah oklahoma
3705,Bobby De Leon,"October 9, 2018",5, The different options for information gathering is great. I enjoy the constant updates emailed to keep me updated on houses for sale.
3706,Aleksander Underwood,"May 16, 2019",4, Homes for sale are disappearing. In an area with hundreds of homes for sale it is telling me there are zero. This is after removing all filters.
3707,Eric W,"October 3, 2018",4," Good app. Can be slow to load individual houses to look at, but definitely not bad enough to stop using it."
3708,A Google user,"October 26, 2018",3, Keeps crashing. I've been using Samsung phones for several years and the Zillow app always freezes and takes me back to my phone apps screen. Odd.
3709,Chad Laucher,"May 2, 2019",5, Love the personal emails that are based on past searches. The app is user-friendly and makes researching homes quick on your phone.
3710,Robert Gerlach,"January 1, 2019",2," The app is fine except it comes with all of the annoyances that come with a bad realtor. Buying a home is already stressful enough, I don't need my phone making it worse."
3711,Elena Torbenko,"November 23, 2018",5, I am using it all the time as a great tool to compare houses. To see market and much more... It's a great easy to use tool!
3712,Susan Schmitz,"June 5, 2019",4," Planning on moving to a different state in the near future. Zillow is a great app to give me insight to what's available in different areas. I especially like the ""draw"" tool to narrow down to specific areas."
3713,Jim Bob,"June 8, 2019",5, easy to use. I can find the information I want very quickly. I like the quick preview option this available from the map view.
3714,Andrew Billy,"June 14, 2019",3," it'd be better if you could hide auction properties. where and ghr price range we're looking, that's about all we can find and have zero interest in auction property"
3715,Lyn Locke,"June 21, 2019",1," The only way I can see new listings is through emails now because my saved search will only show the same 8 or 10 ""Recently Changed"". If I switch to any other category, all the properties disappear."
3716,FireyRayne,"June 22, 2019",5," The app is really good and I love it! If I were to give a suggestion it would be to look up houses by like what kind of houses they are (Modern, Bungalow, etc.)"
3717,David Rollins,"June 24, 2019",4," Great app, EZ to use and provides a wealth of information. I just wish it could somehow incorporate overall condition relative to both the interior and exterior."
3718,david melton,"June 25, 2019",1," App doesn't work well. If you sort by high to low, you get 2 properties- the high and the low. Similar results on other sorts."
3719,Robin Helfers,"July 30, 2019",3, Not convenient. Makes you navigate back and forth between dots on a map and details of each house that fits your search criteria.
3720,Yaly Vidal,"August 21, 2019",5, Great app for finding homes! I have used it twice now in the home buying process and it has been very useful. It has the latest info and plenty of extras to help you truly see the area and consider whether a home is right for you.
3721,Leo Zoucha,"August 24, 2019",4, What I like the most is that you just zoom into an area you are lookong at and all the listings are just there and come up quickly when you press on a property. Enough details on the listings to see if yoy are interested or not.
3722,P 3,"August 21, 2019",3, I like the app but when you find an area and your going through the pictures when you think you like one and stop to look when you exit that listing it totally closes you out of that row of listings then you've got to start over !☹️
3723,Vickie,"August 29, 2019",2," The pet search criteria needs to be modified. You need a separate selection for dogs and cats. I waste alot of time looking through postings that don't take dogs, but do take cats. Even Craigslist offers this option."
3724,Lorri Brooks,"September 8, 2019",5," Great app with lots of details on buying a house. Location, street veiw, financing available and how much your mortgage would be with a certain down payment."
3725,Ze Bunster,"September 7, 2019",1," Keep getting unwanted emails, can't unsubscribe. I click unsubscribe on the email nothing happens. I go to help, it directs me to the email or an option that doesn't exist in the app. Pain in the butt."
3726,Jan Daloz,"September 8, 2019",3," Sometimes inaccurate or out of date. The estimates dont often accurately seem to represent costs or value, and some listings arent current, but generally easy to navigate and check out places"
3727,J ___,"September 10, 2019",1, I never give out my real phone number...yet a recent Zillow update allowed Zillow to STEAL my phone number (because the update didn't tell me they were going to get my number) then Zillow started MASS SPAMMING my phone!

BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE. I use a prepaid emergency phone through WIFI to access the Zillow app. One or two people have my phone number only - until I started receiving MASS SPAM CALLERS out of the blue - googled their numbers - and theyre Real Estate Agents for Zillow. UNINSTALL NOW
3728,Javier Munoz,"September 21, 2019",1, Used to have the compass button to show you your exact location. It's gone after this update and it makes it difficult to 1uickly see the houses around you. I'll change my rating once it comes back
3729,Sean Fordyce,"October 2, 2019",2, Web app is better. The mobile app keeps sending notifications for homes that don't match my saved search criteria. Only one out of seven fit the criteria. It feels like spam 🙄
3730,jerry conner,"October 4, 2019",3," Useful, and good UI. Uninstalled it because kept giving push notifications about areas I wasn't interested in anymore and couldn't figure out how to make it stop without stopping notifications for areas that I was interested in."
3731,Alexis Rivera,"December 23, 2019",5, Great app to find homes
3732,Tim Wheeler,"December 23, 2019",1, Junk app. Using the website is better

3734,JC Sanchez,"March 14, 2020",5, I love it easy to use!!!!
3735,Faith Beasley,"May 1, 2019",4, solid app overall just wish there was a way to filter pet friendly to large dogs. it can be a bit disheartening to see a pet friendly place then find out its cats only.
3736,A Google user,"November 18, 2018",5, Hard for me to go back to view more properties without having to close what I am looking at ... But overall I enjoy your application
3737,Edward May,"November 26, 2018",4, Zillow is a great app for research on real estate. The format is easy to understand and the filters let you search for specific property that interest you.
3738,Laura Casper,"February 5, 2019",5," I use Zillow regularly and find it to be easy to use and very helpful. Any time I need to know something about a property, Zillow is my go to app."

3742,Gary Gaskins,"September 24, 2018",5, Love using this app. My go to for references on properties. I use it everyday until we find what we want.
3743,Tate Shepherd,"January 14, 2019",4," My one complaint would be a feature of the UI, or maybe its my phone. But it seems to close the window all time because of something im pushing or swiping. Sure. on an LG G7"
3744,Haydn Brathwaite,"April 4, 2019",4," Good site, needs to be updated regularly. I went to a house that had tenants and was not for sale, but listed."
3745,Johnson,"April 24, 2019",1, why does the app still have such few filter features? and no the keyword feature is not a proper replacement. web version FINALLY got fixed. can actually hit the button for pets.
3746,Roberto Tyson,"October 16, 2018",5," The Zillow app is a great tool, it saves a lot of time, and foot work, better able to pinpoint, and assess your potential,prospective property."
3747,frankie,"March 29, 2019",4," love the site but it would be great if they would label the rooms, sometimes im not sure what room im looking at. (something zillow should consider) 5 stars if they did that"
3748,Angela Spinks,"October 28, 2018",5," I have a home that I lived in for 15 years, but I want to upgraded....move to a different area now that i am older and my son has moved out and started his own family. I love the homes you have on your site. Just waiting for the right one to come my way."
3749,Remedies of War,"November 23, 2018",5, I'm just a fan of this app. Let's me and my wife looking at homes for sale from the comfort of our living room and offers a wide variety of tools like mortgage estimates and house history.

3751,Susan Lonigan,"May 7, 2019",5, I enjoy browsing to see what's available and to judge the market. The app seems very comprehensive. Great aide!!
3752,Sarah Jo Harrison,"October 24, 2018",3," Really helpful app but wish it had better ways or any way to dislike houses or mark what you don't like, just like there's tools for what you do like and favorite houses."
3753,kat bee,"September 26, 2018",4," Love this app, just wish I could plug in exactly what I'm looking for and receive alerts based on my criteria."
3754,Kristi Lenzen,"May 18, 2019",2," app not working, i can only see a few houses in my entire search area and i know that isnt correct. was working fine earlier this week."
3755,Caroline,"November 1, 2018",3, Its ok. Seems like I put in certain houses to look for and then weeks later I am getting notifications with filters set that I never put in. Too many notifications and prices don't contain everything such as HOA fees.
3756,KarmenSense,"January 24, 2019",5, It's great. you can save homes with notes and also save your search types so you don't have to keep setting your filter parameters with each use.

3760,A Google user,"January 26, 2019",1," will not pull up any thing. even houses that I type in their address that I have saved prior to my favorites. I uninstalled and reinstalled, still doesn't work. deleted it for good."
3761,Donna Hagerty,"October 1, 2018",5, Used Zillow to drive by homes prior to arranging appointments with my realtor. This was very helpful in mountainous region in NC. I could eliminate alot of properties do to difficult landscape or noise level when near a roadway.

3766,Samantha Mansell,"December 14, 2018",4, I like this app a lot it is very helpful to find what I am trying to look for. However I find that when I put my price range in I will still be shown places that are outside of my price range.
3767,Jennifer Big Red,"March 5, 2019",5, it's easy to use and easier to find homes you want to buy or perhaps get some ideas on how to fix your home to sell it. very good site to use and app.
3768,Wes Wolfram,"January 30, 2019",3, Overall it's okay. I've found it to be very slow and it definitely doesn't show all the listings that are for sale when I compare to the website from my laptop.
3769,A Google user,"January 9, 2019",5, I enjoy using Zillow. It has many options to search for exactly what you want. I love that I can search by city or draw my own search area.
3770,Denise Hinds,"June 8, 2019",5, Love the setup. It's easy to search different areas. In most cases you have an idea about the cost of operating home on a monthly basis.
3771,James Tyler,"June 1, 2019",5," great app all around! simple and easy to use, and most of all its a fun way to find the propertie/properties that best suits your needs"
3772,H K,"June 7, 2019",3, It's decent. The zoom function is a little buggy on the map. It also would be nice to filter by whether or not rentals have a kitchen.
3773,Garrett B,"May 29, 2019",3," It doesn't always show listings you're searching for, you'll have to zoom in and out on the map and random places will pop up where it didn't previously show anything."
3774,Eli Oshinsky,"June 9, 2019",1," The website works great, shows all the listings in my area. according to the app there is one house for sale within 3 miles of my house. Just use the website, it would even better if they made it as a PWA."

Our realtor told us that Zillow does this all the time. Drove by hoping he was wrong, NOPE! Zillow put the house up for sale yesterday, for sale by owner. It was foreclosed on by the bank MONTHS ago, and isnt for sale. This isnt the first time."
3777,Shalana Bryant,"June 16, 2019",5, Great access to homes for sale and information about homes. Easy ability to share the information with others as well. More homes than on other real estate sites or apps.

3779,Numbed Feelings,"July 9, 2019",5, The app helps me find a home/apartment a lot quicker then looking on the Facebook market or eBay or other sites there's no random pop up adds there no fees for being on the site and they never invade your privacy very outstanding app.
3780,Miranda Durbin,"July 27, 2019",2, Filters don't work to remove auctions. Hide feature no longer supported...that was seriously the BEST Zillow feature because you could weed out everything you weren't interested in. Removing it was a mistake.
3781,S Washington,"July 11, 2019",1," When i click on a link from email, it nolonger opens up the property for which I clicked on. I'm displayed a list of properties instead. Was working fine a few days ago."
3782,Kory Johnson,"July 12, 2019",4," Great app but properties I have already viewed show up as unviewed until I move the map and it refreshes, then again they become unviewed again. lots of messing around moving the map to see new properties."
3783,Steve Rominger,"August 3, 2019",4," Fairly easy to navigate and accurate listing's most of the time. The notifications are a nice feature, however, take the not always appreciated liberty of extending outside a desired area."
3784,Frank Power,"September 8, 2019",3," Not sure if its the app or just the realtors but in searching for Waterfront many listings come up that are not truly waterfront, maybe one or two blocks away. Wastes a lot of time."
3785,Kai McConnell,"September 15, 2019",3," Zillow is mostly great - its easy to use and relatively intuitive. However, Zillow isnt very up to date and often lists homes with the incorrect status (i.e. a home says for sale but really its pending)."
3786,Irene B,"September 21, 2019",3," 1 big complaint is it doesnt interface well with MLS, delay in uploading data, inaccurate and not up to date listings. Easy for visitor, not easy for sellers"
3787,Meeghan Miller,"September 18, 2019",3," The recent update makes the map a lot harder to view. I also would love a crime map option, so I don't have to jump back and forth from zillow and tulia."
3788,Vision TheWolf,"October 25, 2019",4," i would give it only 4.5 stars. i think its an amazing app and it really does find what im looking for, but i feel like the searches are too wide and doesnt give me a specific type of house im looking for. But, i do love this app!"

3839,Devin Smith,"June 30, 2019",1," App shows no results. Even after downloading and reinstalling. I live in the hottest Real Estate market in the US currently, I find it extremely unlikely that there are no listings."
3840,SticksFoot5,"July 1, 2019",3, I would like to see a bigger emphasis on garage/workshop/outbuilding space. Plenty of people have toys that they need to store or work on.
3841,Matthew Peairs,"July 7, 2019",1," use to show me houses now nothing pops up. I thought maybe if I uninstall it and reinstall it, it would fix the problem and it's still doing the same thing."
3842,Heather Kiernan,"July 15, 2019",4, I like Zillow it's easy to navigate and save homes I am interested in plus the zestimate feature and information about the neighborhood is nice to have. I just wish the waterfront properties had the water depth noted.
3843,Roxanne Westmoreland,"July 24, 2019",1," The app is far more difficult to peruse once downloaded. Zillow is more concerned with getting a user's private email information i.e. location, etc. I recommend using Trulia or Redfin."
3844,Jerry Thompson,"September 8, 2019",5," Fantastic app, this is a great way to easily see what's available in the real estate market, that is how I found my current home, now I'm looking for investments"
3845,Jenna Winthrop,"August 2, 2019",1," This used to be good. Recently it is not showing all the homes available. When I use the website with my desktop, more are available. Not accurate."
3846,PunnyMemes 101,"August 2, 2019",5, Makes finding houses super easy! Also it makes getting in contact with the seller very easy as well! All in all it's a really helpful app.
3847,Josh Gross,"August 10, 2019",5," I love Zillow, it's like if i were to make an app that i thought would be perfect to search and buy homes this would be it. By far the best. do yourself a favor and use Zillow for searching for property, you went regret it!"
3848,Jonny Dingo,"August 4, 2019",5," Zillow is great, would like the zoom feature on the lot line setting though, to let me get a better picture of where the property is. Overall a great app!! Thanks!"
3849,Brad Vandiviere,"August 19, 2019",2," Can't trust this app... It continually shows wrong locations when I select a pin, even after updating. Stopped using about a year ago because of this... Came back and it's still happening."
3850,Cindy Arington,"September 7, 2019",4," Love all the filters, pictures and maps. Gives you a complete picture of the property you're looking at. I havent figured out a way to get alerts on my preferred search though."
3851,Elayne Harrison,"September 9, 2019",5," I love this site, it's so easy to house shop on Zillow rather then driving from house to house. I can look at every room and get a real feel of each home, very clear photos."
3852,L Ross,"September 10, 2019",4, Notifications are excellent. Ease of use 4 stars. Sometimes my husband gets slightly different results. Still trying to figure out how.
3853,Nancy Hatlestad,"September 11, 2019",3, It's a great way to see houses but the way you figured zestimates is not correct if you don't know the area and the tax rate those figures hurt the chances of selling for the price that needs to B. A zestimate should be figured on price per square foot and where these homes are located
3854,Georgann Fennell,"September 21, 2019",1," This app used to work great, but lately it hasn't been working at all. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it just shows maps instead of going to the property clicked on."
3855,Eric Rosen,"November 1, 2019",1, App intermittently deleted content without cause or explanation. Heading to another app.
3856,Jesus Romero,"December 1, 2019",5, It's a very helpful and easy to manage page.!!!
3857,Pamela Poulos,"December 19, 2019",2, Sends usless notifications about stuff I don't ask to be notified about.
3858,Mackie mack,"January 14, 2020",4, The draw feature really makes it easy when you are a location shopper like me.
3859,D L,"January 16, 2020",1, Contains Push Ads
3860,Janet Reeves,"May 1, 2019",5, Easy to navigate! I've come to come looking at the properties! works well. i have a little trouble undoing a particular search. i hope to figure that out
3861,Carlos Garcia,"March 20, 2019",4," Easy to access the properties you are looking for. Despite filters, some unwanted properties still come through, but no big deal."
3862,Maranda,"September 26, 2018",4," This app can be a little glitchy on my Samsung Tablet. Other than that, it works great for searching homes."
3863,S Maxx Mahaffey,"October 17, 2018",5," The search feature (by state, county, or address), comparables, tax and sales data, Zestimate, are the reasons why Zillow is my go to app to find residential real estate"
3864,A Google user,"February 27, 2019",5, Zillow is so easy to use. I appreciate the smooth experience of searching for a house and having the data and pictures at my fingertips. Thank you!
3865,t chab,"May 3, 2019",5, I love the exposure this gives the real estate. Have found a new home and new buyer with this app. Most current houses on-the-market are posted here.
3866,A Google user,"March 13, 2019",2," Doesn't list my house that I bought over a year ago (public record), so not useful to me. My house shows up in apps by the competition."
3867,A Google user,"September 26, 2018",5, I love that I can expand the pictures so easily so I can see the small detail of the home. Just great!!
3868,Claudia Nugent,"April 27, 2019",5," Best real estate app out there. Easy to browse. I'm in Little Rock, and moving to Seattle in a month. This app helped me to find a house in Seattle. I totally recommend it."
3869,Bess Brown,"April 30, 2019",5, when i first starting it showed pic and prices which eas great. now they have made it diffacult. so i dont ise it as much. i am looking for a home. please put prices back on map of area it makes it alot simpler. thankyou.
3870,K Truong,"November 30, 2018",5, Very useful app to monitor local real estate activities. It also keeps track and send of an update all of properties of my interest.
3871,Andrew Rutherford,"February 26, 2019",4, Love it. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because they can make the filtering options easier to navigate and use. Right now it just doesn't feel right...
3872,Eddie Gonzales,"March 26, 2019",5, Very nice application. Easy to use. My listing was posted the next day I listed. Thank you.
3873,A Google user,"January 5, 2019",2," It keeps adding ""for rent"" to my saved searches even though I'm not selecting that as an option. Also, I'm very annoyed that I can't hide homes I'm not interested in."
3874,Mary Johnson,"January 26, 2019",4, The app is easy to use and has more info than other reatly sites but I've found that the lot lines are typically inaccurate or not tagged with the property at all.
3875,A Google user,"March 19, 2019",5, A definite answer to rental searching headaches. This app is helping so much that I haven't had a headache since I've been using it for my search. Thanks Zillow!
3876,Tanner Curtiss,"January 29, 2019",1," App repeatedly tells me I have no network connection regardless of the fact that it's wrong. Doesn't work on mobile service, my wifi, or through a VPN. I guess the app is just junk now."
3877,A Google user,"March 25, 2019",3, Crashes often. Please add location tracking while in saved/mapping. It would be convenient to know where one is in proximity to saved homes while out for the day looking at homes.
3878,Emily Sullivan,"April 14, 2019",1," I really liked this app until they ""updated"" it about a month ago. Now it doesnt load any homes so I cant look at any. Junk."
3879,jeff monteforte,"January 4, 2019",5, Very user friendly! intuitive and provides the critical data ypu need to make initial decisions on the most important purchase in your life!
3880,A Google user,"October 28, 2018",1," On wifi, yes thats working but still says check network connection and cannot do a thing. Tried other networks and without wifi same thing. Also tried reinstalling nothing!"
3881,Ryan D,"May 25, 2019",1," Zillow USED to be a great app, but an update within the last month or so ruined it. Please go back to the way it was and quit messing with it. As it is now, hardly worth using."
3882,Mark Avallone,"December 17, 2018",5," Very useful application, check it regularly. Custom search geographies are very useful for keeping an eye on local markets."
3883,Kevin Morgan,"September 22, 2018",4," Great app. Just wish it allowed me to type in a dollar amount to search for rather than use a slider, but that's a small gripe"
3884,Raychelle Irby,"February 2, 2019",5, Every since I have been looking to purchase a home. I have always been drawn to the Zillow home site. Its always been helpful in my home search.
3885,realimbored668,"November 6, 2018",5," Zillow is a nearly perfect app, I say nearly because sometimes the list mode for viewing houses in a smaller ish city like Newport KY can be retarded and only show 1 or 2 houses until you tap a category like most popular or least expensive"
3886,Levita Goodwin,"February 1, 2019",5, Great experience searching for homes to rent or buy. I love the information provided. It's more complete than other places I've seen online.
3887,Thomas Yakubik,"May 1, 2019",3, it lags alot when dragging to new area. it also doesnt seem to update areas often. there are always more houses on the website than the app.
3888,lazy tigerz,"May 13, 2019",3, Took awhile to get used to the new app layout. Enjoying it. One problem is that all properties are not showing up on Zillow that are showing up on other apps.
3889,Issei Kohama,"March 16, 2019",5," very smooth and quick! very convenient. Although search results only go to 75, still a very good app for looking at real estate."
3890,Tony Garcia,"January 2, 2019",5," Great app, I'm able to see a virtual tour inside and out of the homes and properties, and very informative as well."
3891,Jason Alexander,"March 1, 2019",1, Well I mean everytime I moved the map it had to reload or it clicked on something. When I tried to click on a house for rent the calibrations were totally off. Clicked on a place that was not close to my finger tip
3892,Margaret West-Savage,"April 14, 2019",5," I love zillow! I found my current home in it. Love the details on the site. And, the photos are so good."
3893,Marv,"June 8, 2019",1," Other versions allow user to select home options, but this one makes you type in KEYWORDS and they don't filter the results successfully. Contacted Zillow and their answers are unhelpful general BS."
3894,Christos Katsiyiannis,"June 12, 2019",1," This app lacks a fully customizable price search. It makes looking for budget properties atrocious. I mean, c'mon, your website has this feature, your app should too."
3895,Debra Fornek,"June 26, 2019",5," We are looking in many different areas to retire. Zillow is a wonderful place for us to start. Zillow gives detailed information on each home we look at, we love this app."
3896,Jeff Kasper,"July 14, 2019",5," A great app with little to no issues when i use it, the only big problems I have are with some of the postings that people put up."
3897,Patrick Feathers,"July 24, 2019",1, I have used this app for years listing my rental properties. I recently tried to upload photos and now they only allow Apple/IOS devices to upload photos. Really!? Fix it so my Android will work please!
3898,Brandy Ziemann,"July 30, 2019",3," Great searches, but it really needs a way to mark properties as a NO. Tired of looking over listings, and seeing the same ones and trying to rem which ones were No's because of various reasons."
3899,Juliette Cadet,"July 10, 2019",5, great drawing tool for specific areas and filters for low HOA fees. Live that im able to tag homes with specifics. i only wish i could make my own categories to save homes under
3900,Tom Duplissis,"July 21, 2019",2," information on rentals was not updated and a comically slow response by one realtor to when I might be able to see a property. Local newspapers and pennysaver classified were more reliable and up to date, just no pictures."
3901,Michael Fogarty,"July 11, 2019",2, I don't understand why you can't upload photos on Android through the app. I shouldn't have to do it through the Chrome browser on my phone. It's frustrating that functions that are on iPhone aren't included in the Android app.
3902,Tom White,"August 28, 2019",1," The website is great, but the app is just horrible. I can't view the houses in my saved searches no matter what I do, meaning I can't show my family or real estate agent. So annoying."
3903,Fredrick Crandall,"September 2, 2019",5," Love this app, I can search for any home at any price. Was looking for something newer as my mom has cancer and can't get up stairs."
3904,barbara hanson,"September 9, 2019",2," I have had to reset my password three times since yesterday with three different passwords and Zillow has rejected each one. I followed the password reset directions explicitly, it wasn't hard but I'm just wasting time now."
3905,Misty Waterfalls,"September 27, 2019",5, Website is easy to navigate. I love that you can put in specific parameters and then scroll in and out of the map fuction. Makes finding suitable properties enjoyable.
3906,T C,"October 14, 2019",1, The app is great except for the minor detail of it not showing any homes for rent that have an undisclosed address. I have to keep this app uninstalled so that I can use Zillow in the browser.
3907,Nancy Geer,"November 4, 2019",5," Great app, keeps me informed of all new listings!!!"
3908,Brittany Jackson,"November 5, 2019",5, Great app. Makes house hunting a little easier.
3909,Ricardo Brown,"November 13, 2019",5, Always loved using the app. It's very helpful in searching for a nice place to live.
3910,Alexander Secor,"November 16, 2019",5, I love getting market updates and see new listings as they are added.
3911,Kelly Price,"January 23, 2020",5, Great tool for finding your dream home
3912,Dave Kotowski,"April 13, 2020",5, So much fun to surf homes for sale
3913,Taylor Etzwiler,"April 19, 2019",5, I love that I can put tags on why I like a property! There are often so many to look at that I forget why I liked or disliked one. Great app!
3914,Estelle D,"February 24, 2019",3, what happened to list of homes. used to be able to look through a list. now I have to click on each on the map. very frustrating.
3915,Melissa M,"April 18, 2019",1," It doesn't have even half of the houses for sale that I have seen elsewhere. Twice when I went to save the search area, it caused my phone to shutdown. Deleting."
3916,Bo Kim,"February 23, 2019",1," zillow show houses for sale on my wife's phone but not on my phone. deleted and reinstalled but the same result. also, it showed not for sale on the map but after finding address on fmls and searching on zillow, then it shows up as for sales. is zillow trying to hide some houses???"
3917,J-Gnome at Home,"May 12, 2019",2, worked great at first and suddenly stopped showing homes for sale. realtor app shows the same homes buy also works. not sure why Zillow suddenly stopped showing anything.
3918,Clareena D Edwards,"April 12, 2019",5," I had Zillow on my last phone and someone stole my phone....We love this app. It lets us know exactly what we want and plenty of locations and homes to rent and buy according to our needs with price, rooms, yards and much more..then leads us through the rental agency or seller and mortgage Informati...Full ReviewI had Zillow on my last phone and someone stole my phone....We love this app. It lets us know exactly what we want and plenty of locations and homes to rent and buy according to our needs with price, rooms, yards and much more..then leads us through the rental agency or seller and mortgage Information...best app yet.... thanks 😊🤗 ZILLOW."
3919,Majid Lakhani,"December 27, 2018",3," good reference. but when I save a search, no way to update parameters. also, saved mobile searches on a laptop dont match up on criteria either (2 bed). annoying having to redo all my saved searches. what's the point?"
3920,A. Buycks,"January 6, 2019",4," It is helpful to see whats out there. Some details sound kind of sketchy but, i like the way the app is set up."
3921,Dan Starkweather,"February 20, 2019",3," Good app! I just wish there was a way to put DO NOT SHOW AGAIN on some homes. Also, many lots are listed WAY more than they actually are."
3922,A Google user,"October 9, 2018",5, Loved the Zillow App. It made my move that much easier! Being able to look at multiple houses from different property managements!
3923,M1A2 Gunner,"April 17, 2019",5, Easier than I honestly thought it would be and has a good number of pictures for each property to include satellite and map location.
3924,A Google user,"February 6, 2019",5, it's a good app. good info. and directions. then I can drive by to see if I like the location. the inside pictures helps also...
3925,A Google user,"October 10, 2018",5, I love the selection and the site. Just wish you had more pet friendly places in my area. Over all I hope to rent one of those beautiful homes you have listed
3926,He He Hicks,"January 12, 2019",4," It's a good app, but I wish that I can add more to the ""keywords"" section to make my search even more specific. Other than that it's fine."
3927,Антон Пашко,"April 8, 2019",5," Awesome app. Needs a few more filters to be absolutely amazing, but it does what it should."
3928,Edward Winters,"April 25, 2019",5," Great to be able to look at lots without involvement of agents, Untill I decide what I want and can afford to buy."
3929,John Castillo,"May 17, 2019",5," Very useful, as well as helpful, in helping me find an apartment. Much easier than a simple web search."
3930,Jim Duzan,"October 7, 2018",3, Seems to filter results for no reason. With all filters set to default or cleared. Mine shows far fewer results than my wife standung next to me with her zillow open
3931,C Stinn,"April 2, 2019",2," Even when I change the settings, draw, and save, this app gives me everything outside the setting I want. I want Lexington, KY within the city however, I get Georgetown, Nicholasville, Paris, everything outside of Lexington and nothing inside. Very frustrating."
3932,A Google user,"November 2, 2018",5," View homes on this app is almost as exciting as viewing homes in person - you can actually see more in app, de things I've learned to look for and ask about came from viewing the app. Thank You"
3933,James Campbell,"April 21, 2019",2, Very slow unusable on my phone. First app I had to uninstall due to it being so laggy and slow. It is unusable on a Samsung Galaxy Express Prime.
3934,Joel Smith,"October 20, 2018",5," Great interface, easy to use and really like the additional info about each property."
3935,Jay Bfield,"September 26, 2018",2, When they got rid of ability to hide houses you no longer want to see caused a big waste of time. Not sure why they would remove this feature it was very useful to prevent notifications on places that you uavld no interest in.
3936,Candy Kendrick's,"February 23, 2019",4, it's nice it works good! I don't have any problems with it I've been to 14 different places that this App tracked its really good
3937,Alisa Banuelos,"May 18, 2019",5," convenient, easy to navigate, alot of info on the houses so it makes it easier to find exactly what you are looking for."
3938,Antwoine Brown,"December 29, 2018",4, Great App. It helped me find my dream home! Shows great and large pictures. Easy and fun to use!
3939,Marcel Young,"February 23, 2019",4, The app works really well. The desktop version is just as great but if you're looking for a house quickly the app is the best way to go.
3940,Joe Koskey,"March 17, 2019",4, good all around app. zestimates are always a little high though and available properties don't appear to update as frequently as other sites.
3941,Carmela Tayag,"October 24, 2018",4," Very informative. Gives me the map locations, photos, description, prices and notifications of status is great."
3942,DIANA Gomez,"January 13, 2019",5, great app for house hunting. alot of detail even for houses that are not for sale. im on it all the time.
3943,Alberto De La Mora,"May 8, 2019",5," Very detailed in the searches. Very fast updates. I really like the saved search updates, when properties you are looking at are either still available or pending sales or, sold."
3944,Lucas Witte,"December 12, 2018",2, The saved searches never work and then they just send you a ton of emails of houses out of your price range. It's really annoying. They also don't show as many houses as they do on the computer.
3945,Jennie Godfrey,"November 12, 2018",5, Zillow has helped me buy a number of homes. I can sit and watch all of the listings going up and selling in certain areas so I know when is a good time to buy and a good time to sell. Love it!
3946,Lovely Alice,"June 18, 2019",3," it's a good app but a ""multi-family"" home search option in the search refine should be added so it can be easier to find a multi-family home. Please add!"
3947,A Google user,"December 26, 2018",5, Helpful This app is so helpful I can find houses in my price range. and see houses that fit the criteria that me and my family love. definitely download this app or you can search houses online.!!!
3948,Katherine Martin,"November 12, 2018",3, It's an okay app. Needs the feature of showing you who you already tried contacting and when. I do really like being able to choose why I like a certain location.
3949,A Google user,"October 24, 2018",5," Easy to use, just right amount of info. Needed. Lots of updates. Some scam problems though."
3950,maureen obrien,"May 26, 2019",1, when you click on a house that has been emailed either as a price drop etc. it automatically goes to the map/list and not to the home in question. Zillow works better WITHOUT the app.
3951,Marina Pontes,"March 20, 2019",1, this app does not work. theres some sort of bug going on. i have cleared all filters and still no houses show in the continental US. app installed twice. Pixel 4XL on apps latest version. please fix
3952,Bryant Anderson,"December 8, 2018",3, Decent app. Lags a bit here and there. The app lacks the ability to cast from mobile devices and that makes this a 3 Star rating.
3953,Brad Rust,"March 7, 2019",4, Well structured app for for finding and descriptions of properties on the market. Very pleased with it's search capabilities.
3954,Yusuf Ahmed,"May 31, 2019",5," Easy to use, gives me notifications for price drops on houses in different places (close-ish proximity to what I was searching)."
3955,Brittney Lewis,"June 6, 2019",3, I love this app but I've stopped using it lately because its not updating or showing new houses. if i go to the website there are way more listed than on here.
3956,Dustin Thomas,"June 10, 2019",4," i believe it is a tad late on some houses going on and off market, but it is a nice tool to use while searching. Easier to coordinate than HAR, but less information."
3957,el tragon TAQUERIA,"June 11, 2019",5," THE BEST housing app, PERIOD! You cant even compare it to the others. I rented my condo and everything was so easy and explanatory."
3958,Hannah Acheson,"June 26, 2019",4," Suggested features: an option to ""hide"" listings not of interest; an option to filter out commercial properties; recommendations tailored to saved search terms."
3959,Pamela Rowley,"June 27, 2019",3, sometimes the descriptions do not match the photos at all. i.e. lake front property with a satelite view of nothing but trees(?). odd.
3960,Vinay Sharma,"July 29, 2019",1, get a lot of useless notifications. i still have not been able to modify my searches to where I can stop receiving listings for cities that I am no longer interested in looking for property.
3961,Andrea T. Dawson,"July 29, 2019",5, Most of the time homes shown for sale have an accurate price and the information is up to date. I've gotten so comfortable with Zillow. I don't look for houses anywhere else.
3962,Spock Conyers,"August 17, 2019",2, Satellite view is nowhere to be found on my current up-to-date version. Not on the map (zoomed in or out) and not in the MORE options. Makes it useless in this state.
3963,Kirk Pierson,"September 4, 2019",4," Good searchability. Easy to use. Not totally confident in pricing. Home facts get changed and are not always right, but it is a great place to start."
3964,Vardan Egiazarian,"September 23, 2019",1, Search engine is bad you need to fix that. Even if you put right address it will not show up because if it doesn't match for 100% it shows listing not found. Difference could be a # or apt and you never will find it
3965,David Rowe,"September 25, 2019",3, I'm very disappointed in the fact that you can no longer X out a property you are not interested in. It just leaves me with too many unwanted property options on my map.
3966,whiskey echo,"October 11, 2019",3, Could use some more bells & whistles... the option to like/love is great but it would be equally helpful the opposite direction so that it doesn't keep appearing in the feeds.
3967,Irma Rosario,"October 16, 2019",5," The Zillow app gives me pertinent information that is useful to making a decision on buying a home such as taxes, year built, and amenities including a look at the neighborhood itself. Very valuable!"
3968,Roni Gi,"October 21, 2019",4, Solves lots of search issures of other apps. Sometime switching to other menu windows causes pauses and hick-up. Yet over all quite good. Better break down window of how estmated monthly payment reached needed
3969,S K,"October 23, 2019",5, Best app for all real estate inquiries! Not only listings of current properties but also a wealth of information on everything involving real estate.
3970,Beth Bailey,"October 27, 2019",5, I like that I can see the level of the house that each bedroom is on. Zillow is the only house searching site I've found so far like that.
3971,Quinn Fung-A-Wing,"October 31, 2019",4, Great site. Pictures render a little slow sometimes
3972,Cathleen Richardson,"November 5, 2019",5, Has all the current details and easy to use.
3973,stan king,"January 3, 2020",4," It's fun, I think they're pretty close in values also"
3974,Anthony Wright,"December 29, 2019",5, Very helpful with understanding the housing market when considering purchase.

3977,Vicki Lenard-Moyer,"March 20, 2020",5, it's a great site to be able to look for homes for sale or rent.
3978,Michael Crabbe,"March 31, 2020",1, This is the 3rd time I have unsubscribed from your app and I am still getting your emails. If I get one more email from you about anything I will file a hurasment charge for invading my privacy. Thank you so much.
3979,Teazjha Moyé,"April 4, 2019",5, awesome app. found my home 🏠 here and it looks like the pictures that are shown. the agent was very detailed and simple.
3980,Zero Compassion,"May 19, 2019",2," App was working great until now. Everytime I try to use the filters, it freezes my phone and forces an automatic restart."
3981,A Google user,"November 4, 2018",5, Great way to look for a home? Easy to use!!! Helpful information!!! Makes the whole process of buying a home easier!!!
3982,J.I Y.A Representative,"September 19, 2018",5," Easy, well put, updates immediately. What more can you ask for, look there goes another one again. Perfect, point blank, period..."
3983,Joshua Inglis,"February 6, 2019",4," Fairly useful and straight forward app design. Could do with a couple of improvements, but overall a solid resource for house hunting."

3985,Bethany Lochner,"April 5, 2019",5, love it. gives me control to find properties instead of depending on an agent. nobody will look harder for what i want than me.
3986,Roland Breckwoldt,"December 28, 2018",5, One of of my favorite apps!! They make it easier to find info on a home without always calling a realtor.
3987,Joseph Dilaura,"November 27, 2018",5, Very helpful for me. I've purchased two properties and was able to get info on the property I was looking into love it

3989,A Google user,"October 9, 2018",5, Easy way to search for a home and pull up helpful info. Could use some improvements but very good overall.
3990,SHERI BROWN,"January 13, 2019",5, Best app ever for house hunting for both buyers and renters. I've searched on several different apps but immediatly uninstalled them all after installing and using the Zillow app. No comparison.
3991,Minda Carpenter,"January 16, 2019",4, I wish there was a search feature to set a maximum distance from a certain address. That would make it easier to find houses with reasonable commutes.
3992,w0 w1,"May 8, 2019",1, stupid app! can't change the notification search area! doesn't display all the current homes for sale! the offer companies they list are higher than everyone else! this app is garbage!
3993,Robert Warren III,"February 18, 2019",1, should be a no star opotion. glitchy. about half of the listings are filled. call every property owner/manager to verify onenings. needs an option to leave comments for others to be able to see.
3994,Hannah Audrey,"January 20, 2019",5, Easy ways to look for a home. Has good information about homes. I love how I can put hearts to save houses that are perfect for me.

A link that doesn't link-If not the poorest funtioning website - Zi4llow will fight for being the most deceptive!!!
3999,C Kirkland,"October 8, 2018",5, Very helpful app to quickly locate homes for sale and determine interest in the home when looking in specific areas .....even those for sale by owner.
4000,Kendyl Lawson,"May 28, 2019",3, This app is not working now on my Samsung. I have cleared all my settings in installed. Reinstalled and not all homes in my search area are shown for sale. Help I used to be addicted to this app!
4001,Paulette Zaouk,"December 19, 2018",2," The recent update makes screen look cluttered. Saved homes no longer stand out on map. Hard to read map, recent sales too cluttered."
4002,Felix Alvarez,"October 24, 2018",5," This app makes house hunting a simpler task. Troublesome listings are always a risk, but as whole, Zillow is a welcome addition to your real estate toolbox."
4003,Kathleen Bessmer,"January 25, 2019",5, Good app for looking at properties for rent or sale. Like that you can see where property is easily on map. Like street view available for all properties
4004,Karen Enos,"May 26, 2019",3, frequently does not show houses that are for sale on the map. you must click on them before it shows you they're for sale.
4005,Henrietta Finkleton,"May 5, 2019",4," I like Zillow, but sometimes the same search on different devices will yield different results, and once all my favorites disappeared."
4006,A Google user,"March 30, 2019",4," Very informative. I'm only window shopping for the future, but need to begin my search and I believe that Zillow will make it a lot simpler."
4007,Kris Mcwethy,"May 16, 2019",1, I loved the app the way it was. Now it sucks. The app feels generic and you cant even see the sat view of the properties anymore.
4008,randy franklin,"November 27, 2018",1," Constant ""recommendations"" about home purchases that are completely irrelevant to what I am looking for, much less in the right location."
4009,Paul Threatt,"November 17, 2018",2, The 5 star ratings are paid-for fake reviews. The search is difficult to control and much of the data is old in a rapidly moving market.
4010,Michael Allison,"May 25, 2019",4, Good app. Sometimes the search filters seem to stay on and ultimately eliminate any listings. Could be operator error.
4011,CyberWaddles,"February 22, 2019",5, I really like it so far. really helpful keeping updates on houses and other places. easy to use
4012,Emily Robinson,"May 7, 2019",3, The fact that you can't list view is very irritating. The fact that it demands a review every few clicks is also very annoying.
4013,Woody Wood,"January 7, 2019",5, I enjoy the information that the app provides. I'm still looking and wtg for financing. thank you for your patience.
4014,Alysa Rae,"October 31, 2018",5, We found our perfect rental home through this app and many other houses to view and choose from! It was a fast and easy experience. We move in next week!
4015,A Google user,"December 16, 2018",5, I like it with all the information and pictures you show of the house. But disappointed that when giving information and not showing the inside of the homes
4016,Crystal McCall,"May 14, 2019",1," I agree with previous comment, the app has a glitch where you can't view the homes available. Please correct ASAP. I'm relocating and Zillow can't help with the home search."
4017,A Google user,"September 17, 2018",4, I liked the old website layout and navigation system much better. Do not like the photos being at the bottom of the page.
4018,Mark Tomseth,"April 16, 2019",5," The app is intuitive, simple and easy to use. I like the tools and options on narrow or expand my search."
4019,Michael Esping,"November 28, 2018",4," I would like to be able to filter rental properties by ""pet friendly "" to save time scrolling through each property one at a time."
4020,A Google user,"November 19, 2018",4," I like the flexibility to change the search parameters. It helps in looking at homes I'm interested in, as well as homes similar to the one I want to sell."
4021,Stefan Bury,"October 27, 2018",4, Great for finding home values in any area and where you can afford only wish it had a home button to get you back to starting page after you've delved into area
4022,Gary Kitchen,"June 8, 2019",4," Brand new to condo hunting. Filters are a learning experience, don't want to miss out on a something good because I set up my search wrong. Good info and calculator tools to determine mortgage and other costs"
4023,Alex Balleh,"June 19, 2019",4, you can't share your saved homes list with more than one person. this is limiting when shopping with a spouse and working with an agent. fix this asap.
4024,Mandy Ashley,"June 24, 2019",1, even with perfect singal the app says network error. no point having the app to browse local neighborhoods or future homes if it doesn't load anything. waste of a download.
4025,Todd Soltau,"July 3, 2019",4, it's a great app if you're looking for a NICE HOME!!! I'm in the military and Zillow has kept up with me across the globe.. absolutely love this app
4026,Lana,"July 4, 2019",2," Nice concept, but repeatedly getting listings that are NOT within my set preferences... Seriously considering uninstalling since its wasting alot of my time with listings I do NOT have interest in..."
4027,Stephen Rickard,"July 6, 2019",5, This app has been a very good tool for my wife and I. We have been looking for a new house and Zillow has really helped us!!
4028,Karen Krensky-Day,"July 28, 2019",5, It's great for selling and renting. Shows sellers how many people are looking at your property and how many saves you get.
4029,Brianna Gonzales,"July 22, 2019",5, I love this app! It makes house hunting super easy. If you're in the market for a new home definitely use Zillow!
4030,sam g,"July 19, 2019",1, I thought zillow was a great app until I realised all the houses are via agents and the rents are expensive. it is a waste..I gave up on searching this app and moved into an apartment. I still Think their app is great but it is useless.
4031,Rohit M Mundayadan,"August 3, 2019",2," the app doesn't scroll on the background/credit check questionnaire. after 3 attempts, it blocked the verification step for 24 hrs. the step works on the web though. its broken on the app."
4032,Sonya Korf,"August 14, 2019",4," (Thank you for fixing the problem so promptly!) So frustrated with this site! There's a mistake on our listing, potentially affecting interest in our house. Our realtor has been trying to get it changed for 6 days, and they haven't even responded!!"
4033,Lori Mclean,"September 18, 2019",5, What I like about Zillow is that you get an inside view of the property you get full details of the community the things that are in the vicinity of where you're living along with the school zones for that community and you get quality pictures.
4034,Tara Miller-Hochhalter,"September 24, 2019",1, Location Button? Disappeared! Most recent update seemed to removed the location button where you could easily see homes near your location for sale. Please bring this feature back!
4035,LucasMelissa Hausner,"October 3, 2019",1, Used to be good. I click on houses near me and they don't even have the right address or any of the correct info. I can't even get any info on my own house. Not good anymore. Will be deleting APP if they don't fix issues.
4036,Deaven Smith,"October 29, 2019",5, Great app. Easy to find homes. Woulnt use anything else

4039,Kathleen Stewart,"January 4, 2020",5, Great place to shop for a home.
4040,Joseph Giarratana,"January 9, 2020",5, I love the options and their evaluations they give
4041,Desiree Sundquist,"February 9, 2020",5, It really is really helping me find places I would have never know about.
4042,Marlon Jamieson,"January 7, 2019",5, Great app. I use it regularly to assist as a rough estimate of comps and much more.
4043,Joanne Boaz,"April 28, 2019",5, Very user friendly! Better than any of the other realestate sites. We have found lots of properties through Zillow.
4044,Francis Franco,"April 8, 2019",2, Either there is a problem with the app or .my phone .the screen kept going blank or nothing would show for a 1 br apt less than 1500 plus a month.
4045,Samantha H,"February 17, 2019",4," love this app, but would like a feature that hides houses I've already seen or don't like, maybe a dislike button. I frequently find myself clicking through houses I've already viewed"
4046,A Google user,"November 23, 2018",5," I wish zillow would require realtors to post detailed and clear pictures, but the app itself is super easy to navigate and makes it easy to reach the home owners."
4047,T.J. Anderson,"March 6, 2019",2, It would get more stars if it was easier to look at different locations. Also lost all my favorites I had
4048,Jackie Kinney,"May 25, 2019",1, I can no longer use Zillow at all. It just shows 0 listings in any city at any price range. Idk what happened but awful app. No longer using.
4049,Harold Gaefikas,"October 4, 2018",5," Great app. If you are looking to buy a house, this app is great for scouting areas and finding a house that you would like to buy"
4050,A Google user,"February 7, 2019",2," Hard to use. Can not delete saved searches, I don't know if it is because I am using my phone or not. Can't save searches either."
4051,Ben Ruggeberg,"December 29, 2018",2, Still much to be desired. Uninstalled because I keep getting recommendations for senior only communities and townhouses when I have only been searching for single family houses.
4052,A Google user,"December 8, 2018",2, I get notices but click on the site and nothing.. A circle rings..tells me to check internet connection. Nothing wrong with the connection. It's the site
4053,Chenelyn B,"October 10, 2018",5," Great options.... i hope it had an option for NO HOA. Enjoy looking at these beautiful houses. Ready to move, but haven't found the right acreage with the right house."
4054,Eric,"May 12, 2019",1," Latest update messed up the app.. The update glitch removed 90% of the homes for sale, rent, etc... Needs to be fixed otherwise app is worthless."
4055,Don Presley,"February 28, 2019",4, fairly accurate pricing and information. pictures are subject to the photographer hired by the agent or owner. Good site to browse neighborhoods as well as how your house compares to others
4056,Alice Lepage,"April 15, 2019",5," Love the options you get! Like, finding a home within your ""circle"" on an area map."
4057,Janis Colonell,"October 27, 2018",5, I am pleased with this app and it has served me well. I moved into a great apt. I will continue to use Zillow for my next move.

What a joke 💩 🗑️"
4059,Danel Massey,"December 29, 2018",1," This app has nowhere near the amount of listings that Realtor does. Looking for a 4 bd any bath house for 120,000 or less nets you 3 houses. The Realtor app will net you 24 houses in the same area. Maybe great looking for a rental, not for buying."
4060,A Google user,"January 15, 2019",5, Love the app. Look at it every day to see property sales and trending around me. Also keeps me updated on my property value and impacting factors.
4061,Rhonda Singmaster,"March 1, 2019",4," Enjoy the app and the ease of getting info about listings. However, the satellite view of house locations and neighborhoods need to be updated."
4062,Gene Payton,"March 6, 2019",5, Great app. It allows one to actually see the inside of the place and 380° look at the surroundings of the location
4063,Brandon Million,"October 18, 2018",2, Joke... Thought it'd be better than the mobile site but just as clunky and won't open up directly to a shared text listing. Just use a desktop or a different app.
4064,Stephenie Hewett,"March 26, 2019",5," It is really easy to list, add photos, and a viseo. Great reports are sent daily and weekly to make the seller aware of views."
4065,Mark Honig,"April 5, 2019",1," What the heck happened to the old Zillow? we used to love it, now we find not useful. Don't bother installing. I don't have an alternative to it yet."
4066,Jay Mitchell,"March 13, 2019",4," The search is easy, the info is accessible and comprehensive, and the performance is good."
4067,Mary Koize,"January 27, 2019",1," Constantly changes my search criteria, saves searches I didn't want, refuses to unsubscribe me from emails. Now I remember why I don't use Zillow!!"
4068,Amber Taylor,"December 27, 2018",4, This is the best app I've found for searching rentals. My only frustration is that it doesn't have a filter for places that allow pets/dogs. That would save me a lot of time in the search.
4069,A Google user,"January 31, 2019",1," App WAS ALL GOOD up until recently, it just crashes when viewing photos of a house/ apartment & says 'network error'. So much for the update(s). Uninstalling"
4070,Kevin Anderson,"February 7, 2019",5, Great app with tools to help navigate through listenings. Detailed maps and the app structure help you get a feel for the market and area.
4071,Terrance Heard,"February 6, 2019",5, I love this app because it shows me the insides of the homes and it gives me all the information that I need I just have so many choices I don't know which one to pick thank you so much for creating this app.
4072,Sevetra Douglas,"March 6, 2019",5," Awesome App, love the pictures and prices! I can find exactly what I am looking for and where!"
4073,Carol Fisher,"May 1, 2019",5," best service out there. you can sell, you can buy or you can just look at what is available. Gives you additional information thats very helpful when making a large purchase."
4074,John Martin,"September 30, 2018",3," The thing that bugs me about this app is that house of which have been sold/under contract will remain listed as ""for sale"" for weeks and weeks."

4077,Elissa Allen,"February 27, 2019",5," Being new to adulting, i've found myself stressing about owning a home one day A LOT. Using Zillow along with homeowners tips, has taken an immense amount of my worries away. A wonderful app with an amazing catalog of homes near me."
4078,Vince Fournier,"May 3, 2019",4, The app is great outside of the fact that you can't hide houses that you've seen/don't want. I can't tell you how many times I've looked at the same house.

4082,Tina Bumbalina,"September 24, 2018",1," Since the update the app on my Samsung tablet is horrible. You can't see the whole house, the picture is stretched out and I don't see where you enter the city and state. I just can't use it anymore so I'm uninstslling."
4083,Nathen Knowles,"September 28, 2018",5," Great for my area whether buying or just ""window shopping"". Love the comparison tools and all the links to lenders and contractors"
4084,Piggy,"February 27, 2019",2, I like this app but it never works because it says I need internet to load homes when I'm connected to the internet already... all my other apps that need the internet work?
4085,Kamryn Rouhselang,"May 22, 2019",2, I love the app but there's no way to filter out the 55+ homes. So just about every house i have inquired about isnt available to me.
4086,Mark Anderson,"January 16, 2019",5, Easy to zoom in and get data on nearby homes. pictures are nicely presented as well.

4088,Dher H,"May 31, 2019",5, I've been looking on Zillow for quite some time. One of these days I'm going to find that must have home and property and take the plunge. Zillow's a great resource.

4090,Doc Martin,"June 10, 2019",3, very difficult to edit and make changes and very very low on property actual values. other than that good app easy to use but hard to make changes and low values estimate
4091,Darian Moore,"June 14, 2019",4, i really like this app super easy to use the only thing i have a problem with is that the city we live in alot of landlords lie about bugs and stuff as such i wish it would have a list to tell if the landlord is good or bad
4092,Ross Toyne,"June 19, 2019",5," Fast, flexible, for apartments and homes. Find a place to live, also easy for landlords (me) and sellers."
4093,Sarah Moseley,"June 19, 2019",5, Love being able to scroll around on map to see what properties are for sell in an area. price history is helpful for figuring how much equity the seller might have
4094,Alicia Nicolle,"June 19, 2019",4, need more floor plan pictures. A layout of the whole house would be a great tool to have when selling or buying.
4095,Julie Brown,"July 4, 2019",5, Loved having this app on my phone while I needed it to search to be able to customize my home search. Very useful and never any technical issues with the app.

The neighborhood is very stable not sure what's wrong but tech support said they removed the New York home and yet it's still claimed as mine (claim to a home in New York) that we never claimed or owned...this app is wack. Tech support said just delete the claim however that option not available at the user level.
4102,Angelina Carter,"August 6, 2019",1, so many times I see houses for sale afmdd when I search for them they aren't listed for sale on here. This app has gone downhill drastically in the last 6 months to a year
4103,Sonya Demaio,"August 15, 2019",2, i am so sick of dealing with this... after every update it messed up the app and shows maybe 3 houses available in each area. i KNOW thats impossible. ive reinstalled numerous times. and i am just done dealing with it.
4104,Mr. Romo,"August 25, 2019",5, The interface of this app is better than the standard MLS portal coming from my realtor. The best features are the hability to open every picture and stretch it out (zoom) to see the details.
4105,Xenia Farouk,"September 14, 2019",5," very useful but would be more so if certain content, such as photos of bathrooms and closets/storage space, were uniformly included."

4109,Latoya Gupton,"October 13, 2019",5, I like the app. It has a lot of nice homes to look thru giving you an idea on what to look for when considering buying a home for the first or second time. 😎
4110,Vanessa Speight,"October 21, 2019",3," Good on the go. Some discrepancies, ie a house sold, still showing available on Zillow. Also, just wish you can hit a dislike button so the properties you don't like, don't keep showing up."
4111,Kirsten Jinks,"October 25, 2019",5, This is the only way to actually enjoy house hunting. Tim and I really enjoy showing each other the cool places we find on Zillow. We love it.

4118,Arthur Bryant,"October 22, 2018",5, I love the way the pictures are featured on Zillow. Other home sites don't provide the option to view the full image. You're able to see more details.

4120,Lake Blackfeather,"April 27, 2019",1, tells me not even 10% of the properties available in my areas. then I got on my computer and it's all good. I like Zillow but this app must improve
4121,Josephine Kemp,"February 12, 2019",5, This app is very helpful when you looking to by a house. Picture come in clear .No one calls you unless you want then to.
4122,Michelle Nason,"January 25, 2019",1, every time i search for houses with this app it says 0 results. what's up with that. I know there are houses for sale in this area. so why isn't it coming up

4128,A Google user,"March 6, 2019",2, This app isn't very good at keeping track of your search perimeters even though I continue to delete and update it still sends me the wrong listings with the wrong prices. Very frustrating!
4129,Tina Adams,"December 20, 2018",5," love it, but the mortgage calculator does not reflect the actual property taxes and the prime rate"
4130,Micah Sebastian,"May 10, 2019",1," Not showing all homes for sale. Leaves out homes even on Zillow's desktop version. No longer useful. Sad, used Zillow for years. Trulia works much better."

4132,Paul Johnson,"March 25, 2019",4, only downside is that searching on mobile is not as flexible as on PC. Otherwise great app for those searching for a new place
4133,Robert Mead,"September 12, 2018",2," Constantly tells me it has no connection, or deletes my saved homes and searches. Then refuses to save new homes. Always have to uninstall and reinstall weekly!"
4134,Miranda Gillespie,"October 19, 2018",4, What happened to the ability to dismiss houses from the map that you aren't interested in? That made it a whole lot easier.

4146,G E,"November 7, 2018",3," There is no way to change default settings; I don't want to have my saved houses sorted by newly changed, I want to change this default. There is no way to reset defaults, it lacks personalization and makes me want to go elsewhere."

4163,C Alward,"July 4, 2019",4, Very useful app for home buying. Would be much better if the app had a feature to block properties you do not want to see again.
4164,Tatiana Gregg,"July 31, 2019",5," I love Zillow. It's such a great app, they sends out emails as soon as you save or like the given matches. I'm hoping to find a new place soon, and Zillow is on my list."

4215,Quincy Gilbert,"January 21, 2019",4, the app is very useful it would be get a 5 star rating if they showed which locations allowed pets before clicking or have that as a filter option.

4231,Timothy Daniels,"July 5, 2019",1, Piss poor! Every home we were interested in had already been sold. They need to update the properties frequently so people don't get their hopes up for one and it has already been sold and moved into.

4250,Marsha Puleo,"March 21, 2019",4, I love the app. I would like to go directly to the house that is shown in my email notifications instead of searching for the house.
4251,A Google user,"October 27, 2018",1, Wow what happened to Zillow this app is so bad now the new update isn't user friendly at all it is just a big clunky mess. Do yourself a favor don't download there are better home finding apps.
4252,Gods Healing Hands Ministry,"December 14, 2018",5," Awesome so far, been here a week now, still viewing, I would recommend this app to others, makes searching for a new place so convenient & easy😊"
4253,Terance Dwayne McCutchen,"May 18, 2019",4," Great app overall, But the filters need to be empro ved. There is no price cap and you can not set exact beds. ect....."
4254,Julie Stitt,"January 22, 2019",4, easy to maneuver. like the zestaments. like lots of pictures. One of my favorite real estate apps to use.
4255,V Wiggins,"December 30, 2018",5, One day I will find the house that I'm looking for and I know that I will find it using Zillow is a very good app I look forward to looking at it every single day it's a good app that's all I can say.
4256,A Google user,"September 23, 2018",4, The only thing missing from most listings is a floor plan. It would be helpful if more people included that in the listing
4257,Bernard McDevitt,"April 20, 2019",4, the ability to transparently view price history ..... where it's made available.... is truly a difference maker. All despite many apparent attempts to create fraudulent transactions. Wonder why industry sponsored sites would prefer less transparency?
4258,Paige Fo'Rizzle,"January 10, 2019",3," works most of the time, until you need it to. Then it just shows you a bunch of stuff outside of your price range."
4259,Julia Jewelz,"January 7, 2019",5, I like the app. Only improvement I would like to see more of is videos of the walkthrough which is not the app problems anyways.
4260,joseph plummer,"November 15, 2018",3, I wish they would update the feature to add photos of your house with Android applications. I think it's gay it won't allow you. That is the only complaint I have. It is a good app I like it.
4261,Comical SITH,"December 11, 2018",5, I love how easy it is to use and filter through my options especially as a 19 y/o first time renter this app has been helping me find the perfect place to start my life in.
4262,clyde hughey,"April 28, 2019",3, Saving Searches on the mobile site is a gigantic pain in the ass. It's ridiculous how complicated it is to save them.
4263,Dustine Stevens,"October 6, 2018",5, Works great. Able to find open houses in areas we are visiting and gives useful info for commutes and such.
4264,Keana Mills,"January 8, 2019",5," Awesome app! I found and moved into a home already, some homeowners are impossible to contact but im very happy where i am. (:"
4265,Kevin O'Meara,"December 25, 2018",1, latest December 2018 update it's awful. the map is cluttered and the houses hard to see without zooming way in due to ellipse style markers. also miss the ability to hide homes.
4266,Jeff,"April 6, 2019",2," Has no pet filter and the houses only filter doesn't work. It keeps showing me condos, townhouses and apartments."
4267,Stephanie Spears,"September 28, 2018",5, Very user friendly & keeps me up to date with the latest listings or price adjustments.
4268,Shawnee' Huxley,"September 15, 2019",4, I love being able to see pictures of the houses and the zillow team is very responsive. The only downfall is some of the photos don't show the whole room or house.
4269,Nestor J Molina,"April 14, 2019",1," Total Junk. Worked OK for 2 weeks. Since 2 updates ago, all I can see is network error. Uninstalling and using Realtor's app"
4270,Ken Kwan,"May 16, 2019",2, Clicking links from email updates takes me to the map and the property isnt even highlighted. Why would I bother using the app if the mobile website provides better functionality?
4271,Muyumi Ast,"September 30, 2018",1, I dont like that it shows the map then you pick a purple dot. I like to scroll thru each rental and then pick if I want to view.
4272,Mr.Nugget Guy,"March 25, 2019",5," Zillow is a very well put together, there little to know errors and it gives you what you are looking for."
4273,Jumoke Osuntokun,"May 12, 2019",5, Accurate and exceptional description and photos of the houses for sale. Sound real estate conversation.
4274,Roger Kacmarcik,"May 3, 2019",5, I've been enjoying the notifications for properties coming on the market in the area I've selected. great app!

4278,Jennifer Barrentine,"May 20, 2019",5," User friendly. Great options/specs checklists, so you can find exactly what you want!"

4281,jason jacobs,"September 21, 2018",5, Easy to use. Lots of filters for specifying search criteria; like rent amount and number of bedrooms
4282,Scott Randall,"March 4, 2019",4, Decent app...... But lacks a filter to rule out places that do not allow pets. Kinda a basic oversight in my opinion.
4283,TheBrewer3535,"June 4, 2019",4," overall I like the app, but there are weird quirks. I had searched set up for one city, which I have deleted 2 months ago, but I still get notices."
4284,Joe Cargile,"May 27, 2019",5," Great app. Most homes are not what they are pictured, but, you have plenty to pick from."
4285,K P,"May 31, 2019",2," Glitchy, keeps saying ""Homes cannot be loaded."" Also, it would be helpful to have a ""Exclude these features"" filter."
4286,Joan Somerville,"June 23, 2019",2, The Zestimate price is not accurate. There should be a suspend for temporary purposes. And the 3D is not for android users. Could have been a great way to market for sale by owner home.
4287,Kay Groves,"June 24, 2019",4, i find that the application is quite useful. there only issue i have is could there be a sort by location in the list view.
4288,Tschotty,"June 29, 2019",1," When selecting a house, from an email with ""houses I may like"", never takes me to the correct house. Hate that I cannot choose that I am not interested in a house and have in not keep appearing in my searches."
4289,Matthew C,"July 26, 2019",3," Not bad. Could be better. This app would get 4-5 stars if there were a ""zoom in-zoom-out"" slider on the side that would make searching larger areas simpler."
4290,Stephen Whittaker,"July 31, 2019",4, The app works great. I was able to make notes on my saved homes (e.g. typing a comment with the HOA cost instead of having to go into the listing details to see it)
4291,Charlene King,"August 4, 2019",2," It's frustrating not being able to set a radius search of so many miles. The draw option is nice, but a milesge option would be appreciated."
4292,Jason JJ Cruz,"August 6, 2019",1, zillow App is very slow to load web pages when I'm connected to my home's internet The old app loaded quicker and even the zillow website loads quick a d web pages are not slow I may drop this app it's ti slow it should not run in the background and use my phones me memory
4293,Loretta Eisele,"August 10, 2019",5," Love this app. Functionality in the app is much better than on the website. Pictures fill the screen, and it's a superior experience over the web."
4294,Joyce Singh,"August 6, 2019",5, I am Always happy with the service and super super happy with the info acquired from the app. Keep up the good work.
4295,Barbara Frazier,"August 18, 2019",4," I like frequency of homes sent to view. Disappointed that so many are doublewides, for which I cannot get a loan. Many are needing too much repair and are sold ""as is"". Keeping hope alive."
4296,Audrey lane,"September 7, 2019",5, I love it so much I found a mansion that is cheaper than what a mansion should be and me and my child love this mansion and my man loves it too and we feel like this is our new home and we love it we just moved in and it's perfect
4297,D Davis,"September 14, 2019",4," Does a pretty good job and keeps me informed. The map functions are a little clunky and slow, but they mostly work."
4298,James Mason,"September 15, 2019",4, it's pretty cool I look on there very often for apartments and houses to rent I just wish there was more cheaper and affordable houses that you could rental!!!!?????
4299,Don Del,"September 21, 2019",1, Why on earth would you think that showing houses on a map in dark mode makes any sense? At the least make it optional. I'll be deleting soon if it is not reversed.
4300,Jr Baca,"September 21, 2019",2," Latest update is horrible with the dark mode, and there is no longer the option to click the GPS symbol to search homes in your current location."
4301,Jewel Wendt,"October 24, 2019",4, Pretty good app. It would be extremely helpful to have lot rent for manufactured homes in the monthly cost calculation instead of just hoa fee.
4302,Sydney Maage,"October 3, 2019",1, Worst app for finding a home you want the search criteria doesn't mean anything. Zillow decide what to show you regardless if you have selected out of options. Worst app for trying to find a home.
4303,Lucci Cordoe,"October 6, 2019",5," I love everything about the Zillow app... The usually clear photos, precise descriptions, and the tax and finance predictions make it the best in it's class!!!"

4315,Carol Sanderson,"May 3, 2019",4," As a purchaser & seller I appreciate this app & the service they provide. My only complaint as a seller is that you really need to improve how to post, edit & manipulate pictures."
4316,Kelli Bartlett,"September 13, 2018",4," Like that it keeps you informed, but not correct at all. Most houses you have listed are either rented or sold. Very frustrating"

4319,Javier Rodriguez,"October 5, 2018",5," Is very current and updates are immediately. Very easy to navigate, that is how I found my home."
4320,A Google user,"February 9, 2019",4, I like the way each house is shown in detail inside and out. The streets and the surrounding areas and for sure the price.

4325,Hollie Varden,"January 17, 2019",1, Constantly crashes! Can't even look at a single property without it crashing. Waste of space on my phone.
4326,Joe Koppenhaver,"February 12, 2019",2," like the website but selling my house and it tells me to download the app to add a video, then the app asks if you want to add a video. however it says video capture is no longer supported..."

4330,Kelly Thompson,"April 2, 2019",1, I put in my location I'm searching and nothing comes up but when I search online they're all there. I've tried uninstalling it. I've tried everything. it wont work for me.
4331,Terrie Klenk,"October 17, 2018",5, Zillow is easy to use. I can look at the houses that I want to look at or just stay and daydream awhile.
4332,Taylor Madison,"April 6, 2019",2, Recent updates took away the feature of street view and satellite option. Really liked having this as an option to get a sense of the neighborhood.

4353,Samantha Shanks,"July 10, 2019",3," I like this app but other apps you can put in a state and search I would love this feature, I would like to be able to search by states instead of city otherwise it's a good app"
4354,James O'Quinn,"August 1, 2019",2," the app used to work great, but now nothing ever shows up. no rentals, nothing there for purchase. the website shows everything correctly though"

4365,Jessi True,"October 1, 2019",4, Easy to use but definitely a time sink. You can spend hours just scrolling through listings.
4366,Jackie Dunlap,"October 18, 2019",4, Has worked great for us. Uploading photos was a bit trying But I think it was a deficiency on my end.
4367,A B,"October 27, 2019",1, Lost all my saved homes. It's requesting I sign in now and it won't send any kind of confirmation to my email to do so... What a pain. If it's not broken don't fix it...

4400,Mickey the Vampire-Cat Thing,"September 12, 2018",3, Why can't I hide houses I don't want to see anymore? Is this a new format? Is it also possible to add a feature where I can keep senior housing from showing up in my search results?
4401,Pam Norwood,"March 18, 2019",5, A great way to preview a home prior to making an appointment. The specific information is listed. Great Application.

4403,Pam Jones,"November 3, 2018",4, I have the Zillow app on my 📱 and it is informative. The homes are really expensive. To much so for my husband and I. Hom ed s should cost ALITTLE less then what some of them cost.
4404,Adèle Chalifoux,"March 13, 2019",1," Glitches, freezes and stops working only a few minutes into using. Annoying and waste of time."
4405,A Google User,"June 28, 2019",1, Missing an important feature of any listing: website source to the listing! Especially for apartment complex. Why would you exclude this?
4406,Timothy Warner,"April 26, 2019",1, This update runs the app so slowly and you cannot remove the zestimate from the map. Worst update I've seen in a long time.
4407,Julia Kern,"March 7, 2019",4," I'd give it 5 stars except I can't remove auction properties from the search and I wish there was a ""never show this property to me again"" for places I really don't want"

I was look for a house to yesterday morning and everything was great then got out of it for a few hours and got back in it and all the sudden all the houses that's for sale say no pets. come on really? everybody knows if ur buying a house it don't make a flip if you have dogs or cats. it just unsettling for me. don't understand it and don't understand the updates and etc
4440,Renee Evans,"August 23, 2019",1, This app is great when it works. Right now it is only showing land for sale and no houses no matter what I do. It does this frequently and last for weeks.
4441,John Lindsay,"August 23, 2019",4, Very intuitive & simple to use. The personal linking and data mining cookies are a little disconcerting but ingenious nonetheless. That seems to be the world we live in.
4442,Johnna Lynn,"August 30, 2019",5, It is so easy to use and updates are made. I can look at and compare houses in the same area. Zillow will also inform me of houses of interest.

4445,Sweet P,"September 10, 2019",5," Love this app. Rental market in SF is not accurate, but that might just be because the rental market is ever changing"
4446,Cyndi Schroeder,"September 16, 2019",5, A quick & easy way to know what real estate is available for purchase and to post an ad when selling. A great tool to communicate in the marketplace!
4447,Andy Skoien,"October 2, 2019",2, I like to use my tablet in landscape. I don't want to constantly turn it. Map view landscape perfect. Clicking on listing portrait only. Uninstalled.
4448,FamilyPaw,"October 2, 2019",2," Search parameters don't stay. I select No HOA and I still get those properties. I select Must have pool and I get homes without, or they have a pool table. APP could be fine tuned."
4449,Sandra Mohler,"October 11, 2019",5, It keeps me current on whats available and gives enough information for me to know if I want to go see a property in person. Until I buy Zillow will be my #1 resource.

4457,Scott Parker,"October 29, 2018",2, Disappointed that the app vs the full site creates multiple accounts and will not show which one is active. Not able to edit my property.
4458,David Lamale,"May 26, 2019",5," Easy to use, and ability to search numerous locations. This app is awesome!! 👍"

4462,charlene jones,"November 13, 2018",5, This app really helps you find what your looking for in a home and the contact information is so helpful. Yes I love Zillow
4463,A Google user,"January 25, 2019",1, even though I unsubscribe from all the emails and discontinue using the app. I still continue to receive emails and wish it would stop
4464,Melissa Stinehart,"January 17, 2019",4," the only thing I don't like is that after filling out my profile with my needs for space I am still sent places not within my requirements. ie I need at least 3 bedrooms, and the send me places with only one or 2 bedrooms."
4465,Lisa Gordee,"October 8, 2018",4, Very useful app. Like the sharing capability. Not always clear/timely on contingent/sold properties.
4466,Deborah Spence,"October 9, 2018",3," Valuations are inaccurate much of the time, but the app is a great starting point. I'll continue to use it."
4467,Denny Browne,"April 29, 2019",2," the actual app works very well and informative... I'am a licensed realtor, unfortunately the values of properties are very inconsistent with actual values..."
4468,Meeche Da Boss,"December 3, 2018",3," There doesn't seem to be a real and convenient way to search for multi- family properties, accurately. Other than that, it's pretty good, as far as I can tell."
4469,Chris Hartig,"October 6, 2018",4," Very good home finder,but sometimes when looking for house it would report ""error""."
4470,Tom Winiarczyk,"February 24, 2019",5, Very easy to use and updates are automatic which helps to keep current.
4471,Brennon Venable,"February 19, 2019",3, good but some properties listed as foreclosures are confusing and some listing that you mark as interested in just disappear without any notice or explanation.
4472,ma griff,"March 16, 2019",5, I always find what I'm looking for. It's great to see that you can pinpoint specifically what your searching for and locate it!!!

4474,Mark H,"February 15, 2019",1, Random push notifications with no way to disable them. Constantly begging for your email address so they can sell it to advertisers. No thank you.
4475,A Google user,"December 29, 2018",5, Zillow always sends me new home possibilities. And I am never annoyed when I receive an update. They don't flood my in box with properties that I am not interested in. Thank you Zillow!
4476,Vanessa Giancola,"November 9, 2018",5," Love Zillow. Refer to it a lot. Zestimates are not exact, but helpful to see listed sales price and sold properties. Pics are fun too."
4477,Debbie Griffiths,"October 21, 2018",1," my app also has Chinese language marks where you type info, why if my app is US? Also where my searches are it has listings for homes on other states that i have never searched is someone else using the ""same"" app that is installed on my phone?"
4478,Adrian Howe,"March 22, 2019",1, I loved this app till they changed it today. if it's not broke don't fix it! now I have to find a different app. new format is garbage.
4479,FRITOTAYO chestnut,"May 25, 2019",5, its an amazing app it lets you find places around that are affordable and you don't have worry about pricing.

4482,Ria Shroff,"November 23, 2018",4, I think that this app is very useful. Maybe it just might need a few more listings because I checked every one.
4483,Gordon French,"December 22, 2018",3, Good app for reviewing houses by area. Really need to be able to mark houses that you never want to see again. Reverse of liking a home.

4486,Waumbra grw,"April 14, 2019",1, This zillow app is asking where I live. They're trying to get more and more your personal information and there's no good reason why zillow needs to know when I live! Uninstalled this spyware app. Be careful using this.
4487,A Google user,"September 15, 2018",3, I can't filter my searches by price--and I'm on an extremely tight budget... which basically renders this app useless for my purposes.
4488,A Google user,"November 28, 2018",3, The dots are not always on the exact location and the satellite views are not up to date which is very disappointing for this app.
4489,Manda Johnson,"May 10, 2019",1, use to work great. now that I'm actively seeking a home to buy. I get 3 houses that show in 8 different countries. no search filter restrictions. just the SAME THREE LISTINGS. uninstalled. logged out. no difference. Bye zillow
4490,A Google user,"December 4, 2018",3, Constant barrage of marketing notices and updates. Keeps sending areas I have no interest in even after setting filters.

4497,Rebekah Hendrix,"January 30, 2019",4," I do not like that you cannot ""hide"" a listing anymore. Otherwise helpful at veiwing multiple properties from your phone. Good app."

4504,Steven Barlow,"June 23, 2019",5," I love looking at houses and imagine myself in the houses themselves. What I would do to make the house my own, what i would chamge or leave. this app is outstanding, I usually end up spending all day on here."
4505,Tony Lynch,"June 20, 2019",2, Properties that are for sale do not show as such until I physically click on them. Makes the search and map functions useless.

4509,Dyana Mitchell,"July 13, 2019",5, Great app for starting your home search! You can weed out the undesirables and ask pertinent questions before you even see the home! Great time saver!
4510,Montie Hall,"July 18, 2019",3, need too be able to see a list that you can go through instead of tapping on one at a time other than that i love Zillow i like knowing what the home I'm looking at sold before and what the tawes are close too

4514,Nicole E.,"August 8, 2019",1, Both the app and the website drop listings if you minimize it to share the link. I went from there being 12 rentals that fit my criteria to 1 in less than 10 minutes.
4515,Lou Anne Bennettt,"August 22, 2019",1, Zillow has begun alerting real estate agents when I look at a property. It is annoying and bothersome to me when I receive calls and text from agent. It wastes my time and the agents time. I am looking for other ways to access real estate information. Please stop Zillow.

4521,Jayna Jones,"October 9, 2019",5, Zillow is my go-to when looking for available properties. I like that you can also see properties that are For Sale by Owner.
4522,Carol Holt,"October 21, 2019",4, This app is very helpful locating properties. The only problem is sometimes it shows properties in areas where I'm not looking even after resetting the filters.

4532,Deborah Walsh,"February 13, 2019",4, at first it wasn't good as I could not get any help. I finally got a response and was able to list my property. I have gotten quality responses to my ads and Zillow keeps you updated.

4537,Julie Stone,"October 22, 2018",1," Use to be to type in your own price range, now you can't look for anything under $30k. I'm trying to look for land and it's bringing up nothing now. I had several results before the update."
4538,Matthew R,"April 5, 2019",5, information is spot on. Notices are immediate and I'm always well informed of the market in the area I'm looking at.
4539,kristina shifflett,"January 19, 2019",5, I like it because they a great selection of places all over the place. And I get updates when new places are added. I have the app which makes it handy to use. love it.
4540,Sharon Bendix,"May 5, 2019",4," keeps us up to date We are very busy, and Zillow let's us know what properties are available. We sold a home on Zillow. Only problem we had was someone was able to hack our account and change price on us. We got a nightmare worth of calls before we got it fixed."
4541,matt howard,"January 5, 2019",2, was much better before updates. used to show years of taxes and graph of prices over the years.

5022,Jeff Clausen,"October 11, 2018",1," Useless. Listings don't show up until weeks/months after a property is listed, if at all. Snooze you lose."

5024,Anne Marie Guarini,"May 27, 2019",3," It would be nice if Zillow would concentrate on describing houses in Amerst, NH. It is very confusing when you think that you have found the house of your dreams - only to realize the property is in Amerst, NY. Very disappointing!!!"

It's a great thing to be able to preview before you drive all over looking. I wish more realtors would learn to take better photos and label them so we know what we are looking at. I think the app needs refinement so buyers can say or no to basics, also show zip codes on maps. If your looking to find an address, you require a zip code so fhe maps have them."
5428,A Google user,"February 7, 2019",5," Zillow helps me find exactly what i want and also sends direct emails to property owner for contact. I recommend anyone searching for a house, apt, condo, duplex, rent to own, etc it's all right here with Zillow 👍👍👍"
