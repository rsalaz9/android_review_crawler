It is cute and fun. It just has some bugs. Like, it won’t or can’t for some reason fetch my friends from Facebook, it crashes when I go to the Game Center, and I’ve tried numerous times to download the tiny monsters game for the crystals via the task that was given but it doesn’t redirect me to a downloadable link. So then I downloaded it separately and it won’t recognize that I’ve downloaded it, so the task just sits there never going away."
1,PinkGayUnicorn Utako,"March 5, 2020",5," I love this game! I had it once several years ago and decided to get it again, by far one of my best decisions in mobile games.

I had it once several years ago and decided to get it again, by far one of my best decisions in mobile games. The only think i dont like is that everything with crystals is so expensive! Even to buy extra crystals, you dont get a lot with what you pay and there arent many chances to get free crystals. Other than the crystals its an absolutely adorable and addictive game?"
2,Gemma Oliver,"March 5, 2020",4," Good game, it's just a shame it hasn't been updated. Tapjoy doesn't exist anymore so the free coins and crystals isn't an option. Gifting doesn't work. Coins are very hard to build up until you get the dinosaurs so people lose interest. But I love it, it gets me thinking"
3,KJlpsrocks 21,"March 18, 2020",4," I love me some cute little dinos, but paired with world building? Fantastic! The game crashes sometimes, and I'm not sure if its the fault of my device or otherwise. Other than that, amazing!"
4,Patrick Owens,"February 18, 2020",5," Cute game. One thing, though. The game used to change the theme every month or two. Now, it appears to be stuck on ""Rodeo"" for at least 5 months."
5,bella nokomis,"January 22, 2020",5," Still love this game, just as good as it was when I first started playing all those years ago! App shuts every now and again but it opens back up a couple seconds before it closed so you don't lose anything if this happens"
6,alex miranda,"February 29, 2020",5, WHEN ON EARTH DID THEY BRING THIS GAME BACK. Last I checked they removed it for unknown reasons I use to play this game when I was younger and wanted to play it again years later. And now it's back again
7,Diana Mitchell,"December 2, 2019",4, There is a Free Crystal bar above the crystals you can purchase but when I push it nothing happens. Can you please fix this issue. Other than that I love the game!
8,Tracy Cook,"February 22, 2020",5, I love this game. It sadly crashes a lot but I love it too much to stop playing
9,Asia Rogers,"February 29, 2020",3, I would put 5 stars but everytime I try to connect my game to Facebook it shuts down. Please fix and I'll change my stars.
10,Lacey Neal,"November 5, 2019",3, Great game I've played over the years but has so many bugs and crashes often. I can't access the free gems/coins or sign into fb without it crashing.
11,H Hutchinson,"December 3, 2019",1, Why did this game start on level 4 . I have never played this game before. It looks good but it isn't. This is not a good start. For me to carry on playing. Fix it.
12,Sinaja Bojicic,"March 30, 2020",4, I cant upgrade my storage there is no option and to many thing on market costs with gems.
13,Bill Black,"January 22, 2020",4, A decent building/sim game. It's more relaxing than other similar games. I just wish there were more options when it comes to leveling up.
14,Anny H,"December 7, 2018",3, I've just recently downloaded the game again. Its different this time. Very stingy with gems. Some of the missions aren't working. No new content. Very disappointed.
15,Angie Fletcher,"November 14, 2019",2, I cant facebook or email connect used to love this game 😭 now every other time i try to do something it just quits and goes to home screen and dosent even save progress i had made.
16,david gallegos,"October 8, 2018",3, Games okay I've played it off and on for years and it hasn't really changed much in all that time unfortunately I would love to see some more storage options that I don't have to shell out irl money for even just make it an option like you pay 499 crystals or 800k coins
17,John Jay,"November 22, 2019",4," Bit grindy, and i think it need and update or 2 but its still just as fun as it was when i was little"
18,Nick Boles,"April 14, 2020",5, I really fun game just needs to get tap joy fixed for extended rewards
19,Kathryn Stiles,"November 27, 2018",5, Amazing. Very fun and always something to aim for. Has good features that mean you can't waste too much time at once as you have to wait for things to get built etc.
20,Lee Harrington,"December 6, 2018",3, I like the game but takes too long to obtain coins . The Dino request let be realistic unable to get enough coins in less than 4 days.
21,Elmer Strickland,"October 22, 2018",5, Love this game.  Glad it finally works right again on iPhones.  Now I’m just trying to get back to where I was so many years ago with this game.
22,Nathan Sell,"November 22, 2019",3, Progress is too slow but the games foundation is cool

28,Isela G,"September 12, 2019",4," With the recent new update, the app unfortunately crashes every time I try to gift friends"
29,WillToLive,"October 2, 2019",5, The game needs to be optimized it runs poorly but nostalgia makes it better.
30,Dorothy Teggin,"February 9, 2020",5, Use this game lots as a 'mindful' aid. It's great to dip In and out of

Can't do any of that right now."

I understand you have other games that need your attention but you need to be loyal to the people who play Tiny Village.

I appreciate that there is opportunity to play through the goals, just taking a little bit more time, when you don't have many crystals. I don't mind making in app purchases, but because it isn't so forced, I will be more likely to buy crystals and continue playing. I would give it another star for just a little more excitement"

With no real competition, it is a good casual game to just make a happy little village and watch it grow. Overall, I really like Tiny Village. But there are some things that kept me from a full 5 stars. First of all, it is really hard to get coins in the beginning because of the lack of income. At level 5, you get the annual quests which uses a lot of coins. The other reason is that most things dont have build times listed, which is harder to plan."

It really is a classic, fun and addicting game without the usual complexity and cynicism of most modern mobile games. Unfortunately Tinyco doesnt treat it with respect and continue new content. Just because a game is older shouldnt mean it gets thrown away. People still play Doom from 1990..why? Its a classic. This is a classic for mobile games. Hopefully Tinyco will realize this is a classic worth keeping around!"
204,Crystal Edmondson,"March 26, 2015",2,Cute... but This game freezes often and gets very annoying with wanting you to make purchases right away instead of getting into the game first. It has several goals that come up right away that require purchase. Mmmm no thanks. I've had it less than a week. May try it again if this stuff is fixed.
205,Flibber De jibbet,"July 23, 2018",5," I used to play this game years ago and became so addicted I had to stop. 
Now I'm playing from scratch again and it's still so addictive! You can 
easily play without spending real money, and the time to wait for stuff and 
costs are not unreasonable. Love it!"

209,Hannah N,"August 30, 2015",4,Great game I love this game! Its really fun to play. The only problem is that it seems hard to keep/collect coins. Every time I go to buy something for a small amount like 5000 I come up about 3000 short! Otherwise its a great game.

224,A Google user,"June 12, 2017",4, Love this addictive game but I wish it wasn't so dependent on spending real cash to get ahead.  And I can't open it right now which is getting me very upset because time is money and resources in this game.  I need every tiny dime cause I cannot spend real cash to get what I need when I need it!
225,Omega Sans,"March 5, 2016",5,Its so cool I just come over first dinosaur and I love him. But there's one thing that I don't like about it they say that there is going to be a t-rex coming in your village😀
226,Christina Smith,"February 14, 2015",5,Great way to kill some time! I enjoy this game very much. I only wish that the game would allow for more opportunities to earn more crystals without having to pay for them. But if you're dedicated then you can create a happy little village without coming out of pocket. But only if you're willing to put forth the time & effort!

This was my first phone app game (I was very late in getting a smart phone) and was a very active player. My first smart phone was a ""starter phone"" and eventually had no memory so had to uninstall everything. I lost my original account due to this, but loved the game so much I started from scratch on my new note 4 last year. Which was hard to do going from lvl 30 to lvl 1. I wasn't as active due to this but did play everyday or 2. I was excited that for Christmas I got a tablet and transferred my game (which is easy and awesome BTW) and started playing a lot more. Which is why I've noticed the game is stuck in time. The rodeo theme is old old old and no bingo etc. Etc. I've tried your other games tiny monsters and tiny castle which are no fun at all they move so slowly and are so limited I uninstalled all of them. Idk why your neglecting tiny village, you should be concentrating more on it. You obviously have a huge fan base. So what's the deal Tiny co, resuscitate this game back to life!!

Give us our mission's and bingo back or you are gonna lose a lot of fans!!!!!"
375,Freya Baker-loveday,"August 6, 2015",4,It's okay The game is to do with building up a village using resources collected from different areas to then be made into items for money or to gift friends the only thing I would say as a downer is how expensive it is for money and gems.
376,Maxine Pullen,"December 29, 2018",5," I loved this game but have lost it, my village name was maxieworld and I played it for years"
377,Nathan Cuthbert,"April 2, 2016",5,Enjoyable game No problems with it and very fun.

382,Brad Hallett,"October 19, 2015",3, I like the game but it seems they are no longer supporting it the social part of the game  stopped working and despite reporting it nothing has been done to fix it the only game they seem interested in  is family guy very disappointing
383,Elese Weaver,"February 10, 2015",2,money The game is OK but it takes too long to get anywhere unless you are willing to spend money
384,A Google user,"March 9, 2017",5, Awesome game except once I sighned in onSocial Media and entered an email address it keeps shutting me down when I enter the Social media area!!!

386,AJ Ibarra,"September 25, 2015",4," It's a cool game but things cast way too much and it takes way too long just for some things to finish, this game really wants you to spend money on those crystals."
387,D hartman,"May 28, 2016",3," No support as with all tiny co games..no surprise, just what they do..bad customer service"
388,Heather Johnson,"November 23, 2015",5,"Great game! The emphasis on $$ is a bit daunting to beginners, but if you ignore those it is a great FREE game as well"
389,Kelly Detert,"February 9, 2015",1, Won't let me visit other village as I would like to do and it thoughts me out of the game
390,Akame,"November 7, 2017",1," This was one of the first game that I installed and for some reason it does not work anymore. I want to add my super old account but, I cannot because it does not let me it stops working on every device I use. I like this game but, it stops working."

392,kirsty hughes,"January 12, 2016",4, Fun so far. Not experienced any issues apart from how long it takes to get coins
393,A Google user,"November 29, 2016",5, Awesome game! Absolutely love it. Only wish you would make more levels. I've had to restart my village three times because originally I couldn't transfer my game and the last time because the transfer wouldn't work. Should make it easier to get crystals also

398,DAPHNE PEOPLES,"February 19, 2018",4," Are you guys still there,I've been playing sense day 1 you came out NOTHING NEW YET I GUESS I'M DONE PLAYING. TIME TO FIND A NEW GAME"
399,Nimsaway Pink,"January 18, 2018",3," I gave it 3 stars because the creators abandoned the game, if you want a limited time dino you'll never be able to get it. I believe a solution would be to make it based on your phone/tablet's calendar."
400,Julie Maxwell,"August 4, 2015",1,"Unhappy I spent $5 on this game.  And did not get the crystals, the habit, or the dino. Instead it said that I failed the  challenge. The same thing happened to me in Tiny Monsters and Tiny Castle. I  tried contacting the company, but so far no luck."
401,zack gerth,"October 17, 2017",1, It closes the game an frezzes everytime i click tiny social. Some of my quests include adding friends. I cant buy a coffee shop unless i add friends. I'm tierd of the game frezzing an closing out.
402,grandad at a wedding,"July 19, 2018",4," It's cute and addictive. The best part is that you don't have to spend real 
money to use most of it's fetaures and your village progresses in a 
reasonable pace."
403,A Google user,"April 10, 2016",1,Total Crap Don't make in-game purchases because they are way too expensive. Upgrading a house costs almost the same as buying a new house and the wait time is the same.  I think TinyCo has totally abandoned this game; no updates or new content in over 18 months. Total crap!
404,Heather Mantia,"August 5, 2015",5,New phone How can I get my old game back on my new phone. The old one is completely destroyed so I can't transfer from that phone. I was getting really far and I don't wanna start over

413,A Google user,"February 1, 2018",4, I wish there were more ways to get crystals n more coins but it helps time pass quicker! Also I wish bingo was back like when I originally had the app. The crystal tree would also be a big bonus!
414,kassi Gary,"August 14, 2015",5,Fun game! I play this game all the time and I can honestly say I'm addicted.
415,Jenna Schoeman,"August 21, 2017",3, A few annoying bugs. If you have it on mute then go up a level it takes you to a page that doesn't load then automatically puts the volume back on. Very annoying.
416,David Bendon,"June 3, 2015",5,Loved it Had it ages ago on other phone transferred it . magic rock lvl 2 got a dino lvl9 more money if you could upgrade gold capacity in Dino's house that would be really appritiated

2857,Hal,"August 2, 2014",4,I like it a lot The newly installed ads (well at least they weren't there last time I had it installed) are somewhat irritating but they only happen whenever you gain a level so it's not that bad.
2858,A Google user,"September 20, 2013",5,"Fix update please After the update I can't place dinos, freezes every time and force closes. I've been trying for days and no result. Fix the update and will give 5 stars."

2873,Mike Audleman,"September 8, 2013",1,Tried to like it but coins and ads killed it The constant popup ads when collecting coins are too much too often.  Also constantly pushing ads to get you to buy gems every time you start the game.  Spent 3 days trying to get coins to build a store with to try to make more coins.  Gave up. Uninstalled.

2876,Sharde' Kay,"March 18, 2014",4,This game is suoer fun but.. I wish we could deposit coins and resources towards expanding and rock upgrades instead of having everything up front. Then as soon as we get all the money and resources deposited it starts upgrading!
2877,Jack Seddon,"June 7, 2014",4,Awesome game As far as I could see this is a great game but the only problem is that you have to cpmplete quest and buy gems but you cant find them.

2883,A Google user,"December 1, 2013",1,"HTC one s Would you guys cut the cost in  expanding your village already, over 60 million coins to expand is OUTRAGEOUS, one star for now and bingo is a fraud, don't waste your crystals because you won't get your prize"
2884,Michaela Ann Dvoracek,"October 1, 2013",3,"It's okay I like this game, but I think it's dumb that your village ""doesn't have enough room"" even when there's plenty of room to put stuff down. Makes completing goals irritating, and nearly impossible."

A sad individual that has actually spent real money on pretend money, the game now has explained it cannot expand the land anymore. Game over, lesson learnt.  Prices that just don't justify the product, $50 to drop on three add-ons to clear the to-do task list of one icon, that's a grocery bill!!  Instead you have bought a very low res. 2d sprite on a mobile device. A sad indictment of modern values. Beware!"

7896,A Google user,"January 25, 2013",2,Would be a good game if... This game would be fun if it weren't constantly force closing. Every time I try to visit neighbors or buy something it force closes. I've notified the developers several times and yet nothing seems to have been done. Your game gets a rating of two stars because you refuse to fix the bugs.

We should be given more crystals for progress. M

I do want to note that the animation of the 2D characters in a seemingly 3D space needs some work. I'm not an expert in animation, but I would think it is a simple enough thing to fix. It is also something I have noticed in other games by this developer and unfortunately it really drags the gameplay down."
7899,A Google user,"December 17, 2012",4," My little boy loves this game. I just wish someone would put out a similar game and make it cheaper. I would buy crystals if it didn't cost so much.

8035,Libby Williams,"January 8, 2013",1,"Won't load! Only downloaded this game as a way to transfer my tiny monsters to another Android device. But it won't load, and keeps saying ""can't connect to server"". Please fix!"
8036,A Google user,"November 22, 2012",4,Frustratingly fun Can't buy crystals so missed out on all bday specials.  Sometimes I don't get my resources... When I open game after few hours the resource count is the same.  Many fixes work great ... But I really want to buy some crystals because I'm  missing out on some great stuff.  Id is dannoman.
