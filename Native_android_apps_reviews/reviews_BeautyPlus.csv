And the filters aren't obvious at all. I wish I could show before and after pics so u can see for yourself. This app has figured out how to highlight everyones beauty (especially for girls like me with light skin and fine features which usually make me look completely different om a regular camera and not in a good way). Perfect for anyone who isn't photogenic like me. oh! It has a ton of free stuff and no ads.💞

2572,Angel Logic,"December 19, 2018",4, good app but the lighting changes after you take a photo. It adds a purple filter even when you have all filters off? I can't figure out how to turn it off and it is very frustrating because it's not a pretty color.
2573,Anime Player,"April 12, 2019",5, I personally love this app. It is one of the first beauty apps that I love. The rest have cameras which are way too dark. I was expecting a dark camera but I got a pleasant surprise instead. I love this app and reccomend it to everyone.
