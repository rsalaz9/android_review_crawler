That way when going through profiles, I feel it's more likely to match with someone on a basic level right off the bat rather than learning these things after and wasting energy and time on someone who was never really a good match to begin with."

I'm heavily built and only ~15 lbs overweight for my frame. I would prefer someone from near to better shape than myself. Not only is there no way to choose such an option, but about 85 of the about 100 women it has shone me, so far, have double my body fat or more. It also daily, gives you a notification, we think you and xxx should meet. Not one so far would I remotely consider."

Detailed, full profiles selected by specific preferences, it encourages you to start a conversation and really fill out your profile, and there is instant messaging, liking and picture viewing all without paying a thing! It is also well built and runs smoothly, certainly doesn't feel like a half baked app, and the option to boost is reasonably priced, and not shoved in your face. The only thing is the distance selection is a bit broad. Good app üëç"

14,Jaimie Martyn,"April 25, 2020",5," I really like how this app prompts more conversations rather than the popular one where people just match and don't chat half the time.

The ""date from home"" function is infuriating, constantly popping up in the way and there's no way to remove it, even if you've ticked ""yes"" on that person. The chat often defaults to the top, even if you have a big string of text messages, so each time you open you have to scroll down (after lowering the ""date from home""). Worst of all. I'm a single parent with an awesome kid. I had it set, clearly, to show that I have kids. Its set to visible. When I view my own profile, it shows. BUT. Those that I'm matched with can't see this. I discovered this this afternoon when chatting with someone amazing that I was meant to go on a (safe distance) date with. I told her, (nicely) rejected. Heartbreaking!"

Also, when you need to report inappropriate photos or profile content, the process is so frustrating, you want to give up doing a report. Four questions deep, you're forced to provide comments on the offensive content. Are you supposed to describe the inappropriate parts for the staff's entertainment? Nonsense."

29,Marissa Shaye,"April 19, 2020",4," With the free version, there is no way to wait on a match if you're unsure before connecting/reaching out. They say premium members can see all their matches at once, but under the free version you have to either permanently X or start a conversation with a match to see the next profile."

I like how user friendly it is, but dear god, you would think that the algorithm is backwards. Tinder is way better. The girls I think are attractive or ""like"" never show up anymore, the ones I don't want to see are the ONLY ones I see. Hinge picked someone as my ""closest match"". It was an overweight special needs girl. Deleted the app in the end because like I said, Tinder is actually better."
46,Janet L,"April 25, 2020",2, It used to be better. My chats are glitchy. I use to get lots a matches but it seems like Hinge isn't showing me my matches or not showing my profile to potential suitors. Maybe they want money from the extra boost feature üòë

Go broke and be an afterthought."
50,Jake Russell,"April 9, 2020",5," Love the way this app works. It's not about swiping right on half naked photos, but instead it teaches you just enough about someone to genuinely be interested in them. The connections are so much more real than any other dating app I've used."

54,Dave J,"April 24, 2020",5," The apps seems fun and it's nice to have found one that is honest with the description. Used it for an hour, but my country is incompatible with it. An hour of looking through profile and all the women are fat. I'm appalled, I guess I'll just wait for the virus to pass and try at the gym."
55,Ishan Vashisht,"April 17, 2020",4, Everything is great except for 1 thing. I keep seeing the people I rejected again and again. Newer people are way below the pile. It's frustrating to reject those people all over again. And there are many spam profiles who are selling sexual services. Please Check it out
56,Ryan C,"April 12, 2020",2, App is seriously glitched. I've gotten the same recommended person five times in a few hours after I've X'd them multiple times. And people I've written in the past day keep popping up in the rotation. A bit frustrating and annoying for a paid app.
57,Melisa,"April 16, 2020",3," I like the prompts aspect compared to other dating apps. BUT being asked to pay such a large amount for the premium features of a dating app is absurd... Also there appear to be glitches as I have ""X'ed"" on the same people numerous times and they keep appearing."
58,Laura Hitchings,"April 14, 2020",5," Easy to set up, easy to use, more real content and less filler. Lots of great guys with similar interests. Loving it so far. Had technical difficulties connecting Instagram though. Still unresolved, grr."
59,Brad Lipman,"April 16, 2020",4," I like the format and differences between it and the other dating apps. The ridiculously low number of ""likes"" you get each day without paying holds it back from 5 stars. And I'm a fairly picky person..."
60,Will Fordham,"April 22, 2020",3, Cannot upload more than one photo and the mechanism for responding to likes is unclear. Those connections are also missing on the likes screen. Clunky yet the prompts seem like a good idea.
61,Kelly Kobliska,"April 25, 2020",4, Very geared towards dating. Not a fan of all of the things you have to pay for. Hate that I have to pay for unlimited likes. But I do like the virtual date option!!!
62,Matthew Citty,"April 17, 2020",5," The free version is honestly amazing, there's no ads or spam profiles that I've found. I can tell bc I only have a few in my area, but it's great for casual conversation over long distance."
63,Jennifer Riley,"April 24, 2020",5," A great dating app so far. I'm enjoying it much more than Tinder. It's much easier to use, and I've actually made a real connection with someone who actually wants to hold a conversation."
64,R F,"April 15, 2020",5," This is honestly the best app for people seeking genuine connections. I really enjoy that, for free, I can reach out and say something to someone I'm interested in. Sometimes that personal comment after viewing a profile adds a lot.....quality app!"
65,Nathan Chelsea fan,"April 13, 2020",5," I have tried plenty of dating apps. As of 04/13/20 this one is the best! I don't even have a date. Yet, the layout is designed to make communication a two way street. A form of application accountability. I love it! Hopefully, I find Mrs. right!"
66,Darshita Rastogi,"April 24, 2020",4, Better than tinder! Nice crowd. And interesting UI/UX. You wont find pervs here (Exceptions are always there). Easy to function and there new feature of online dating is pretty killer idea! üî•

70,Tony Fantastic,"April 13, 2020",3," Some glitches in the app. Losing entire conversations for a bit, then they reappear. Otherwise it's pretty good for finding people to ghost or get ghosted by...because that's really what we do, right?"

72,Mick F,"April 20, 2020",1, App freezes when trying to upload pics from phone. Even though hinge has full access to photos. Other apps dont have this problem and all you get is generic help. Obviously I have to give 1 star since I cant even finish my profile. Too bad
73,Natasha Brandon,"April 20, 2020",3, Not a bad app but people tend to just stop talking or will make a connection and thats it. If you make a connection and don't plan to carry-on with it why make the connection in the 1st place.
74,Andy LePage,"April 19, 2020",5," Hinge is the best of the dating apps in my opinion. The UI is very intuitive, you are able to keep initial messages short (because you have to) and you have a chance to really engage with people you are interested in."

76,mike brillhat,"April 20, 2020",4," REFRESHING. Is my first thought. Its not mindless swiping. You have to actually put an effort in and explain yourself and so do others. Now do i match with people.....ehhhhhh, but thats a me problem. Overall great app."
77,Rebecca Frankland,"April 18, 2020",5," This is the BEST dating app. It makes online dating feel more natural than other apps. Instead of trying to come up with something to say, you can simply comment on someone's picture or description! I would highly recommend this app."
78,Jeff Young,"April 17, 2020",5," Best dating app out there. Not designed to manipulate you into buying credits or making you play games, no really lame daily messages telling you to check your prospects, thoughful prompts, either party can take action and make moves."

80,PMONEY502,"April 11, 2020",1," This site is full of catfishers and ghosts. Since membership is free, they have no financial risk in playing games or wasting your time. Your time is better spent on places where people seem more genuine. I recommend Match or some place where people seek to have honest intentions."
81,Toyosi James Abdulai,"April 22, 2020",4," It is kind of slow not as user friendly as I would like ( when you leave a conversation and come back, you end up at the beginning of the conversation)"
82,Jim Ritter,"April 25, 2020",5, The best dating app hands down with no robots. Buy the membership and you meet real people. This app absolutely destroys all the other and it's not even close. 5 stars all the way.

85,Jonathan Rocket,"April 18, 2020",5," So far so good. Have to say that this has been the best experience on a dating app that I have had thus far. With the exception of the pay wall, but in this day and age that's pretty universal to all dating apps."

Its more personal than tinder yet less time consuming for setting up a profile compared to Okcupid. Somewhat comparable to Bumble except both sexes can say hey first. The prompts for conversations are genius and Ive already talked to some super cute guys who seem to really have stuff in common with me!
88,Autumn Parker,"April 24, 2020",4, This is a more serious dating app where I feel individuals are more intentional in taking the time to create profiles for dating purposes and not just hook ups like that of Tinder. I'm enjoying myself and I'm matching with people I actually realistically see myself getting to know and perhaps date.
89,Mirella Ruiz,"April 25, 2020",2, Nice app and the only negative consideration is the 10 likes per day only. You can have more likes but you need to upgrade the profile and pay for it.
90,J Richardson,"April 22, 2020",4, Better than the other dating apps! You can like and leave comments about a profile or a picture. Leads to more meaningful conversations.
91,Joshua Whitney,"April 25, 2020",5, Overall pretty nifty and clean. Annoyingly the transition between 'Chat' and 'Profile' tabs can be a bit glitchy. Otherwise a smooth app.
92,S Lynch,"April 12, 2020",4, I've had more interactions on this app than any other. It really does promote more conversations. The only thing I wish it had was a dark mode option in for the ui.
93,Kendra Buchanan,"April 22, 2020",4, I like how you can interact and like certain part of a person's profile and not just the pictures. You get limited like per day unless you upgrade.

99,Kiaya Pruitt,"April 12, 2020",4," I like the app. The only thing is that I was not aware that i would have to pay to keep liking people. Otherwise, I really like the vibe of this app. It is a major difference from Tinder."
100,Antonio Vega,"April 17, 2020",4, Unmatch people shouldnt be allowed to still message you..also wish there was more options to what look for in a person..such as what member is looking for and if person is active or what language they speak
101,piyush rajput,"April 16, 2020",4," For me Hinge is by far the best dating app amongst the ones that claim to find you like minded to connect. Where it could improve is on adding features in its interface, such as liking other people's comments, GIfs etc."
102,Mario Almanza,"April 23, 2020",1, complete waste of time. This app is designed to get you to purchase the subscription.. and even if you do that you'll still only get minimal matches...
103,Chitra Anand,"April 14, 2020",5, The only issue I've had is we can't share photos with our matches ...but besides that it's better than majority of the dating apps available in the market!
104,Ali Nabavi,"April 10, 2020",3, It seems like this app is improving. The quality of the profiles is much better than before. I haven't been bothered by bots nearly as much recently.
105,Brett Bauduin,"April 12, 2020",1," The app only allows you up to 5 likes per day, and the profiles it shows first are obviously the most liked people so chances of finding a match are slim unless you're flawless."

108,Jerry Atanga,"April 14, 2020",2, Bittersweet.Liking and matching is a bit ambiguous.Will be nice to know if ones message has been read or not after matching with someone and have a limit of 2 messages to send until the other person responds.
109,Yoe Lin,"April 18, 2020",2," Questions are too vague to really get a feel for someone's sense of humour or personality. Also everyone seems not real. Haha like all the dudes are super good looking, that's not even how it is in real life."
110,Jessica Lehrer,"April 20, 2020",5, I really like the limited likes and the fact that the profiles are rather short. You make a choice and start a convo to learn more about each other.
111,Gautham Reddy,"April 14, 2020",3," A very nice app. Decent and more importantly, it works. However, it's using my data like never before and also after the update the application isn't working properly."
112,Addison Beaver,"April 9, 2020",5, Probably the best paid dating app I've used. A unique approach that opposes your typical swipe left/swipe right garbage. You can actually respond to prompts or photos to grab someone's interest.

Then you try the other apps out there which have been gobbled up by Match and require you to pay for *everything,* and you can't help but think that it would be more lucrative if they kept people single and clinging to this thing."

222,Bryan B,"April 3, 2020",4," App works well. A lot of functionality for a free app. A major flaw is the ""location"", which can be extremely vague.

223,Jessica Benton,"April 14, 2020",1," I like that you get limited likes because it makes the process more meaningful. The major downside is with fake profiles.

256,CurvingFyre,"April 3, 2020",4," New to dating apps. Not a great track record so far, but I'll give it 4 stars cause you can at least get matches without buying stuff, which is better than most ""free apps"", though I'm convinced it saves the best matches until you run out of free likes for the day."

Pros: very easy-to-use interface, appears to be genuine users and not fake profiles, known for people looking for long-term dating, reliable with notifications assuming your settings are set correctly on your phone, various prompts that are fun to answer, and requires 6 pictures to even start liking other users' profiles. Cons: profiles feel limited with only allowing you to write 3 short sections to answer prompts, unable to write long introduction messages to users after liking something about their profile, only available as a phone app and not a website to use on your computer, only shows city/town you live in not the state (which is hard since I live near a state border), when un-matching a user you are required to answer why you don't like the user but most answers are regarding sexual harassment or abuse (which is a scary thought) and not related to attributes related to the user. A few other things I cannot think of at the moment. Again, good app, but I haven't found anyone yet.

EDIT: After deleting my profile for a break I am unable to log back in. This issue has been going on for days. Not so impressed!
368,Simone G,"February 10, 2020",3," Used this for a bit but hit a pay wall after 30 minutes of use as it limits the number of people you can 'like' before you have to start paying. Not worth paying for the main feature of a dating up, liking to get matches, upgrading to unlock additional features is fine."
369,Brian Aiton,"February 9, 2020",1," Horrible. The UI is great but finding a match is horrible. I set it up to find people of a specific age range and location and I'm getting people of all ages, all over the country. They all look like they're from Hollywood too. Very glamorous, professional pictures. Seems very fake to me"
370,ashley oferrell,"February 17, 2020",4," So far so good. You can pay for more things if you like, but it doesn't block you from talking to people if you just keep it free. Like the prompts for pitctures and the questions, makes it eaiser to send that first message if Im interested in them."

389,Stephanie Bednarz,"April 3, 2020",4," It's a good app. I like that there are prompts and an visually appealing structure. People seem appropriate, but it doesn't tell you what type of relationship they are looking for. However, it's nice that they say if they do drugs, marijuana and smoke."

The way it encourages interactions between people is a renaissance in the dating app world, kudos to the developers!"

427,Will Duffek,"March 8, 2020",4," It's better than most dating apps. It's a little more effort since you have to both be desirable and come up with some witty comment, but it leads to more matches. My experience has been that women never send likes/comments so it's pretty much on guys to come up with stuff, but that may be just me."

429,Matthew Cline,"March 25, 2020",2," I thought at first this app was great, I was getting hits. But then I found out that Android and Apple products behave differently. Sometimes I will get messages on one platform and not the other. My suggestion is to move away from the app and text directly, the messaging can be a bit flawed."

The guys on here are truly nice and looking for love, friendship and they aren't push or rude or make overtly sexual comments etc. No creepy hookups or one night stand kinda site(no judgements if that's what you like) but I couldn't be happier about that. Who would've thought a site you're supposed to delete was so lovable and keepable."
432,Grace P,"March 23, 2020",4," Exponentially better than Tinder, and a lot better than Bumble. You can like individual parts of someone's profile, plus you get individual suggestions of who's most compatible with you. Unfortunately, all the creeps from the other apps will eventually make their way to this app as well"
433,Kevin Wiese,"March 28, 2020",5, I just like Hinge versus the other apps because it does a good job of encouraging you to comment on their profile instead of just liking something and it immediately notifies that person of your like. It's all very transparent and designed to easily get a conversation going
434,Kaitlyn Nichols,"April 2, 2020",4," I like it, it's a very pleasant app. I wish there was a little more information you could put about yourself or read about others. The only thing is that it freezes and I have to reopen it every little while."
435,Kaz Neuro Therapist,"April 13, 2020",5, Great app. Lots of sincere serious people about wanting to meet. Less attention seekers or time wasters

437,William Blair,"April 4, 2020",3," It is a great app ONLY if you pay for the full version. I imagine most people don't pay for it, so you're really missing out on great people because they can't even see if you liked or messaged them unless they paid."
438,Lewis Sanderson,"April 12, 2020",5, It is by far the best out of the rest of them. You get to see who likes you and your profile is more visible.

440,Jordan Hubscher,"February 12, 2020",4," I know my phone may be old now (samsung galaxy s7) however I'm experience some UX issues. When I get a match and I click reply, nothing happens on screen. Yet when I ""cancel"", the conversation appears in my matches. So it does technically work. It just doesnt transition to the appropriate screen."
441,alexandria johnson,"February 28, 2020",5," So far I am really enjoying this app. I haven't run into any unwanted contact, the people seem ""genuine"" (to an extent), and the conversations have been absolutely lovely. I would reccomend this app to people who want to try online dating!"
442,Flashgrand,"February 28, 2020",4," Probably one of the better dating apps. I've met few people of here, all normal (which makes a change!) I've come across no bots or spam accounts (which also makes a nice change). I'd happily recommend this app. Only thing I'd suggest is to allow more likes."

445,Estephanie,"March 25, 2020",4," It's definitely easier to use than other dating apps. When you run out of likes it doesn't let you know when your likes amount refreshes so you have to wait until an unknown time to send new likes. Other than that, it's a pretty decent app."
446,Mark Colborn,"March 27, 2020",5," I like how it is set up to make it so you have to talk to somebody if you like them. Most other dating sites you can just like dozens of people and never talk to them, but then look at their profile whenever you want. This one actually forces you to chat to ever look at them again. Good design."
447,Josh Giammatteo,"March 29, 2020",1," Had the app for about three months now. Get a bunch of connections. However, not a single one responds at ALL. Kinda have a feeling it's not a coincidence and majority of these profiles are fake. At least that's what I tell myself haha"
448,Raven Roses,"April 1, 2020",5, Great for Gender nonconforming Individuals! App lets you list as what you identify as easily and does a great job matching you with individuals you may have things in common with leading to meaningful conversations! I totally recommend it!
449,Ken Nugget,"April 6, 2020",4, Pretty easy to use interface. It allows for a decent volume of matches and I like that users can break the ice with prompts and/or picture comments. Wish it was easier to sort and sift through existing matches - it's a bit cluttered there.
450,jacklynn stott,"April 8, 2020",4," Great UX and seems to draw in a good crowd of people, and the app keeps adding cool features. Still finding it hard to know who is worth pursuing because the info is limited for what you can show."
451,Kiddbug4732,"April 11, 2020",3, Many fake profiles. You have no idea where the people are actually located because it doesn't show distance. A person can be overseas but their profile location is New York.

506,Jonathan Bailey,"March 26, 2020",1," I can tell you why this app is designed to be ""deleted."" The selection is horrible. Your number of swipes are limited unless you pay. This is not worth paying for. I am deleting it NOT because I found someone there, but because this app is subpar."

511,tariq green,"February 6, 2020",4," Much better than tinder, I like how personal the questions get so you really have a good idea of what the person you like are into and not into. So it makes striking a conversation much easier and much more genuine. Great app."
512,R Paylay,"February 18, 2020",1," Let me tell you why this app is ""Designed to be deleted"" You can only chat with the last person you matched with!?

I've had the most success with actually meeting people from this app over all the others I've tried in the past (Bumble, Tinder, OKCupid, EliteSingles).

514,Rachel Josie,"February 29, 2020",3, I like the profiles set up. It's not just a swiping type of app. You really check profiles and see if you are on the same page. Flaw: it keeps crashing on me or freezing. You have limited likes per day free.

So far, it seems legit And I was pleased that I haven't seen one person yet that I had seen on other dating sites. I've chatted with a few people. That said, women keep your defenses up because I am finding the usual rifraf that you find on dating apps, ie. scammers with fake profiles, guys that have a significant other and/or are just looking for sex.

519,Elijah Hutchinson,"March 18, 2020",4, It's nice for a free dating site. The prompt idea is neat but leads the profiles to start looking far to similar to each other. Most people using it don't seem to be looking for one night stands which is nice.

521,asif akhtar,"March 5, 2020",5, this is the best 'dating app' in the market right now. it makes starting and having conversations a very natural process and gives you agency over who you interact with and how. its not based on swipes but on quality of interaction in a very personalizable way.
522,Varun Shivdasani,"April 1, 2020",3, It's ok...not many matches and the ones I skip or message keep reappearing..almost like there are only 10 people! Also I moved from London to Loughborough and updated that on my app but it still.shows me matches from london instead of Loughborough?
523,Michael Holley,"February 21, 2020",1," Don't WASTE your time on this app. It randomly bans you without any notice, and all the time and effort you've put into creating a profile, finding people you like, and developing connections through conversations will all be wasted. Find apps who care more about their users."
524,Sylvon McSween,"February 8, 2020",5," To be honest this is better than those popular dating sites like POF, tinder etc, the people you meet are actual people.

525,TheAgent,"February 23, 2020",4," Actually pretty surprising, honestly like it's a bit slow at first and sometimes you run out of likes (if you are a free user) however once you start going you start to meet a few people and it's just great."
526,Sarah Abou,"February 24, 2020",3," The user interface on the Android is weird. You can be typing and it goes all the way back to the top of the conversation. Also, it's super easy to send your text when you're not looking. It happened a few times and it slipped."
527,nathan aardvark,"March 3, 2020",5," Easy to use. Less about looks, though it's important, more about personality, and Hinge manages to leverage that really well, giving you enough of a chance to express yourself and play on the expressions of others. Never disappointed."
528,Isaac Elgersma,"March 6, 2020",1," The gif delivery system is horrific. You click on the gif. It sends the url, which the person you are talking to has to then click, completely interrupting the flow of the conversation. Just send the gif. Its just as easy as copying the text."
529,Elizabeth Suzanne,"March 18, 2020",3," So far so good in matches, however the limit of ability to send out a ""like"" is hindered without being a paying member. Not very helpful to people looking for a partner while remaining frugal."

Fix this junk or take it down you are stealing folks money!
533,Rob Bishopp,"April 2, 2020",4, Compared to Tinder this is actually showing me women I like so I'd say it's considerably better. I have a feeling it tracks physical traitsin the background even though you don't get to choose and shows you people based off of that.
534,Freya Porter,"April 7, 2020",3," Sometimes when I match with a message, the message doesn't send and it says ""You invited X to start the chat"" instead. The app is glitchy but apart from that it has a good premise."

539,Stephanie Drumright,"February 24, 2020",4," The app is generally good. Easy to upload pics and answer prompts. Every now and then the chat and some profiles don't load, forcing you to shut down the app and reopen. Overall, good experience though."
540,Maximilian Smith,"March 15, 2020",4," Having technical difficulties with messages I send with likes not going through. Besides that... It's fine.

541,ultra sonic,"March 5, 2020",3, I'm revising my rating now that I've set up a new account. I'm going to say this is one of the best dating apps out there having tried most for an extended period. Docking them a star just on the lack of Dev response and support. A solid 4 if you never need or want to get help from them.
542,Sarah Hodge,"February 17, 2020",3, It's okay. There's so few guys on in my area that it would show thr same 5 guys over and over. I'm having far better luck with other apps. I'm also not a fan of the question system on the profiles. I like a simple bio.
543,Lauren HB,"February 11, 2020",1, Less than 1/4 of the time pictures of the members don't load. This is a known issue with the app after a Google search. Hard to connect with someone if you can't see what they look like with the 3 small prompts. Hinge is more like a blind dating app

These prompts are generally awkward and alien feeling, only really giving any value to the type of people who take social media way too seriously, or try too hard to blend in.

545,Milan Gupta,"February 24, 2020",4," User friendly, organised and clutter free. Easy to get used to, especially if you had been bored or disapponited with other apps like tinder and others. Definitely better crowd too. Could have allowed more free likes, hence 4 stars."
546,Jezzikah Rainbow,"March 6, 2020",3," Like most other apps if you don't pay for it, it's very limited. A good thing about the app is there is a lot of people on it so when your outta swipes it reloads more people using the app rather than say there's no one around you."
547,O N,"March 14, 2020",1," Broken. Recent updated seems to have made the app unusable. It doesn't seem to be sending/storing my responses. I've had to say no to the same profiles for over a week. Each time I reload the app, it shows the same people again as waiting for a response."

558,Sandra Anderson,"February 26, 2020",3, Some what difficult to navigate. Not alot of matches and matches have come through way beyond my 51 mile limit I had set. Sometimes the message done button does not connect to send messages without messing around with spacing or things.

565,Andrew Wadham,"April 5, 2020",5, Pros: The app and the way it was designed is amazing. It's really easy to start a conversation amd connect with someone. Cons: Not a lot of people in my area but that's not the developers fault.
566,Loudweige Jean,"April 11, 2020",4," Hinge is pretty reliable in allowing for people to get a match in my opinion. I definitely get more matches here than any other dating app out there. Usually I would try out a dating app for like a week or two then delete them. If you actually put real pictures and be yourself, you'll get matches."
567,Emily,"March 5, 2020",4," It's nice to have prompts so you can include details about yourself that you wouldn't normally think of while trying to write a profile from scratch. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the limited likes unless you pay extra, but they've gotta make money somehow."
568,Sean White,"February 13, 2020",5, App works pretty well. Only approvement I could suggest is that it takes a while for the app to narrow the selection pool when you change preferences such as distance. Had to kill the app and restart. Not a big deal though
569,Kelly Yockey,"March 4, 2020",4," I'm happy with it thus far, I have not upgraded nor do I think you should have too. I like that you cant just swipe through you have to decide, but I wish there was and option to do undecided. All in all pleased with the app."

583,Jeremy Thomson,"March 18, 2020",5," Probably my favorite of the free dating apps. This is probably the best one for making a more meaningful connection, not just hooking up. Being able to send a message with a like is significantly better than just swiping."
584,over arren,"March 18, 2020",4, Seems good. I like that I can actually speak to women first on this app unlike others. Id say that's the main difference between bumble. It's also nice they make you fill out the whole profile.
585,Evslice,"March 22, 2020",3," Needs to have its chat setup fixed. Everytime I open a convo, its scrolled all the way to the top and I have to scroll down to see what i am responding to. Plus, the date ready tab gets in the way of the convo."
586,Cheyenne Gooding,"March 27, 2020",4, Great dating app. Ove tried other apps and this one is the best for me. Not sure exactly why it works so much better. I do find issues with the responsiveness

So imagine my dissapointment when I open the app to find I had been banned without any notice or even a reason"
588,Evan Cohen,"April 2, 2020",4," The app is great, but too many users have message notifications turned off which makes it hard to communicate. Hinge should incentivise users to turn on notifications through whatever means."
589,Andrew Amerson,"April 10, 2020",1," People have been banned for nothing,with no explanation. Really ridiculous system"
590,Alex Kauffman,"April 9, 2020",4," My first experience with online dating. It has a simple and effective design, and most of the people on here are actually looking for relationships. Better than just simple swiping and actually has information about the person."
591,Phillip Cano,"April 16, 2020",1, Couldnt get passed the phone number verification (too many log in attempts)
592,Michelle Johnson,"April 20, 2020",4, Great app to meet but needs more profile information options and more pictures to get to know them more
593,Tristan Peregrine,"April 23, 2020",4, Having an actual look at a person before accepting or rejecting is far better than just swiping on a photo
594,Tom Valcanis,"February 20, 2020",2," A good idea and fun, but the technical bugs are getting worse. The chat function is broken. I'm not getting notifications despite turning them on manually. Please fix."
595,Matt Peterson,"February 23, 2020",2," Plenty of people worth meeting, but the application itself is a slow, glitchy trainwreck. Some of the issues have been fixed since I first reviewed, but the app remains unstable."
596,Marc Poirier,"February 5, 2020",5, So far this is the best experience I've had on any of the dating apps. It encourages actual conversations and doesn't force you to pay to see who likes you and the only pay wall is how many people you can like in a day. So overall a very refreshing experience
597,A Google user,"February 14, 2020",1, The app is great but I'm giving it a one-star because it asked me 50 times if I would like to rate the app in between sending messages. Didn't give me an option to cancel and notreview it just kept asking over and over forcing this review on me which is not my favorite thing.
598,Seth Ferreri,"February 25, 2020",5," Lots of matches and good quality women. It kind of sucks running out of likes though. The distance feature seems to not be working as I keep getting people from over 100 miles away, but that may be because there is no one else near me on the app."
599,Jim O'Donnell,"February 26, 2020",1, Terrible. Wish I could get my money back. I keep getting profiles with things I set as dealbreakers. No way to search for people. Profiles are almost useless with barely any info to go on other than looks. Don't waste time or money.
600,Daniel Lee,"February 29, 2020",2, Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Lately it doesn't save information like who you are interested in and removed profiles. No point of using this if you start over every time you open the app.

Never came across anyone I knew on the site, never wrote or posted any remotely inappropriate in my page or to others. There's no way to appeal or contact them about it. Apparently they don't take ""violations"" seriously at all. The app and the team behind it are garbage."
602,Ms. NaitoChan,"March 11, 2020",1, Hinge straight up doesn't work anymore. On two separate phones I've had the same problem with verification. The text never sends so you can never get the code to make an account.
603,Xavier Gomez,"March 13, 2020",4," Can you really rate an app where the subject is you, at some point you can't believe the app is the issue and it's the fact that people think you aren't attractive enough therefore worth the time to chat with. Not 5 stars because I'm in that boat. Lol"
604,Steven Payne,"March 11, 2020",4," Went on one date and really hit it off matches are few but seem to be quality so far, she ghosted me but not the apps fault. Would recommend for busy people who want to put themselves out there. Location filters could use some work though I'm getting matches more than 2 hours away."
605,A M,"March 16, 2020",5, Im enjoying the app. I love the questions and when I sent an email I received an answer back within a day. I also love the discretion and privacy when sending a report on someone. Thank you.
606,Brendan Leighton,"March 25, 2020",3," Unable to do interactions with others because my profile isn't complete. I go to edit my profile and it says it's 100% complete. I' not seeing any indication on how ""complete"" my profile needs to be."
607,Bearpaw 991,"March 26, 2020",5," App works well, it's not necessary to pay to get matches normally, only complaint is there's a low limit of intros you can do otherwise this app is better than anything out there truly, and no I'm not paid too say this"
608,Zachary Larson,"April 7, 2020",5, Biggest pro is people seem to respond to messages. Everyone on the map seems to be here with purpose. So it's been great. Nice format too.

I don't understand why there are so many on this site when they are obvious to spot. Here are some easy ones ""antique seller"", ""cashier at Walmart in NYC"", "" US army infantry in NYC*, ""I want you to eat my clam"", ""È¶ôÊ∏ØÂ§ßÂ≠¶"". I can go on and on. Hinge really has to do a better job at reducing this because I don't see nearly as many on other sites."
610,Colin C,"April 23, 2020",3, It has gotten buggy - I will get shown the same people after already sending a comment leading me to believe Hinge is just dropping the messages...
611,Jeremy Nussle,"February 7, 2020",4," No real results yet but the concept is sound and the app functions well. Friends of Facebook friends, for me, includes people all over the world, so not most precise in that way."
612,Son Trinh,"February 7, 2020",5," Great app, clean, easy to use and concept really helps facilitate connections and communications much better compared to the other apps out there. Highly recommended!"
613,Jodi Duncan,"February 15, 2020",5, This is the best dating app I've found so far. It's not the traditional swipe left or right. You actually learn a bit about a person's personality and playful side with prompting questions. So far I love it!
614,Liam Galliv,"February 19, 2020",5," This has been better than any other app by far. The suggested matches are actually pretty good, and the profiles are just laid out better to try and get conversations going!"
615,Victoria Shiffler-Roche,"February 22, 2020",5," SO MUCH BETTER THAN TINDER. Seriously, people are much more intentional on this app, whereas Tinder is the hook-up app for a reason. If you're looking for a serious relationship, or people to chat with with intention, this is the place. üëç"
616,Dan Koz,"February 24, 2020",3," The match making formula, doesnt work, not sure whos calibrating the data. To determine a good match for someone. But they're formula needs to be tweeked with. Its not working and i think they're screwing with me"
617,Jon Carver,"March 6, 2020",4, A nice combination of impulsive (swipe right/left) apps and other services which require lots of overhead to setup. So far (after two weeks of use) the platform and it's members are keeping me engaged.
618,WinterZune,"March 14, 2020",1," Interesting idea, no support whatsoever. Randomly got banned one day and they're almost impossible to reach. No appeals, explanation or even an email! Nothing, just account gone. Bad experience, can't recommend."
619,Drew Poepping,"April 7, 2020",4," Overall pretty good, every once in a while I dont get a notification for a new match/message, but aside from that a great app."
620,Christian Navarro,"April 11, 2020",5, Only been a day but already a much better experience than ive had on other apps. No ghost accounts thus far and actually quite a few responses
621,Javier Urquizu,"April 15, 2020",5," Probably my favorite dating app. More intentional than Tinder, but not as serious as CMB. Match rate is also somewhere in between Tinder & CMB üëçüèΩ"
622,Alexandra Tikhonova,"April 19, 2020",4, The only part I dislike is that I have to pay for more matches!
623,Jake Jager,"March 28, 2020",5, Great dating app! Works well on my phone and not many ads polluting the service. Sometimes it can glitch but for the most part it's a descent app to find local guys.
624,Raquira Randle,"February 4, 2020",1," Terrible matching strategy, same guys over and over who are scared to message you plus they want you to pay to be able to swipe left or right after a certain amount. So far, just not worth the download."
625,TreBion Prince,"February 9, 2020",4, So far it' been a decent app. I like the interface and the use of prompts to help bring out personalities. I don't like that I am limited on the number of likes I can have/give without signing up for preferred.
626,Justice Negron,"March 2, 2020",3, Ehh. Kinda wordy and confusing as to how to match with people so far. And theres so few likes. Also you must have 6 pics and answer some lame questions. It's a bit annoying. I think I prefer bumble or tinder. Its simpler
627,RonnocTheBlock,"March 5, 2020",4," tbh i think this is better than tinder, the quality of matches are there. and you have things to start the convo off so its easier. it is esentially your opener. would give it more stars if you could like more ppl. i think theres to few"
628,A Google user,"April 3, 2020",4, So far it's been a decent app. Got quite afew people on in my area. Love the comment prompts in photos it's a good conversation starter. Only downfall is your only allowed 6 likes per day. Be better if it was 10.
629,Miguel Riley,"April 24, 2020",5, Absolutely hypeeeee! It's like tinder for adults. Much less sleazy and all the women are keen as a bean! Got 18 matches on my first day and already finessed one or two of them to meet up after the pandemic. Let's just say we won't be having tea and buscuits.. Do not pass up on this app guys!!!
630,Ray Where,"April 23, 2020",5, App works flawlessly. Haven't found the one yet but it's not because Hinge isn't trying!
631,Ayodele Michael,"March 23, 2020",5, Nice app. I just dont understand why one can just get logged out and ban without doing anything wrong. I have heard a number of people getting pushed out n banned for no reason. I will like to know why my account was banned though. I am really curious.
632,Duke Togo,"February 18, 2020",2," It's easy to navigate, set up and start looking, BUT I get no responses, and if I do... It's here and there. Once you run through everyone, then that is it... Unless you want to date someone more than 50 miles away. I'm not very pleased, and think all those profiles are bunk."
633,Johnny Bawan,"February 25, 2020",4," The app is well designed, made with quality and craftsmanship. Please add an indication of remaining likes (likes counting down) so it's easier to see when one needs to subscibe or wait for more."
634,A N,"March 4, 2020",4, Attractive design. I wish it helped me match closer to the age range that I set in my settings. I hate the fact you can't comment after awhile unless you pay. Oh well.
635,David Jones,"March 5, 2020",5, My favorite app now. I almost never get a bad match or even a bad like. Which is very unusual. Love not wasting my time and often connecting with women much closer to what I'm looking for.
636,Cameron Scott,"March 21, 2020",1," App is broken. Spent a couple of hours filling everything out and uploading images but it would'nt let me use it. It kept saying ""complete profile to send likes"" but my profile said it was 100 percent complete. Wasted my time."
637,Kyle Juelfs,"March 21, 2020",3," Always shows the same people you swipe left to. Over and over. They should have it if you swipe left on the same profile 3 times, it never shows up again. Or at least an option to ""hide the profile"" for now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
638,Matthew Mitchell,"March 30, 2020",2, Waited 48 minutes for a verification code that never came. I was happy to uninstall and strongly recommend not using this app until they figure out what they want to be.
639,Daniel Breen,"April 1, 2020",1," Starts off showing profiles of people that I'm not interested in, gets more accurate over a couple days but it's an annoying user experience at the beginning."
640,Jacklyn Martino,"April 2, 2020",1," the app randomly logs you out and it's too crappy to recognize that an account already exists with your phone number, so it tries to get you to start from scratch"
641,skylar sutton,"April 7, 2020",2, I enjoyed using the app but the recent update to it has stopped me from being able to upload new pictures. All I get is a bugged out gray screen when I try
642,Inkd Ken,"April 4, 2020",4, This app helps actual conversation happen with the folks you run into on it. It feels a bit more comfortable to explore with the people that use it.
643,Ashley Baptiste,"April 14, 2020",1, I deactivated my account cause I stopped getting messages and when I went it reactivate it keeps telling me I violated the terms when that never happened
644,Robert Torres,"April 16, 2020",1, To many glitches and no quality control keeps repeating profiles I already liked and even message
645,BigSimple Live,"February 16, 2020",4," Tried it for a little while, app tries to match you with people but it's a wasteland, no one matches and no one replies. Plus the company is making this pretty ghastly show about much dating sucks, I guess they don't see the irony that they are pretty much part of the problem."
646,Monique Champagne,"February 11, 2020",2," I guess you need to pay if you want to see more than one person therefore, you need to say yes or no to a person before you can see the next. Also I haven't figured out how to save a favorite so you can move onto the next and then review profiles more thoroughly later."

App was good last year, but for whatever reason I signed back up as a paid customer and the only women that show up are 99% generally overweight women which isn't my type. Why can't there just be an app that allows you to see every possible option instead of some stupid algorithm that thinks it knows what you match well with??"
648,KRIS WEST,"March 8, 2020",4, - Great setup - I appreciate that you are throttled so you aren't liking millions of profiles. - The refresh issues with the chats are irritating but you learn to hit the back button or manually scroll back down.
649,Peter Verrier,"March 11, 2020",5," I find hinge a lot more flexible and easier to use than other apps. I like that if I'm busy, I can still find interactions without having to be active. Which is a very nice change."
650,Rod Strykez,"March 11, 2020",5, A pretty solid app so far that has led to meeting some of the best matches with great in depth conversations. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for more of a serious thing and not just hookups.
651,Boisson Media,"March 18, 2020",4," I am doing pretty good on here so, I guess my experience is alright. My only complaint is that I have to scroll to the bottom of long threads to see the latest message because it often resets to the top."
652,Alan Garner,"March 28, 2020",3," Lacks matching features. Limited amount of characters used in each section, limits the number of sections to 3 but gives you like 20 options of secrion headers to choose from."

654,Megan Megan,"April 11, 2020",5, I like that you can video date before an actual date. A lot of the guys are interested in relationships not just sex. I have met a few really great guys!
655,Project Hu148,"April 1, 2020",1," Typical dating app. There is nothing special, uses the same matching algorithm as tinder. Their support is atrocious, they reply to you with canned emails and if you ask for a refund they IGNORE you which is rude and unacceptable."

And I know they are there bc I run out of likes for the day then those profiles disappear and all the ones I've already said no to come flooding back. It's some BS honestly.
658,Kevyn Drago,"February 18, 2020",4, The app works really well. The problem is there aren't enough people on it so it has me viewing people living 2 hours away despite my max location is set for 20 miles. Everything works very well technically.

674,Kendrick Manon,"February 7, 2020",4, Much better than any other app I've tried. But it's been bugging so that people that I've already viewed or sent messages to on my feed pop back up as it no messages were sent.
675,Lloyd Mower,"February 9, 2020",1, Messages I've sent disappear so people think I've only liked rather than put the effort in to type a message - made support aware with screenshots and all the info they asked for... They've done nothing about it.

679,Cody Shedd,"March 26, 2020",5," So the population is much smaller than tinder, or even bumble. That being said if you're looking for a meaningful relationship you're much better off with hinge vs those apps. Girls seem to be much more responsive and willing to have conversations past a few minutes on this app."

691,Hombre Darby,"April 6, 2020",4, It's good. There are plenty of matches but it seems to stop and start you from matching whenever they want.
692,Anthony Torres,"April 14, 2020",4, Good app but the free version should have a few more likes available vs the handful the give you
693,Andrey Sklyar,"April 17, 2020",5," App is beautiful. Love the simple, short profiles."
694,Jeremy Jeremy,"March 31, 2020",1," It's the worst dating app out there. Bunch of robots and people trying to get insta followers. Not trying to actually meet someone. You get like five ""likes"" before it inevitably asks you for your credit card number."
695,Samuel Hsueh,"February 4, 2020",1," Absolutely horrendous. I contacted the customer support for help in regards to my account. Not only did they not answer my inquiries, they also fail to explain their actions. This app does not support its users at all please do not let them fool you.

Not only did they not answer my inquiries, they also fail to explain their actions. This app does not support its users at all please do not let them fool you. Customer support named Chris is very unprofessional and many one star reviews here share the same sentiment and struggle. Please before you try this app out, save yourself the trouble and go for something else. Because Chris will randomly ban you."
696,Chris Con,"February 29, 2020",4," I like the way the like system and prompts work, but it just recently started signing me out for some reason. (issue has been resolved!)"
697,Tony Sebastian,"February 12, 2020",3," The app works well to meet people, more matches than most other apps. My issue is with the battery drain - I don't use the app often but somehow a third of my battery is used by Hinge."
698,kelsie gurley,"February 23, 2020",4, Great place to meet people who you can form great relationships with both platonic and romantic. Sometimes I don't always get notifications so I don't realize someone sent a chat.
699,Andre Legit Olivier,"February 25, 2020",4," Shocked that this app is free AND you actually meet PEOPLE not robot chats, and can have real conversations. Well done!! Would give it 5 Stars but it feels like there is something missing.."
700,Jaala Davis,"March 2, 2020",1, I haven't even had a chance to enjoy this app because my photos won't upload! Wrote a support ticket and they responded quickly but the issue has not been resolved.
701,Nakama Nakamura,"March 16, 2020",1, App works smooth and no issues on Android or Samsumg A70. Interface well designed and intuitive The content and claims are misleading do not be fooled Hinge is just another peddler of false hope to the lovelorn. Do not waste your time and especially do not waste your money.
702,Paul,"March 14, 2020",5," Amongst all the dating apps I've tried, this is the best by far. Real profiles, real matches, real chats, and not spammed with ads or pressure to subscribe to paid service. Thank me later."
703,edmondYJ,"March 21, 2020",3, I like it but making it limited with only 10likes per person you like is a bit annoying. I'd pay for it but it's not really worth the gamble of matching in online dating.
704,Heero Nonya,"March 19, 2020",1," I tried to sign up using FB and it said there was an issue and to use a phone number instead, which I don't have. This app really was designed to be deleted."
705,Jorge D.,"March 27, 2020",5," Actually a pretty good app. I get consist matches and some good convos with it. I should also mention, I revamp my profile every 3 weeks just to keep it fresh."
706,Iain Wallace,"March 31, 2020",1," Seeing the same people in the same order has detracted from the experience. Similarly, new people being available when likes have expired is a cynical ploy to encourage subscription."
707,Tweedler The Fool,"March 4, 2020",5, I enjoy the design of this apps interface! My only issue is being near the lake I get connections 80 miles away directly across water. I wish the App was smarter to accommodate for this.
708,Samantha Mary,"February 5, 2020",4, The app is great. The only part I dislike is when I take the time to comment on a photo or an idea and the comment does not send to the other person. So it is wasted time on my part.
709,TheNodrokov,"February 7, 2020",5," Great app, it really feels like the algorithm actually works to get you matched with good people rather than trying to extract money from you."
710,Adrian,"February 12, 2020",1, Your app does NOT work outside of United States. Can't log in or create profiles you need to fix it. Ohh well it's works well inside the states. It's 2020 man an app on Android Market have issues like that funny and cheap.
711,Claire Boyles,"February 24, 2020",4," Limited info on profiles makes it difficult to start conversations, but generally the app works well and I've had a few nice conversations, hopefully going on a date next week."
712,B Smath,"February 25, 2020",5," Great app, I wish it were more in depth. They might filter the problem people well enough that you can easily have a conversation."
713,Kyle B.,"March 6, 2020",4, Its been great so far. Changing the search area helps with results. I get a lot of replies and meets. It kind of feels like dating. Lol
714,Celeste Newton,"March 6, 2020",2, Setting up my profile was made very difficult. I don't like the lack of flexibility in how you want it to be either. Or how much they demand payment for you to set your preferences.
715,Francois Paquette,"March 14, 2020",5, It's hard to even make contact on a dating site but Hinge make it easy to keep it simple and find people who have the same interest. The technical part of the app work great.
716,Trapp Industries,"March 24, 2020",5, I am enjoying the Hinge app much more than others. Well designed and plenty of different opportunities to start a conversation and meet someone with similar interests and attraction.
717,tristan franklin,"March 30, 2020",4," This app (so far) seems like a real deal, which I think is saying a lot for a dating app. Can be fun right out of the gate, let's hope it finally works!"
718,dany osorio,"April 7, 2020",4," The notifications can have some better work, I have to constantly open the app to see if I got a message because sometimes the notifications won't go thru"
719,Sara Caron,"April 6, 2020",4," Hinge doesn't give you as many ""likes"" per day as say Tinder. But I believe this app also has a far more advanced algorithm to match you with people of similar interests. I do no smoke weed and don't want kids, so hinge has done a decent job in finding me like-minded partners to choose from.

I do no smoke weed and don't want kids, so hinge has done a decent job in finding me like-minded partners to choose from. Well done."
720,brennan basnicki,"April 5, 2020",1, Great. Except it always asks me to rate it. Way too frequently. I never rate apps. This is annoying! Otherwise it would be 5/5
721,Daniel Fasciani,"April 9, 2020",4," Started out really weird, got a horrible feed of options for the first couple weeks, then things suddenly changed and starting seeing better quality."
722,Dibyendu Mohanty,"April 12, 2020",4, It's good dating app. But only problem I found deleted profile reflecting too many times
723,Sam Romeyn,"February 14, 2020",5, Best dating app ever. All the prompts and the ability to add a comment to your like is a genius idea. Makes for a lot more meaningful connections with people. The app to kill tinder.
724,Jeremy Hunter,"February 10, 2020",4, Hinge is much easier to connect with people than some other dating apps. There's a lot of options to personalize your account and like/comment on specific points in their profiles!
725,Katie Estep,"February 21, 2020",3, Overall a good app and less hookup based than others without being too old-fashioned. HOWEVER it's still pretty clunky and has an odd layout and the free package is super limited which sucks.
726,Daniel Nelson,"February 29, 2020",2, I put my date of birth in perfectly and you miscalculated thinking I was under 18 which is annoying as hell because now I had to send ID which I shouldn't have had to do so in the first place. Fix it.
727,Renee Robbins,"March 3, 2020",5," Enjoying this app more than Tinder or Bumble. The profiles are more interesting and social. I love that even after you open a message, it shows that it's ""your turn"" to respond."
728,Colin Goffe,"March 6, 2020",5, Actually really good. Much better than the alternatives I've tried. Most people seem eager to have actual conversation and the profiles help with that
729,Vikki,"March 12, 2020",4, Pretty good dating app and easy to use. There are actually people on here who wants a long term relationship which has been so hard to find in most of my 20s! Thank you :)
730,Kwame Acheampong,"March 12, 2020",4, I get a solid number of matches and the design of the app makes it easier to get matches than Tinder or Bumble. I can't give it 5 stars just yet because I haven't met anyone off the app yet
731,Jure Alavanja,"March 23, 2020",2," Something in the algorithm changed recently. Used to swipe 50% of the time right, and 50% left. Now it's 95% left and 5% right. Change it back."
732,Nicola Muzzin,"March 25, 2020",5, I like that either party can start a conversation directly related to something on one another's profile. It means you can start a more interesting conversation.
733,Mason M,"March 28, 2020",1, Has an algorithm that only shows low-liked profiles to other low-liked profiles. Basically just rubs your social status in your face. Not a good time.
734,E Welch,"April 2, 2020",1, For April Fool's Day did this app decide to be absolute garbage? It keeps showing me the same people over and over again and when I match with someone they don't show up in my matches they just disappear.
735,Nicholas Denomme,"April 1, 2020",4, I've had a good experience with the matches I've had. The only downside is a weird glitch that would send me back to the top of our conversation
736,Dan Fraser,"April 5, 2020",5," So far so good. The app encourages you to leave a comment on people's profile when you like them, allowing for an easy icebreaker. Better conversation on day 1 here than day 60 on tinder"
737,pup101,"April 6, 2020",3," better app than bumble, pofdating, badoo and perhaps even tinder. does seem to he free to use obviously if you want more features you pay but even being a free user seems like you can actually use the app. not bad better than most"
738,Caty Gutierrez,"April 15, 2020",1, Its cool until you change your number cause you cant log back in at all!!!!!
739,Keri Scarlett,"April 14, 2020",5," Hinge is definitely one of the better dating apps I have used, it definitely stands out from the pack as well with it's none swiping take on dating apps"
740,Nicholas Banchiere,"April 23, 2020",3, Haha covid hits and they jack the price up...and its the worst time possible to be on a dating app. Way to go guys

But, hinge has the most ugliest looking females I have ever seen in my entire life. So extremely depressing to see countless numbers of dumpster fires back after back. Tf is up with this app? App was definitely designed to be deleted."
742,Nigel,"February 25, 2020",2, Poor quality profiles. This app has the worst profiles ever for a dating app. Lots of profiles with quote pictures and fake ones. The UI looks nice but is also buggy at times. This is actually the worst dating app I've used
743,Varina,"February 12, 2020",2, Way better than POF. There are enough pictures and sometimes IG to help you determine if you're attracted. You're only matches if it's mutual. My one issue is I accidentally passed the profile of a guy I was VERY üí´attracted to üíî you can't undo üò≠ lol
744,Matt Law,"February 27, 2020",1," App is completely broken. No way to go back during setup, used wrong account and now have to reinstall the app. Now it will not send me a verification code. This app is completely unusable."
745,Chibuzo Nwaeze,"March 4, 2020",4, I have a better experience than other dating apps. I think there needs to be more work as regards coverage as 95% my matches are over 200 miles from my location.
746,George Vlahakis,"March 7, 2020",5," The best online dating app and platform I've used to date. Substantially better profiles than Tinder and the rest! More genuine people on Hinge who are looking to date with the intention of a relationship in the future and more, higher quality conversations as a result of that."
747,Bri Bailey,"March 7, 2020",1," You x someone, Hinge repeatedly shows you their profile. You unmatch with someone, close the app, reopen the app, and the person is suddenly back as a match. Serious bugs in this app!"
748,ama jim,"March 10, 2020",4, So far it better than tinder or match or other apps I've used... Real people communicate and you don't even need the upgrade version unless you want to see some extra feature which I feel could be worth it.
749,Justin Stimpson,"March 16, 2020",4, More involved and unpressuring ways to start conversations. Young so still mostly pure users. But you cannot filter distance without paying. Overall good dating app as of 03/16/20.
750,Kyle lash,"March 19, 2020",3, It's a little confusing to get started and I still don't know how to fix my profile. I don't like that it seems to be forcing me to use 6 photos. But overall a good app.
751,Mathew wilson,"March 20, 2020",4," Good experience to start with. I could use a tad bit more info, and the amount of likes are low, especially to start. But better than most so far"
752,Tom Zatirka,"March 23, 2020",5," So far so good! The quality of profiles is alot better than other dating apps! For those of us in white collar industries, it offers the ability to find someone with the same goals and determination"
753,Jingting Wu,"March 23, 2020",5, Really good dating app! The account setup is tedious but worth it since every profile has good level of detail and compatibility related questions & answers. Quality over quantity :)
754,Abigail Mercier,"March 27, 2020",3," Great app. But when they took my subscription out, they took more than they should have. Not very happy."
755,Rishi Kumar,"April 3, 2020",2, It seems you have to pay now to use it in its basic form. Not sure what's going on with this app. Used to be good but seems have lost its way.
756,Cat Nav,"April 16, 2020",1, 100 % of profiles are fake.its a waste of money and most importantly.... TIME. Very disappointed
757,Kgaugelo Seanego,"April 19, 2020",1," I honestly thought this is better than Tinder, üò¢ I was wrong. ""No likes left. Upgrade to send unlimited likes."" Mere rubbish."
758,James Chan,"March 4, 2020",3, Decent app that changes mindless swiping to clicks by posting a comment on a specific question or picture. Main issues: Round robin of same profiles previously rejected and a lot more fake/hookup profiles.
759,Yatin Raj Singh,"April 16, 2020",3, My I'm seeing cards of my friends who have deleted the app. If someone deletes the app. There should be an automatic unmatch. Period.
760,Michael Sternberg,"February 4, 2020",4," I like the prompts. Sometimes it gives me people outside my age or distance range, even when I make it a dealbreaker. But I assume that's because I live in the sticks without many people."
761,Ashleigh Heinichen,"February 15, 2020",5," Great prompts and polite folks. Not sure how the ""did you meet/meet again"" option works out with my algorithm, but otherwise I'm happy with it."
762,Lana Noel,"February 16, 2020",2, I don't like that you're not able to filter for distance without subscribing. The free service lacks quite a bit compared to other apps.
763,Joseph Catania,"February 18, 2020",3," Needs to be update to filter by body type, Just like there is for Height. Have to filter through hundreds of over weight potentials just to find a suitable match. üëé"
764,V,"February 21, 2020",1," Cannot bypass age restriction even after sending photo ID to Contact Support email to confirm info. Deleted, re-downloaded. Nothing. Please fix this issue. Very frustrating."
765,Brittany Cunningham,"February 22, 2020",4, So far so good! Sometimes you get matches from people from far away even though you set the distance to only so far away!
766,Ben .M. Cam,"March 25, 2020",2, App works fine. May need a filter for waist size. Got quite a few chunky monkeys on this. Bit of a turn off once you have flicked through 30 something in a row.
767,kris gruda,"March 28, 2020",4," ...this is a pretty engaging app...it seems to encourage dialogue in a casual way, which i certainly appreciate!"
768,Richard Marcano,"March 31, 2020",3, It's okay but it's too expensive for certain options. It should have an option for daily preferred membership.
769,Johnny Grayson,"April 2, 2020",4, If is really free because you can do everything that the app advertises without paying. I do wish there was more areas to write about yourself.
770,Bethany B,"April 3, 2020",4, Quality guys. Quite expensive. A bit glitchy. But definitely the best out there.
771,Omar Richardson,"April 12, 2020",1, Purposely matching me with the worst prospects they can find. Even showing me members of the same sex when I don't have that option selected. Garbage app.
772,Skeleton Cycling,"April 20, 2020",4, App works fine. Cant blame others for not getting matches
773,Larry Baker,"April 22, 2020",5, Better than the other dating apps I've tried. The questions help with the hassle of typing up a paragraph about yourself.

777,Neil Tring,"February 21, 2020",2, It seems if you minimise the app and relaunch after some time it automatically chooses the 'X' to say no. Pretty rubbish if you want to open the app and reply later.
778,Koriander Yander,"February 21, 2020",5," Way better than Tinder. I like that I can upload videos. I wish I could upload videos that are atleast 30 secs because that's how long Instagram videos are, and I want to upload the fully Instagram video"
779,Germaine Trans,"February 26, 2020",4," It's fun! I feel bad for the older likes, tho. If you don't get through the new ones, then you can't get to the old ones. Seems kinda unfair?"
780,Kalyani Shirwalkar,"March 3, 2020",4, It was a good app for people like me who struggle to make small talks. Profiles on this app gives you pointers to start conversation. Recommend it!
781,Aannaliisa Moulton,"March 4, 2020",5, I love that you can see more personality than on any other app. The captions and questions can show more character than just model pics.
782,Bj√∂rn Math√¥t,"March 6, 2020",1," Pretty useless cash grabbing app. You get very very limited options unless you open your wallet. And from what I read, it just gets worse from there."
783,Wyatt Martin,"March 5, 2020",5, Best dating app I've used so far! Allowing the user to open a conversation with someone based on a shared interest or question rather than just superficiality along is very refreshing.
784,Alicia,"March 5, 2020",2," Not great just like other apps. It is harder to find people that are looking for the same thing, the questions section needs to be more specific."

786,M Nordike,"March 11, 2020",2," I enjoy this app. I like the style and set up swipe. It just SUCKS that you are given a limited number of LIKES unless you pay a monthly fee. ‚òπüëéüèø Well, back to staying single."
787,Jasmin McNeill,"March 11, 2020",1, Terrible app don't waste your time or money. Terrible customer service. No refunds no re activation if you delete your account if you pay for premium you still can't use it outside the small amount of countries allowed.

794,Joshua Swift,"April 17, 2020",1, Please stop asking for a rating every 2 minutes. It is frustrating and made your rating drop from 5 stars to 1.

797,Nicole Barnaby,"February 19, 2020",5, I like the filter options and the interface is nice. Unfortunately you have limited swipes per day but it isn't unreasonable.
798,Lais Donella,"February 16, 2020",5, I love the fact that we can apply filters and just see profiles that match those filters. It saves so much time!!!! Thanks Hinge!!!üòÅ‚úåÔ∏è
799,Abhro Bhuniya,"March 16, 2020",5, Very effective dating app with enough information asked to allow the other person to break the ice. You will have to spend time creating the profile but it will be worth it.
800,Crystal Azaria,"March 30, 2020",4," Its a great app, easy to use but when i set my interests to only women it still shows me mostly guys...if that gets fixed then it'll be a 5 star app"

811,Keith Bracken,"February 5, 2020",1, Update Review: So many bugs. This app crashes more than any other app ive ever used. They just released and update to add some taglines to photos but they can't fix their bugs. Pixel 2.

813,Sudhanshu Mittal,"February 6, 2020",4, The app layout and functionality and easy to understand and simple. Unfortunately the Android version is not as good as the iOS one. Still good
814,Nathan Wright,"February 17, 2020",4," Could use to have a little more likes in the free version, seems like I only get like 5 before I run out. Also notifications aren't always consistent, otherwise great app"

816,Shannon Sliter,"March 8, 2020",4, I actually really like it as a woman. The guys seem a lot better than on other apps. Only issue is some times I'll get the same message 3-4 times in a row.
817,Jessica McDonough,"March 15, 2020",5, I'm actually finding Quality Connections Within the first few matches. This app is for people who are looking for relationships and not just hookups. And that's what I'm looking for.
818,Kimberly K,"March 30, 2020",4," The app is designed well, runs well even without paying to use. Really easy to report any issues and the ""Unmatch"" feature is brilliant!"
819,Kyle Whiteside,"March 31, 2020",4, Actually gotten some conversation out of matches. Annoying having to wait a whole day in between matches and they are fleeting but still.
820,patrick jaggers,"April 5, 2020",1," I have to leave this review again because they took it down last time. Hinge only gives you a small number of likes a day, and also shows you profiles you've already seen again to make you waste even more likes, then asks you to pay a subscription for unlimited likes"
821,Tony Volanti,"April 4, 2020",4," Easy to handle, and navigate. Slower and more casual pace."
822,Holly Christensen,"April 6, 2020",1," The new update is horrible, I'm picky and I hardly ever try to match with someone. After like 3 attempts in one day apparently I'm out of matches and now have to pay ? No thanks. Back to tinder I go"
823,Will Tewell,"April 13, 2020",5, It's a totally fresh online dating style. Not just bland messages or weird rules.
824,Michelle Jungles,"April 18, 2020",5, Easy to set up profile and responses right away.
825,Ruchit S,"February 13, 2020",5, UPDATE: Has improved a lot. Plus more matches happen compared to Tinder or Bumble ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è. ------- PAST REVIEW: Doesn't allow me to login through Facebook. Throws an error. And i dont wanna login through my phone. Please fix the issue. Literal garbage of an app üò†üò°
826,Trevor P.,"April 8, 2020",1," This app is full of fake accounts, wayyy more than any other dating app. It's pretty bad considering. Wish I could get my money back for the subscription service. Definitely not renewing again."
827,Scott Sinclair,"February 10, 2020",5, Better than tinder and bumble. The swiping makes you feel like an article of clothing at the dry cleaners. Hinge actually forces you to think of something to say in order to like them
828,Nick Russell,"March 1, 2020",5," There's a lot of people, messaging is free, and the question prompts give you a way to start a conversation. I've tried a lot of apps and this one is probably my favorite."
829,damian lawrence,"March 12, 2020",5," Great so far , can't complain. Easy to you , great interface . Great selection of women and they seem quite accomodating ."
830,Timothy Casassa,"March 18, 2020",4," Would like to see some additional features, but mostly it seems to work. Automatic matches seem suspect."
831,Stan Golston,"March 31, 2020",5," So far so good. I like that it actually trys to match me with people I would be interested in. Don't know how it does it, but it's been pretty spot on!"
832,Andrise Maloy,"April 2, 2020",5, This app is pretty awesome. I feel a deeper connection to the people I match with because you have a way to break the ice without it being weird.
833,Kendall Young,"April 1, 2020",5," Very clean aesthetics and the setup of this, using prompts, makes matching and conversing after so much easier."
834,Morgan Mccroy,"April 5, 2020",3, It's a good app just has a couple problems with the app not showing me messages when messages are coming through.
835,George Lamb,"April 7, 2020",3," overall ok - am matching and texting.. I find the UI a bit slow, not keen on panning across for peoples details and the pics are all square..."
836,Sharlie P,"April 10, 2020",4, I like that it's compulsory to put a certain amount of information in your bio. That way you don't get as many time wasters. It's a fun way to meet people.
837,Epic Realist,"April 20, 2020",5, Best dating app I've tried thus far! Everyone is attentive and honest and active here. I am polyamorous and you can clearly state that on this app and you will still get people who are interested. Amazed! üòç Even better than OkCupid! üëèüèæ
838,Isaac Leventon,"April 21, 2020",5," For a phone based app, the best out there to be not entirely based on swipe yes/no. Have met some cool people and enjoyed a range of covos here."
839,Charad Israel,"March 26, 2020",3," The app is ok, but I am starting to notice scammers on there. There should be a verification system to know who matches with their profile."
840,Christylynn Nurko,"March 12, 2020",1," Though it's a decent site, I don't like that we can't just message people without having likes. I'm not paying to find ""love"" especially when people hardly contact you back in the first place. Also that I only get a certain amount. Kinda bogus"
841,Michael Gerlich,"February 5, 2020",5, Enjoying it so far. Better atmosphere than some of its peers. Still annoying it wants you to purchase likes with only 10 free a day.
842,Kyle Gordon,"February 16, 2020",1," Format is great but location doesnt work and women are hefty here, I mean alot of them, maybe install a BMI filter. App just feels like a waste of time"
843,Carolyn Stark,"February 11, 2020",3, I have been on here for almost five months. I haven't met anyone yet but generally it's a nice app. Also I wish I had another section to my profile where I could write a bit more just about myself but not under the intro questions.
844,Michelle Bad,"February 21, 2020",1," I live in NYC and only get at best 6 options a day. That seems ridiculous considering the amount of people using this app in my area.

I'm even a preferred member. I'm not even saying ""likes"", just the selection available for me to choose from with a 12 year age range. I feel bad for the people in smaller cities. NYC offers nothing on hinge. Look elsewhere."
845,JT S,"February 25, 2020",4, Plus Size women are definitely in full force here. It's a great app overall and fun to use. I just wish there were more regular sized women to choose from as self control is a quality I value.
846,Alan Stanford,"March 21, 2020",1," Wont let me do anything until my profile is complete, yet when I go to my profile it says 100% complete, fix this. Complete waste of time since it wont let you do anything."
847,Sandy R,"March 19, 2020",3, To send more than a few likes you have to pay. Way too many notifications (duplicates) and only options are on or off.

849,Takami Nanako,"April 19, 2020",1," It was a great app but after update, keep showing me same people. Very desapointed."
850,Ben Actis,"March 11, 2020",5," This was what OkCupid was 5 years ago. While it may not have the degree of questions, it does seem to have a very well-rounded user base."
851,Taige Zhang,"February 10, 2020",3, Better than Bumble but still not that great. I prefer CMB and Fairytrail in the USA because I get more sincere matches. Tinder is great for meeting locals while traveling. This has very limited use outside of New York in my opinion.
852,Dan Rasper,"February 10, 2020",5," This app is one of the few that has little to no spammers or fake profiles, as of now it is a great application to connect with people"
853,Vanessa Snary,"February 23, 2020",2," The max of 10 likes per day is off putting, and that you can only add x amount of answers to be displayed on your page. Basics should be apart of the app"
854,Joan Long,"March 2, 2020",4, Easy to get on and begin using. It's missing a section for people to select what they r truly looking for. Would recommend a dropdown or question/answer section 4 that.
855,Nathan,"March 3, 2020",1, Android not supported. Features are available to android users like uploading videos. Frustrating that there is unbalance and you have fewer chanes just because of the phone you own. Stupid app...
856,Natasha,"March 7, 2020",4," Hinge makes it so much easier to match with compatible people and view others profiles. Definitely a head and shoulders above other dating apps I have tried (bumble, okcupid)."
857,Ben Bacon,"March 22, 2020",4," Wonderful app, and a solid community within. The hardest part is that the iPad app is not native; the screen doesn't rotate."

One time they gave me a successful recommend, every other time they think I'm into one particular kind of girl, and that ain't it.

860,Kyle Kirby,"April 1, 2020",4, Pretty great app! Different setup from others. Took some time to get use to.
861,Pierre Cassis,"April 5, 2020",5, You get to like a few profiles per day for free and get to msg if you both match. You can set some filters too! Pretty neat
862,Craig Stafford,"April 6, 2020",1," As an Android user, I'm feeling left out that I cannot share profiles like iPhone users are able to. I figured this out by testing my profile on my iPhone."
863,Michaela Kis,"April 6, 2020",3," Mostly a good app but has some glitches, like getting notifications for messages but they aren't there."
864,Jono Reshef,"April 7, 2020",3, Great UI and idea but the free version is verrrrrrry limited. Obv have to make money but feel like you get more from other apps at the free price range
865,Stephanie Benedict,"April 19, 2020",4," I really like it, but having only 10 likes a day definitely is a bummer during the pandemic, especially considering the pricing."
866,Deimos,"April 24, 2020",4, It's a good app. Still come across some fake accounts but this app is better than most

868,M B,"March 25, 2020",4, Honestly a good app. Tries to get matches that you would like and want to date just don't use it enough to really give it 5 stars
869,Kevin Smith,"March 26, 2020",1, All this app ever shows me or people half my age and white outside the range I have specified in the settings. It seems the commercial is truthful when it says this app was made to be deleted.
870,Kyle Sierra,"March 30, 2020",4, I use Android and I'm unable to link my Instagram. IDK why. But great app for displaying what you are about in a clean way.
871,Brittney Hincks,"April 6, 2020",1, Can't seem to upload a picture unless I have FB or something. I don't have any of that and can't use photos from my phone. Couldn't even get past the create profile

Most dating apps give you an invisible, relative 'hotness' score but hinge's is incredibly inconsitent. I do decently well on other apps, but hinge only shows me people I am clearly not interested in. I know quite a few people in the same boat. Youd think if you 'nope' the same kind of people over and over they would re-evaluate who they show to you like other apps. Hinge is designed to be deleted, thats for sure."
878,Melissa Honeycutt,"February 20, 2020",1, This algorithm is strange. It suggests people you should meet that are way off base. This app tries too hard. I havent had the best experience. It also seems to attract some gross dudes.
879,Mohit Gogia,"March 9, 2020",2," Weird app, keeps showing you matches you've already messaged as new matches. This is a sure-fire way to get blocked by potential matches."
880,BestLeaf Games,"March 9, 2020",4," I have not used it for long but sparking a conversation based on something you like on their profile, seems easier !"
881,Saif Uddin,"March 14, 2020",4, It's just a dating app but you get to let more of your personality show thru and overall just feels more respectful of the user than it's competition. Don't mind spending some money every once in a while
882,Connor Quinn,"March 13, 2020",5, This app is good due to the fact that you can at least say one thing before matching. Makes it easier to start a conversation.
883,Ludwig Rosiclair,"March 16, 2020",5, This app is leagues better than tinder. Takes time to actually look through profiles. I've gone on many dates with my matches. I've found much more in common with matches.

895,Nicole Simotas,"February 19, 2020",4, This is a great app to find real people. Only downside is you don't get very many opportunities to match a day unless you pay.

914,Mandi Webb,"March 7, 2020",3, I loved this app until the likes were made a preferred member thing. Some people don't have the money to pay monthly for dating sites. Thanks for making it even harder to see if anyone is interested in me. Deleting now.

933,Jeff McCormac,"April 2, 2020",5," It's great this app works for free. I match with quite a few people, and we actually talk."
934,mike RO,"April 3, 2020",1," Verification is pitiful, won't link with my Facebook and then can't manually select my age, i have to email them a picture of my ID or passport,.. yea right...."
935,Tarun Bakshi,"February 15, 2020",5, Best dating app. Genuine people. Nice UI. Smooth. The paid membership is too costly. It should be brought down.
936,Jimmy Barnes,"February 17, 2020",3, The app is fairly straightforward and easy to use. It's down fall is needing to have 6 pictures just to like people. Like other dating apps it has pay to play options. .
937,Alex Mottley,"February 20, 2020",5, Great! Except theres a search option for height etc and not for weight etc. Would be nice to be able to filter out the obese. Its only fair.
938,Natasha Randhawa,"February 26, 2020",5, Great site and app. The questions and prompts make it fun! See lots of potential on this one
939,Theodore O'Connor-Dunphie,"March 6, 2020",4, Decent. I think it should have more things to match with people. Such as interests etc.
940,Caleb B.,"April 11, 2020",1, The current version crashes when I try to see who liked my profile.
941,Mike Campisi,"April 8, 2020",3, experience was bad until paying $20 for one month. 3 out of 5 stars overall
942,Cali Fobar,"April 9, 2020",4, Not much difference from every other dating app. The problem is more so the people on the apps then the function of the app itself.

As I said, they label men and non binary people (this includes people who clearly state they are men) as women so if you want to date a woman, tough luck, you have to sort through everyone for some reason... and the devs are dirty for deleting bad reviews. They always claim they can't but considering I'm writing this from scratch after having written one... well, need I say more?"

And thats something ive been looking for, for a while. (Cons: without premium you only get like 6 likes a day it seems like)"
949,Moving Train,"February 21, 2020",3, Well seems promising but still not get someone. Though i am getting a few hit backs so just hoping it turns out to be the game changer.

Yeah, that's right. I've been just banned for violating the policy which happened when I stopped paying for the application. Women can be rude, passive aggressive, but as soon as you say something women don't like... bang, you're banned without telling you why."
952,MCD E,"March 12, 2020",4, Had it for one (1) day and am not in love yet. But I like the design of it and people on it seem to be more interested in chatting than posting gym pics.
953,Carlos Limmer,"March 16, 2020",3," Been on here for a month, and can even get a single like, have used both free and paid versions, unless I am incredibly ugly and unaware of it, this app doesn't actually work."

I have had a couple men who are asswholes. Seems they're bitter towards women or think they are better than women. One guy was an asswhole because I didn't laundry list 10 different things in what I was looking for in a man. He came at me like I was dumb for not mentioning loyalty & chemistry..kinda figured it was common sense though."
960,K Yuen,"February 9, 2020",2," I hate the new layout. I liked the simple one they had before. Overall, decent app with better vetting for potential dates. I've met nice people on Hinge."
961,Ms. Chelle G,"February 17, 2020",4," I think it's weird it says I invited someone else start the conversation. Just say I like them back, you should say hi, or something like that."
962,Trey Jacques,"April 1, 2020",4, Hinge is a dating app that lets you know and potentially match with other people who have liked you! Problem with Moto g7 - I'm unable to scroll down in match screens limiting my initial messages
963,Izabel Garcia,"February 16, 2020",3, Very slow process which not be a bad thing but it took almost a month to get a decent person to talk to. Not finding a lot of connections just a lot of passer bys
964,Solar ASMR,"February 29, 2020",5," It's good. But, it needs new features for paying users. A boost would be amazing."

968,Rigo Nava,"March 27, 2020",5, I like this app because unlike other hookup apps people actually want to get to know each other here. Is very simple and there's actually real people.
969,michael smits,"April 25, 2020",3, I like the platform. How ever not that many women that would be right for me. I dont like profiles that appear. Way better than tinder.
970,Mario Frassinelli,"February 17, 2020",1, It keeps showing me oversized women. Very annoying. Also keeps showing me the same ones over and over again. Alot of in active users on here. Fix this!

976,Emily C,"March 30, 2020",5, The system they use takes note of the type of ppl you reject and adjusts accordingly. It's refreshing to not have to swipe left on the same kind of person repeatedly.
977,Joe Angel,"March 30, 2020",1, Garbage app. Matches you remove constantly come back. Horrible matching algorithms.
978,Tyler Saunders,"April 3, 2020",1," Trash app. Won't let me register with my facebook account, it just sends me back to the register screen. When I try to register with my phone number it says I'm underaged, which I'm not sure how they would know that anyway. I'm 29."

980,Varghese Manakalathil,"February 10, 2020",4, Great app. Great format. But should allow for a few more likes in one day.
981,DirtyF Butler,"February 10, 2020",4," The smaller your city the smaller the options, but that is true for all the apps. Easy to use, you must send a comment as a like."

983,Derek Pixley,"February 23, 2020",5," Easy and low pressure environment, the filters and ability to like comments makes for more meaningful connections."
984,qwerty as,"February 21, 2020",5," Its a good dating app,unlike tinder and bumble where you expect the person crosses your profile and swipe you right. Here,the person will get the notification of like,that you are interested and its up to her/him to like you back."
985,Anonymous,"February 23, 2020",3," Average to me,as usual upgrade to get unlimited blah blah if not you're limited to how many you can like per day.. Nothing about it is special to me"
986,Tim Guest,"March 7, 2020",4, Good so far. Increasing the descriptors further would be beneficial especially considering the fee paid.
987,Ryan McCourt,"March 11, 2020",1, Was great until it started limiting daily likes. Now it's all about squeezing every dollar out of you.
988,Jessica Brooks,"March 20, 2020",4," I haven't met anyone yet, but really easy to use. Profiles are clear and it's a good format for quickly getting to know people."
989,Jeremiah Tuttle,"March 21, 2020",1, Pretty sure you have to pay to get anywhere. Shows you the same 50 people or so over and over. Shows you a hottie that's probably not even a real person once you run out of likes for the day and asks you to pay a subscription to like them. Seems like BS in general
990,Kieran Longmuir,"March 22, 2020",3," Good interface, chat up is a bit buggy, still get people who never reply so defeats the purpose of matching"

995,Andrew DeLong,"February 18, 2020",1," Crashes often, after about an hour on app the algorithm changed and started showing a lot of people I didn't match with"
996,Antoinette Oldfield,"February 23, 2020",3, The app so far is great. A lot of good matches except its telling me I ran out of likes. Females shouldnt have to pay. I can't view who has liked me
997,Trenton Bean,"February 28, 2020",4, I really like the set up but have no idea how many likes I have or how long it takes for them to refresh some kind of indicator of that would be nice.

Im a M in my mid-late 20s in a large city and have sent about ten messages a week for last 12 months but have received almost no communication in return. I have legitimate doubts if the app even works. Likely a good portion of women are just unattracted to me but the magnitude of futility indicates many stale user accounts and many people on the app for self validation rather than dating.
1009,Anacortes Rigging,"March 23, 2020",4, Best of the dating apps I've used. Met more people from this app than others. Seems like more interesting people in general. A little glitchy I recently lost my entire profile and had to rebuild it.

1011,majere inc,"February 28, 2020",3, the app has a tendency to not have many matches.. but the matches received seem like really nice people. We need more great matches! lol
1012,Jared Shive,"February 29, 2020",1, Dreadful app. Its match making is awful. I'm looking for a woman and they throw men at me!! The quality of people on there are poor and the app keeps giving the same profiles you said NO to. They must of spammed their own reviews to get a 4.2. One star is too good for it!
1013,Ophelia Szigeti,"March 3, 2020",5, Really great app. The people on it seem to be a better caliber than I have found on other dating apps.
1014,Jason Gentile,"March 15, 2020",3, It's pretty decent. Still finding spam people that don't seem like real people. Improve the validation please
1015,Muhammad Smith,"March 24, 2020",3," It's fine, the specific like mechanic doesn't do much more than make reaching potential partners more awkward."
1016,Tony Grego,"March 24, 2020",1," Very slow, not user friendly, very disappointing. I trust I'll get the refund I requested!"
1017,Travis Bonner,"March 25, 2020",5, I love it. You can't start a conversation until you match so you don't get covered up with messages.
1018,Peter Marshall,"March 31, 2020",5," An app that is at its core free, nice to having anything hidden behind a pay wall."
1019,Ben Smith,"April 22, 2020",3, Not the worst dating site I've been on. Simple to use. None of that swiping stuff!
1020,Sky,"April 22, 2020",4, This is very different from other apps and they make it easy to set up your profile.
1021,The Scared Code,"March 12, 2020",4, A very few profiles.. Its like the developers only are on this app... There are many fake accounts. Interface good though.

1023,Steven Landeta,"February 14, 2020",2," Very clunky, and seems like the same person working as the administrator profiling my answers rather then real people chatting."

1025,Michael Finley,"February 27, 2020",5, This is the best dating app of all! Liking and commenting on profile pics and info is genius! There are better people here and no fake profiles! No hidden likes! Now I'm almost dating too much! Thank you!
1026,RAN WEI,"February 23, 2020",4, It is good that people can talk and connect without the need to pay and they can choose to upgrade their membership if they wanted to
1027,Al√´na Steiger,"February 21, 2020",4, Pay for everything! ü§∑ Wish it was easier to swipe left and right like tinder .
1028,Caiti S,"February 27, 2020",1," It was great, until after 10 minutes of use you have to pay an obscene amount to continue using."
1029,Crystal White,"March 3, 2020",5, A nicer app in comparison to others. Great layout too üôÇ and excellent touch with permitting a match before it's made üëå
1030,Alexa VL,"March 9, 2020",3, I find it really frustrating that you have to pay only after like 4 matches.
1031,dena kahle,"March 10, 2020",4," I don't like the X... Or I wish you could see the X'ed people again if you wanted to. Otherwise, it's pretty great! I like the simplicity."

1035,Michael Sarkar,"April 9, 2020",2, I updated the app and all my photos disappeared. I'm so irritated right now. I'll probably just delete this app rather than trying to find those pics again üôÑ
1036,Darcy Aktanarowicz,"February 5, 2020",5, Actually a very well put together app. Lots of options and specifics. Solid work üëåüèº

1038,Shawn Weldin,"February 16, 2020",4, Out of all the other dating apps Match group owns... This is the best. I've had more interactions with people than on any other app I've used.

1042,Emma Penelope,"February 24, 2020",5, Pleasantly surprised with this app! Much better than the alternatives in my opinion. Glad I gave it a try. Now to see if it works.. lol.
1043,Matthew Wheeler,"February 27, 2020",1," Oof. 85% morbidly obese. 1% healthy body composition. People say just power through it will work itself out, but I am not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. If you're a chubby chaser this is the dream app. Otherwise stay away."
1044,Jermell Weaver,"February 25, 2020",5, I like that the app follows up if you have exchanged numbers. It allows a woman to match but the Male must still speak first.

1048,Spencer Handley,"March 21, 2020",5, I've used a lot of the other apps and it can feel a little bit like window shopping in a gross way. This one actually makes me want to connect with other human beings and that's way more important to me right now.
1049,Francisco Arteaga,"March 26, 2020",1, It randomly resets. Like others mentioned it constantly shows you the same people over and over again.
1050,Picks JPE,"March 27, 2020",3," It's fun to use, but it feels a bit empty, for some reason. It's easy to get a conversation going, but it's best to move the conversation to a different app."

1052,D.C. Billman,"April 12, 2020",1, I got maybe 10 likes in before it told me to pay for a subscription? Absolute trash.
1053,Forrest S,"March 14, 2020",1, Lost two stars because it kept asking me to rate the app when I already had. Very annoying.
1054,Staphesa Richards,"February 3, 2020",4, Been on here for 2 weeks and so far... I don't hate it. Didn't give it the full 5 stars cuz you know room for improvement and all that. Will update my ratings once the app has fulfilled its primary purpose and I 'delete it' lol
1055,john brighton,"February 5, 2020",1," Decided to come back on after months of not using, to be told my account has been banned and with no reason or way to appeal, it worked before I quit? Waste of time."
1056,Cheryl alexes,"February 8, 2020",5," What I like about hinge as opposed to other sites , is that no one can hound you or annoy you like weirdos for example , they can only chat to you if you choose them . Site seems lot less stressful than other apps ."
1057,Jason Imbrogno,"February 19, 2020",2, It can't ever load properly. It's over all functionality Kinda sucks. Might wanna figure out these bugs cuz it's really annoying lol.
1058,Ryan B.,"February 28, 2020",5," I mean, as an average guy, I'm atleast able to find people that I can talk to and possibly meet up with. That's a whole deal better than any other app I've tried out there."
1059,Nate Brown,"February 29, 2020",5, Best dating app / service so far. Super easy to strike up conversations. I literally never review anything but they have done a great job
1060,Mike Scherback,"March 13, 2020",4, Unique enough to attract something better then normal dating sites. So far the few experiences I have had are encouraging.
1061,Alec Roberts,"March 14, 2020",4, Prices are a bit steep but otherwise the app's fine. Could do with more daily likes .
1062,Eric Fureal,"March 20, 2020",1," This app is terrible. It was actually pretty decent to start, but then all of the sudden your choices go from 7-10's to 3-6's. Don't waste your time people."
1063,Jasmine D,"March 23, 2020",3," Many matches. Not too much conversation that leads to anything. Then again, it's social distancing time. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1064,Damian Gonzalez,"March 29, 2020",1," Too many bots, way too many hookers and fake accounts,very few matches."
1065,Simon O'Connor,"March 31, 2020",5," Definitely one of the better apps. Encourages actual communication, which is awesome"
1066,Daniel Chavez,"April 6, 2020",5, A dating app where you actually get to connect with others with similar interest. Some of the best connections I've made has been on this app.
1067,John Nunez,"April 12, 2020",3," Decent app, a little annoying at times though."
1068,Terry Faugno,"April 14, 2020",3," If it weren't for COVID19, I think I'd have had the same luck as all other sites I've used prior to now"
1069,Konrad Brown,"March 13, 2020",1," Constantly seeing the same profiles in my feed, even after I dislike/""X"" them. Also not getting matches that meet the criteria I set."
1070,AK Baller,"March 3, 2020",4," Barely got the authentication thing working but beyond that it's better than most other apps - still a ton of ghosting, would be nice to add it as a reason to unmatch"
1071,peter S,"March 22, 2020",1, ü§Æ only dating app worse than this is okcupid. It's god awful don't waste your time. None of the preference settings work and zero matches after subscribing which leads me to believe they use fakes to getcha to drop money.
1072,Christopher Brandonisio,"February 6, 2020",4," Better quality matches than tinder, much less of a waste of time. Wish more people were on the app but it's definitely getting better with time."
1073,Sanjay Tomar,"February 27, 2020",4, Experience is good but you have give some free access for weeks or subscription rate should be reasonable so everybody use yours services easily
1074,Ben H,"March 7, 2020",1, When I type on my S10 it then doesn't allow me to see the send button as it's too low on the screen. Tried everything but won't work
1075,Nichrissha Wiggs,"March 10, 2020",5, This is a cool site. Once the likes are out it can be difficult if you dont want to pay but hey looks like quality folks for the most part lol
1076,Shawndrika Cook,"March 19, 2020",4, Great app to meet new people on. I saw the commercial for while watching a streaming channel and was curious about it.
1077,Mimic Verse,"March 19, 2020",1, Can't edit the phone number on the profile registration b/c it goes to the verification page even with no number entered.
1078,Keith Heim,"April 16, 2020",1," This is the worst dating app I've ever used. I was banned for absolutely nothing, I didn't use profanity, never said anything derogatory or even insinuated anything sexual, but apparently you can make up false claims and get someone banned. Really an all around unprofessional service."
1079,Kooma,"March 23, 2020",4," It's alot different than what I've seen in other apps, took some time to understand the leaving a comment / like on someone's photo or comment.. starting to understand and like it ‚úåÔ∏è"
1080,jeff B,"March 24, 2020",3, In a conversation it always brings you to the top. Always have to scroll to the bottom to see the most recent message.
1081,Jesse Soto,"March 31, 2020",5," Enjoying connecting first over soelmething other than looks or lazy swiping. Been nice, and ladies are high quality."
1082,melissa ortiz,"April 6, 2020",3," Most men seem to want the women to do all the conversational work. Maybe it's just current day men, but maybe the app can help prompt them."
1083,Eric Taylor,"March 12, 2020",4, The new update is horrible. The app was easily 5 stars before and now nothing works or looks good.
1084,Kev Fernandes,"March 4, 2020",5, It's a good app. Ppl r genuine. But ultimately depends on u to lead the conversation. Great to get to know a lot of ppl than fake apps.
1085,Olegs Vlasenko,"March 2, 2020",4, Somehow your site mostly picks ladies with extra weight for me. Needs description for body type and better if it follows selected options. Thanks
1086,Angel Morrison,"March 8, 2020",1, I just signed up and checked it out. So far I've mostly gotten 20 year olds to review which is way too young for me I do have tge age setting adjusted to a minimum of 25.

So far I've mostly gotten 20 year olds to review which is way too young for me I do have tge age setting adjusted to a minimum of 25. It also seems like you're still juding by pictures for the most part like all other dating apps. I don't particularly like the layout either. Only 3 things to say about yourself will start some conversations but really isn't a strong starting point. It might be better to upgrade but I won't be doing that.
1087,Enrique islas,"March 16, 2020",5," Works great. I've met great people. I like that it's more interactive, and not just swiping"
1088,Philippa Asamoah Andoh,"March 16, 2020",2, Too many pop ups. The difference between a basic account and premium is way too high.
1089,Adam Collins,"March 17, 2020",1, Not good since update. They now enforce to you pay a monthly subscription for things that used to be free
1090,Ephraim Fanfair,"March 21, 2020",1," Deleted my account for literally no reason then claimed i ""violated their terms and conditions"" I emailed customer service and they ignored me. Im still.being charged though! Amazing! Stay away from this wierd app. Awful"
1091,ThatOneDude,"March 24, 2020",1, Ben on the app for about 5 seconds. It keeps telling me to complete my profile before I can like anyone. But my profile says it's 100% complete. Not a great start.
1092,Jay Anderson,"March 29, 2020",4," Great app, like using it. Still single though, so only 4 stars"
1093,Jedadiah Cracco,"April 12, 2020",5, You like specific parts of their profile. This makes starting a conversation WAY easier
1094,Sam Clayton,"February 19, 2020",5," Please fix your app. I can't start any new conversations with any of the people who have liked me, only the people already on my conversation list..... Annoying"
1095,Jonathan _,"February 18, 2020",2, This thing is super buggy. Especially with text field inputs and loading charts.
1096,Kamel Hanna,"February 14, 2020",3, It's a great app with great people in it. Just wish I could have a few more matches before it goes to premium
1097,Kathy Banasik,"February 11, 2020",3," Meh. Decent but if you want more like looking at your likes,, you need to pay extra."
1098,Malcolm,"February 14, 2020",2," Since your last Feb 11th update, you've introduced more bugs. Now my message responses are disappearing."
1099,Brittney Freeman,"February 18, 2020",3, I never get notifications if the app is not actually open. If I go to another app I don't get any notifications until I reopen Hinge.
1100,Gabriel F. Reyes,"February 23, 2020",4," The chat has some bugs, but this is the nicest of the apps out there, I find."
1101,Joshua Loesel,"March 4, 2020",5, Friendly and easy to use. Already had a blast with some of the people on the app.
1102,Chase N,"March 9, 2020",4, Pretty good as far as dating apps go. Quality people and a simple effective user interface.
1103,James Stewart,"March 16, 2020",4," Limited use so far, but it seems simple and straight forward to use."
1104,Nate Richards,"March 18, 2020",5, Well functioning app with a good candidate pool and system for matching with potential suitors.
1105,Nikita Reshetniak,"March 22, 2020",1," Doesn't work - once I completed profile with 100%, there was still message - complete profile."
1106,Rachel Castellanos,"March 23, 2020",4," It's pretty good, for what it is. It would be nice to have more access to preferences without having to pay."
1107,Aris Kaps,"March 28, 2020",5, Very positive experience. Accurate matches and pleasantly presented profiles.
1108,Nate,"March 29, 2020",2," Good idea and interface, but I have never received a single like so IDK if my profile sucks or if something is bugged"
1109,Zoso Party,"March 27, 2020",1," Very frustrating location setting, is it glitchy or do y'all just like matching us with people hundreds of miles away....?"
1110,P.J. Leyden,"March 27, 2020",3," The app itself is kinda buggy, I don't get notifications sometimes. Otherwise good!"
1111,David Evans,"April 1, 2020",3," Good, but not really tailored for gay men. We have different criteria for dating which hasn't been looked into at all."
1112,Matthew Shaffer,"April 15, 2020",4," First time I've found a dating app where I have made a lot of matches that turned into actual conversations, there's just a different culture to the whole thing than Tinder."
1113,Jim Just,"April 19, 2020",2, Limited usage unless you pay large monthly fees.
1114,kyle morris,"April 17, 2020",5," It really is a dating app that gives the best opportunity to match, communicate and meet"
1115,A Google user,"March 24, 2020",1," Has gotten worse. Must've sent over 1,000 likes with no response. This used to be my favorite app but it's garbage anymore."
1116,Vincent Shaules,"April 3, 2020",1, Liked it when it first came out but now it never works right so im done with it which is sad....and its only gotten worse.
1117,Thomas Thongvilu,"April 9, 2020",4," If you change any filters, you have to go through the same people again"
1118,laura harrison,"February 5, 2020",3, Matches are empty. Profiles say nothing about the person behind them. Shallow platform
1119,stilllaughting,"February 5, 2020",5," Great app full of beautiful, interesting people who can actually hold a conversation. Best dating app I've ever tried"
1120,Ayeesha Edwards,"February 6, 2020",4, So far so good. I am debating actually paying for a subscription. Not a large selection but that is part of the idea. One downside is that there are still people looking for hookups and I saw a few wedding ringsüôÑüòë
1121,Damian Ameen,"February 16, 2020",3," Significantly higher quality matches than competing apps, significantly lower quantity, artificial limitation lends only about 10 likes or so"
1122,Peter Maez,"February 19, 2020",5, Great quality and aesthetic. Easy to use and navigate.
1123,Richard Tack,"February 10, 2020",5," Actually one of the most interactive dating apps I've used. Tinder, Happen and POF don't have anywhere near the interaction rate as Hinge- really impressed!"
1124,JD Fuimaono,"February 18, 2020",5," It works. Takes some time so be patient but I've met a couple really cool people. Some didn't work, but one did! Good luck to everyone else out there!"
1125,Ketan Bagga,"February 21, 2020",5, This is the best dating app ever. Period. I've come across so many like minded people around and the ability to directly send a like is the killer.
1126,Grace Holly,"March 5, 2020",4," So far better than Tinder which is a low bar. Prompts are little annoying but definitely get a convo going better than ""6ft if that matters"""
1127,Jon Vaughn,"March 14, 2020",4, Took a little bit getting used to but I like it. Advantages over the other models of online dating for sure.
1128,Justin Smith,"March 13, 2020",5, I've had a couple dates off here and I love how you can comment on different aspects of people's profiles rather than just swipe. Really makes the app seem unique
1129,Velvet Kat,"March 12, 2020",3," So far I met 1 person and it was nice, but not it. Everyone else that I've matched with DOESN'T TALK, so I don't understand why they matched in the first place. I'm now talking with 1 person that's pretty cool:) We'll see how things go"
1130,Michael Hastings,"March 18, 2020",5," I've had more conversations start than other apps, which is good."
1131,Aquins Varghese,"March 26, 2020",2," There is a bug when two messages come one right after the other, the first one won't show."
1132,Matt Damen,"March 31, 2020",4, Decent dating app with more space for personalisation and therefore connection. Shouldn't cap number of likes to 5 people
1133,Lee Woodhouse,"April 3, 2020",1," App constantly shows the same people. Also won't match or clear people who have ""liked"" you."

Terrible experience 0/5 Not only limited to 5 likes daily, but if you have any self respect at all as a man 99.99% of the women using the app are some of the most mentally, and physically unattractive people you will encounter I have never seen more morbidly obese, extreme left politics, hatred/jealousy of both individually successful people, and men Do not use unless you have the time to reject 600 women daily to use your 5 likes."
1135,Laura Shurden,"April 3, 2020",2, Listing neighborhood makes it hard to know what city people are from. And I've had multiple occasions that someone sent two messages and I only received one. Wonder how many other messages haven't gone through somehow.
1136,Ismael Romo,"April 12, 2020",2, Better the others... just extremely slow.
1137,rankingtrevor,"April 10, 2020",5, Great app. Great experience so far. No bots or fakes.
1138,Policy First,"April 17, 2020",5," I've tried Hinge, Happn, Okcupid & Bumble. This is the best app in terms of the sheer number of people I've chat with."
1139,loki y,"March 29, 2020",1, Needs lot of improvement in sorting out the matches and the chat interface
1140,Erik Corredor,"February 13, 2020",5, I like how personable the app is. I think it helps people relate more quickly.
1141,Kevin K,"February 10, 2020",4, So far so good. Wish there were more free likes in a day though. But great filter options
1142,Joaquim Rodrigues Dos Santos,"February 19, 2020",4, Good app! Please fix the scroll up issue. The app is scrolling up automatically on Android version
1143,RKWDBMX,"February 15, 2020",1, This app doesnt work. I cant even get past the registration process to even begin using it.
1144,Dan W,"February 19, 2020",5," Surprisingly helpful. After tinder and bumble fell short. Likely because I don't use Instagram üòÇ Hinge was much better, much faster."
1145,Kaleb Byrne,"February 13, 2020",3," Good system for connecting, few number of likes available makes it very slow to match at times"
1146,Paul Hitchings,"February 18, 2020",1," cool idea but majority of matches are too old and grossly out of shape. I want an activity partner, not a future dialysis patient"
1147,Neha Sharma,"February 22, 2020",3," 1. Good matches - upvote 2. Limited number of likes, even those you can't see altogether at once till you upgrade by paying money - downvote"
1148,Camera Crashcourse,"February 21, 2020",4, Pretty good app. Not as big a tinder so its easier to match imo. And great layout
1149,anthony webb,"February 28, 2020",4," Of the dating apps I've tried, Hinge has been the best for me. Because you get to comment on people's posts, you're able to get a better idea of who these people are, and, if you're clever or interesting, it can be much easier to come up with a witty opener"
1150,Pete Campbell,"March 6, 2020",5, Easy to use. Good for connecting and chatting with people
1151,Ethan Anderson,"March 4, 2020",5," Definitely the only viable dating app out there right now. Rarely see bots, and most matches feel genuine."
1152,Silvia Spirchez,"March 10, 2020",5, Decent better then other apps for sure.. They actually notice your type.. Haven't had the luck to find THE ONE.. But I'm not giving up!
1153,Miles Hewitt,"March 15, 2020",4," Good system, and you get loads for free without having to buy membership"
1154,Justin Riker,"March 21, 2020",4, Good app but it would be nice to be able to scroll through all of your likes instead of one at a time.
1155,Derick Mugambi,"March 28, 2020",5, Superb hassle-free dating app. I have come off Tinder and PoF. This one does not bother you with the 'upgrade to see who likes you' bullsh*t.
1156,J-P Christophe,"March 27, 2020",1, Very difficult to navigate. Ladies on the site aren't real. Computer generated responses
1157,Duane Hymel,"March 31, 2020",5, It is very lovely and great app to meet people friends around you and in the world I love using it often and often
1158,resolute germ,"April 4, 2020",2, No way to narrow search in free mode. Very limited membership pool

1160,Brianna Davis,"February 12, 2020",4, Overall just meh. Lots of inactive profiles... people on here aren't really better quality or less of players and douches than any other app.
1161,Kejaia Bowman,"February 8, 2020",5, It's nice that you can go back with no limits and everyone on here seems to be on the same page. Feels alot more genuine compared to tinder.
1162,BJ Kurai,"February 7, 2020",3, I like the app overall but limited likes takes away from potential connections and basically alienates the concept of a dating app.
1163,Eric Nemchock,"February 17, 2020",3," Old format was way better. Should not make drinking, smoking, etc subscriber only."
1164,Tyler Buck,"February 13, 2020",2, This app is hit or miss. I have about 7 matches but no likes at all. I dont think that's how its supposed to work. Is it?
1165,Louis Toledo,"February 18, 2020",4, Only issue is that I want more free likes. Outside of that I like it so far.

For example my sister's profile showed up on here and matched with me, which was not only disgusting but she proved she never made it. I really wish these dating apps would stop it with the fake profile BS. It's just a ploy to make people think there are POF on a dating site when in reality there's very few active users. Don't bother paying either since it won't improve your odds of finding anyone real."

1176,Roxy Peterson,"March 19, 2020",1, Not helpful at all. No support for sing in issues. Sent my licence to prove my age and was ignored.

1179,David Sharp,"April 1, 2020",2," Limited likes, and the nature of the platform seems to discourage responses"
1180,Mark Alford,"April 7, 2020",5, Works well. The app itself can be a little buggy. My friends got married from this app.
1181,Anthony,"April 4, 2020",1, Randomly opened the app one day and found that I was banned. Support wouldn't tell me why and I haven't used the app in a bit.
1182,Alexis Williams,"April 9, 2020",5," Pretty cool app, cool people, fun conversation, and not a bunch of creepers like most apps."
1183,Rezwan Ahmed,"February 8, 2020",5, Have had more success (matches) with this app than any other app. Really good about setting up matches for relationships rather than hookups
1184,Blaze King,"February 10, 2020",4," Great app and concept, just doesn't work on my phone for some reason and a desktop version would be dope"
1185,Linda Smith,"February 20, 2020",4," Great app, but stop working on my android after an update,I'm receiving no likes and response."
1186,Charlene Biron,"February 18, 2020",5, So far so good! I like the app format and it's easy to navigate :)
1187,Sophie S,"February 22, 2020",4, Good but it sometimes doesn't let me scroll through profiles and shifts it back to the top
1188,Rachel Gray,"March 18, 2020",4, I like that it's more conversational and not just based on how attracted you are to others.
1189,David Brown,"March 23, 2020",1, Location service dont work in it..Location service on my phone is on and working fine...Cant continue.puts me in USA....Im in Uk...uninstalled fast

1193,Gnaneshwar Rao,"February 9, 2020",1, On android. It has some page navigation issues and notification related bugs.
1194,matthew moore,"February 8, 2020",4, This app matches me with great people but the only downside is that the chat can be quite buggy sometimes :/
1195,Stacey S.,"February 11, 2020",5, Pretty awesome user interface. Clean profile theme and format makes peoples profiles look amazing. Great job.
1196,LeAnn Parkinson,"February 13, 2020",4, Has a few bugs in the messaging portion but I do like the profile set up.
1197,Candace Mills,"February 12, 2020",5, I love how you can actually see likes without having to buy it. But could care less about having to answer those silly questions before your profile is complete.
1198,Caroline M-L,"February 18, 2020",3," It's an okay app. It rarely shows your profile around though, on other apps I get 300% more likes and messages."

1200,jay bres,"February 26, 2020",5," not as many users as some of the other dating apps, but this is great for looking for a real date or potential partner, it doesnt have the shallow, hook up and fake profile vibes like tinder."

1241,Dane Dombrowski,"February 8, 2020",3," It's not a bad app, but the very limited ability to like someone is lacking. Otherwise good app"

1249,pat b,"March 5, 2020",5, It's great that they show you who has liked you and tell those you've liked. That way you can match or not right then and there.

1259,Joe Stamer,"February 13, 2020",1, They were supposed to send me a verification code so I can log in. I never received it. Unusable.
1260,Matt,"February 11, 2020",1, Got banned for no good reason after upgrading my membership and paying money. Hinge Customer Support did not work with me at all on an account restoration or a refund after I contacted them for assistance. Classless company!
1261,Claudia Nita,"March 3, 2020",1, Not working to build a profile and is designed to make it hard or impossible for users to communicate with each other.

1268,Sandra M_Yoga,"March 24, 2020",3, Well it's inconvenient to have limited likes. As most of apps don't do that. It is unreasonable to pay for that. Other than this it ok

1278,Paulius Buta,"February 13, 2020",4, I had more great conversations and dates then any other apps Maybe because one needs to put some work.
1279,Mabel Darling,"February 26, 2020",1, My pics apparently don't show up to other people even though it looks fine on my end. It's a wonder anyone has matched with me with such a broken key feature. üòí
1280,Gobindram Talreja,"March 3, 2020",1, The app desires a lot to be executed. Great idea. But needs more efforts.
1281,j t,"March 2, 2020",1," Seems decent but you have to buy premium just to filter to local people, otherwise you lucky if 1/50 is in your state"

1288,Lucas Durrett,"April 21, 2020",4, Can't get premium. The app times out.
1289,Emily Pagan,"March 11, 2020",5, You can tell who is genuine and who is just looking for some fun. Over all it's a great app and you have a lot of opportunities to meet someone.

1292,Samson Tamijani,"February 13, 2020",2," Confusing, limited in features, people are too far away, and quick to want me to pay for other features"
1293,Lonestar,"March 11, 2020",3, This app has a bad habit of reusing people. After you already say no they somehow pop up again. Or maybe I'm just that ugly.
1294,Dominic Forget,"March 20, 2020",1, It has a super obnoxious popup looking for a rating that interferes with the use of the app- so he's your one star rating üôÑ

1300,Jake Sampson,"February 16, 2020",5, I like the format and it just seems better than most of the other dating apps.
1301,Lupe Little,"February 16, 2020",1, Seems that its basically like tinder but with alot of older ppl. The free features do not make it seem as paying would make it better
1302,Luis Enrique,"February 15, 2020",5, I love the no pressure feeling from the app - enough free options to want to experience the full app.
1303,Oxtail Gravy,"February 24, 2020",5, Definitely the best dating app out right now. I love how you get to see who likes you right away instead of you having to match.

1305,Wayne LHeureux,"February 25, 2020",2," Most women do not respond. They will like your photo or things you say in your profile, but do not respond to messages.

1363,William Fann,"March 22, 2020",1, Doesn't even work I used my phone number but a blue check appeared and it won't do anything else
1364,A Google user,"March 24, 2020",3," Could be better, the preferences you choose actually don't work so that could be improved"
1365,Larry Andretich,"March 16, 2020",5, Great user interface and definitely better responses.
1366,Gabi Bermudez,"March 17, 2020",2, Have to pay for the important stuff to only have the filters not work
1367,Renee Graver,"March 25, 2020",5, Enjoying it so far. I love their marketing message. Hopefully it will make the difference!
1368,Andrew Edwards,"April 5, 2020",1, 95% of all possible matches aren't in my country despite me setting the distance parameter within my own
1369,Adam Richard Ibarra,"February 5, 2020",5, I love the different prompts. It brings a positive dynamic to dating apps
1370,Arash Aria,"February 17, 2020",5," I like it better than other dating apps, way more personal and engaging."
1371,Donald Barham,"February 10, 2020",5, Much better experience than Tinder if you are looking for a less surface level interaction
1372,Hubert Ziemlewski,"February 12, 2020",4, Using it for a day. Not bad so far. Girls actually reply compared to Tinder. Most people are real too!
1373,Edward Bobson,"February 15, 2020",3, Nice app but sometimes my matches disappear and after few days i cant chat with my matches anymore
1374,Adam Lopez,"February 21, 2020",5," Honestly I applaud this app. Not sure if I've just had decent luck but this app has much more quality people on it which is refreshing. Still dating haha but much better to meet solid, head on straight, mature people. Deff recommend. Best of luck everyone!"
1375,Unknown Unicorn Fangirl,"February 21, 2020",5, I feel like it's a much better way to introduce people to each other and a great way to show interest in someone.
1376,Edmund Arellano,"February 27, 2020",5," Finally, a useful and professional dating app that's fun and easy to use."
1377,Kinzee Andrew,"March 3, 2020",5, Lovely app with a fast method of delivering messages.
1378,James Reed,"March 8, 2020",3, Good app but many of the people you swip left too keep appearing.
1379,Jahmaica Leary,"March 18, 2020",2, I really like this app but now I'm not able to log in because I have a new phone number. is there any way to get into my old account and not have to make a new one?
1380,Guy Rilleau,"March 19, 2020",5," Personal descriptions on profiles are minimal unfortunately, but this is outweighed by the number of users"
1381,Meked McLachlan,"March 25, 2020",4, Better chances someone responds nicely compared to tinder. Wish there were more preference options for the free version though.
1382,Collin Baker,"March 31, 2020",5, Generally a better way to get to know people compared to other apps.
1383,Michael McCarron,"April 5, 2020",1, Recommended are way off. Interested in women is selected but is only showing men. One of the worst apps.
1384,Pouya Yaghob,"April 11, 2020",1, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. This app is ful of bots. All the girls ask for money. They first offered me a trial.

They first offered me a trial. Then after 2 days the app started giving me matches. I emailed customer service and they banned my account. I contacted my lawyer and we founded that the have access to your personal information and they sell them to big companies. They also save all your pereosnal pic on ur phone. I am going to a lawsuit with this fake company
1385,MICHAEL BENTON,"February 28, 2020",5, Good but could still use improvements..selection of potential matches is wayyyyyyyyyyy better than Bumble and Tinder
1386,super awsome cool guy,"February 12, 2020",1," Made a new profile, cant upload any profile pictures, the edit photo screen is unresponsive and blank"
1387,Marquita Ferguson,"February 20, 2020",2, Very slow. Do not receive messages & freezes a lot
1388,Rajvir Kalsi,"February 23, 2020",3, Too many profile items to fill in and difficult interface
1389,Creature Collector,"March 6, 2020",1," Hinge broken. Cant upload pics at all, cant see others pics an cant continue profile because of. Delete is correct, bye bye app."
1390,Andre Lacroix,"March 14, 2020",5, Absolutely awesome! Really impressed by the look and feel of this app.
1391,Paul,"March 12, 2020",4, Got likes and some matches. I like layout. If there is a connection maybe 5 stars?
1392,Anthony Juiliano,"March 14, 2020",5, Easy to use. Love that you can make a comment while liking a profile
1393,Zach,"March 19, 2020",1," I no longer have the option to like (for 3 consecutive days) I've tried logging out and back in, reinstalling but the problem still persists. Is there any way I can solve this?"
1394,CTdonnner1991,"March 23, 2020",5," Only thing I dont like is limited likes per day, but it's a great app."
1395,Christopher Mackey,"March 28, 2020",5, Honestly not a bad dating app. I tend to find myself talking to people more on hinge than other dating apps.
1396,Michelle Graham,"March 31, 2020",5," Easy to use, nice layout, Modern, Fresh Feel"
1397,Bruce Hughes,"April 15, 2020",4, Easy and intuitive to use.
1398,Gary Bozigian,"April 25, 2020",4, Solid matches but a little too much algorithm for my likes
1399,Christopher T.,"February 6, 2020",2," Hinge really encourages people to talk about their passions and personality, but it's getting really difficult to actually have a conversation with someone."
1400,Mark Farrell,"April 3, 2020",3," Have not hooked up yet, but there is a very good chance. Over all some of the women are too far away to hook up. Plus there are a lot of the woman on the site that are prostitutes their always asking for money to show you something. Some start as young as 18yo."
1401,Tim Searle,"April 15, 2020",4," Pretty good app, really needs dark mode though"
1402,Ken Barron,"April 6, 2020",3, Good app but letting people accept a match without writing anything back is lame
1403,vanessa king,"February 21, 2020",5, Fun bunch of people to meet on this app. I find it very easy to converse with like-minded people and if they are willing to meet up. I've had a few dates so far and they all went well. Good luck everyone!

1407,Raina Anand,"March 16, 2020",4, It gets pretty glitchy in the message area but otherwise pretty decent dating app.
1408,AliciaG g,"March 11, 2020",4," It's good. It forces you to interact with people but in a different way, which is good."
1409,Yulia Suslova,"March 17, 2020",3, Why is there a limited number of likes? I do not remember seeing this info when I signed up. I'm out of likes and I can only get them if I pay. This is cheap.
1410,paulex official,"April 6, 2020",3, Good but need to improve not to upgrade on only one like
1411,Brian Smith,"February 5, 2020",4, Seems prerty good. Just which you had mote likes in a day without havijg to buybthe membership. Havent met anyone but have struck up a few good coversations
1412,anthony t,"February 6, 2020",3, Notification settings can't be customized. You either get everything or nothing. Also can't send pictures or gifs
1413,Shelby Thompson,"February 27, 2020",4, Not having the premium option makes the app slightly limited. But good.
1414,Brandon S,"February 28, 2020",5, Pretty good. I like the messaging being free and the non tinderish feel its got.

1418,Josh Clifford,"March 21, 2020",4, Good dating app. From my experience matches are about trying to find a compatible relationship rather than just 1 night stands.
1419,Jello Dee Marco,"April 7, 2020",5, Being able to use a prompt sets hinge apart. You get a different perspective of other people
1420,Kallie Schell,"April 15, 2020",3, Apparently I can't see the people who like me unless I upgrade. Very frustrating! That's not how it used to be
1421,Charles Michael,"April 19, 2020",2," Ever since I downloaded this app I've not gotten a single response from anyone on the site, going to one month now. Why"
1422,Vinnod,"April 6, 2020",2, Mutual likes can't be turned in matches ! There's a bug !
1423,Philip Carhart,"February 6, 2020",4," Of the dating apps, it has the least fake profiles. So there's that. Same amount of ghosters, sadly üòÇü§£"
1424,Chris Crocco,"February 7, 2020",2, Still finding a lot of bots or scammers. Pretty annoying.
1425,Jim Elliott,"February 17, 2020",5, Its accessible before charging. Prices seem reasonable.
1426,Philippe Bastien,"February 17, 2020",4, Great but cannot send pictures that's should be fix!
1427,Duff Wallace,"March 6, 2020",4, Good but one sided. Once again it's on the guy to do all the work and girls to just look for the guys with the hardest bodies.
1428,Craig Chase,"March 15, 2020",1, Had a malfunction system that didn't work. Help desk suggested an uninstall then reload... now I'm banned. Worst site ever.
1429,jensen atkins,"March 20, 2020",1, Can't change my preferences. Says my profile needs to be completed. But says it's 100% completed. Still can't change anythinf
1430,Jake L.,"March 31, 2020",5, Uniquely organic experience in starting communication.
1431,Aaron Kephart,"April 5, 2020",1, Starting to seem like a scam. I'm paying for preferred and not getting any of it... also getting no gelp by contacting support. I followed the steps in the support section and nothing.
1432,sanyam jain,"April 21, 2020",1, If you dont pay the matches will get disappeared
1433,Logan Odom,"February 9, 2020",4," It's good, more detailed than other apps of a similar nature"
1434,Trista Hindes,"February 10, 2020",4," It's telling me to complete my profile before I can like pictures or customize my preferences, but my file says 100% complete"
1435,ifeanyi omeokachie,"February 19, 2020",4, Perfect app. only bad thing is the permitted likes per day is too small for free users
1436,Doug Peck,"February 21, 2020",5," Much better than the competition, been stable and just the right level of notifications"
1437,Devin Foster,"February 25, 2020",4, Better than Tinder because it forces people to give info about themselves and more photos. Hasn't stop filters yetü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1438,Spencer Smith,"March 7, 2020",1," Used before, now when signing back up keeps telling me age restrictions and wants my driver's license.. why?"
1439,Sabrina Benedict,"March 29, 2020",1, You have to pay to filter by height now. You're no better than Tinder or Bumble at this point.
1440,Chris Stevenson,"April 4, 2020",5, This app connects you with like minded people. It's successful I have no complaints.
1441,yadav Durgesh,"February 13, 2020",3," Its better than other apps, still started chatting without paying anything"
1442,Beetanator Mask,"February 10, 2020",5, Perfect for semi attractive but clever and witty guys that arent good looking enough for hook ups but funny enough for casual dating
1443,Robert O'Connor,"February 28, 2020",5, Much better algorithm than other apps and a more interactive layout
1444,Sher Khan,"March 14, 2020",4, It should filter people closest to you. Other than that it's good.
1445,Eerin Costanzo,"March 16, 2020",5, Amazing. Nothing like the other app that I've tried. It's like eharmony for 2020.
1446,Aj R,"April 17, 2020",1," I get the same bunch of people every single time, and that too the ones I'm least interested in. Useless app"
1447,Meredith Ewell,"April 24, 2020",5," So far, so good! Great format."
1448,Danny Rodriguez,"April 3, 2020",1," I reviewed this app years ago and gave it five stars. They keep asking me to review it every so often. So now, you get 1 star."
1449,Randall Smith,"February 9, 2020",5, Better than literally any other dating service I have ever tried by a long shot. All the other charge ridiculous prices and you hardly get any matches or wven find good people. On Hinge there are great women and it's all free.
1450,John Willingham,"February 9, 2020",5, Easy to use and navigate! Would recommend!
1451,Ian Wan,"February 11, 2020",2, Petty annoyed how similar matches keep showing up day in and day out. Kinda getting over it and lots of them if consider irrelevant
1452,Monica Gaut,"March 1, 2020",5, Easiest to use and most connections out of dating apps. I've tried. And it's free!
1453,IILMTII,"March 1, 2020",1, Harasses me with obese and transgender people for the free version. No guarantee of improved experience if you pay. Will not upgrade till better experience on the free version.
1454,LaWynda Olsen,"March 14, 2020",4, This app came recommended by a young lady I adore. My first experiences have been good but limited due to free account but I've already found & talked to a few nice gentlemen. So TY!
1455,Angela,"April 15, 2020",3, Asks too many times what you think of the app before giving me a chance to actually experience the app.
1456,Jason Cunha-Lautsch,"February 9, 2020",3," 20 likes a day, but slogan is ""made to be deleted"" Maybe I'm just not that good. I like the idea though."
1457,Juan Almonte,"March 12, 2020",3, Not too many matches üòî and they sometimes send me guys profiles to look at eventhough i selected im interested in females.
1458,Tofowa Pyle,"March 15, 2020",4," It's nice, not much interactions yet but its engaging."
1459,Nick Osmonson,"March 19, 2020",5, People actually match on this. Still not the most matches but im also a solid 6 so its probably not the app.
1460,Riyaz van Wegberg,"March 23, 2020",3, It's okay but a huge dealbreaker for me is the fact that everything is in imperial. Would love if they could ad the metric system.
1461,Vincent Chau,"March 29, 2020",3," My only complaint with Hinge is that it's a bit heavy-handed with how it shows you people that are around your ""physical attractiveness"" and sometimes it's feels like it works against if you if you're an acquired taste."
1462,Marissa Holley,"March 28, 2020",4, very detailed profile options but limits number of swipes per day
1463,solution ifedolapo,"April 15, 2020",5, Nice easy to access with good features
1464,Morgan,"February 13, 2020",5, profile Q&A is quite handy for an idea when thinking of something to open with
1465,Max Kogan,"February 20, 2020",5," Great App, very well-designed, lots of nice people."
1466,123,"April 15, 2020",1, Annoying that it always asks me to rate it. Mostly catfish on this app...
1467,Mr Williams,"March 3, 2020",1, Fix your sign in feature and sign up feature in impossible to use 1 star for now
1468,Liz Causey,"March 5, 2020",5, Dating pool seems to be more compatible than the other apps I've tried!
1469,Jap Slap,"March 25, 2020",5," Seriously the best set up for a dating app. I'm super introverted, and shy, Why I'm trying online dating, and this app helped me get out of my shell, a little..."
1470,Bert Curtis,"March 27, 2020",5, Their algorithm actually tried to get you matches with people that you'd be interested in instead of purposefully screwing you over like the other dating apps
1471,Anne Manske,"March 29, 2020",5, Easy to use and connect... wish there were more choices
1472,ALLISON M,"April 1, 2020",5, Loved the setup but looks like its mainly for people under 30 & I'm not
1473,C. Grey C,"April 10, 2020",5, I appreciate the daily limit on like's bc it helps me manage the volume.
1474,Amit Mirchandani,"February 16, 2020",5, Good design. Love how this app enables people to express their interest in someone
1475,Corn Holio,"February 18, 2020",1," SCAM ALERT!!! Do NOT download this app. Once they have all your info they'll change the birth year so it says you're under 18, this restricting access to the app entirely so you can't remove your info from the app. They're just phishing for sensitive information."
1476,Ryan C,"February 27, 2020",2, Still doesn't connect to Facebook but at least it can send an SMS now..
1477,Dave,"March 9, 2020",5, Could be better. Enjoying the non pay to play.
1478,Becca Donaldson,"March 18, 2020",3, It is a little frustrating to check a message you have to buy into the app
1479,M. Watts,"March 21, 2020",1," Cannot use the app because I ""haven't completed my profile"" even though it say profile 100% complete. Thanks"
1480,James Hurley,"March 22, 2020",2," the app itself is great, but make no mistake, hinge is THE BOTTOM OF THE DATING APP BARREL."
1481,Hiho Silver Away,"March 23, 2020",4, Pretty above average matches. Easy to use. Met someone cool first night on
1482,Shriniwas Kadam,"March 26, 2020",4, Very good. Needs some work with the messenger.
1483,Stephen Carroll-Keene,"March 3, 2020",1," The notifications suck on Android, they hardly ever work for matches or messages."
1484,Alex Willoughby,"March 21, 2020",1," Am asked to rate the app CONSTANTLY. So, here's your 1 star for bad user experience."
1485,Luke Cooper,"February 29, 2020",5, You tend to find less people looking for hook ups which is great and they is more photos and information to check out about each person which I like
1486,Kamilou Fofana,"February 26, 2020",2, The app itself is not bad but ya have to fix all the scammer ans sex services people on this app.i really didn't feel comfortable with that people be acting like that. It's dumb.
1487,Casey Garrett,"March 1, 2020",2, The app keeps shutting down after 2 minutes.
1488,Chris P,"March 6, 2020",1, Been on this app for about two weeks I don't pay for it so I only get 10 likes a day. Ive liked 140 people and not one match. Probably doesn't even send the people likes since I don't pay for it..... Waste of my time.
1489,Modena Meeks,"March 25, 2020",4," I like the improvements of the app, but it still lacks substance. I'm not very sociable and there's not much information to know if you want to contact a person to learn more. I need more information up front."
1490,neps cat nip,"March 28, 2020",4," So far I've met plenty of really cool people who are relatively close to me. Not everyone messages back but, those who do are pretty cool. It does charge once your like's run out though ..."
1491,Tj Spencer,"April 13, 2020",5, There actually people here that are looking for that special person. Not alot of fake profiles with scammers. I enjoy using this app over all others
1492,N B,"February 6, 2020",4," Finally an app where I can filter on cultural background an religion, makes it easier to find persons who are my type."
1493,Luke Smith Guitar,"March 1, 2020",5," Best dating app I've used, seems more genuine and has a nice way of putting info across"

1495,Jackie Johnson,"March 23, 2020",5, Lots of conversation and found great connections!

1513,Andrew Cooper,"April 9, 2020",3," This app has been really tough. It started by suggesting the same style/type/personality women as compatible with me after 30 X's in a row, it still pairs me with the woman who is 6 inches taller than me. Can't this app take a hint?!?"

1530,Shwetang Panchal,"March 5, 2020",5, I've experimented with this app for some experiencial learning. It's a well built app with some nice and unique features.
1531,Nic,"March 10, 2020",1, Designed to be deleted is right - what's the point of linking to Facebook if you can only select from your profile pictures?
1532,George Le Blond James,"March 16, 2020",3," Not a lot of people I find were my type, also men keep popping up when I specifically set my preferences for women."
1533,sboss50,"March 14, 2020",4, So far it's easy to use and short and concise
1534,msakallioglu,"February 16, 2020",5, One of the best apps out there. Smart user interface design.
1535,Noah crowder,"February 18, 2020",3," App is ok, the only problem I have is actually getting someone to even at least meet for coffee, so not really much you guys can do for that but app does run very well"
1536,Angela Abina,"February 14, 2020",1, Annoying AF to have a review request pop up every time I'm in the app or messages ;)
1537,Jena Robbins,"February 27, 2020",1, The men on here treat it like any other dating app by just swiping right on every one then never messaging if you do match because they finally decide to read your profile after you match.
1538,Lee Shelnut,"February 25, 2020",4, Why is Hinge not sending my Comments anymore? I can type the comment but says send like instead of comment and when I match the comment isn't there. Sometimes girls will match with me from something I say so It's really hurting my chances. Please fix!
1539,Angela Wyatt,"March 18, 2020",5, More responsiveness and interaction than Bumble.
1540,Wole Akinbi,"March 27, 2020",4," Easy to navigate, very functional."

1546,John Soong,"February 7, 2020",1," Accidentally put in the wrong birth date and was locked out of the app. I sent two emails to Hinge 6 months apart from each other, and I am still locked out of the app. Why bother suggesting to contact Hinge when no one responds to problems, let alone answer e-mails?"
1547,Heather Herbel,"February 12, 2020",3, I'm only a couple days in so dont have too much of an opinion yet other than I like how it's different from other apps. I'll circle back after I've used it more and give a more accurate rating üòä
1548,Sarah Sanon,"February 13, 2020",1, After I login the verication code never gets sent to my phone and I can't continue

1558,Jason Horne,"March 30, 2020",5, I Get tons of likes tons now which one to keep! Serious works fine....bomb ones
1559,Crystal Allen,"March 27, 2020",5, Easiest app to use ever. It really is. Thank you for making dating simpler
1560,Casey Bain,"April 1, 2020",1," Yo I was banned for no reason and when I messaged customer support all they said was 'well ya know its whatever' and signed off their latest email with ""this will be our last correspondence"" IM SORRY BUT WHAT KINDA BS is this üòÇüòÇI was really enjoying the app til all this!"

1566,Ryan Mcdermid,"March 8, 2020",2, Been on this app for 3 weeks. Haven't had one match or like. Either no one is on it or they are all fake accounts
1567,jason tuinstra,"March 8, 2020",1," If you're looking for an over weight slob or cross dresser or transgender this is the site for you, just the worst selection of people. Not to mention the speed of the app is atrocious."
1568,Bryce Schrag,"April 3, 2020",1, Only get to like 5 times before you have to wait 24 hrs if you dont pay for sub now? This app became a joke. Unistall
1569,dat___afrikaans.kindje Rudey.y,"April 13, 2020",4, Very nice app but likes should be unlimited
1570,David Smith,"April 18, 2020",1, I'd give zero stars if I could. This app is clearly designed day one to give you the profiles of all the attractive women in your area in order to suck you in then after that it's all fatties.
1571,Robinson Sineus,"April 23, 2020",5, Great app and easy to use.

1575,Steve Bennett,"March 6, 2020",4, Definitely better quality matches than other sites.
1576,Daryl Petty,"March 9, 2020",1, Doesn't work with instagram 2 factor authentication.

The only drawback for me is that I'm shown profiles that I've ""liked"" that have clearly (or at least seemingly) declined my advances. If this is the case, I feel that, logically, those people should be removed from my options. This ""elimination"" feature should be worked into the algorithm."

1583,Matty Allen,"March 1, 2020",1, Cannot get on app put incorrect age and customer support is nonexistent.
1584,Andrew hayes,"March 20, 2020",4, Wpuld give it five stars it is a good app and helps find people you might like what could be better is sometimes it clutches and gives me the same few people and once I redownload it's all better

1592,William Hopkins,"February 27, 2020",4, Solid dating site that changes how we select each other and choose to interact.
1593,Leo Jalaf,"March 19, 2020",1, This app is same like other apps. Fake profiles. I want my refund. I only use it for a day
1594,Misha Jaffe,"April 12, 2020",3, Not getting matched with people looking for the same thing as me.
1595,G5A Wireless,"April 11, 2020",1," Banned; Says terms of violation. Didn't know meeting a couple crazy people was violation, good to know they are all about working things out and taking into account ""fair handling"" No email given from staff, nothing Like they say, meant to be deleted."

Terrible app. Tried to differentiate itself from Tinder / Bumble with silly questions it forces you to answer (eg I'm overly competitive at x). Very lame - you'll find girls bypass this entirely and like your pictures without commenting, so it's just a waste of time. It's also far more time consuming to like people / swipe, and the daily number of likes you have is tiny compared to that of Tinder. Awful app."

1781,Elizabeth Ortiz,"January 28, 2020",3, I think it's a good app. However they should give a trial. For those new members to try the preferred or premium plans it's not fair that I get someone that likes me and I can't see it without having to pay. some tweaks should be made.
1782,jessica yang,"January 30, 2020",3," Recently it keeps showing me these 5 potential matches that I've swiped no on, but once I close the app and open again they're still there. It has been going on like that for the past few days and it is annoying. Please fix it."

You can't expect instant matches or interactions but I find that to be the case with most of the other dating sites. I definitely recommend the app."
1791,Abby Adams,"January 30, 2020",4," Nice interface, and the setup on profiles does mean people actually interact with what you've posted rather than mindlessly swiping.

It's nice to know what the top thing for them is going into the conversation. They have a compatibility matrix, but they dont tell anything about it and it seems very ineffective. In the first 3 weeks: 0 dates on Tinder 1 date on Bumble 3 dates on Hinge."

Normally I don't waste my time rating apps but my experience with Hinge has been so sub par that I couldn't resist. The user interface is good - that's why I'm giving it three stars. The profiles being recommended by the app (based on my preferences and like/dislike history) are the polar opposite of what that history would suggest, and the app does ping your phone with notifications, until you shut them down.

1972,Caylor Heaverlo,"February 3, 2020",5, Best dating app out there. Somewhat forces you to have a complete profile so you know more about the people you meet. You can pay but you dont necessarily need to since basic features arent walled off like most other apps.

2147,Holly Cashman,"November 26, 2019",5, Great app for meeting people. I love the profile feature. The idea of liking something they've already said makes it super easy to strike up a conversation. My only qualm is that it takes a second to load everytime you open your messages.
2148,Nathanael Lane,"November 29, 2019",4," This app is buggy and full of dark UI patterns that optimize for ""engagement."" The UX is better than other popular dating apps on the market, but that's a very low bar to clear. Much of the appeal of the app is through network effects rather than standalone merit."
2149,B H,"December 2, 2019",4," Not bad. I like how profiles are displayed with the picture layouts and your answers to questions that presented and then you can like and comment on a person's answer or picture. Only issue is likes are not unlimited, that's how they get you to pay."

2151,Rob Cavallo,"December 2, 2019",2, The app crashes when scrolling through profiles after a bit. It will happen because there are no body type filters and everyone on this site is overweight. So if you are a fit person looking for other fit people perhaps this is not the best app. If you like BBW then you are in the right place.
2152,Bryce Londree,"December 11, 2019",1," App is very glitchy. Asks for a sms verification and never sends it, if you close out of it and reload it. It skips that step.

2153,Candy Welk,"December 18, 2019",1," Easy enough to set up and navigate, but tired of hitting x only for the same profile to appear or completely disregard preferences.

2154,x x,"January 5, 2020",2, Very annoying that if you connect to Facebook you cannot remove photos the app picks from your Facebook account. Ridiculous that you need to replace every single photo. It's my photo. I should be able to decide and not the app. Age preference is not working properly.

The actual app is better than the other dating apps I've tried, but I have lost my account because Hinge has no way to recover your account if you only used a phone number to create one."

2218,Nicholas Snow,"November 18, 2019",4," A decent amount of matches and less focus on photos. The conversations I have had some far a pretty positive! My concern is with the UI. Sometimes it will take a while to back out of certain elements, such as the chat"
2219,Rahul Gupta,"November 26, 2019",5," Awesome and a genuinely great dating app with real people and no nonsense bottlenecks created to force users to pay.

2220,Simon Mellins,"November 29, 2019",1," Too many server problems to bother with. You like someone and compose a message, send it... Next time you open the app they're there again, it never sent. You choose no for someone... They come back when you reopen. Too unreliable to use, avoid."
2221,R. Ross,"December 2, 2019",1," The developer says this app is made to be deleted. However... use caution. If you delete the app, you will never be able to log in again. I used my phone number to log back in, and they will never send you a text, in order to log back in."
2222,Claudia Lee,"December 12, 2019",3," Mediocre. The messages dont always show up, sometimes it'll tell me I've got a message and then I cant read it for several hours. They recommend people to you that you're supposed to be a good match for - not sure what algorithms they're using as they couldnt have got it more wrong."

2224,Franciscy,"December 15, 2019",4," A surprisingly solid app. Easier to start up a conversation vs tinder and I just prefer the general structure of it. Only real downside is that it needs a big marketing push on the uk to get more people on board. I give it a ""I feel slightly less lonely in life but still somewhat lonely"" out of 10."

2226,Michael Lee,"January 22, 2020",4," Actually a pretty good app. Many of the users are looking for something more serious. People cry that you don't get enough likes, but they probably should put a little more effort in haha.

2241,Matthew Buddell,"November 10, 2019",4, So far great but only had it for a short while. The concept of commenting/ liking specific parts of profiles are great for conversation starters. It does really push for you to get a premium version though with significantly less likes a day than other apps.
2242,Alden Johnson,"November 10, 2019",3," My biggest complaint is that it doesn't refresh your potential matches enough. So you swipe left on the same person half a dozen times, and it still keeps that person as a potential match again, again, and AGAIN."

2252,Gagan Khera,"January 6, 2020",5," I am a guy and getting good matches on this. Almost 1 in 5 girls I like reciprocate with a like and all are genuine profiles. The database of the app, however, is low compared to Tinder and other sites and same few faces keep coming again and again. I would say it has a good conversion rate"
2253,Ryan Haskins,"January 3, 2020",3," While I do like the app, the location could use some work - its almost TOO specific to the point of me not knowing what city ppl are in. One came up as ""east"" east what?. We have limited likes and not being able to tell what city someone is actually in really hinders the experience."
2254,Phase,"January 11, 2020",3," The limit of 10 likes a day isn't great and the lack of the ability to filter by anything more than age and distance without paying money is awful, but the fact you can comment on someone's profile means conversations can be a lot easier to get started."
2255,Keira Pritchard,"January 8, 2020",4," Seems fairly decent, however it's glitchy. I tried to answer a message, but when I sent it wouldn't send, the only way out of the page was to exit and then it just unmatched us. Undo also unavailable apparently. Fix this and it'll be much better"
2256,Dylan Knight,"January 20, 2020",4," I think it could benefit from having more systems for selection (personality type, interests?)

2257,ahvire baxter,"January 25, 2020",1," Fix your messaging system!

2258,Nick Landis,"January 28, 2020",5, It's definitely a nice alternative to other dating apps. Being able to leave a comment with a like definitely feels more personal.
2259,Mark E,"February 6, 2020",4, Pretty good app at finding matches and putting little blurbs about yourself. Matching is very restrictive unless you pay but the chat feature I like a lot.
2260,Wesley Maxwell,"February 8, 2020",4, Positive so far. By being able to chat straight away you've increased you're chances of a reply. Better than endless swiping and disappointing results.

2273,Valerie Guerrero,"November 11, 2019",1," Latest update now makes you pay for the height filter. As a taller girl, I really hate this new update. I find myself turning to other apps and will probably get rid of this soon. Also you wait a long time to match with someone."

2303,Joseph Maltby,"January 22, 2020",4," The algorithm is pretty solid. Their recommendations are often people I'd be interested in if I found them on their own. My one complaint is that the process of matching is a little vague, so nobody knows who's expected to talk first."
2304,Kevin Ndife,"January 18, 2020",4," The filters aren't super great, at least a free ones. But the format of the app, it's letting you know who likes you so you can make a decision, and making you like a specific trait about somebody so that you don't get as many bad matches or both good features."
2305,Matthew Throne,"January 23, 2020",3," Much more detailed, and I like the matching system. But the quality of people is the same as Tinder. They match and stay silent. If you want your app to differentiate itself. You have to punish users that don't take it seriously."

Then on Black Friday, Hinge increased the cost to $20 (with no new features!) and proclaimed you could get a 50% discount... so still $10."
2313,Andrew Bertonesi,"November 6, 2019",3," Good idea, poorly executed Very glitchy app, after swiping no on people they still come up and clog the feed, messages send multiple times and you seem to run out of swipes randomly.

2315,Colton Whitehill,"November 20, 2019",5," Great app! Free, and it is nice to be able to comment on other people's things on their profile to engage in conversation! Also this app is not full of people trying to catfish, or fake profiles that are robots."
2316,Paul Johnson,"November 23, 2019",5," You get so much without having to pay for the premium version.

It doesn't feel like the app is forcing you to pay by dangling relationships in front of you, unlike every other dating app I've used. The design of the app also succeeds in emphasizing quality of matches over quantity, and the comment-first feature is great to showcase your personality. My only quibble is the app likes to scroll to the top of conversations!"
2322,John Lightfield,"January 8, 2020",5, High quality matches. I think it helps that you are prompted to introduce yourself to a match with a comment on one of their responses or pictures. Messenger portion of app could be improved as navigation within a thread can be laborious.
2323,Stephanie,"March 17, 2020",3, The daily limit for likes is way too low
2324,larry dean,"December 18, 2019",3," Hinge was better before they started to limit people's pickings. There's no consistency in the timer that you get to choose possible matches, it's available at random times. Definitely a drawback, another money trap to get you to pay to play looks like to me."
2325,Joshua Rowe,"November 8, 2019",5," I like the variety of options there are in terms of preferences. The system is good and I think works effectively. Overall this is probably the best dating app I have used. I should mention that this is as a paid member, so undoubtedly is better than the free version."

2327,Stephanie Luce,"November 13, 2019",3, I'm having trouble with messages loading. When it does load it loads to the very top of the message string then I have to scroll all the way down. It takes a while for notifications and the app to sync.
2328,Mike Reed,"November 22, 2019",2," Buggy, often don't receive notifications for messages or matches. Also they give you a small amount of likes per day unless you pay money. The number of likes seems to be even less the more people you say no to."

The other apps, such as Bumble and OkCupid, are an all around disappointment and most profiles I like or message are either no longer active or, if a match goes through, are unable to hold a conversation beyond a word, or simply ghost after a short conversation. Hinge is by far the best dating app if you can hold a conversation and want dates."
2331,mash b,"November 22, 2019",3, Signing up and loading all the information took a very long time. For each photo I wanted to upload I had to turn off the app and then get back on it as it showed I had no photo. It was a bit frustrating.
2332,Aaron E,"November 30, 2019",1," The limited amount of likes is a problem. If I have to choose between paying for a premium version or just not using the app, my choice would be not using the app. There's no point in using it if I can't like people because I don't have anymore likes left. Stupid."
2333,Billie Yuan,"December 11, 2019",1," If you want to encourage relationships, it would be better to have it be a requirement that people send a message and not just likes. It's like tinder at the moment. People aren't communicative. There's not enough information in profiles too."
2334,Joe LaPhilliph,"December 12, 2019",2, I gave this app 6 months and got no matches that actually sent a message to me. Honestly it's convinced me that I'm not worth it to anyone. On the plus side the app design is sleek and the filtering works pretty well so I can see all those who don't want to talk to me.

Sent an email as directed, including a picture of my ID, to verify my age and fix the issue and have not heard back after weeks. Very poor support regarding a simple issue.

2337,Michael Laush,"January 26, 2020",4, Seems like there are actually real people on here. Only problem is the app lags. Messages show up way later than when they were sent. It seems like the updating takes a while also. Everytime you log in messages you already read show up as new.
2338,Victoria Gallagher,"February 4, 2020",3, The messaging is really weird sometimes but i like the concept. So far its working great for me.
2339,Craig Smith,"February 3, 2020",5, This is the best dating app I have tried. In my opinion you are more likely to meet the person you talking to than you are with any other app.

2345,matt edmond,"November 15, 2019",2, Asks me to rate too many times. Insists that I need to match with people that are far beyond the radius that I've set.. keeps notifying me about things that didn't happen. The app is great besides those things... But those things are very annoying
2346,Frankie Armstrong,"November 21, 2019",3," Its nice to meet people but it freezes a lot and will send messages I did not type. When talking to the other people on it, they say the same thing happens to them as well. Few bugs but not terrible."
2347,Joshua Wright,"November 24, 2019",5," Really smooth, slick platform with an intuitive format. Clever, witty suggestions for the profile which inspire a little bit of audacity from the users. Extremely impressed. Only had it a day and already much prefer it to Tinder."
2348,JthaBrain BRAINIAK_BRAINWAVES,"December 5, 2019",5, So im writing this because the app functions like is supposed to. Good Matches after a bit. But this is from a man's perspective I would imagine the experience could be different for a woman. Good luck out there.
2349,Garvis Davis69,"December 20, 2019",4," It's a good app, the only thing that bugs me is that sometimes when you like and comment, the comment sometimes doesn't send to the other person, and it just says ""you liked their answer"" and I have to apologise and tell them what I originally said"
2350,Jessica S,"December 29, 2019",4," So far it seems good. There are some glitches, it will x a person when you didn't but then they reappear. In chat, sometimes its blank and you have to reload. But overall, good selection of humans."
2351,Tanya Walker,"January 7, 2020",4," There are still some minor glitches, like messages that you haven't read yet looking like they have been, but overall a good app. I like that you can't put down too much information; it forces you to have a conversation."
2352,Ian Both,"January 12, 2020",5," Best experience I've had on a dating app hands down. The method used to match leads to far better conversations far more often. Designed to be deleted and for me, that was a goal that was met quickly."
2353,Steven Shorte,"January 15, 2020",3," I'm not getting all my messages, as in, I'll get a phone notification indicating I have a message, but it won't be reflected in the app. The app sometimes grinds to a halt and becomes completely unresponsive."
2354,Tierney Hambleton,"January 15, 2020",3, Cool concept but showing me guys out of my age range. I'll set it to 22-28 and see men in their 30s and 40s in the discover section! I'm in my early 20s im not trying to see 45 year old men! Also it pushes premium a lot.
2355,Raph Porco,"February 17, 2020",1," So far... its not that bad. Once you weed out these fake profiles. Just be normal and not a weirdo people. Its online dating, take it with a grain of salt! Update: My profile was deleted without my knowledge or consent. Kinda bs. 1 star for that."
2356,Craig King,"February 2, 2020",1, I downloaded the app to set up a account. When tried to set up I was told I couldn't as I was banned. Not sure how you can be banned from somthing when you were not even a member to start with. When emailed I was told basicly told tuff with no answers. Total joke
2357,Jonathan Prince,"February 10, 2020",4," I don't think they have false profiles, that's what is good"

2364,Carl Spivey Jr.,"February 1, 2020",1, I paid for the preferred membership play giving me the basic membership and I'm not very happy about it. Other than that is okay.
2365,Soph Merc,"November 12, 2019",3," Quality of men, ok. The platform is rubbish. You get a notification to say someone has liked you but when you open the App there it says No Likes.

Randomly they will send me an email saying there this a person they fill is a perfect match for me. I don't know how they can consider that when they don't know anything about me. There's no way that to add additional information to the profiler or set filters for what your looking for. They say this app is created for deleting. Should say this app is created for not being downloaded in the first place.
2367,Yev,"November 18, 2019",5," Match quality needs improvements, but it is getting better. The screening process is very good and there are practically no robots or shady fake accounts, which offsets any negatives."
2368,Shaun Joey,"November 18, 2019",1, Awful. Disgusting. For months now I have not heard anything from HINGE. no match no contact no nothing. Something is wrong with the app. I'm afraid to uninstall and reinstall fearful of loosing my chips. Please check my account from your end and fix it please. Thank you Shahn
2369,Bruce Finebaum,"November 21, 2019",2, Generally like the app but suddenly banned for no apparent reason. Claimed TOS violations (plural) but failed to provide any details when contacted. Would be nice to know if my account or profile was hacked or what. Frustrating to not know what happened and customer service was zero help.
2370,Keenan Myers,"November 27, 2019",4," Some glitches when using it. Messages send multiple times, or don't send at all. Weird glitches when opening messages from notifications. But overall the app is awesome. Way better than tinder. Like tinder's mature older sibling."

It definitely makes it harder to sift through people and actually meet someone I like. I'm 5'11"" and it can be tedious to find someone that's taller than me but also has a good personality."
2372,Kevin R Strauss,"December 9, 2019",3," I like the app. I like the concept. I'm struggling with the execution with lost messages, missed notifications, freezes and other similar bugs. As an app developer myself, this app needs some real optimization work."
2373,Camyla Nikirk,"December 13, 2019",4," It is above tinder and other dating apps I've tried for sure, but there is one thing I would change.

If any woman sees a Lucas who is a nurse and looks muscular its a fake profile that tries to scam you into sending monetary gift cards due to some kind of hardship. You will never be able to speak with or face time this person who claims they are working in another country short term. Outside of that great matches and good conversations. And people of good quality to go on dates with to see if there is something there to develop deeper. I recommend it
2386,Rob S,"January 28, 2020",4," It does the job but the ""We think you should meet"" function needs more work, I'm commonly matched with people who have ""dealbreakers' such as a religious or political orientation, drug use, etc."

2393,Heidy A.,"December 6, 2019",3, Easy to use. There does seem to be many of the same people even AFTER you've X'd them off when you are not interested. Developers must be hoping the next time I log in I have changed my mind? Not sure..please stop/fix it. Total waste of my time. Thanks
2394,Andrew Harlow,"November 10, 2019",3," Incredibly buggy since the design refresh went live. Messages disappear, images from previous profiles load onto subsequent ones. Notifications no longer work properly. Shame as it spoils what has otherwise been a positive experience."

I know that gender is visible but sometimes pronouns may still be vague even if you know someone's gender identity and it's super uncomfy to have to correct people when you use different pronouns than they expect. Good on you for including a wide selection of gender identities but pronouns are even more important when it comes to interactions with strangers.
2397,Anthony Chan,"December 31, 2019",5, This is the funnest dating app I've used so far. Forget the swiping and same old profiles written a million times over. You get to show more personality by sending comments to photos and questions. There is much more freedom to be yourself!
2398,gotsniff,"December 25, 2019",5," Hinge offers many features for free that other dating apps charge for. Baked in, u can see those who have liked ur photos so its not just scrolling through people--hoping for a match--all of the time. The app encourages conversation between users. This is over looked in other apps."
2399,Maria Simmonds,"December 30, 2019",5, It's good mostly like all the rest of the sites the only thing I don't like are the limited likes if you wanna have unlimited then you have to pay that's kind of a sneaky way of them to get you to pay for what most sites offer for free.
2400,Helen Taylor,"January 7, 2020",3," Better than tinder as a concept but the free version isn't very good at filtering your preferences.... and the messaging side is a bit rubbish, sometimes sending a notification of a message but on opening the page, no messages appear."
2401,Dylan Fernandes,"January 8, 2020",4," The 3 minimum prompts is definitely a good thing, but the 3 maximum prompts could be raised. I don't like how if you switch app's for a minute and go back to this one, the profile you were looking at gets automatically X'd."
2402,Adam Mattinson,"January 20, 2020",4, A great approach to online dating. Method for matching encourages more in depth and meaningful matches compared to other options out there. Only inconvenience is a minor annoyance with the UI which occasionally bounces the view to the top of the chat whenever opening the window.
2403,Maile Carey,"January 24, 2020",3, I've been liking it so far but just recently my matches responses are disappearing after I see the notification tap it to bring me in the app it's gone. This just happened so aside from that I love the layout and easy use of it all.
2404,Arizona Pilot,"January 26, 2020",1," Says I violated the terms and can never use the app again. I've emailed several times to customer service and they say they can't tell me what I did.

I've emailed several times to customer service and they say they can't tell me what I did. Don't waste your time with this app, it's full of spam account, fake profiles and apparently a customer service that refuses to help when you do nothing wrong."
2405,Kevin Manson,"January 24, 2020",4, It's a good app especially since after a few likes and dislikes it shows you people of your interest. The only dislike is that you have a limit on your how many people you like. Thus. They recommend you to buy a subscription to have more.
2406,Leora Simon,"March 1, 2020",1, Poor selection can't be selective in unpaid version
2407,Charles Haines,"March 1, 2020",5," Great app, gives me the opportunity for quality dating."
2408,Brandy Walker,"March 15, 2020",4, It's giving me a wrong location but besides that everything is good
2409,Steve Z Turner,"March 28, 2020",4, Decent app. Reasonable dating pool.
2410,Dustin Lewis,"January 3, 2020",4," App has been working pretty good since my last review. My only gripe so far is that after using it for a while, it starts to freeze up. Not sure if it's my Google Pixel 2 or the app itself."
2411,Mr Aware,"November 10, 2019",1, SHOCKING APP! ...A good app but then suddenly I'm not allowed any more likes forever more unless I pay ¬£10 per month?! It's not as if you've given a saily limit or anything... it's no more likes forever... 1 star until you dtop being so greedy.
2412,Elsa Lindstrom,"November 16, 2019",1," They changed a bunch of really basic filter settings to paid only, but only after they gave them to you for free for awhile so you got used to it. Bait and Switch - the classic scam normally reserved for shady car dealerships, now in our apps."
2413,Thomas H.,"January 3, 2020",2, I have been swiping for 3 days and the app must be scrapping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to woman. I'm guessing it shows the less popular woman to non-paying account holders. I'm not that and picky I have yet to find anybody to that is worth the like.
2414,Lorna Balfour,"December 30, 2019",2," The fact that you have to pay to see your matches and only get limited chances to match each day makes no sense. There's a lot of good qualities on the app but right now, I'm preferring Bumble."
2415,Jacob Leis,"December 21, 2019",4," Rating is based in comparison to Bumble Match CoffeeMeetsBagel App has not crashed. The layout is concise and easy to read. Most importantly and I'm not sure if this is intended, but no annoying pop-ups. So thank you for that."
2416,Jonathan Davern,"January 1, 2020",1," Worst app every I downloaded this app 2018 and put my age in correctly and now it's 2020 and it still thinks someone born in the before the year 2000 is under 18. Did what they asked to verify my age so they could fix it but nope, still not fixed! I would give it Negative stars if I could!!!"
2417,Nikolas Hoyt,"January 7, 2020",5," Really great compared to some of the stories I've heard from my friends about the other apps. Very happy with my experience so far. Immersive enough, and good range to hone your goal. Thank you!"
2418,richard koury,"January 10, 2020",3," Nothing pertaining to this app but it would be nice to have something that requires more than just a ""like"" of a photo. People who just do that tend to quickly fizzle, because they were never truly interested to begin with."
2419,Bubble Boba,"January 13, 2020",4," I like it, people are a little more serious on here and I've actually met some cool people, a lot of the guys are funny for sure so this app feels a little more relaxed and I think as long as you're patient you'll *maybe* find someone üòä"

I've used other dating apps before, but this one really seems to focus on addressing big issues that can be deal-breakers. Don't want to see people who are of different political/religious/ideological backgrounds? You can tell right away based on the profile and save yourself time and pain. You interested in kids in the future? You don't have to worry about meeting and falling for someone who doesn't want them."
2421,Bianca Pamboukian,"January 25, 2020",5," Apparently the super psychos havent discovered this app yet, so is super good to meet nice ppl. I've only had good experiences. The fact you have to answer the questions makes it easy to start a conversation and it makes things less shallow. Its the only app I bother taking a look at sometimes."
2422,David Botton,"February 4, 2020",2, The screen continues to jump back to the top of the page. Absolutely maddening. Fix it please.
2423,David Muir,"January 31, 2020",4," Run out of likes quickly, but like the idea of having to be more specific on what you like about someone. More engaging. Let's hope it works."
2424,Garrett Bryant,"January 29, 2020",4, Pretty good so far but make sure you double check the settings. It automatically set my radius to 100miles which was a little annoying
2425,Patrick Woodring,"February 16, 2020",1, When you try log in it won't recognize your phone number
2426,Austin Christofferson,"February 13, 2020",1, the initial ladies were all fake. after 24 hours I started to get realistic potential matches in my queue.
2427,noah kendall,"February 29, 2020",4, It's actually good at figuring out who you would have a good date with. Whether or not that's who you're meant to be with is another question. I've had plenty of good dates with people that later turned out to be not my style
2428,Eunice Marquez,"March 1, 2020",1, Why doesnt the app let me sign in with just my phone #. I dont want to give you full access to my fb.
2429,Stephanie Nerette,"March 12, 2020",5, Awesome dating app. Very user-friendly
2430,Brandon Muha,"March 21, 2020",5," Great app, way better than the competitors."
2431,Anson,"March 18, 2020",2," real life is still the place to meet, this just kills time."
2432,Daniele Martin,"March 17, 2020",4, Pretty good. The men seem to have slightly better behavior than the men on other sites.
2433,Luke Kuchta,"March 19, 2020",5," Solid app, probably the best in comparison to tinder and bumble"
2434,Rich Ward,"March 29, 2020",5," I've only been on this app for 2 hours, and I already have two great conversations going."
2435,Tim Knudson,"November 11, 2019",1, Removed connections still show days later. UX is very annoying and just not easy to use. Certainly a long way until as easy and effectice as Tinder. Unless you give feedback the app constantly asks even if you select not to rate.
2436,Mark Manning,"April 5, 2020",1, Plagued with bug after bug. You type a message to someone and that message box e pands and pushes the send button below the display with no way to press it. Dont you guys TEST your software?
2437,Joe Kaelin,"November 15, 2019",2," Best online app so far, but you end up cycling through the same 50+ people no matter how many times you X them out. If it was a semi-permanent X for people, I would rate it higher."
2438,Sayed Youssef,"November 17, 2019",4," Great concept, better than a lot of the other dating apps. The only issue is when you log back in, it'll show messages as new, when I've already seen and read them already."
2439,K S-G,"November 25, 2019",5," Premier current dating app, the ""questions"" add a good personal depth for sharing yourself (and useful as ice breakers), while still having the ability to ""like"" photos as well. Good preference selection too."
2440,timoth88,"December 9, 2019",4," Very good dating app, and popular, so there are lots of options. However its pretty technically glitchy at times. Most are small annoyances rather than major issues, so I still recommend it."
2441,Winnie Maz,"December 10, 2019",4," Well organized and more serious compared to Tinder. the notifications for the conversations are confusing, because they constantly want you to continue so you think you received a message but its a notification to tell its your turn to reply üòÖ"
2442,Alonzo Torres,"December 14, 2019",4, Love the app! Definitely better than any other thing I use. Only problem is the preferences. They don't seem to work. I keep matching with people way older than me or with people who live too far. That needs to get fixed!
2443,Britinie horvath,"January 2, 2020",1," This app is terrible. Cannot filter properly, doesn't let you fill out more information about yourself. You do not get unlimited likes, it's a scam to get you to upgrade. Its meant to be deleted because its garbage."
2444,Colette Katz,"December 27, 2019",5," Really fun so far. Like the guys. Problem: how can I actively search for dates? See photos & bios? So far, I'm only able to answer those who are writing me. How are they managing to do so, since I'd like to do the same?"
2445,Ekansh Saxena,"January 7, 2020",2," If you really want people to delete the app please add the last active feature. It really feels like after giving so much info, the profiles are not frequenting the platform. Men are putting more efforts just to see them go down the drain"
2446,Julia Hoang,"January 8, 2020",4," So far so good. However one thing I think they should totally change is the location of the person. People are listed according to neighborhoods instead of city, so I'm always googling where on earth places are, such as Jingletown, which happens to be Oakland. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2447,Daniel Carr,"January 29, 2020",5, Does a good job of filtering your matches and suggesting people that you might be a good match with. Definitely recommend this one over Bumble or Tinder.
2448,Mason S,"January 30, 2020",4," Making your profile takes a while but that's good, it makes the matches you get a lot more genuine"
2449,A Google user,"January 28, 2020",1," Cant even upload a profile picture from my camera roll because your app wont load most of the pictures in my camera roll plus the fact that I cant actually choose the location I live ........ can see why yous say ""made to be deleted"""
2450,Sweet Bread,"March 10, 2020",5, Cool app. Lots of good matches.
2451,Chris Plumpton,"March 13, 2020",5, There enough traffic to be able to genuinely meet people in the real world.
2452,Amy H,"March 20, 2020",3," So far so good, but the real test is yet to be seen."
2453,Thad Asa,"December 1, 2019",2," It is still pretty slow loading interfaces, but at least things load now. A couple months ago I couldnt load anything. Small improvements, but it's better than nothing"
2454,Andy Hammond,"November 16, 2019",1," The update has ruined this app. Its glitchy, wont let you match with people who have liked you, crashes regularly and messages sometimes dont send. I used to really like this app, but the experience is awful right now. Please fix it!"
2455,Michael Bagley,"November 12, 2019",5," It has everything I want in a free dating app. I've found a number of gems, a couple of rotten apples, and a fair share of normal people seeking a companion. Being free, expect a limit on likes."
2456,shawn beliveau,"November 20, 2019",1," One star because zero is not an option. Downloaded the app, got to the interested in page and found it was blank. Also won't let me continue without selecting. It would be great if I could at least set up a profile."
2457,terina ayala,"November 22, 2019",1," All the reviews are saying the same thing. That's weird noone has said anything about a repair, not even app's creator/creators replied to the many complaints about it's glitches. That tells me it's not ready. I hope it will be soon."
2458,april d,"November 30, 2019",2, Guys are still treating this app like it's Tinder. There should be some mandatory screens that must be filled out before being able to use the app. The questions should filter out the people that don't actually want or aren't ready for a committed relationship with a life partner.
2459,K Lada,"December 1, 2019",3," The concept of the app and the quality of the people on it is best I've seen so far in dating apps (and I've literally been on dozens). However the technology keeps crashing, hence lower rating."
2460,Matthew Curtis,"December 4, 2019",4, Connections and conversations a plenty. It's a bit more personal when the app prompts you to write a few paragraphs about yourself. Really makes the online dating experience more personal.
2461,Curtis Granger,"December 17, 2019",3," Decent app, just recently deleted my account, yet when I deleted the app itself, Google play told me that there are still active subscriptions in the app. Is it because I already paid for the month? Because I deleted my account so I can't go in and cancel whatever the subscription might be."
2462,Anna D.,"January 4, 2020",1," One of the worst app ever, plenty fake accounts, you need to pay for everything, when you get premium account you have less possibilities than normal account. Don't expect to find someone ""normal"" there."
2463,Tim Pastelak,"January 5, 2020",3," Has a lot of features that are more useful to use to jumpstart a conversation which I like, not always easy to get to know people like most dating apps though. Much better than the competition"
2464,Michael Bent,"January 11, 2020",4," Minus one star because dating apps suck in general. 4 stars for doing absolutely everything they can do to make dating apps as least bad as possible. Now that they made the perfect app, if only they could make the perfect match. Now that deserves 5 stars!"
2465,Natalie B,"January 19, 2020",5," Easier to avoid time-wasters than other dating apps because people can only send you one message unless you match with them and subsequent unmatching (if needed) is simple. Good set up in terms of not having to write or read essays, there is only a small amount of text in profiles."
2466,Eleftherios Chelioudakis,"February 16, 2020",5, i like that we get less likes makes it less chaotic and you have to be carefull who you like this is not a self esteem up but something that actually works
2467,Kenny Stevenson,"February 13, 2020",5, The only dating app with genuinely good free features. I've met nice girls off it too. Definitely worth try before paying for Tinder etc
2468,Angelique Trollip,"February 21, 2020",5, I love that they give safety tips
2469,sammy short,"March 6, 2020",5," Good starting point questions, helps thin down wasted time."
2470,Nicole Ames,"March 11, 2020",4, Decent so far. No issues that I can see.
2471,David DeArmon,"January 21, 2020",4," Its a great idea but it has the same problems as other dating apps. I used the for a couple weeks and out of dozens of message staters , I only got a 2-3 responses. I never had anyone pop up in the ""likes you"" section."
2472,Colin,"January 22, 2020",1," Love the app, but the messages section and messaging of the app are so buggy and unreliable. Constant problems with messages. Makes me wonder how much of other parts of the app are broken? Please help and fix!"
2473,Yunus Danis,"November 6, 2019",2, This app turned into a mess. Location does not work properly anymore. People from other countries are popping up on my queue. Half the profiles are fake with single pictures of locations or animals. Useless.
2474,Jess E,"November 8, 2019",4, Pretty reliable app in terms of functionality. Can be a little slow sometimes but that's no big deal. Good app for better quality matches as almost everyone fills out their profile.
2475,John Door,"November 13, 2019",4, When first installing the app. There just quite a few moments where they just show all the same types of matches. And it's pretty annoying. But it seems to have evened out now.
2476,Nic Napoleone,"November 13, 2019",4," More than just an aimless swiping app, having profile prompts is a great idea. I'd like to see the ability to fill in the blank on ""Other"" responses like politics, 3 choices ain't enough in 2019"
2477,Jenn Hodgson,"November 17, 2019",4," I like the fact that there are so many questions to choose from when building your profile. It takes awhile to weed through the age ranges to find the one I want, but a good platform none the less"
2478,Sarah Bowers,"January 14, 2020",3," Love idea and content, but often glitchy. Asks me the same ""Have You Met"" question for the same person every time I log in, and it never remembers when I hide people I've matched with. Gets annoying."
2479,carina glover,"November 21, 2019",5," This app has a great range of people and I dont come across the same profiles over and over like in Match! So pretty good so far, I also happened to find the guy that I am crushing on, and that's a great sign."
2480,Isaiah Morrow,"December 2, 2019",1," This dating site is riddled with fake profiles utilizing the same phrases for all their descriptors. I am fairly certain that hinge is flooding their profile base with fake profiles to make it seem as though they have a much larger selection. Do not be fooled by this app, it will lead you nowhere."
2481,Neil Rodrigues,"December 4, 2019",4," Cool interface, like the ability to send a message to comment specifically on a pic or a conversation starter. I don't get a lot of responses but that's not the apps fault that I'm ugly"
2482,John Cisneros,"December 11, 2019",4," Everything's good! It keeps asking if I met people and constantly pops up if you don't say yes. I'd personally like it to pop up once a week. But I get it, the aim is for people to actually meet"
2483,Wes Newsom,"December 14, 2019",4, Wish there was an option to fill in a blank about me or create my own ice breaker. Also I think message notifications should by default be turned on after initially installing the app. Some people don't respond to messages for a long time.
2484,Aimee Blayney,"December 26, 2019",1, I am quite a bit older than 18 and have used the application before. Now it will no longer allow me to download the app because it states that I am younger than 18. Have tried deleting and redownloading it several times and it still is not working.
2485,Rutger Jackson,"December 25, 2019",3," Glitchy as hell, text responses to pictures or about me's sometimes go through sometimes not. Never quite sure how my first message is going to show for them. However, more genuine users that are looking to date than any other app"
2486,TUSHAR GAMING & TECH,"March 19, 2020",2," Yes, I have real matched with this application. But why I rate 2star, because due to limitations of finding your match."

Obviously hookers using the site for business. I met with a couple of girls, but pictures were very deceiving and I was not pleasantly surprised."
2488,David Bud,"January 14, 2020",1," It's all about money. 1 month costs $20... I've never seen a more expensive app before. If you don't pay, you're reminded every time you log in that things could better if you paid them..."
2489,Charles L. Barnett,"January 20, 2020",4, I have been on it for a week.. It seems okay. I really enjoy no adds. I tried other dating apps. I didn't like some of there layouts and formats. Hinge is more classy and done with style.
2490,Tobias Larsen,"January 27, 2020",4, Definitely prefer this app over tinder. Still minor bugs when going back and forth from chats to profiles but not to an annoying level.
2491,Jeremy Johnson,"January 27, 2020",5, Very positive experience. I love the question format. It makes it a lot easier to start a conversation!
2492,Christina Auman,"January 29, 2020",3, Above average compared to most apps very glad they don't charge just to chat. That's annoying.
2493,Nightwing 08,"January 28, 2020",3, Thankfully it was only 20 bucks. Needs more filter's. App it'sself works great so far just not my type of gals on here.
2494,Olivia Cox,"February 3, 2020",4, Good information shared and asked about. A little intimidating for first time users that are used to swiping.
2495,Katy Harrison,"February 15, 2020",4, Seems more current and modern than most apps out there.
2496,Èúç‰∏úËãá,"February 25, 2020",5, It's fun to use and the comments are witty
2497,Kyle Trautwein,"February 29, 2020",5, Easy to use. Although I haven't been on a date yet. I have communicated with quite a few women.
2498,Maria Cardo,"April 13, 2020",3," Its ok, a lot of fake profiles."
2499,Sharif Shabazz,"April 19, 2020",3, Too many scam profiles and inconsistent communicators

2501,Jason Bell,"April 2, 2020",1, Was great until it's like every other site now pay to see who likes you. Ya great I wanna pay so I can see a bot that wants to charge me money to see nudes or some 300lbs women . Done with this app
2502,Loise Lane,"November 11, 2019",4, It's okay for now I wish I could just go back in to people's profile again . Because it's easy to just swipe left . I've now seen that they are planning to add an undo button so that's great !!
2503,Liam Stritt,"November 14, 2019",3," Profile is good, can see they put care into designing for deeper connections. However its not perfect, the UI is buggy with regards to chat in particular scrolling all the way to the top."
2504,Huxley Gay,"November 18, 2019",2," The latest update takes away what was a free feature, filters, and makes it premium. Namely, I can no longer filter by height, smokers, drug/alcohol/weed use, or if someone has or wants kids."

I know they're fake because I've seen them exact same ones taken down on Plenty Of Fish. Except that, even when reported, Hinge doesn't take them down so it's an endless cycle of me reporting them, Hinge looking at them for five seconds, and then popping them right back into my matches until I give up. Unfortunately I bought a six month membership so I'm stuck with this time suck until February."
2507,Maxwell Patterson,"December 22, 2019",1," Couldn't get started! The text message to confirm the phone number wouldn't send, there was nothing to select when asked ""who do you want to date."" Unusable application. Absolutely shameful"
2508,Darnella Stenzel,"December 18, 2019",3," I wish the location worked in a way where you can click on it and it shows on a map. Idk where half of these places are because it marks the community, not the town. On top of that, I have a radius that the app doesn't follow. I don't want people 45 miles away when I have a set 15 mile radius."
2509,Nico Snider,"January 1, 2020",4," Probably my favourite dating app, but it does have weird glitches sometimes. Lately, it's been asking consistent if I met up with someone, I click yes, and it pops up again the next time I open it ."
2510,Zac Lanoue,"January 5, 2020",5," I've used Tinder, POF, a few others I cant think of, and this has got to be my favorite. It's so much better at making real connections, as apposed to scrolling through pics in the most shallow way."
2511,Dillon Winegar,"January 5, 2020",3, The app is easy to use and had an intuitive interface. It seems to be really glitchy when running on wifi. I frequently get notifications or send messages that dont show in the app until I turn wifi off.
2512,Michael Setterholm,"January 7, 2020",5, It's solid. Still in the early stages but the UI is clean and it doesn't overwhelm you. It's easy to go through the profiles and the design encourages it. Also wallet friendly.
2513,Drew Pom,"January 11, 2020",4," It is the best app so far with limited fake profiles and good matching but it started being buggy as all get out lately. Telling me the same people I already liked and crashing a lot. Maybe it's my phone, but prob not"
2514,Cameron Leblanc,"January 22, 2020",5, One of the better recent apps. It forces everyone to make a decent profile with 6 pictures and some writing prompts to serve as ice breakers. It also let's you set preferences for matches.
2515,Marcel de Graaf,"January 28, 2020",4, Pretty good dating app. At least you can get in touch with people. The matching system needs work though.
2516,Felipe Calder√≥n,"January 29, 2020",4," Good app, it has been working so good, I would only give a couple of likes more in the free version"

2522,2uMRAsh,"March 21, 2020",5," Good app but won't let me upgrade?? Take my money, damnit!"
2523,Dan Evans,"November 15, 2019",3," It's a good app and well designed but I'm having a nightmare trying to connect my Instagram. I've tried everything and it just keeps saying 'something went wrong retry,"
2524,Kandice Ocheltree,"November 25, 2019",2, The app is super glitchy. Pages freeze all the time and conversations jump around making you have to scroll to the bottom. Sometimes it will open up to conversations with people I've unmatched.
2525,Natalya Andreya,"November 23, 2019",3, Does not allow you to go back easily and glitches sometimes. Also you have to pay if you want to look at everyone that likes you and msg them etc but its fine I guess since you have a 1 month choice.
2526,Ryan Van Dyke,"November 30, 2019",2," I can't get past the ""who do you want to date"" screen. Its blank and when I click the next arrow it says ""you must make a selection."" So, yea, the app is unuseable."
2527,Brandon Dutcher,"December 3, 2019",1," Push notifications don't come through until the app is opened, which makes it useless when trying to have a conversation with someone that forgets to regularly open the app."
2528,Chris Doughty,"December 2, 2019",5," Quality. That is what I can say about this app. Through all the dating apps that are riddled with fake accounts, or prostitution.

That is what I can say about this app. Through all the dating apps that are riddled with fake accounts, or prostitution. This one has real people, with solid intentions. I've been on 6 dates from this app. Some went great and some just didnt work out. But every person I've met has been so nice, and GENUINE. Beats the other apps by a mile if you're looking for something serious."
2529,Liam O'Meara,"December 12, 2019",1," The app is terrible. The hinge support team never reply. I messed up the age restriction and can't log in. I have sent a email as requested, but they never reply. Its like they don't want you to use the app."
2530,JM,"December 13, 2019",4, Compared to some other apps who just want to bill you for all kinds of stuff full of fake profiles this is really good. Haven't run into a bot or scammers. And the matches I get seem real. Enjoying this app for now
2531,Shanna Tucker,"December 14, 2019",1, Limited likes?? I'm not feeling the 10 likes per day thing. I see so many matches but I can like their profile because I've used up my likes? Not fair because let's say the next day the profile is no longer there. Smh! It should be unlimited.
2532,Sonia M,"December 22, 2019",5, I've been on soo many dating apps. This one is great for getting to know someone. Anyone can make the first move and it's super easy! As easy as liking a picture or something you find interesting in their profile! Also alot of attractive people!
2533,Mark Abadier,"January 3, 2020",5, It's my favorite app. You feel like you are connecting with real people. Everyone is inclined to chat since you can't swipe as fast as other apps- this is a plus im my opinion!
2534,Kayla Sheets,"January 9, 2020",5, This app is great. People seem like they're looking for something real and it's not just a hookup culture. Real and raw. That's what I'm all about. I've only been on this for a few hrs and I'm loving it wayyyy more than any other dating app I've tried.
2535,Landon Cahow,"January 23, 2020",5," Very solid platform and so far getting good results. The premium membership is worth it given the advanced filters. I have tried many, many dating apps out there and this one has proven to be among the best."
2536,Rob Franklin,"January 19, 2020",5," This is what the rest of the dating apps are trying to be. Clean, genuine, and focused.

Just wish I could send pictures or gifs in the chat"
2537,Holly Peacock,"January 24, 2020",2, There's a bug in the app that does not allow full New Zealand phone numbers to be entered (the character limit is too small). I cannot access the app with a NZ phone number login
2538,Noneofyourdamnbusiness,"January 25, 2020",1," First impressions are not looking good, cannot see a single image on any profile, ""support"" is not helpful, automated and slow to respond. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP!"
2539,Kayla MacKenzie,"January 29, 2020",3," I do enjoy the app, but it's VERY pointed towards the premium version that you pay for."
2540,Aparna Jha,"February 17, 2020",1, It's far too expensive and forces people to upgrade.
2541,Michele Mittelbuscher,"February 15, 2020",2, I dont like that we're limited to 10 likes a day. Very slow process.
2542,Edward Courtney,"March 22, 2020",5, Literally so addicting it's such a fun app to use and to meet new people on highly recommend
2543,Alex Nguyen,"April 4, 2020",5, Better than Tinder if you're looking for less superficial than Tinder. Met some interesting people
2544,East Earth,"April 15, 2020",3, Kept asking me to rate... don't do that Great dating app. Stop charging people during the shutdown we are bored and biches be boring.
2545,Levani Zandarashvili,"February 24, 2020",5," I gave it 5 stars but I'm strongly reconsidering it now, because despite already rating it, I get asked 50 times a day to rake it again."
2546,Jose Perez,"November 9, 2019",1, It was great I was getting matches! But this newest update is just terrible! They took the ability to filter the height which really helped me get matches I guess it becoming another tinder or bumble!!
2547,Kyra Pitz,"November 11, 2019",2, It doesnt work half the time. I click match but doenst actually go through. My messages are the same. I put someone on hidden and that arent actually there. Very frustrating to use.
2548,smashley 420,"November 13, 2019",2, This app is not made for left handed people I end up x -ing on people when I'm jus trying to scroll through the profile because the stupid x button is in the bottom left hand corner. Also it recommends random people that have nothing in common with.
2549,Jay B,"December 4, 2019",4, Cool app with every intention of getting you off of it. No sneaky fake likes preying on your curiosity or conversations hidden behind pay walls. Short and sweet comments on prompts or pics to get things moving.
2550,Amanda hooten,"December 5, 2019",2," I have filtered the app several times and it still gives me guys from far away. I've seen all this stuff on Instagram on how ""great"" this app is suppose to be but now I'm wondering if they aren't making $ from it ü§î most people wanna actually meet people closer to them."
2551,Connor Jakes,"December 15, 2019",4," The format is nice, but the app only works online (cant view matches or conversations offline) and the interface can be glitchy when navigating, especially when clicking into the app from a notification."
2552,Benoit R√©millard,"December 17, 2019",1," Hinge say they want you to delete the app. Well, they succeeded. I deleted it before even finishing creating my profile. The fact that there's no way to delete photos from your profile, only swap them, is pure garbage."
2553,Heidi Cardinal1111,"December 22, 2019",5," I feel with this app people have to really take the time and effort to go through the hoops answering questions, being verified, having so many pictures for a relationship. Of course there's always the ones. But I actually enjoy this app."
2554,D Leeper,"January 1, 2020",1," Mostly fake spammers/scammers, big waste of time. Nothing shows last time person was on, so you end up writing to a lot of people that are no longer using app. Also, no sort for last online, and other things. Worst of all dating apps for actually meeting anyone. Big waste of time!!!"
2555,Peter Francis,"January 14, 2020",4," It's a great, well sorted app with free chat. I can almost say it's classy. I would rate it 5 stars, but I ran out of likes so that took the perfect edge off."

2557,Cara Hardy,"January 31, 2020",4," I definitely meet better-quality people through this app, than the other dating apps. The only reason I didnt give this app 5 stars, is because the app is SUPER glitchy."
2558,DMB Entertainment,"February 23, 2020",5, Blows Tinder out of the water. Girls on this app actually know how to converse and don't small talk lol.
2559,Nomad Grim,"March 10, 2020",2, So many bugs causing me to be unable to use it
2560,Care Bear,"April 15, 2020",1, I have no idea why I got banned. Waste of time do not install.
2561,Thomas Hunt,"February 22, 2020",3," Can't even open the app... It gives you the option of using Facebook(which I don't have) or entering a mobile phone number and they send you a code, only, they never send you a code..."
2562,George Montgomery,"April 9, 2020",5, I can't upload pictures..... What happened to this app
2563,Van Lutch22,"November 21, 2019",2," 3/4 of my likes disappeared. I cannot talk with, meet, and chat with that many potential dates before the ""like"" expires. Please fix this. Also the # of likes fluctuate too often."
2564,Denise Gadson,"November 25, 2019",4," Only been on for one day. I really like the questions bit. I do wish there were a few more allowed on the profiles, but I guess that's what the dates are for ;-)"
2565,Kathryn Patterson,"December 1, 2019",5, Most people are genuinely looking for connections and not just hookups which is nice and refreshing. It's nice to know the expectation is not straight into relationships but also its not just hookups. Its genuine people looking for other people
2566,Taylor Chausky,"December 14, 2019",5," I'm giving this 5 stars because somehow the algo matches me with people I actually make connections with lol The 3 question system has always been what made it unique, but they really did a great job with the newest UX and UI, creating a really welcoming vibe."
2567,Jeff Wallace,"December 16, 2019",1," Every time you update the app, I have to redo my profile and now I've missed messages from people I've been talking to. Not happy. It happens every time the app updates."
2568,Isabella Leon,"December 16, 2019",3," The idea behind the app is cool and it works well. The workflow of the app is not great. If you select a notification, the app can't handle going back to the core app from just one conversation."
2569,Max Smith,"December 18, 2019",4, Easier to match than other apps. However selection of possible partners is some what limited to the less attractive compared to other apps such as bumble and tinder. Not the apps fault but just a downside as a user.
2570,TheJamsplat,"December 26, 2019",3, The app has a great concept but could explain the like feature a little better and the lack of daily likes is too much. I understand that they want people to buy the paid membership but you only have about 10-15 likes a day so you are only on the app for 5mins max a day
2571,Jessica Walby,"December 18, 2019",4, Great app and very enjoyable but I really feel you have to pay for it. I think it is well worth getting but there are lots of things that require a costly subscription. Would still reccomend though.
2572,Sara,"December 24, 2019",3, Needs more question/ answer section than just 3 and the question part could be more detailed then what's offered to really match better. I just started so giving a 3 so far a lot of the same faces from other sites...
2573,Mel C,"December 28, 2019",4," So far almost every person I've matched up with have ACTUALLY been interested in talking and getting to know eachother. I had tried POF before and that was a nightmare, every person just wanted to hook up. Ew. My only thing with this is I wish you could send pictures in chat but oh well üòä"
2574,Jason Crispell,"December 27, 2019",1," Buggy, some messages will randomly disappear, certain buttons will stop working, and sometimes it'll keep scrolling back to the top of a profile as you try to scroll down."
2575,Benjamin Watson,"January 7, 2020",5, A gazilion times better than tinder. I like how you can click on people's pictures that they have up from Instagram and it has the copy that they've written. It's nice seeing how much effort they put in or if they've just written 'happy Friday' üòÇ
2576,Brad Cherry,"January 16, 2020",4," I have matched with a few individuals that I enjoy talking to, but I would like to see the inclusion of adding monogamous or non-monogamous to the general profile to help with matches. As a non-monogamous individual it would be nice to have it on my profile"
2577,Alexander Adet,"January 28, 2020",1," For sure you will uninstall it! Of all the apps I've ever tried, this one managed to make me say NO to 95% of the girls recommend. There is no middle ground. Either a very few extremely beautiful girls, or an unmesurable amount of the opposite!"
2578,Ross Shelton,"January 31, 2020",3," I type a message as a response for a match, and yet it says ""You have invited (person) to start the chat""."
2579,Chase Szymanski,"February 16, 2020",5, Very easy to manage!
2580,Veronica Phongsavath,"February 29, 2020",5, Allows a lot more personality to come through prefer it to tinder
2581,Vilol Marathe,"March 29, 2020",3, The number of daily likes are too less.
2582,qwe qwe,"April 15, 2020",1, I was banned without even making a account. The app glitched out on gender preference. Now I can't even use this app...
2583,Devin M,"April 16, 2020",5, Great place to connect with great people
2584,Julian Bradley,"November 10, 2019",2, Profile pictures don't load half the time. You have to close and reopen the app for them to appear. I usually just close it and move on to something else. Don't waste your money
2585,Meesh Bono,"November 14, 2019",2," The app is glitchy and slow but there are some decent people on there.

Also, it keeps asking me if I've met one of my matches, I keep saying ""no and stop asking me"" but the app continually asks me every day if I've met this guy. It's so annoying. Some advise to the developers, if you want a good review stop bombarding me"
2586,You Know,"November 17, 2019",3," I have used it for 2 months seems promising at times. But sometimes it feels some profiles are false. Thus far I have not met anyone in person. Always keep hope, so we shall see."
2587,Anthony Singleton,"November 19, 2019",4, Great app... But the message/notification system sucks.... You virtually never see/hear messages until it's too late... Make the it the bubble message type similar to messenger... Also bring back more free filters..... ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2588,John Zvanya,"November 20, 2019",4, Overall a good experience but the app has a few bugs here in there that should be fixed. Instagrams displaying other people until you click on it and not being notified of messages.
2589,Sophie Rachel Amic,"December 2, 2019",5," Very nice app allows a more personalized interaction with your matches and pushes you to have actual conversations beyond the traditional ""Hey! What's up?"""
2590,Echo,"December 3, 2019",5," Easy to navigate, and just enough profile info to get a gist of the person's character. I like the fact you can like various info the other persin has given you and highlight that fact to them"
2591,Christina Ma,"December 10, 2019",4," Cool concept and works pretty well. Just a minor bug that inconveniences me a lot, which is having to scroll to the bottom of the chat conversation every time someone leaves a message."
2592,Taylor O'Carroll-Reed,"December 13, 2019",1," Glitchy as hell. Never sends SMS verification code, and a blank screen on who I'd like to date. Willing to join beta team just to report every bug and get them squashed out asap before public release."
2593,Brian Ross,"December 13, 2019",5," Best dating app! Price is reasonable, good filters, and I like that you have to pick out something you like about someone in particular. Takes more effort"
2594,Kevin Trevino,"December 15, 2019",5," Hit or miss, like most dating apps. It seems more genuine when it comes to matching you with people, and there's significantly less fake profiles."
2595,Trevor Pierce,"December 28, 2019",2," Doesn't appear to allow for connecting Instagram accounts if you have two-factor authentication enabled, which seems like a huge oversight. I shouldn't have to temporarily degrade the security of another account just for this."
2596,kenneth mcintosh,"December 26, 2019",4," So far the experience has been alright, I've yet to meet in person with anyone but I have started a few conversations. Platform is easy to use and has speedy notification."
2597,Charles Henry,"January 14, 2020",4," Easy to use, works well. Chat sometimes weirds out and puts the screen at the top so I have to scroll all the way down to the latest message."
2598,Alice Undead,"January 8, 2020",4," It's been pretty good so far, but even though my preference is set to women I still get men trying to match with me. Seems like there's less of a hookup culture on this app, which is refreshing."
2599,Keith MacKay,"January 19, 2020",3," It's ok, and you do see more of matches personalities. But, very limited features unless you pay. Chat is very clumsy and you seem to be paired with folk very far away, but that could be me."
2600,Logan Powell,"January 26, 2020",1," App is nice, but refuses to work for more than a couple seconds before asking for a review. Normally I don't write these, but it is so frustrating. Otherwise, great app."
2601,Colin E,"January 31, 2020",5, Nicely doneüëåüëç. Easy to use and the questions are good for sparking some kind of convo.
2602,Caleb Evans,"January 29, 2020",5, It's been different than any other dating app I've tried. The feel is something you have to experience. It's genuine.

2606,John Poulter,"April 12, 2020",3, Why in this time unlike all the other apps do you still limit the likes available
2607,Andrew Gillette,"December 9, 2019",5," this app feels so much less exhausting. I feel like I can casually have quality conversation with people just about every day, and not feel the need to keep mindlessly swiping. Could not praise it more."
2608,Kevin Knesley,"November 9, 2019",3, The recent update in the past month made this app worse... It takes multiple touches to get the app to do something and it crashes very often... I never had an issue before the last update
2609,Jon Cornfield,"November 16, 2019",5," Way better than the other dating apps. I love the dynamic of liking something about the person, rather than just the person. Lends itself to some easy conversation starters."
2610,John Howe,"December 11, 2019",5," I live in a dense suburban area, and still no one nearby uses this. The app makes you pay to see behind the curtain, and when the curtain is lifted nothing is there."
2611,Sandra Lopez,"December 9, 2019",5, It's super simple and quite honestly worth the membership. The limited information you post on your profile makes it incredibly better to actually conversate. A lot of nice people on there so I might delete ;)
2612,TheSuperbikepro,"December 6, 2019",1," They trick you into thinking you don't have a subscription then charge you for a whole new one and when you write customer service to ask for help getting your money back their response is ""how to cancel my membership"" directions."
2613,Jonathan Chenier,"December 11, 2019",5," This app is great, it doesn't have the most people in my region, but then again none of them do. You don't need to pay to send likes or to message, just to get a boost in popularity."
2614,Mason Ayoun,"December 15, 2019",5, Within an hour I already was chatting with someone. Which I must say isn't a common occurence I've experienced. I like how they emphasize on deleting the app.
2615,Daniel Gerick,"December 20, 2019",4," Great format, only issue is shifting between menus, hitting buttons don't work sometimes. But you usually just have to figure it out. Not broken at all"
2616,Andrew Brown,"January 3, 2020",2," Of course I write a positive review of this app and they change it. Lots behind a pay wall now. Limits on swipes, can't see all your likes. Bumble is back to being number one."
2617,Lisa Corazo,"January 3, 2020",4, I love the way the app works but not satisfied with the quality of people and follow through in conversation. This has been the same problem with every app Ive tried.
2618,Caleb Pralle,"January 1, 2020",5," No microtransactions. The free account is awesome, and the upgraded one is even better. Chatting is free! They certainly stand out as the dating app to get you off dating apps."
2619,K G,"January 7, 2020",5," You can actually get a conversation. It isn't gamey where people cat fish, play games, not communicate, and send mixed signals. They are quality people. You would think they charge but even with the free portion, it's a lot of traffic."
2620,Olivia Koval,"January 11, 2020",5, By far much easier and less stressful to use than other dating apps I've tried. People are more genuine and I don't get the flood on right swipes I'm used to. Gone on a couple of dates and so far so good!
2621,Aija Mccoy,"January 13, 2020",5," Love this so far. You can comment under pics, like photos and get notified when someone comments or likes your pics. Easier to chat that way rather than waiting to be matched."
2622,Jesse Collins,"January 25, 2020",5," The app setup is very simple but has a different way to connect with people you like. Shows you what kind of interests, personality or connection you may have than just a typical ""like"""
2623,Butter Bay Biscuits,"February 4, 2020",2," Best UI of the major apps, but paying for it didn't help anything, waste of $20."
2624,JB Custom,"January 30, 2020",5, Solid app for meeting more real people. Have had better results in 2 weeks then years on other sites.
2625,Huw McMahon,"February 8, 2020",5, It's good but the only reason I'm rating this app is because it keeps telling me to.
2626,Buck Rogers,"February 13, 2020",4, Crashes often but otherwise good
2627,Mark Nie,"March 24, 2020",1," Literally one of the most dogshit apps ive ever used, geneva convention violations abound, needs to be deleted off the play store IMMEDIATELY"
2628,Beatriz Hernandez,"January 22, 2020",5," One of the best dating apps out there. Decent guys, no surprises with their heights. They allow you to filter out some guys by specifying your deal breakers, which saves you a lot of time. Not too many dates but it's not app's fault is more like the way our society is right now."
2629,A Google user,"December 4, 2019",1," App was infinitely better with unlimited likes. They switched over to premium memberships for unlimited likes and now it's almost useless. To make matters worse, they're charging $20 for a month of premium now.. Greedy mfers man."
2630,Rahul Sharma,"April 17, 2020",4," Bad , i already had an account on this app with my phone number and now i can't login to my account so all my matches were a waste of 5 months as this app is asking me to make new account"
2631,Rene,"November 7, 2019",3, Good idea and good premise. I like the app as a whole but you need to fix some bugs. I don't receive notifications for new matches or messages despite having push notifications set on
2632,Kellie McDonald,"November 13, 2019",4," Like the format of the app overall, but there are quite a few glitches. I frequently have to close & reopen it for it to refresh properly."
2633,Cole Donelson,"November 18, 2019",5, In my opinion it's the best dating app out right now. Actually having to pick a pic or description to like actually makes me stop and read the profiles rather then the old hot or not mentality.
2634,shammy keyz,"January 18, 2020",1," Five stars when we can upload videos to our profile for Android and send gifs and pictures in chat. (Edit: so they implemented an ""account pause"" feature, but still can't let Android users upload videos???"
2635,Sarah Davis,"November 24, 2019",4," Good design. Interesting prompts. Decidedly buggy though when updates occur, and hard to get them to stop emailing you matches even after you've uninstalled the app."
2636,Chelsea,"November 23, 2019",4," Dating apps are terrible, tedious, and probably don't actually add much good to our lives or dating culture, but Hinge feels less so. Easy to use. I appreciate that Hinge caters to people that are ready and able to make real connections and to date with intention. Let's keep it this way!"
2637,Todd Bronaugh,"December 7, 2019",2, The distance filter doesn't work. I can set it to 5 miles and it will still return profiles from 50 miles away. It makes it almost useless.
2638,Patrick Asztabski,"December 10, 2019",1, Couldn't even get into the app because it refused to send me a verification code. When I did somehow get in and asked me a question there were no text boxes or options to answer with.
2639,Ted Kramer,"January 2, 2020",3, Sometimes it has trouble loading a profile and can be a little slow on my phone from 2015 (5yrs old at time of this writing). Hinge is better than your typical swip right swipe left app
2640,Laporteisgreat,"December 31, 2019",4, Wow. To my surprise finally a good app. It matches you with people from your own state and not from other states. It gives you more in depth questioning etc. The only bad thing about it is that you cant go back and undo likes....
2641,The720Hero,"January 10, 2020",4, Seems pretty good so far and the people on here are active. The only downside is you don't get very many likes unless you get a membership that is way to expensive...
2642,Caleb Ketterer,"January 20, 2020",1, People I match with are consistently too far away and theres a bug where I can't click done when commenting on someones post. Also it keeps cycling through the same five people. This app is useless.
2643,Derrek Hoffer,"January 20, 2020",4, High quality with genuine matches. My only issue is with the required visibility. Why is height required but weight is not? Both are physical attributes.
2644,Alexa Kirkpatrick,"January 22, 2020",5," I like the prompts you can answer when setting up a profile, they make nice little conversation starters and help you get to know the person better than with just a bio like other apps."
2645,Abhik Mitra,"January 19, 2020",4, I'm enjoying it very much... getting matches at regular interval....very authentic and reliable üòäüòäüòä....but the list and stock of number of girls are very less...need improvement on this
2646,Bekah Ashburn,"February 3, 2020",3," It an awesome app, easy to use an navigate.. just wish you got more likes with a free profile."
2647,Lana B.,"February 21, 2020",5, Love it just sad that only 10 likes a day allowed for free. It should be at least 20üò≠
2648,Zachary Anderson,"March 14, 2020",5, Not bad. I've been using for about a week and have matched with 2 seriously chill women.
2649,Shayonnita Mallik,"March 11, 2020",2, Why is Hinge forcing me to update? Can't see any of my new matches. Keeps telling me to upgrade to preferred to see all of my likes. But I don't want to!?
2650,P Ross,"November 10, 2019",2," New update completely worthless. Matches disappear in middle of convo, same people appear again after you've already X them. This company and their developers suck. Dont pay them a dime. Deleted."
2651,Dave,"November 11, 2019",1, Great app....except the distance feature doesnt work. I keep getting matches hundreds of miles away when I set a limit of 25. fix this!
2652,Lisa M,"November 12, 2019",5, Way better than bumble. Both parties have the option to start the conversation when they're ready instead of rushing to meet the 24 hr window.
2653,Ayden Ledding,"November 15, 2019",3, The app keeps asking me if I've met the same person. I keep answering and it keeps popping up as though I haven't. It's getting annoying. Otherwise the app is very good.
2654,Bekzod Fakhriddinov,"December 3, 2019",1," terrible useless app. none of the filters work, the app is b.. t, u waste your time sitting and searching between ugly photos hours and hours, instead of going out, to city, and getting someone u like in 5-10 minutes."
2655,gayatri khanvelkar,"November 26, 2019",1," I downloaded the app and tried to enter NY age in, but because of some unknown reason, it registered my age as 0 inspire of putting in birth date right. And now I'm locked out off the app, and no one has replied when I contacted support or customer care."
2656,Amir Toghraee,"November 26, 2019",3," Randomly logs you out, forcing you to make a new profile all over again. Once your profile is complete, it'll be deleted before you know it!"
2657,Michael Buckelew,"January 29, 2020",3, Very clean interface. Seems like majority of people are real. Simple to use.
2658,Louis Ades,"December 11, 2019",4, App can be kinda buggy and inconsistent at times but I'm impressed by the matches it sets up and there's way more incentive to scroll through other pictures and text responses in one's bio.
2659,Joseph Branson,"January 6, 2020",5, Much more effective if you're looking for a relationship and value knowing who likes you without going premium. Not sure if notifications are disabled or if they don't exist.
2660,Wil Kelley,"January 5, 2020",5," Whether you find success on Hinge it's easy to say this app is the best place to find people that want to date.

My only feed...Full ReviewWhether you find success on Hinge it's easy to say this app is the best place to find people that want to date. With very clear terms of service you'll find almost no scammers, ""couples looking for a third"", and Instagram thots. I've found higher quality matches on here than other apps. My only feedback is to make it easier to report bugs and prevent users from ""liking"" something on your profile without leaving a comment (if you can't think of anything to say, it's probably not a match)"
2661,Evan Schwalb,"December 18, 2019",5," If you're looking for an app that provides a platform that's not just for hookups, look no further. An effortless UI with a beautifully simple pairing algorithm makes for a great experience"
2662,Abigail Rogers,"January 17, 2020",1, Not great so far; So to update my review....I was charged for the app without my authorization and as far as I can tell will not get a refund even though I had already uninstalled the app. I am not impressed with this service and am disappointed.
2663,Jamie Loizou,"December 31, 2019",4," Decent app that helps people try and find a partner. There are some bugs with the interface, but overall I'd rather hinge than anything else."
2664,Jeevak Ghosh,"January 6, 2020",4, Hinge is one of the very few apps which actually eliminates most of the fake profiles and helps build genuine connections. Although the algorithm which shows the best match for you is flawed.
2665,Sulfur Carbide,"January 6, 2020",3," Very good, but not enough matches before it expires for 24 hours and premium is too expensive. Besides that, great!"
2666,Mo,"January 1, 2020",3, It's decent...The algorithm keeps matching you with ppl outside of your specifications. The matching system is a little weird. But overall it's ok.
2667,Lauren Jones,"January 6, 2020",4," Love the app but the push to upgrade is annoying, especially with it limiting the number of likes per day. Patience is not my strong suit!"
2668,Laura Gibb,"January 9, 2020",3," Not bad. I like that the format is totally different to tinder, but hate that there are so many limitations unless you pay to upgrade."
2669,W W,"February 21, 2020",2, how to reinstall it today because it kept showing the same people over and over and over. There are so many f****** fakes on here. Do something about your shity site
2670,Christina Schofield,"January 13, 2020",1, Unable to get pictures showing. I followed all the self help tips and it didn't work. I contacted the app and never got a reply now a week later. Hard to participate in a dating app if no one can see me!!!
2671,Ravage-raptor,"January 13, 2020",4, I like it its easy to use and helps people to get to know each other before they talk. The only problem i have is that the app glitches out quite frequently.
2672,Eric Campbell,"January 12, 2020",5, It's a fun app and you meet people like any other app similar to it. I like that it tells you who likes you and you can like them back or decide not to. With tinder it's just all guessing unless you pay for it.
2673,Lisa M,"January 22, 2020",3, Good app design & its genuinely free. However not many people in my area I don't think many people use it. If there was more people I'd give it 5 stars. Thank you developers for the app
2674,Colton Barber,"January 25, 2020",5, Without having to pay for any extras this app beats all others. The way it's setup allows for easy conversations or more so ice breakers. Very creative.
2675,Oluwakunle Aduloju,"January 24, 2020",4," Matching algorithm is pretty good, only wish they give u more control of your overall preferences on body types, distance, habits etc. Nothing's perfect though and I still have plenty of interesting and attractive matches."
2676,Ben Griffin,"January 29, 2020",3," Latest update is so buggy. Messages get dropped, alerts keep popping up for no reason"
2677,Rachael Karpinski,"March 9, 2020",4, Moderately confusing app but it's less cringe-y than tinder for sure.
2678,Ariel Hazan,"March 11, 2020",5, Cool concept for tagging photos
2679,Diksh Saini,"March 17, 2020",4, Really good. Different from other dating apps.
2680,Jeffrey Michael Meister,"March 24, 2020",5, This app works fine do exactly what you want. Hinge is the best dating app have ever known!
2681,James Hammond,"March 27, 2020",5, Really liking hinge. Feels nice to connect with some human beings for once!
2682,George Orwell,"November 10, 2019",1," It said there was a problem connecting to my fb but when I checked on fb hinge was there, creepin my data. Tried with my phone number but apparently it's not a valid one. This app sucks."
2683,monica robinson,"November 6, 2019",1, Could not add who do you want to date...did bot give option to choose or type in...wont let me move forward or back. I guess it's a delete for the app before any matches could happen.
2684,heather loveless,"November 26, 2019",4," It's not bad so far. Kind of a middle ground between match and tinder. I wish that starting out, it would give you a better description on what to do and how to use the app."
2685,Bruce Tyrrell,"December 5, 2019",4," It feels more personal than other apps. I like how it works, I just think it's a little slow to respond and can be a bit fidgety. Over all a great app!"
2686,Ryan Sitner,"December 16, 2019",4," There seem to be some bugs that if you send someone a like, it doesn't always go through and you'll see them again in your queue. Other than that it's pretty good."
2687,Jay Hu,"December 29, 2019",5, Probably my favorite dating app right now. It has a lot of customizations. The app is design for finding actual relationships and the quality of my matches definitely shows.
2688,Katharina Frim,"December 28, 2019",2," Like the layout, hate you have to pay for basic aspects of a dating app (seeing your matches/people who like you). A male friend of mine was shocked to hear women need to pay. He never did."
2689,Yourie Kim,"January 4, 2020",5," The questionnaires they give are REALLY GOOD. you can find quality ppl based on it. Also love the picture/profile design, makes the app come off more comprehensive than other apps."
2690,Brimman Frazer,"December 18, 2019",4," Best dating app I've found so far. I like the transparency, seeing who likes you and being able to start a convo right away or not. But either way the lack of constant swiping really does it for me."
2691,Anastasia Jokinen,"January 7, 2020",4," Interesting design and concept, but the messaging system is a bit glitchy - keeps going back to the start of the conversation."
2692,Brian Tondel,"January 13, 2020",4, My only complaint is notifications are a little bugged. I don't get them even when the notification are turned on. Good app and experience though.
2693,raul murillo,"January 18, 2020",5," Fully working app, functional, everyone is real so far. I like how you can like specific parts of the person's profile. Love it so far. Only complaint is that can only message too few people in one day"
2694,Sean Peery,"January 15, 2020",1," I was using the app, messaging people, having pleasant conversations and trying to set up times for a date. Then boom, I was banned.

No notification, no reason, no warning, just banned. There was nothing inappropriate done or violation I committed that I can see on their TOS. But they banned me, and they have no way to appeal the action. So now I look like I just ghosted on people and completely lost any chance of connecting with anyone I found. What a huge waste of time and money."
2695,Rudy Portillo,"January 18, 2020",5," First time rating and app, thought this one deserves it for it's really simple and easy to understand interface. Works fast, no complicated menus."
2696,Andrew O'Kane,"January 17, 2020",5," I have to recommend Hinge, I've had far more success with it than any other dating app. I feel like a large reason for that is because it quickly informs someone that you've liked them, unlike a lot of other apps that keep you waiting and hoping that the people you like come across your profile and ...Full ReviewI have to recommend Hinge, I've had far more success with it than any other dating app. I feel like a large reason for that is because it quickly informs someone that you've liked them, unlike a lot of other apps that keep you waiting and hoping that the people you like come across your profile and also swipe right. I've had far more matches on Hinge than any other app and it's led to more dates for me than Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid combined. Hoping it ultimately leads to a relationship soon!"
2697,Luis Moragas jr,"February 4, 2020",4, Good all around I like the interface of how you setup an actual profile and much more maneuverable to use than most other dating apps
2698,Christian Sab0rLatin0,"February 9, 2020",4, Great at filtering fake people.
2699,A.J Johnson,"March 1, 2020",3, Little bit limited in what you can do. Maybe because it's not as popular as tinder yet
2700,shriya sinha,"April 13, 2020",3, Way too many fakes!
2701,Caleb Bruyn,"April 25, 2020",5, Great way to connect with people.
2702,Jason,"November 9, 2019",3," Tons of matches but makes it harder to stay connected to one match. Almost too much happening at once. Bumble or tinder, the match feels more special. I can imagine girls just get overwhelmed. Its tinder with A.D.D."
2703,D J Funk,"November 10, 2019",4," Bit buggy at times, I scroll down to view the profile and it keeps bringing it back to the top no matter how many times I restart the app."
2704,Penny Ashby,"November 12, 2019",2," Really glitchy, gets stuck on the same person in swiping, tells me I have 5 new likes but no one shows for days then suddenly all appear, randomly disappears and reappears people from your conversations..."
2705,Kyle,"November 24, 2019",3, The app is pretty well designed. Major flaw is having to manually scroll to the bottom of a conversation EVERYTIME I want to send a new message. FIX ASAP
2706,Edmar,"November 30, 2019",2," Love&Hate relationship Basically its an unreliable app. You get messages notifications and then when you open it, it keeps loading and loading. It basically only works when it wants to."

2708,Edward Cao,"December 26, 2019",1," Wouldn't even let me log in. Two step verification fail! Facebook directs me to phone number, and I spent 15 minutes trying to get a text to my phone. What a developer fail."
2709,Rich Carpenter,"December 27, 2019",4, Still workin on figuring it out as a whole but the UI is smooth and the hinge specific features are much better than swipe apps and most dating apps already. No ad filler either which is nice.
2710,Isaiah Holderfield,"January 7, 2020",1, Couldn't even use the app downloaded it went to fill my information out the app glitched out and kept bringing me to a blank page delete and tried to reinstall wont even download is now so one star couldn't even see if it's worth using or not.
2711,ric1928,"January 10, 2020",4," Some UI needs to change.. For example, very unintuitive scrolling to see if match has children or wants them. Can't see your own profile, etc. Minus 1 star for that."
2712,Andrew H,"January 20, 2020",2," Buggy app, and when you try to send through a bug report, firstly you have to jump through hoops, then the bug report also fails."
2713,Sway Yash,"January 23, 2020",1, It was alright for 2 days but now can't even login in my account. Didn't like it anyway. There are so many fake accounts and people with their teenage pics.
2714,John Gallegos,"January 19, 2020",1," Just saw your commercial on tv and i find it hilarious. ""The app meant to be deleted"" yeah deleted because after 6 or so months have yet to get a single match."
2715,Christopher Schaal,"January 18, 2020",3, The app is great when it is working. However I often find that messages either don't go through or have heavy delays. Makes meeting up with folks harder.
2716,Eric Thomas,"January 26, 2020",1," Had an account for months, never misused it or was disrespectful to anyone, only to find I was banned yesterday when I tried to log in. Support were useless and provided a copy/paste response with no explanation."

2727,Akhil A,"November 22, 2019",4, Fairy easy to use the app. But I came across a lot of spam profiles. It'll be great to have a verification setup or feature.
2728,Amanda Scott,"November 21, 2019",1, You only get a handful of likes to use unless you get a paid subscription. There was no information related to when you might get more likes without paying for the subscription.

2731,Carl,"November 30, 2019",5, So far so good. I find myself actually taking more time and consideration of who I swipe right on. It helps show more about someone's personality.
2732,lucas mccartney,"December 11, 2019",4, Great and more serious app compared to tinder and bumble! Only gripe I have is sometimes when messages are received they don't come through for a while? Apart from that keep doing the good work guys.
2733,Crystal Shurland,"December 22, 2019",4, I enjoy this app I just wish we could add a bit more info or add a few more questions to answer onto our profiles (you can only add 3). Other than that it's a good app.
2734,Justin Summerville,"December 27, 2019",2," Either the app has built in filters to ensure you don't see many prospective matches that are of similar physical appearance without paying or the selection on this app is just that terrible. Either way, Bumble or Tinder are way better."

2737,S R,"January 10, 2020",5," I enjoyed it a lot more than Tinder or Bumble. It's nice to not be judged by just pictures, and directly giving and receiving likes without matching is a great feature for guys"
2738,Ricale Woods,"January 14, 2020",4, It doesn't have the option to call inside of the app so that you don't have to give your number until you're kind of secure with the person and it's a random match with all ages.
2739,Derek Oates,"January 14, 2020",4," Met with a couple people and had some dates, so it works I guess but it gets 4 stars cause you have to pay to have preferences which makes it a little harder to find people"
2740,Miss Banana,"January 13, 2020",5, I like this much better than all the oyher dating apps I've tried. I think it would be cool to have the option for making friendships (like bumble does) but on hinge:)
2741,Signs,"January 18, 2020",1, READ THIS NOW!! Do NOT purchase the preferred Membership for this app. I got charge twice because these incompetent jackass developers don't know how to program their damn app. Also! I didn't even get my membership! permanent one f**king star!
2742,Emoni Dunbar,"January 20, 2020",5, Kinda definitely loving this app. You get connected directly with the people that like you and you don't have to pay to see who they are. It's pretty amazing.
2743,Kayla R,"January 15, 2020",1, Facebook login does not work. Sign up with phone number does not work either because don't receive the text to confirm. So can't sign up.

2745,Kevin Cave,"February 2, 2020",3," Everything is great except the way it marks locations. I live near 2 large cities so when it says ""uptown"" or something similar I have no idea where that person is. They also should support sending gifs"

I had to switch my location to Paris so that I could have my internal score bumped up to an appropriate level to show me pretty and interesting women back home. Suggestions: 1.

Every girl who appears in my local search results turns out to actually be thousands of miles away, but this app is so poorly done that they can't or won't do anything about it. These women will ask you to send them money. It's a scam from top to bottom, and Hinge should really be held responsible. The app will often lose your profile. Over a year since I wrote my initial review and today, my conversation was deleted. Incompetent programmers."
2750,A Google user,"December 9, 2019",4, Good but not great anymore as it's going the way of other dating apps (¬£19 a month to get more than a handful of daily swipes)
2751,Bryan K,"January 29, 2020",4, There isn't enough likes given per day to go through the thousands of profiles. 10 likes per day? It would take a century to go through the entire list.
2752,J Har,"November 21, 2019",1," Doesnt work. When you reach the page who do you want to date, there is no optiion so you cant continue. Tried reinstalling but had the same issue"
2753,zack petite,"November 28, 2019",3, Not the best app on the market. Free version is very limited. Pro version is too expensive ($20 a month üò¨). Middle of the road service at best
2754,Jacqueline Swann,"November 24, 2019",1," This app doesn't bother listening to your preferences, it just gives you random people and non of them match what you are looking for."
2755,Jesa Osullivan,"November 30, 2019",2, The app constantly freezes and crashes. Also you only get to write out answers to three questions so you don't really describe much about you to potential dates.
2756,Hello Good Bye,"December 31, 2019",4," Just discovered that, unless your a premium member, you can only like so many people before you get a message that you cant like more unless you pay... wow. We will see how this goes."
2757,Klayton Hofferbert,"January 6, 2020",5, Probably the best dating app I've used. The people I encounter are typically genuine people looking for connection unlike other apps. Clean interface and easy to use!
2758,Nichole Tyner,"December 19, 2019",5, I am getting a lot more matches that fit my personality type. I like the swipe free interface and limited number of likes per day. So far it feels like this really is a 'relationship' app and not a 'hook-up' app.
2759,Jarod Koziol,"December 29, 2019",1, Designed to be deleted because I can't even log in. I've sent emails to support with no response and an email for age verification with no response so it's going to be yes deleted.
2760,Laszlo Dudas,"January 6, 2020",5," So far great and I have not had one bot, not paying for it yet but I think it's nice they let you use it without paying and being a rip like other apps ."
2761,Daniel Morgan,"January 6, 2020",1, So buggy. Keeps freezing up. Doesn't recognize phone numbers from Japan. On the who you want to date screen it is blank; nothing shows up to click.
2762,SouthWestWings,"January 7, 2020",5," Great app with amazing people, you can chat for free and they have matched me with some amazing people, I am having some great conversations and really enjoying this app. Which is more surprising as I'm a guy, and dating apps are normally harsh on guys?"
2763,The JR,"January 11, 2020",4, Been using hinge for one day. So far I like it. Easy to use. The women the app shows me are 99% within my preference settings. I bought the 3 month subscription so we'll see.
2764,Jeffrey Patterson,"January 9, 2020",5," The app UI is very unique. So far the dating ""profile"" is simplistic , yet sophisticated in a way that sparks conversation quite easily instead of a meaningless swipe"
2765,John Breeden,"January 11, 2020",4, Distance filter doesn't work but people seem friendlier than other sites...and i may have found the love of my life. All good.
2766,S K,"January 14, 2020",5, Seems to be a well put together app. The way profiles are setup is helpful in communicating what I'm looking for in a relationship.
2767,Ash Esquibel,"January 14, 2020",3, Nice concept but it a process to get to matching with people also I got a lot of people from different countries and just people I am I personally have in common with.
2768,Arthur Hedberg,"January 16, 2020",2," So far this app takes the cake. I mean, literally. Nothing but barn animals and hefers. 9 out of 10 girls on here are 50 to 150 pounds overweight. If you like hoggin, than this app is for you. Hinge brags about filters but they NEED weight filters badly. Im not lookin to date a full time golden corr...Full ReviewSo far this app takes the cake. I mean, literally. Nothing but barn animals and hefers. 9 out of 10 girls on here are 50 to 150 pounds overweight. If you like hoggin, than this app is for you. Hinge brags about filters but they NEED weight filters badly. Im not lookin to date a full time golden corral member, but this app offers nothing else."
2769,Julia Viertel,"March 17, 2020",1, I am still not finding good matches. It seams like another Tinder
2770,MAX DANG,"January 25, 2020",4, 0 customer support. Couldn't log in with my Facebook or my phone number. Ended up registering again with a secondary number and it worked. Smooth sailing from there
2771,Raymond de Beauclair,"February 2, 2020",5, The app gives specific live related and different questions that make it much easier to connect with someone love it
2772,meganmoon,"January 28, 2020",1," Their ads make it seem like a whole new dating experience, but its honestly just tinder with some of bumbles layout and other features."
2773,Dori Curtin,"February 6, 2020",4, Would be nice to have a feature that allows you to be verified as a real person like I've found on other sites like Bumble.
2774,Sarah Bear,"February 9, 2020",1, Running out of likes in the first day?? Then once i did i can't talk to anybody unless i pay. There's a lot of dating apps out there...
2775,Andrew Gacount,"February 18, 2020",2, Not enoughdaily matches for how many users there are
2776,Ronzino F,"March 10, 2020",5, Far better quality of matches that competing apps
2777,Ms Binny,"March 17, 2020",4, It's ok for now. Seems classier than other dating sites
2778,Cara Marchese,"March 29, 2020",5, I like the setup.. makes it easy and fun
2779,Manuel Mendoza,"March 28, 2020",3, The App should have a feature to be able to see history of who you liked.
2780,Geoff Finnigan,"April 5, 2020",1, Your algorithm shows all the attractive women on the first day of having the app. Every other day now is unattractive women. Boo Hinge. BOO
2781,Isaac Galeone,"February 6, 2020",5, Good quality üëå real meaningful matches
2782,Ilachi Nagda,"January 22, 2020",5," Amazing experience with good times, quantity of matches is low at times but still better than the other apps in the market."
2783,Jessica Schroeck,"January 13, 2020",2, Getting a bunch of shorties on the app now bc they got rid of height requirements. Now the app is a huge time waster and going downhill. All of my gfs are complaining and using it a lot less. AWFUL UPGRADE.
2784,G Fozi,"November 10, 2019",5, Really easy to use. I like the way you need several pictures. And have to fill out several questions. It makes it easy to speak. Best dating app I've used.
2785,sean fle,"November 27, 2019",5, Probably the best app out. Way Much more real women then other sites. Alot Less fake profiles and bots/ spam then other site. How they do the profile makes conversation more Interesting and fun.
2786,Hannah Patterson,"November 20, 2019",5," Hinge is a good app but people don't know whether a text is being delivered or read, can't send pictures. you guys have to add those Features to hinge and I believe you can do that."
2787,Ssh H,"November 21, 2019",1," Not user friendly.. i guess the developer is left handed? ""X"" is on the left side so it's hard to use with one hand.. I'd rather swipe left."
2788,William Kloosterman,"November 30, 2019",5," I like the 3 questions, they provide easier initiation of conversation, and the mandatory 6 photos allow for a more expressive picture of potential matches."
2789,Talitha Royster,"December 9, 2019",5, This is actually a really great app to meet people who are actually normal. My only issue is that I live in a horrible area where their are very little prospects. No fault of the app though.
2790,Tristan Webb,"December 12, 2019",3," love the platform and idea, but you're severely limited by the amount of likes you get. they really want you to buy that premium service"
2791,Michael Lane Jr.,"December 14, 2019",5, I used POF exclusively in the past. Since making the switch I am so HAPPY AND IMPRESSED. The user interface is awesome. There are no bots and scammers like with POF.
2792,L Hoevet,"December 28, 2019",4, Great layout and easy to navigate around quickly. There might be 1 real profile out of every 100 that you look at.
2793,Brian Groth,"January 7, 2020",5, So far it seems more straightforward than other apps I've used. It feels more honest than most. The app itself is really well put together!
2794,Lindsay Alexander,"January 10, 2020",1," Very boring, after several likes you're being taunted to pay or you won't be able to like anyone's profile. You consistently see the same people.. this app is a waste of time, deleted within a day."
2795,Dave Crozier,"January 12, 2020",5, Loving this app. So many cool people on it and it gives you an instant conversation starter by letting you show the other person what it is you like about them.
2796,Abhinav Smith,"January 14, 2020",5, The UI can be improved a more. but its pretty good. The new UI is good and is a good app where fake profiles are less. Better than Tinder.
2797,Rahul Sharma,"November 21, 2019",2," Gets boring fast. Just doesnt have a large userbase like other dating apps do. Very simplistic and doesnt have many features. Have stopped using it, to be honest. May end up deleting it altogther."
2798,Brent Heinzinger,"December 15, 2019",4, The app is nice and easy to use. I like the ability to send a message to people I see rather than just swiping right or left like most other apps
2799,Ty Hurley,"November 7, 2019",5, My only criticism is women should update their location because when they set their profiles up it isn't where they are living now which is wasting my time because I live in London and not Ibiza or Birmingham! Very easy to use!
2800,Steve Burton,"November 8, 2019",2, All of a sudden noone seems to be actually seeing my answers when I contact them? So all they get is a 'like' ans that seriously reduces the chance of a match... what happened??
2801,Angelo Ortiz-Mejias,"November 9, 2019",1, It has been so glitchy since the new update. It seems like I don't get messages and there are several things that keep messing up
2802,William Jefferson,"November 14, 2019",2," Full of glitches, logs you off randomly. Doesn't give a lot of filters to choose from in a search."
2803,Serban Raia,"November 16, 2019",5, Straightforward and accessible. Love the 3 question part and the possibility to like any given picture or answer. Gives a good start to conversations.
2804,H BombWho?,"November 19, 2019",4, Great app that delivers lots of matches. It is more relationship based so if you're looking for casual/Fwb it's not that great.
2805,CATHI BARAN,"November 28, 2019",1, Says it's a free site yet you have to pay to see some of your matches and messages. Doesn't have a lot of people and crashes often
2806,Sourav Mandal,"November 23, 2019",2," I liked the idea of this. But there is no security check at all! Sooo many fake accounts! ""whatsapp for paid service"" bla bla, I am going to uninstall now üò¨"
2807,Dylan P,"December 4, 2019",3, Better than tinder but the platform is a bit glitchy. For example it doesn't register when I've said that I met someone.
2808,Michael Morales,"December 10, 2019",5, I've loved the conversations I've had. This is the only dating app I've ever spent money on and so far it's been worth it just for the opportunities. Give it a try
2809,Jason A,"December 14, 2019",1," so slow at loading and annoying to use. keeps prompting to rate it, so annoying. msgs take an avg of 6-15s to load. I contacted them and they said this is normal"
2810,Paul Della,"December 20, 2019",4," Overall, I have had more quality matches than any other dating app, but sometimes the chat can be inconsistent with messages loading correctly."
2811,Seth Bullers,"December 27, 2019",4, Easy to use. Filters need to be more specific to mod out excess profiles. Still a good app to help find people of interest.
2812,W Hunter,"December 21, 2019",1, Very buggy. Seems like no one on it. I've had issues logging in to delete and zero response from customer support.
2813,ma belle,"December 18, 2019",4, It's pretty cool compared to most apps. However you do have to upgrade and pay for more features like most apps. Overall I'd rate it an 8/10.
2814,Marlana Phillips,"January 5, 2020",5," I like the set up. Its way different than most dating apps. Its simpler, yet you still see a person's personality shine thru on their profile."
2815,Damien Bee,"January 17, 2020",5," Great app, easy to use, lots of wonderful people to open communications up with... Definitely worth the space on my phone and the time to set up... I reccommend this app to all my friends..."
2816,Eric Mark,"January 17, 2020",5," Really neat take on a dating app, the random questions/comments part is an amazing way to figure out what kind of person someone is! Solid concept, definitely recommend"
2817,Martin Now,"February 11, 2020",4," Kinda clunky, but overall a solid app"
2818,Cassie McCabe,"February 12, 2020",5, More meaningful matches/conversations than Bumble/Tinder
2819,Jesse Middleton,"March 11, 2020",5, Great experience! Easy app
2820,Matt Smith,"March 15, 2020",4," Just about the best one on the market today, 4 of 5, cause there is no 5 start dating app"
2821,Kim Benning,"March 21, 2020",4," The platform is great- 5 photos, 3 set questions, saves you wading thru piles of boring info"
2822,Michael George,"January 23, 2020",5," I have found only one problem with Hinge, not enough local people know of it. But I found that the people on Hinge are better than on other apps. I will not spoil it for you, but it works much differently than other dating apps. I love it!"
2823,Christopher Cirincione,"December 12, 2019",3," Keeps asking for star rating and/or whether I met the same person, over and over again. Otherwise, great social app!"
2824,Sassy Flap,"December 27, 2019",2," Fun app but the latest update is sh*te. E.g keeps asking me to rate when I already have. The first version was smooth, this version is glitchy."
2825,Kyle Turner,"November 8, 2019",1," App has terrible UX UI - matches just delete when you try to open the chat, screen freezes all the time (and yes, got the latest version)"
2826,kay te,"November 16, 2019",3, Buggy. Keeps freezing and crashing. Would be nice to have hide your profile feature. Other than that it works.
2827,Mo Mo,"February 2, 2020",2, App not working correctly. Keeps deleting my sent and received messages. Please fix .
2828,littlefred811,"December 1, 2019",1," Lots of initial""Hello...."" Very little follow up after the first contacts. Could it possibly be. Company generated profiles? Hmmm. I believe our answer is yes.üëé"
2829,Russell Bannister,"December 2, 2019",1, I think this was a great app but only used it for a short while. There was recently an update and since then its become terrible. So dissapointed how an cool app can be trashed by update.
2830,Liza K.,"December 8, 2019",1," I found this app through an article about the best dating apps for queer women. Tinder, OkCupid, and POF are all hetero-focused, but even when I tried tinder again, they have started making you PAY for literally just TALKING to anyone. You can't see who likes you at all.

Tinder, OkCupid, and POF are all hetero-focused, but even when I tried tinder again, they have started making you PAY for literally just TALKING to anyone. You can't see who likes you at all. I was hopeful that this app would be different, but not even an hour into use I ran out of likes and have to pay for a membership. Super disappointed that this app is like all the others."
2831,Ryan Shepard,"December 5, 2019",3," Locations are messed up, it just says Northwest, Northeast and stuff like that. No actual cities on profiles and it gets old having to ask people."
2832,Franklin Roberts,"December 9, 2019",3, The messanger is busted. I have had conversations with people I was interested in getting to know better end or get out on hold because either I or them had our app glitch out!
2833,Mathew Burton,"December 15, 2019",4," Works well, easy to use, genuine people so far. Havent had it long enough to know if its got any hiccups."
2834,Ray Lister,"December 28, 2019",5, I like the way this app forces connection on a genuine level. The only problem is the limited response length.
2835,A Google user,"January 2, 2020",5," Easy to use, great prompts and love the fact people can comment on your photos. This app makes online dating much easier and feels less artificial!"
2836,Choco Photography,"January 23, 2020",1," Shows people from my area very very rarely... I'm receiving emails with my matches and when I click on view it, it shows only the next user to view but never my matches... Broken app..."
2837,Tom Cuthbert,"December 28, 2019",4, All good...but some work required on the positioning of the send button...more than once I haven't finished writing and it sends.
2838,Tchay,"January 3, 2020",1," Using a Samsung Galaxy S9, I'm unable to link Instagram or Facebook. The app keeps looping me back to the Facebook/IG sign in page. Very buggy. Dont have this problem on tinder or bumble."
2839,Alec Flaa,"January 14, 2020",1, Not a good app. This is the app for obese people I'm not even kidding. 5% of girls on this are toned and in shape. Or I'm just getting the bad batch I have no clue. All my recommendations are at least 200lbs I swear. Why are you even recommending when I cant even choose my preferences. Stupid app.
2840,Austin Levesque,"January 9, 2020",4," Good overall, there are some technical limitations especially if you start having a long chat history."
2841,Jeremy Dangerfield,"January 21, 2020",1," Couldn't even get an account, tried with Facebook didn't work, tried to use phone number didn't get a verification code. Don't bother downloading."
2842,Rafi Razzaque,"February 8, 2020",2, Did you just hide or do away with the question prompts? They don't appear anymore on my when looking through new profiles and that's one of the defining Hinge characteristics. Big yikes I'd so
2843,amazing_rapper75 king_bob82,"March 4, 2020",5, Great app to find someone that you're looking to spend your life with
2844,Robert Glenn,"March 25, 2020",3, Too many contact limitations
2845,JAMES234 KINDLE,"March 24, 2020",5, Its a good app if you want to end the searching
2846,Steven Henein,"November 26, 2019",2," Better than bumble, the location code is buggy, I'm in Canada and it keeps suggesting people in the US, or the cities that people list as there home location is wrong"
2847,Alex Titarenko,"December 28, 2019",1," Original review was pretty good, but that all changed recently. This company will take your money and keep it while banning you. NO REFUNDS EITHER.

2848,Jesse Thorpe,"November 10, 2019",1," App goes blank within the first question and doesn't give any options on ""who would you like to date"" and can't cancel out or move forward. Nice try developers maybe leave it up to the people who know what they're doing"
2849,Home Sweet Tent,"November 16, 2019",1," ""The App That Is Designed To Be Deleted"" is right! Facebook bought out Hinge; and now, my account has been banned for no reason...?! Why don't you worry about you're 'development' team being incompetent to deliver a working UI...???"
2850,Grace George,"January 6, 2020",4, Love the app but the message section is annoying because it scrolls all the way up to the top when you open the conversation.
2851,J Campbell,"December 21, 2019",1," It was a good app in the beginning with a few minor glitches. Then today, my account was spontaneously deleted. How? And why?"
2852,Karan Murpana,"December 7, 2019",5," Finally an app with true users, 0 adds and disturbances, with quality interface, and interesting match category though the daily swipe limit is very less! The app is worth it!"
2853,Yashaswi Singh,"December 25, 2019",3, The app takes a lot of time to update user activity. It keeps sending the same notifications multiple times.
2854,Marisa Abzug-Callender,"December 31, 2019",5, I like the interface and the way the profiles are laid out. Seems to work well and isn't glitchy.
2855,Ashley Mahler,"January 1, 2020",3," This app does a great job at providing meaningful connections, but the price for Premium skyrocketed .... $20/month? I don't think so."
2856,Reed Wyper,"January 8, 2020",4, Much better design and format but the pool of users is still too small. This needs to be advertised more to compete with Tinder.
2857,Right Left,"January 8, 2020",1," Can't use it's impossible to sign up via email, only Facebook and phone no. I'm not comfortable to provide my phone no, and Facebook login isn't working."

2859,Rachel Morris,"January 14, 2020",5," I had nearly sworn off online dating. I absolutely loathe swipe-based apps. Took a chance on Hinge and have been thoroughly impressed so far! Great interface, simple profiles, fun prompts, and high-quality prospects!"

2863,jake schmidt,"January 17, 2020",4," Very good app, well easy to manage good for those who want to date but aren't very good at meeting people in the real world.."
2864,Claire Alexandra,"January 20, 2020",4, I think it's a little slow moving compared to some apps but the set up is really nice and it seems to attract a better crowd than some of the others. Definitely would say give it a go!
2865,Bella novia,"January 27, 2020",4, Really good but theres always room for improvement.
2866,Alexandre Ciavarella,"February 1, 2020",5," Better than Tinder for real relationship searches. But even then, Tinder has always been awful."
2867,Joseph Ervin,"February 1, 2020",5, A much better interface than any other dating app. Users seem to be more interested in getting to know you.

2874,sebastian wei,"November 14, 2019",5, This app feels fresh and clean. And it forces users to read and choose a favourite part of other's bio. I had some very good conversations with girls. Better than Tinder.
2875,Luke Weidner,"November 17, 2019",4," As far as features go it's my favorite dating app I've tried. Glitchy app though, not too big a deal. My gf and I deleted it so I'd say it worked as intended..."
2876,Nick Calow,"November 26, 2019",5," Nothing but good reports on the app itself. The potential matches or not are all up to the person playing the game, but it's fine"
2877,KingReccer,"December 6, 2019",3, The app is easy to use and has some good features. Dose not have alot of info on other people let alone yourself. 3 question about yourself and 6 pic that's it no more.
2878,ABHISHEK SURESH,"December 6, 2019",2," Way too many glitches. I'm unable to match and unmatch with the profiles, also, the notifications don't work."
2879,CJ Beninati,"December 5, 2019",4," The app, the way it's designed allows users to read their /your profile. Limited likes help weed out the swipers that don't read. Bots I haven't run across."
2880,Shady Spidey,"December 11, 2019",2, Interesting format I enjoy it but it seems no one ever responds or that the profiles are so old. Have answered hundreds of questions and not one legit person

You must be crazy expecting people to send random strangers a copy of your drivers licence."
2883,Pete Baxter,"December 12, 2019",2," The location system is broken, it doesn't matter what I set it to I see people in London which is more than the maximum distance I've set!"
2884,M D,"January 2, 2020",1, App doesn't function correctly just show people you didnt wanna match with over and over .. app just wants you to pay for it no point in using the free version ! Waste of time !
2885,Keith Beard,"January 3, 2020",1, The app force's you to give way too much personal information during sign up and forces you to turn on GPS location. Why bother asking us to input information when they literally force it in order to use the app.
2886,Ayman El Khamkhami,"January 6, 2020",5," The concept of this app is just genius, starting a conversation is much easier and not superficial. The best I used so far"
2887,Salvador Covarrubias,"January 12, 2020",3," It's a pretty cool app, but I'm not too thrilled that you run out of likes so quick. I feel that the reason that that is done that way is to make you pay for this app"
2888,Craig j Blake,"January 15, 2020",5," Just started using it and i think i am beginning to meet people,i hope my account don't get blocked because it's the only app i have on my phone to pass time and it has been good."
2889,Ethan Hetherington,"January 30, 2020",4," Pretty cool, i like how it makes you spend time on each profile instead of mindlessly swiping."
2890,vickyavgstd vickyavgstd,"February 7, 2020",5, This app gets you real dates. I found two good ladies within a span of three months. It can be due to my profile and the benefit of Hinge. Hinge is the best for decent people looking for good relationships. Thank you Hinge

2895,hellosavvs,"March 5, 2020",4, Asks good questions and gives the options of you showing it or not.
2896,Tony Chiff,"March 8, 2020",5, Limited likes each day makes you care more and spend more than 10 seconds on them
2897,H Singh,"March 6, 2020",2, Disappointed that Sikh religion is not a option on this even though it has a population of 35million worldwide. Please may you add this in the next update as it would help myself and bring back some of the people I know that left this app for that very reason.
2898,Nathan Janiszewski,"March 20, 2020",5," Everything is great about it, except you only get 10 swipes per day."
2899,Spencer Reed,"March 20, 2020",1," Couldn't even use the app, it wouldn't recognize that my profile was complete."
2900,Nataliea Renno,"April 16, 2020",5, Easy and no pressure
2901,Samuel Pyle,"November 21, 2019",4," It's actually a fresh approach to online dating, but sometimes the messages disappear and you have to log out and back in to see the new messages. A little annoying."
2902,Joseph Sylvester,"February 18, 2020",3, Basic dating app and no real draw to it even after a year on it.
2903,Tristan Thompson,"February 17, 2020",5, let's you know more about the other person than just pictures. Makes the first text easier.
2904,Raj Gandhi,"January 2, 2020",3," Sometimes shows the same profiles again (that I've already tapped X on), occasionally unreliable with notifications, sometimes comment doesn't send with the like."
2905,Ben Pahari,"November 9, 2019",3," Very glitchy, for example when hitting match it will often not go through but other times it will, resulting in multiple duplicate messages etc"
2906,Grace Scanlon,"November 10, 2019",1, Not happy with customer service - got locked out cause of the age restriction and have sent my details but no one has come back to me. I can't even try to register with fb!!!!
2907,Helen James,"November 10, 2019",3, There is no age or distance filter so there is it requires a lot of searching for someone close to you in age and distance.
2908,Kush Kaur,"November 9, 2019",3," It used to be a cool app and then they decided to make the ""height"" preference for paying premium members only. Now i keep getting likes from men shorter than me."
2909,Curt Soloff,"November 12, 2019",5," Just a few days of use, but much to my surprise, this app seems far superior to the others I've tried that have been universally discouraging."

Let's just start finding our dates here on the review section via google after giving these ""morafaqas"" a faqin bad review and delete the faqin app. It's a waste of time, so I'm going oldshcool as it's the only safe and most effective way to look for a real date you really like and will have normal conversation without interruption. Faq these morafaqas, I'm out of here, faqin benches. Pis of shirt-holes and ash-holes. Really pizzed at them."
2911,J Post,"November 17, 2019",4," Great app. Matches are usually far away though, that's my only negative thing."
2912,Leandra Lewis,"November 24, 2019",3," I'm a new user. It's great so far. You won't really have anything to experience without paying though. The fee isn't steep, so, it's worth it."
2913,Greg Arata,"December 14, 2019",5," Pretty great. I like the option of changing speaking turns, so it's not the man each time"
2914,Top Tenn,"December 29, 2019",1, This app is terrible. Even when setting the location setting to within 12 miles it constantly shows me matches from 2-3hrs away as well as shows my profile to people the same distance away. Do not recomend

Now I get that some people are happy with the way they are and good for them. But I'm a skateboarder, snowboarding, surfer, and rock climber. How would we be compatible at all. ""Hey you wanna go... Oh... Or what about... Oh yeah... Well let's go.... Well I guess we can just stay home then."
2917,Joseph Foo,"January 7, 2020",5," Interesting concept, matches have been good and the girls aren't bots like you find on other apps which is a nice change from the norm üòÇ"
2918,Abby Reed,"January 14, 2020",4, I like this app a lot. It's not just mindless swiping. The format encourages actual conversations.
2919,Nastia Borisova,"January 22, 2020",5, The best app I have tried. Very nice design and easy to use. Minor technical issues nothing serious. Thank you Hinge. Xx
2920,Charlie Markwick,"January 21, 2020",4, Taks a little time to get one's head around how to progress conversations. However it's an interesting approach.
2921,David Parron,"February 25, 2020",1, Reporting system is heavily flawed
2922,John Marston,"March 29, 2020",1, Yet another overhyped dating app with only one body type. It targets people who have a lot of money and limits free users to 50 likes per day. Trash.
2923,Max Little,"April 13, 2020",5," Works well, low pressure"
2924,Brian Evans,"April 13, 2020",5, Makes it easy to start a Convo

2926,Joline Swan,"December 11, 2019",2," Trying to give this app another chance. However, I paid for the Premium about 3 weeks ago. In 3 weeks, I haven't got one single solitary like or match, which is just scientifically impossibly considering I live IVO NYC."
2927,Erin Mulcahey,"December 9, 2019",4," Great, but opening a started conversation drops you at the top of if, constantly need to scroll to the bottom."
2928,Javier Chavez,"February 4, 2020",2, A few matches then pay $20...pathetic
2929,Kevin Jung,"November 10, 2019",2, Terrible programming and software. Matches and messages disappear and reappear all the time. Really need to fix these bugs
2930,Breanne,"November 6, 2019",5, Pretty awesome. Would be nice to have a few more options of questions to answer to get to know folks better before messaging but that can be done with messages also!

2932,Alec Rodriguez,"November 16, 2019",1," Sure it has profile questions to make it easy. But with tons of free dating apps, only having 3-5 likes a day before needed to upgrade is ridiculous. And hardly any filters."
2933,Alek Verwey,"November 17, 2019",4," So far, it is great. But I do wish it would be better with notifying you when you get messages and having someone like you. That would make it even better."
2934,Zac Adewole,"November 20, 2019",4," Cool interface, which makes for more unique conversation. The novelty of liking one aspect of a profile as opposed to the whole things is actually cool."
2935,Steve Silva,"November 21, 2019",4," It's a good app, well made and it highlights points of potential communication, which is nice."
2936,Josh Jordan,"November 26, 2019",4, App can be a little glitchy at times but the matches are good if you put in the effort in your profile.
2937,brandon hachick,"December 2, 2019",4, A little buggy but decent. So far payment is simple and it doesnt syphin money from me and is easy to deal with.
2938,Michael Ioffe,"December 6, 2019",5, Fewer fake profiles. The very fact you don't swipe is somehow psychologically an improvement. Feels like the user base has grown/is growing.
2939,michael bowler,"December 5, 2019",4, Probably the best free dating app about. Doesn't seem to have any fake accounts. People on there seem genuine. It's simple but effective.
2940,Jasminder Virk,"December 14, 2019",4," Ive had a pretty solid time on here, lots of nice people! The only issue is notifications dont work. Not a big deal or anything but not ideal either üòÖ Much better than any other dating app tho."
2941,Zachary Starner,"January 3, 2020",5, It's a great app. I haven't met any bots and it doesn't seem to be the trailer park of internet dating. I'm not even a fan of doing internet dating and I think this is a good app.
2942,Stephanie Lane,"December 20, 2019",4, I really like the location feature whish shows you what part of town someone lives in. It helps when you are trying to date someone in your own area :)
2943,Opal Avery Kelly,"December 28, 2019",2," Plenty of gender options but you can't sort yourself into an ""other"" category. The whole point of having other gender options is to not have to align yourself with male or female."
2944,Marlo Colletto,"January 2, 2020",3, The free user experience is frustratingly limited and the app seems glitchy although I had heard good things. Hope it gets better. Been on less than a day
2945,A Google user,"January 3, 2020",4, Some bugs with messages not sending or showing up. Algorithms for finding matches fixate on some of the strangest things sometimes!
2946,Andrew Glose,"January 6, 2020",5," I like the functionality and many ways of interacting/matching . So far, a very positive experience."
2947,Luis Ojeda,"January 12, 2020",5, App forces you to put more info on your profile versus just endless swiping. I feel like it leads to better matches. Unfortunately I don't get too many lol
2948,Lindy Morgan,"January 22, 2020",5," I like its simplicity and that you can use it without paying. when you pay for a membership, you get extra perks."
2949,Kristen Howell,"January 22, 2020",3," Overall okay. Just seems that its all a game, like any other app. Honestly, most of the men I match with, are petty, and conceited. Blows my mind. Sad."
2950,Matthew Bennett,"January 26, 2020",5," One bug I've found: Pressing done after typing a message after liking a photo does not close the keyboard. Otherwise, great app."
2951,Terra Fornili,"January 31, 2020",5, Great app very easy to use and find exactly what you want.
2952,IN THE KNOW,"February 9, 2020",3, The profiles repeat often .
2953,El Beats,"March 17, 2020",4," Wish there was more likes per day other than that, it's a really great app"
2954,Rajat Thakur,"April 3, 2020",1, Nice place to find the most fake profiles. Even tinder doesn't have these many! Congratulations Hinge.
2955,Max Hacker,"November 6, 2019",4," Solid app, but it seems to love not giving me notifications when someone messages and frequently glitches causing me to make my matches wait days for a reply"
2956,Connor Lavoy,"November 10, 2019",5," By far the app most successful in matching me with people and giving me the chance to actually have a conversation. Make no mistake, blind mutual like matching is a terrible way to filter dates."
2957,Jaiden Wood,"November 13, 2019",5, The best dating app of them all for sure. The mandated 6 pics and 3 answers is great. The quality of the people seem to be much better than the others
2958,Jo Wilson,"November 15, 2019",4," Preety good. A bit confusing trying to figure out where the prospect lives. But I use that as a convo starter. Overall, better quality people than other larger sites."
2959,Dani Mart√≠nez,"November 18, 2019",1, Ridiculous amount of time this apps gets clunky & brings back people that I already removed from matches or doesn't allow me to match people that already liked me - previous version looked way more stable
2960,Talha Saleem,"November 19, 2019",1," Lot of bugs, especially in the new UI. Messages dont open from pop up notification. IT support is non existent and dont reply to emails even"
2961,Diarmid Hawkins,"November 21, 2019",5, Very fast good dating app. Fairly priced if you want the extras but can be used fine without. Good system just needs more people on it. But so far working for me.
2962,James Windle,"November 28, 2019",1," Used to be great, but the new version is extremely glitchy and almost unusable."
2963,Jason Monge,"March 18, 2020",5, Best site I've ever been on. No fake accounts jumping in your inbox
2964,Ryan McGuire,"December 15, 2019",1, Definitely the dating app meant for Deleting. I've never seen more unattractive people on a dating app. I literally hit the X button 99 out of 100 times and I'm not even that picky. I'll be deleting shortly.
2965,Logan Stewart,"January 2, 2020",5," In my opinion, way better than the other free dating apps out there. I have matched with way more people than the competition :)"
2966,Christopher Bell,"December 26, 2019",5," Great app. Very active user base. No bots. No bs. Much better than my other app experiences including OkCupid, Tinder, Match, and Bumble."
2967,P Off,"January 4, 2020",5," It's simple, nicely set out, seems to attract all sorts, including decent folk. As they say I'll like it more after I've deleted it."
2968,Natalie Behman,"December 18, 2019",4, It's good because you have to write 3 things in Bio and have a sufficient amount of photos up. However when you match they don't talk which is annoying üòÖ
2969,Tracy M,"January 12, 2020",4," It's fine so far, but currently I can't connect my Instagram to my profile. The page to input the security code texted to me immediately backs out."
2970,Andrew Williams,"January 8, 2020",5," Quick to set up and use, but much better for meeting people and starting conversations than Tinder or Bumble. Hinge is the way to go üëç"
2971,Jerry Dooling,"January 22, 2020",4, Definitely one of the better apps. It has some small stuff that could be better but for the most part it is good. Plus its free!
2972,Layshad Vaughn,"January 18, 2020",4," The app is ok. Not alot of people are on here, but it's a good way to find someone and socialize if you match or you can just send a message if interested."
2973,Barbora Hessov√°,"February 2, 2020",4, It's alright.. Missing an option to skip a person if I don't want to decide right away... And they don't have gifs!!
2974,Matthew Saturn,"February 2, 2020",4," Moderately good app so far, haven't had any luck yet hooking a good fish but I'll keep my line in the pond."
2975,Rishi Hapawat,"February 3, 2020",1," Downloaded it in india, couldn't log in with facebook, then tried with phone number, still nothing. Bummer"
2976,ANEEK SEN,"February 14, 2020",1, Cant login with facebook...very bad
2977,Shuvro Mahmud,"March 12, 2020",3, It's nice except enough people in my region. I guess it's the fault of their marketing team üòπ
2978,Vee Vee,"March 21, 2020",1, Ugh No just another site full of pervs. Full of sex predators and uploading pics is the worst. I give up with this app
2979,Rydiak,"November 12, 2019",4," Pretty decent dating app. Search/filter functions are limited with paying, but they gotta get you to pay somehow. Works fine otherwise."
2980,Luke Momjian,"November 18, 2019",5," More serious clientele than tinder or bumble. App design effectively encourages relationship creation, most notably in the low number of daily swipes available to free members."
2981,bryan kalarchik,"November 17, 2019",5, Great experience so far the app gives high quality selections and the dates I have been on have been great even though we didn't always work out
2982,Seth Howe,"November 17, 2019",4," Its a wonderful app, I just hate when it keeps asking me to rate it every 25 seconds, not exaggerating."
2983,Richard Kim,"November 28, 2019",5, Very clean design and easy to use interface. Most success I've had on any dating app.
2984,Kara Price,"December 4, 2019",4, It is easy to interact with potential friends. Wish it had more features like video chatting or sending pics
2985,oluwa onipede,"December 5, 2019",1, I rated 1 star because there are so many limits unless to may $$$. It takes the fun out of it. Uninstalling.
2986,wicked will,"December 21, 2019",5, It's different. It's got less insta models and more substance. Nothing expires and no thumb cramps. The algorithm is learning my interests
2987,Gaurav Khiani,"December 21, 2019",1," Used to be great..now your app won't stop repeating FAKE profiles, despite reporting them countless times! Losing patience with this app!"
2988,Clifton Lucius,"December 26, 2019",5," App works well, no need to upgrade to the paid service and they don't push it on you. No gimmicks, just a solid app for meeting others."
2989,Jake Wasik,"January 5, 2020",5," Really cool concept. Starting conversations through the app feels very organic, not something I've experienced with other dating apps"
2990,Brad Davis,"January 9, 2020",5, A free app that actually works! Making you like a particular picture or comment also helps get the conversation started.
2991,Brett Madigan,"January 13, 2020",1, The app always loads received messages from the start of the conversation... Really turns me off using the app. Phone is a Huawei Mate 20 Pro... So I get it lol
2992,Relm,"January 16, 2020",5," Hinge gives you limits which, in practice, is great! Not having infinite swipes means there is priority. I like that."
2993,Panagis Matsangouras,"January 21, 2020",4," A fresh approach to meeting guys. Seems to have many fresh faces. Could do with some details, like sexual role, to avoid pointless interactions. Why does everyone have their top off infront of a mountain in their profile??? ü§£"
2994,Darci McGillivray,"January 17, 2020",1," I can't even open the app. It crashes seconds after I try to open it. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, but it still crashes."
2995,Raeanna Clarke,"January 18, 2020",5, This app is great!!!! It's clean and safe and a great way to meet many kinds of ppl. Love the layout
2996,Kevin Schulze,"January 23, 2020",5, Great app. Matches quickly. Well designed. I started talking to matches within hours.
2997,Seb Johnson,"January 31, 2020",5," Actually a good dating app, people respond and it's easy to make real connections with people"
2998,thomas messer,"January 30, 2020",5," Very good format, makes for solid connections with matches"
2999,Ateesh Chattopadhyay,"January 29, 2020",4," No bots, but takes a while to get matches."
3000,James Richards,"March 1, 2020",4, So far so good. Only had it a day and dating apps usually start well and then you get plunged into an abyss.
3001,Native Joe,"March 8, 2020",3, Its my go to for online dating. But it would not stop nagging me for a rating so that makes it lose points.
3002,Heidi P,"March 14, 2020",5, Hilarious with the prompts!!
3003,flip McFliperson,"April 7, 2020",5," So far, so good. Like the interface."
3004,Victoria Lee,"April 12, 2020",5," Great dating app, compared to others!"
3005,Nayanika Ghosh,"April 19, 2020",5," Very few creeps, and lots of respectful cuties."
3006,Devyn Deak,"January 25, 2020",3, Some bugs need to be fixed and the premium is the most expensive as opposed to most dating apps.
3007,tyler heglin,"November 11, 2019",5, Exceptional and kind of free. Limited liking capabilities for non payment users but over all better than others and doesn't make us pay to use messaging which is great.
3008,Terrance Dauplaise,"November 12, 2019",1," Mostly useless because it lists people's locations with such useful names as ""South Main."" That could be one mile from me, or 100. I give up."
3009,DJ Mutts,"November 13, 2019",1, I installed this app and was rejected cause it says im under 18 which i am not. I have followed their stuff u need to do by sending a gov id photo and stuff and not even a response from them and am still blocked from making an account. What did u just want my personal info ??
3010,Hayley Ryan,"November 15, 2019",5, Love it! Much more interaction and funny stuff amongst the rest! Definitely rate it over the others for sure!
3011,TheMonkeyslim,"November 22, 2019",2," Loads of bad matches, you definitely decline more than you like on this app. Like the concept, style and ideas but jheez still need better people on here."
3012,Roland Villafuerte,"November 24, 2019",1," I wanted to like Hinge as I'm a quality over quantity person. Unfortunately, Hinges algorithm is bad. I'm not exaggerating when I say that 95% of the profiles I see I am completely unattracted to. I never have this issue on the other dating apps"
3013,Anna Jagric,"November 27, 2019",4," Innovative app, a better way to start conversations. Avoiding the quick swiping, encouraging more considered matching."
3014,Dorescia Paige,"November 23, 2019",5, Very cool. More intimate than other apps & it doesn't hit you up to spend money every 5 minutes either.
3015,Andrew Pedegana,"November 26, 2019",2," Refreshed my account after deleting it but my subscription that's paid through until December is not reloading back to my account. Don't want to be paying for something I can't use, how do I fix this issue?"
3016,Pearl,"December 12, 2019",5, I love the UI and it's a lot easier to manage that other apps that can be way too overwhelming for me personally.
3017,Hunter,"January 5, 2020",5, I like that this app offers the direct ability to like someone and interact with them. Prompts and talking poikts allow for more conversation starters than simple swiping as in Tinder or Bumble.
3018,Cassandra Nicole Apodaca,"January 6, 2020",5, Conversations with matches from nearby easy to match and unmatch. Decent experience for me in my first few days on the app.
3019,KJ,"January 6, 2020",3, It's probably the best dating app so far. Only downside would be the price to sign up! It's outrageously expensive for a dating app
3020,Ernest McDonald,"December 20, 2019",3," The app has had some annoying glitches, but it seems to be fixed with each update."
3021,Michelle Svec,"December 23, 2019",2, Still shows people many miles outside of your outlined area. I put in a 15mi radius and it shows me 44mi plus away which doesn't help because even if we match no one wants to drive.
3022,Bluu Speaks,"December 30, 2019",2," Don't really like the limited likes on the free version. Other apps seem to be a better choice, and a little more user friendly"
3023,King Nick,"January 9, 2020",5," It's a good app! Much better than Tinder and giving you an immediate option of communication based off of something in their profile, rather than a general ""Like"""
3024,TrevSkee Cannon,"January 23, 2020",5," It's alright I suppose.. I don't personal get much attention but that's all me, this is about the app ü§£ so yeah very good app works and is smooth, not complicated like the other typical dating apps! üëç"
3025,Austin Gwiazdowski,"January 25, 2020",5," I like it better than tinder. Its nice that you have questions that you can answer on your profile, and its nice that you can like specific messages. Would reccomend trying it."
3026,Hannah Bannach,"January 25, 2020",4, Pretty nice. The app is really well designed and it brings about more interesting conversations instead of complicated bios striaght to the point
3027,Danny Falabella,"February 20, 2020",5, It's a fun app gives you a better insight into the person
3028,Rachel,"February 26, 2020",1, It's clunky and difficult to manage
3029,Thibault Hartog,"April 12, 2020",5, Great to meet real people looking to go out.
3030,Whetham Allpress,"January 8, 2020",4, After the latest update (oct 2019) loads of weird glitches. Random photos and vids popping up in the wrong profiles etc eek!
3031,R CallumTo,"November 9, 2019",4," Better among all the other popular dating apps. I like it for the effort people have to put in, easy and very functional interface. Oh btw lots of pretty girls too. Lol"
3032,Jared Faniel,"November 11, 2019",2, The app seem to have a lot of BOTs that catfish your profile. The send a lot of bad profile. They need to have more filters.
3033,SgtDeath1942,"November 13, 2019",4," Much better than the other apps. Everyone feels much more laid back, the app prompts people well enough for ice breakers"

I asked for all the evidence of me violating their terms and conditions but they ignored my request. So all I am going to do is give my story to the Sun and other media platforms to warn everyone not use Hinge as it discriminates on certain people."
3035,E. Blakely,"November 17, 2019",1, GFC. every. Damn. Time. I download the app. Chat. Meet. Take a break and delete. And next time I try to download it says I've been banned. I contact hinge support and they apologize for the mistake and reopen my account.
3036,Eny Wong,"November 16, 2019",5," So far great experience. However, I definitely send out way more connections than I receive. But eh, worth a shot."
3037,Fernando Pena,"November 20, 2019",5, I haven't met anyone yet but I'm getting a lot matches. The way they keep profiles from becoming overwhelming might have something to do with it.
3038,adrian chan,"December 17, 2019",3," Great concept, meh execution. Messaging interface seems unreliable. Eg; seems like some messages get skipped missed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and I don't mean ghosting lol"
3039,Natalie Marchio,"December 3, 2019",5, Best of all dating apps because it's easier to start a conversation from liking a picture or compulsory question (only 3).
3040,Geoffrey Cooke,"December 8, 2019",1, Suggested matches are terrible and the profiles are awful. Definitely designed to be deleted due to being poorly designed.
3041,Lauren Goetz,"December 11, 2019",2," Can only match with a few guys. Can't see all the people who like me without paying to see that. Designed to be deleted? Yeah for not letting me use the dang app for it's true purpose without payment... Lemme find love, damn it."
3042,Daniel Yarbrough,"December 14, 2019",4," A little glitchy, and a major battery hog, but filled with people worth meeting, so on the balance an app worth having."
3043,spencer childress,"December 15, 2019",4, Pretty straight forward. No hidden costs or subscriptions which is very nice!
3044,David Moskowitz,"December 19, 2019",4, It's a pretty decent site.Very little spam or advertising. ..worth your efforts. ..pretty well designed and easy to keep the nonsense away from your in box
3045,Christopher Napier,"January 6, 2020",3, Only 10 likes per day makes a really slow start. But I prefer Hinge to Bumble. I like that I can message women who like my facts or that I can like their profiles with a short message.
3046,Dustin Richey,"December 17, 2019",1," In the process of deleting this app, to my surprise I opened it to find out I was not logged in. After 2-3 attempts I was prompted saying I violated their terms of use. Being curious, I read the entire terms of use, I did not violate anything in them in any possile way.

After 2-3 attempts I was prompted saying I violated their terms of use. Being curious, I read the entire terms of use, I did not violate anything in them in any possile way. I shot an email to their support team as I wanted to know whatbin their terms I actually violated and wanted to ensure my account was deleted. They could not provide me with anything I violated and stopped responding."
3047,Gordon Williams,"December 18, 2019",4," Quality of people is better than Tinder (in my experience) but I run out of likes pretty fast even though I don't use the app everyday. Other than than that, a pretty decent app."
3048,Joshua Bergen,"January 9, 2020",4," Not sure why but I get about 6 likes at the start, then it says I have no more. Then when I tap no on a number of people all of a sudden I get to like more people. Kinda strange"
3049,Nicola Smith,"January 17, 2020",5," Good app, set up is good. More info about people than just pics and no time limit to start talking when you match"
3050,Keenan Cloutier,"January 21, 2020",4," Really simple account setup, the prompts are really great ways to start a conversation up beyond the usual ""hey"""
3051,Terry Smith,"January 16, 2020",2," So i downloaded the app and it was good got matched and everything was going great but all of a suden i could not see my matches and messages, tried loging out and loging back in but it did not work"
3052,Roy Shanks,"January 22, 2020",4, It is good with matching up people's and like it better than other apps. Just the uploading of profiles n messages takes ages.
3053,N Burke,"January 16, 2020",3," Decent and simple app but super buggy... The built-in texting routinely drops texts, notifications are inconsistent, and the IG interface is spotty at best"
3054,Jakulon Drone,"January 28, 2020",1, Sure it seems nice until they throttle your profile's visibility because you haven't paid anything yet.
3055,Jeremy Boyd,"February 24, 2020",3, I mean it's good I've had one or to likes nothing special but it really sucked when I had to lose my account bc my phone service got shut off
3056,Bea Bou,"February 24, 2020",5, Great and easy to use
3057,Alexander Green,"February 27, 2020",3, It's quite good but still a rather small user base
3058,Leak tv,"March 8, 2020",5, Dude really good app I'm so happy right now like no... really freaking happy it's not like other apps you can really find true loveü•∞ü§©
3059,Dee,"November 6, 2019",4," All around good app. However, it glitches sometimes and shows the pictures of one profile on another user's profile"
3060,Jay C,"November 15, 2019",1," Paid for it, and it really doesn't have many people still online using the app to get matches. Quite a waste of time to be honest"
3061,Colin Burling,"November 15, 2019",5," So far, best app out there besides Bumble. I love the interactive quality of starting the conversation."
3062,Aaron Sciamanna,"January 8, 2020",1, Was pretty happy with the app. Then after work one day found out my account was banned with any sort of explanation. Also found out there's no way to appeal the ban. So it looks like I'm done with hinge
3063,Aron Weiler,"November 20, 2019",5," Very entertaining. Better than most apps, with having to like/comment on something to match."
3064,Ben Lee,"November 22, 2019",5, Better than tinder because your first interaction has some context to it. I think you start meaningful conversations more easily as well.
3065,Ravi Kini,"November 24, 2019",1, This app doesn't work! It didn't even go beyond the phone verification! The least you can do is make your app bug free
3066,Peter C,"November 24, 2019",5, Seems like an interesting interface and concept. The ability to like and comment on a specific part of the profile is an interesting feature.
3067,mark rodriguez,"November 22, 2019",5," It's simple to use, the three questions that each profile has makes for a good conversation starter, a lot of good picks."
3068,Sam Barnes,"December 8, 2019",4, The best dating app so far! Still little bugs that can be fixed: notifications not always coming through or app can show latency when moving between profiles and chat.
3069,alan bendahan,"December 19, 2019",4, The process of setting up ur profile is quite hectic but once passed very nice to use. And actually creates opportunities
3070,Daniel Deakin,"January 4, 2020",3, Great app but Premium is basically for nothing as they keep saying to widen your preference. I'm in London there's no way I've ran out of people!
3071,Alexander Rivera,"December 18, 2019",5, This is an actual real dating site with real people in it. Real women and so far I think it might be better than other sites. The emailing is faster and feels a lot like texting.
3072,Marc Rawnsley,"December 28, 2019",4, Good dating app . Only way it could get better is if there was a box to add random additional information.
3073,Rosie Vadella,"December 19, 2019",3," Was unable to start using after downloading - was not getting texts sent to my phone, tried this several times & when I went to try registering thru Facebook it wouldn't allow me to"
3074,yasmany duenas,"January 1, 2020",5, Great App for finding and meeting new people in your area and it's free so why complaint. Happy New Years!
3075,Ben Pearse,"January 8, 2020",5," Few bots as far as I can tell. The allowing you to message everyone you swipe on, and showing who has swiped for you is amazing."
3076,Mark Lynch,"January 19, 2020",5, Great full bios. Gives a lot of info going in so you know if you have a chance of hitting it off!
3077,John Miller,"January 20, 2020",3, Slower than it used to be... Lags all the time and eventually needs to be restarted.
3078,IceElements,"February 1, 2020",5, Hinge is by far the best app I have used. POF is close but this is a more mature site. If you are looking for real connections and good conversation this is the site to be on.
3079,Josh Martin,"January 28, 2020",5, I feel like I get the most quality matches on this app versus the others. Maybe there's a different kind of person on here ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3080,Nick Taylor,"February 13, 2020",1, Keeps asking me to rate the app every 2 seconds
3081,Yuliana Perez,"February 22, 2020",5, Fun and creative platform app dating!
3082,Mikey Shields,"February 24, 2020",4, Limited options but better initial conversation to start things
3083,Jamie K,"February 28, 2020",1," Commerical lies, had I know this app was money hungry like the rest....thanks for nothing"
3084,Isaiah Padilla,"March 22, 2020",1," ""Complete profile to send likes"" ""Profile 100% complete"" Which is it?"
3085,Augustine Nkpa,"April 7, 2020",4, Good app nice and friendly people
3086,Benny Richard Dickson,"April 5, 2020",1, Instead of naming this app as Hinge you could have named it Hooker. Coz all it shows is only Hookers and that too repetitive. Tired of reporting accounts.
3087,Terrence Jackson,"November 13, 2019",5," Better than the rest...I am enjoying this online dating thing more than ever because of ""Hinge"". The ""swipe right"" thing is so mundane. This is a better experience overall. I, for one, am stuck!!!"
3088,Pankaj Srivastav,"December 20, 2019",4, Best dating app among all because the user gets notified when someone shows interest otherwise you keep swiping and have to wait for the match with no certainty.
3089,Tiffany Begley,"November 17, 2019",4, Good so far. I like the questions and ability to send a message when attempting a match.
3090,Kyle Edwin,"November 16, 2019",4," The app is pretty glitchy, but nothing that crashes it. No real ""science"" behind matches. Still better than Tinder."
3091,Christy Lynn,"December 4, 2019",4," I like the concept but not all the added ""pricey"" options. I'm all for paying for different levels but some of them seem petty."
3092,Ryan Kist,"January 6, 2020",4," Runs verg smoothly and the ux is top notch, but lacks certain niche filters in what you're looking for that may be helpful in matching"
3093,Vladimier Bronen,"January 5, 2020",1, Now I'm unable to even start making an account. I'd like to make one but it stops me at the start page all clicks instantly close the app.
3094,Sean Magiera,"January 4, 2020",5, Saw the ad on Hulu. It said it was designed to be deleted. I downloaded the app and immediately deleted it. Very satisfying 10/10.

I'm always polite, never sent anything x-rated and am genuinely seeking a meaningful relationship, so I'm quite hurt. After a quick Google search it appears that this has happened to lots of people, with no explanation of what they've done wrong. Baffling and frustrating but I guess I'll have to look elsewhere. That aside, it's nicely designed and the questions help to show personality."
3096,Jack Murphy,"January 15, 2020",2, I've heard great things but I can't access it on my Android I have a phone from Ireland but live in England but my number doesn't work when I try send an activation code.
3097,polepino,"January 16, 2020",5, Great. I've had so much more success on this than compared to the swiping apps because the messages go through and are seen.
3098,Rick Godsey,"February 24, 2020",1," This app sucks! Worst site I've ever been on. Would not even recommend it to my EX. Got nothing, no dates, no connections. Too bad I have to rate this app."
3099,Shaun Butler,"February 29, 2020",5, Very relaxed and nice way to meet
3100,Benjamin Connel,"March 24, 2020",1, Rating this app so I can finally stop getting pestered to rate it every time I log on
3101,Kitty Plays,"March 31, 2020",4, Easy and fun to use.
3102,Zachary Cerniga,"April 3, 2020",5," Way better than tinder. And a proper premise, ""meant to be deleted"" - good job Hinge team üëç"
3103,Ed Ras,"January 22, 2020",1," Worst app ever, after subscribing you won't see people and when subscription expire you start seeing people again they don't refund money after canceling subscription, I want my refund."
3104,Ceramic Skin Studios,"November 13, 2019",1," Facebook login wasn't working, never got a verification code via number. This is still a problem."
3105,Louise Hazell,"November 10, 2019",1, New update is a scam. I used to love Hinge and used it as my main source of dating. Now they've turned it into a money maker so it's no better than the other apps that encourage creepy men and doesn't try to find good matches. Waste of time.
3106,Adam Singer,"November 10, 2019",1," Horrible app. Software glitches, bad platform, and their matching algorithms are way off base."
3107,Michael rios,"November 9, 2019",1, Really boring. Doesn't collect data to find your best match and you only get like 5 free swipes a day.
3108,Conrad Bourne,"November 13, 2019",5, Hinge has a good matching system and encourages more than mindless swiping. The chat part could use a little work but it's functional
3109,cloudotaku,"November 15, 2019",3," As a dating ap ok if you live in a city the more rural you are less chances of meeting someone local bit pushy with the pay for account is cheaper then most other dating apps which will most likely jump if it get popular free vertion limits likes to message people and it not a lot you get free, find...Full ReviewAs a dating ap ok if you live in a city the more rural you are less chances of meeting someone local bit pushy with the pay for account is cheaper then most other dating apps which will most likely jump if it get popular free vertion limits likes to message people and it not a lot you get free, find tinder better then this as a free dating ap way better then POF though"
3110,Karianne Hege,"November 14, 2019",4," Fun but kinda weird with how you match. It took me a few times to figure it out. But, it is very good"
3111,Andrew Manzara,"November 17, 2019",3," Good design overall, much more interactive than tinder. Charges Men for features that are free to women."
3112,Hari R,"November 20, 2019",5, good filters to help you find your type but needing to commit after only 3 or 4 swipes is a bit too small.
3113,Zachary Hester,"November 28, 2019",4, The best out of all the dating apps. Would be five stars if you could swipe more than 10 times before waiting 12 hours on the free version!
3114,Aaron Niehaus,"December 3, 2019",5," I met my ex on Tinder after several months of heavy use, but I have had much more successful matching on Hinge after a couple weeks. It's pretty good about filtering out serial swipers and the selection is what you'd see in real life. Average people. Very satisfied!"
3115,Chris Wearing,"December 3, 2019",3," I'm a straight man. To be brutally honest, over 3/4's the women on this particular app are...well...I'll just say that there are endless beautiful women on different apps that are definitely not this one."
3116,eva rainwater,"December 11, 2019",5," Its just so perfect and highly recommend. And just as the caption says ,ita goal its to delete it,find that perfect match"
3117,Gary Franco,"December 10, 2019",5," Does a good job matching likes. Could use some work on glitchiness, but overall a very good experience."
3118,MarkHend85,"December 10, 2019",5, Simple and effective. Super easy setup to begin looking for dates.
3119,Charlotte O'Farrell,"December 18, 2019",4, Great app but a but cumbersome to use! Tends to cut out like bumble! Good innovative idea! Website version would be good
3120,Alex Daniel,"December 20, 2019",3, I like the app expect two things. One I've never seen a app where you run out of likes. That I dont like. And two you can not send any pictures in the messages
3121,Alex L,"December 25, 2019",4," Pretty good, I like the algorithm better than tinder and it seems more creative with features to me."
3122,Bartholomew C. Berggren,"December 20, 2019",1, You cant set up account with Facebook to import your age. I set my age to zero and cannot login to set up an account. Seems very week backend for an android dating app. I don't recommend.
3123,Jaymes Sygrove,"December 28, 2019",5," Really good. Straightforward, simple and easy to use. Clearly designed to help you get the best experience possible."
3124,Marcus Ng,"January 3, 2020",5, Fast and easy. Doesn't rely on currency or a subscription system like other apps.
3125,Jake C,"January 11, 2020",1," Cant even use... Despite the fact that according to the app my profile is 100% complete, the app keeps telling me I can't send like because my profile isn't complete."
3126,Nicholas Downing,"January 14, 2020",4, So far so good. It's a grown up app that actually gets people to put effort in to get it to get something from it. Good job Hinge.
3127,Shanita Stokes,"January 21, 2020",4," It's pretty cool, being an adult and meeting and mingling is not as hard as it seems with the help of this app!"
3128,Shiva Shams,"January 22, 2020",5, Good easy to use interface. Starting a conversation is made easy.
3129,Thomas Superfine-Rivera,"January 23, 2020",5," Easy, and full of friendly intelligent people who genuinely want to interact on a meaningful level. Not a hookup app, which is refreshing."
3130,Carlen Caae,"February 20, 2020",2," Not much activity with possible matches , kinda boring."
3131,Dylan riley,"February 19, 2020",4, I will give it 4 stars because the app is easy to use and is full of real women. It lost a star because the majority of women are... plus sized.
3132,Yneill Twyman,"March 10, 2020",3, It works and easy to use
3133,SATPRAKASH,"April 13, 2020",4, Very nice app best guinmen profiles but some are fake but app is very nice
3134,Ramona Cuc,"November 20, 2019",3," The app freezes quite often, delays messages or sends them twice. The app itself it's not well sinked with the notifications"
3135,Felipe Doyle,"January 24, 2020",4," Hinge has probably been one of the more successful dating apps I've had. However whilst settling in, it takes a while to match with people. Nice UX."
3136,lisa jamieson,"November 7, 2019",2, Unless you're willing to pay you can't use it much and the advert to rate it is constantly popping up
3137,Amanda Patrick,"November 10, 2019",5, This app is far better than the other dating apps available. It's clear and concise and doesn't mess around. I especially enjoy the fact that it wants me to delete it.
3138,Christian Gilby,"November 11, 2019",5," Simple. Easy to use. And fast, great response from real women."
3139,Nick Blood,"November 13, 2019",3, UI lags and resets to the top when scrolling. Chat also makes you scroll to the bottom every time you open it
3140,Jordan Leslie,"November 13, 2019",1, Many glitches. Continues to ask if I've met my matches in person even after I selected not to ask me.
3141,Fionnan O'Mahony,"November 13, 2019",5," By making people put information on their profile, and having interesting prompts, you actually have a talking point to start with, perfect for someone who's naturally shy"
3142,Dan Rukavina,"November 14, 2019",5," Great app, easy to use, affordable and it seems the best girls are all on it."
3143,FLSx REBEL,"November 20, 2019",5, Love the layout of this app! It looks and feels like it was actually designed to help others find their significant other.
3144,Angel Taylor,"December 15, 2019",2, Used to love this app until it limited the amount of likes.. & took away a great potential match for me without me even clicking anything.
3145,Maya Jay,"December 30, 2019",5," I quite like how the design and how the app works. It's simple, clean, and easy to navigate."
3146,Jessica Crepeau,"December 27, 2019",1, I can't even log in because the code won't send to my phone and I dont want to log in through Facebook. There is no point in having this app if you can't even use it.
3147,Rodney Givens,"December 31, 2019",4," It's not bad, would like to be able to like without limits, and needs more access for free."
3148,Richard,"December 30, 2019",5," Well designed, beautiful app. I'm still discovering the features and don't know it it'll work out but so far it's the best dating app I've used"
3149,Tushar Mallick,"January 7, 2020",5, Been the most reliable app for finding someone nice. However can still suffer from the same issues found in other dating apps but thats more based on the users.
3150,Kristal Macaluso,"January 8, 2020",4," Like this app, but don't like the fact that when you start chatting with someone you can't go back and view their profile and pics."
3151,Cameron kendrick,"January 14, 2020",5," Love it, the woman are real and they suggest someone that you're most likely compatible with. Well structured!"
3152,Eric Ng,"February 11, 2020",5, Epic app with extraordinary results:)
3153,Hidequel Burgos,"February 23, 2020",5," It was amazing, In less than 24 hours I met the love of my life, I'm so glad I downloaded this app, thank you!"
3154,Allie Jolly,"February 29, 2020",5, It's nice that people cant get away with a blank bio. Love the set up
3155,Typical fan,"March 14, 2020",3," Still new to the app but so far, no complaints. I haven't run into a ton of guys who are just looking for hookups so that's a bonus!"
3156,Charlie M,"March 16, 2020",5, So far so good. The only thing I would change would be somewhere where I could write a few paragraphs about myself.
3157,Giles,"March 24, 2020",4," Better than tinder, app runs with no issues"
3158,David Sutherland,"April 2, 2020",5, Excellent site/app Very positive experience
3159,E W.,"November 22, 2019",1," Why are ""likes""limited? Definitely counterproductive. Very glitchy. Asks ""Did you meet ___?"" Every time i login. People i unmatched from can still message me."
3160,Philip Patnude,"November 8, 2019",4, Good content but occasionally glitchy interface. Worth the trouble and still my current favorite among dating apps.
3161,Charlie,"November 16, 2019",5," By far the best dating app, so much easier to have conversations and make connections. Hopefully it doesn't go downhill"
3162,Karina Fonseca,"November 9, 2019",4, Easy to use. Im glad it has filters and You can establish a communication for free.
3163,John Duston,"November 9, 2019",1, Cant get through set up. Tried the phone option but verification code wont send. Tried the facebook option and stuck in the questions because it doesnt have options to allow me to answer.
3164,Jennifer Gomez,"November 15, 2019",2, Even though the notification box is checked I still don't get the notification. There does seem to be a delay In the app.
3165,Daniel Belz,"November 17, 2019",4, It's not a pure swipe app. Filtering is a little bit broken. Fair user base.
3166,Manny Punks,"November 19, 2019",1," You get banned for no apparent reason, and you cant appeal. Also, the app is filled with people not in your area to make it seem there's a lot of people."
3167,Simone Thomas,"November 20, 2019",1," Location by mileage is inaccurate, shows people in new York when it's set to 10 miles away, have to pay if you want to do most things and can't properly match can only like their pictures."
3168,James Lewis,"December 2, 2019",4, A better model than most dating apps. A bit slow to load from time to time.
3169,Owen Hill,"December 3, 2019",4," In my experience Hinge is the best dating app I've used. I get matches at a higher rate and find that matches respond more often. Still lots of dead ends, but I think that is inherent to dating apps."
3170,Jordan Novotny,"December 14, 2019",4," Good dating app, more personal than others and your ""likes"" are more meaningful due to only have 10 free likes a day."
3171,Mattsfire1,"January 4, 2020",3, After a while the same people come up and I'll like the person each time and sometimes it takes 3 likes to actually get the match to work
3172,Hayley Murphy,"January 4, 2020",4, Good app limited likes for the free profile. Can only chat to someone if you match which is what I prefer. Enjoying it so far
3173,Kendrick Oveal-LEWIS,"January 10, 2020",4," Its a pretty easy app to operate. The only thing i haven't liked a little is meeting people from other states, when i put a mile preference on there, but thats not that huge of a deal i just pass on them."
3174,Matthew Clegg,"January 11, 2020",3," Seems like the algorithm doesnt just show everyone the prettiest people, which i think is a good thing, but you cant send people pics in the chat."
3175,Danielle Preece,"January 18, 2020",1, Locked out of app - emailed support three times nonresponse. App is glitchy and doesn't allow me to login with Facebook or phone number.
3176,Doc Massie,"January 21, 2020",4, So far I like it very much. It runs smoother than other dating apps and it's easier to communicate.
3177,Kazorax le Kaz,"January 19, 2020",1," When they say this is designed to be deleted, they arent wrong! This app sucks, 90% of the profiles are fake and you never get a response from a real person. Dont waste your time."
3178,Atro Serkkola,"January 18, 2020",4, Nice idea but the free version is so limited that I'll delete this. You can give a few likes per day and have only one like to you...

For one guy that it said I should really meet, his whole profile spoke only about mushrooms, I don't understand why they would think that makes a great match for me? They should remove it if it's not based on anything real."
3180,Katie Lovato,"January 30, 2020",2," Limited number of likes, cant view all my matches unless I pay. Meh"
3181,Brent O'Guin,"January 31, 2020",5, Set up my account in a few minutes. I was able to connect with quality people and set up a couple dates within a few days. I recommend this app.
3182,Isaiah McCall,"February 7, 2020",5," A dating app where people actually talk and meet up, simple as that."
3183,Matt Herbig,"March 1, 2020",5, Its just... different. The commercials dont lie.
3184,Matthew,"March 23, 2020",5," Great app, way better than Bumble or Tinder"
3185,Leonidas Isaak,"March 29, 2020",1, Worst algorithm Ever this site. Like really.
3186,Juan Gonzalez,"April 21, 2020",4, Way too little likes for free
3187,Brian Packer,"November 17, 2019",5," Decent app, feels more direct and personal than the swipe left/right apps, doesn't rinse you for cash."
3188,e r,"November 22, 2019",3, Looks like you can't upload pictures that are screenshots of yourself and there's minor glitches here and there.
3189,Darci Shockley,"November 23, 2019",5, So far so good! I do wish there was a notification sound for when you get a msg from someone tho
3190,Jon Davis,"December 2, 2019",1," What an absolute pile of garbage. Drains you battery and gives you 100s, yes 100s, of fake ads. Take a few minutes to google proper reviews on this dreadful app"
3191,Ryan Somerville,"December 6, 2019",4," Not a bad format, unique and different to other apps. Price seems fair too."
3192,Sjohn85166 X,"December 16, 2019",3, Better than the other dating apps. One gripe that I have is that the profiles only list a town. No state or distance.
3193,BIB Brothers,"January 5, 2020",3, Clean but filling up with bots and fake profiles. Also 80% of my options are pretty much farthest away that I sat my range to.
3194,Sheree Swanson,"December 17, 2019",3, I don't get push notifications even though I have them turned on. So when someone sends me a message I don't find out unless I open the app.
3195,Daniel Good,"December 25, 2019",3," Its very classy and unique even the totaly free option is cool but hardly any women reply, at any hour of the day, and I'm a relatively attractive guy so mabey if the filtered out non active profiles"
3196,Vincent Nguyen,"December 19, 2019",5," It is pretty fun, I like the feature where it says if someone likes you! Best feat. By far!"
3197,Mike Fortier,"December 19, 2019",4, Seems to take awhile for their matching algorithm to figure you out but commenting on other peoples profile is better than just swiping right.
3198,Jacob Hose,"January 5, 2020",4," Great dating probably the best one out there right now, the only problem is the time of year of which you use it could change your success rate."
3199,Jason Pineapple,"January 5, 2020",5, Good first impression are key when meeting someone. This app gives you the opportunity to do just that.
3200,Alexa Em,"January 6, 2020",1, Very Apple-centric app. Wish I'd known before I wasted time on here. Cannot do many things unless you have this running over iOS app üí©.
3201,Asare Asare Bros,"January 12, 2020",3, This app seem to have some serious bugs. It finds people miles away and people who aren't in your preference criteria.
3202,hazel nut,"January 26, 2020",5," Easy to use and the matching process has a bit more depth, people seem quite nice."
3203,Tyler Pence,"January 31, 2020",2, Needs an update for distance or something. I've got it set for up to 70 miles but it is showing me people 300 miles away
3204,Sabeel Kazi,"February 1, 2020",5, For now it's really good. Decent number of matches and quality people.
3205,Gojira Salad,"February 21, 2020",1, Takes forever to upload a photo
3206,Ryan Stewart,"March 4, 2020",1, Trash app banned for trying to sign up? How weird is that?
3207,Josh Gi,"March 13, 2020",5, Pretty happy. Good interface. Nice matches.
3208,Nishikant Sohal,"March 23, 2020",4," Great app, good interface."
3209,Ave Freidel,"March 28, 2020",5, Simple and easy to use
3210,Kate McKnight,"November 13, 2019",1," I made a mistake when entering my birth year, and was locked out of the app. I sent repeated emails as instructed and have not heard back from the customer service team."
3211,Sebastian Piccoli,"November 18, 2019",5, Better then the others and its free version is pretty decent. Much more intuitive.
3212,Colton Wilding,"November 15, 2019",1, Lots of bugs!! wont let you like very many people. It's not worth it. Needs to be free.
3213,Stephen Dunn,"November 18, 2019",3, It's ok at the beginning it wouldn't let me send lines because my profile wasn't 100% complete... It was complete I battled with that for about a week and a half
3214,bailey peeso,"November 27, 2019",2," Just like any other dating app. Not good, not bad, just some where inbetween that's makes you pay for more likes and other perks."
3215,Ryan M,"December 1, 2019",5, Best app so far for actually meeting people. Especially if you're older than the twenty something crowd.
3216,Travis Pastrami,"December 7, 2019",2," Good concept, but algorithms keep getting stuck and showing dozens of total 0/10 chicks in a row. Like unrealistically bad"
3217,Jamie Merkler,"December 26, 2019",5, Better than any other dating app. Significantly higher proportion of actually meeting matches because of features of they're product.
3218,mark pierce,"January 20, 2020",1," I wish I could give 0 stars, support is terrible they will not resolve my issue, I'm convinced that it never will be resolved. I think its time to move on."
3219,Paco Sanchez-Ray,"December 17, 2019",1, Unable to up load any photos that were not my Facebook profile picture. Tried from my phone and PC and neither will allow me up load any photos
3220,Mike Jakusz,"January 4, 2020",5," It's a nice app, I like how you can get a feel of the person from their questions they answer before setting up the account"
3221,Ryan Kelly,"January 7, 2020",3," Good app, but only a very limited number of likes available each day on the free version"
3222,George Bo Clevenger,"January 23, 2020",3," One of the better dating apps. But you can only ""like"" ten people per day unless you pay for premium services."
3223,Chicken Dinner,"January 31, 2020",1," Similar to bumble and tinder, except on hinge you have no idea if they been on or not.. at least with bumble or tinder there are clues if they have been.

Easy chance to be the 5th option to girl on hinge and have no idea about it. *another edit review, giving it 1 star instead, very delayed messages which is causing me to look not interested, missing opportunities, plus me having to asks girls when did they send/receive makes me look needy.* i am even a preffered member smh."
3224,Adam Guenther,"February 4, 2020",5, Really went in hesitant at first but really good and distinct so from others apps. Much more personable and relatable than other apps too.
3225,Adam Thompson,"February 24, 2020",4, Seems to work pretty well so far (used for 2 days)
3226,Alex Davies,"March 22, 2020",1, Crashes all the time
3227,Janith T,"March 31, 2020",1, How glitchy can an app be?! Your undo button doesnt even work
3228,L S,"November 10, 2019",3, Eh. App like all the rest. Maybe it's me but I get matches and will reach out but they won't reply. Most guys do seem to only want to fool around. Doesn't seem to have a great variety of men but idk. Not impressed.
3229,Devin Huapaya,"November 13, 2019",4, Occasionally I can't match my likes or send messages and have to uninstall reinstall... Otherwise nice people on the platform üëå
3230,Mitch Taylor,"November 15, 2019",3, The app is buggy. You press back and it goes in and out of the last chat
3231,SYNERGY Consulting,"November 18, 2019",1, Fake profiles with no verification. Waste of money. They need a way to verify profiles.
3232,Rache Bishop,"November 23, 2019",5," This is great, easy, simple and works well without paying a dime."
3233,Mark Basniak,"November 26, 2019",3, Nice app but I really don't want to see people who are 40 years older than me when I have specific age specifications set.
3234,Brennen Brooks,"December 3, 2019",5," The best dating app period. Someone likes u they pop up in their own category, you dont have to go hunt for them they're right there and u can start talking immediately"
3235,Dob Feldman,"December 10, 2019",5," For anyone wondering, it helps to put a special effort into your photos and your profile. This app will change your life if you work with it"
3236,Andrei Wasylyk,"December 10, 2019",5," Tried almost every app, this one is by far the best. The app has a sort of culture to it, it's really nice. less hopeless and alone than others hahaha."
3237,Alexis Mora,"December 13, 2019",5, Better than Bumble which can be wayy overwhelming with people that are just swipe happy. Gotten a few good dates on this app so fingers crossed!
3238,Plasbez,"December 22, 2019",1, Absolute garbage app. You need to buy membership just to change alternative settings that is free in other dating apps. Which is 90% of the settings. Don't install.
3239,Jus'ME LONDON,"January 6, 2020",3, Good ice breaker but shows the same girls more than once when you already like or sent message . Be careful that's it so far so good.
3240,rachel greene,"January 13, 2020",5, The flow of the app is really cool and doesnt force a match down your throat. Lol. Its legit.
3241,Edward Hector,"January 21, 2020",5," Doesn't seem to hide matches behind a pay-wall like bumble, tinder, and okcupid. A good free service.. Thanks Hinge."
3242,Epix Wheelz,"January 15, 2020",2, Like the idea. Wish I could start finding matches but I can Finnish my profile to even like anything. I can't upload photos to complete my profile
3243,Tyga McHenry,"February 1, 2020",1," ""Complete your profile"" to even send a like? Four pics isn't enough, apparently. Stupid app."
3244,Cameron Richardson,"February 7, 2020",3, Its alright. I need more preferences that other apps offer without paying
3245,Marquis Vasciannie,"February 12, 2020",5, 3 matches in a couple hours. Great experience
3246,Ceez Fernandez,"March 9, 2020",3, It's ok not to bad chatting alot but not enough dates

Another edit for those interested, I have been in contact with Hinge for 6 months (that slow) and none of my issues were resolved, stupid advice to restart my phone and delete and reinstall the app tho"
3249,Stefan Koenen,"November 14, 2019",5, Quality beats quantity. Seriously. Quantity gets boring. Quality is fun.
3250,Anthony Marsden,"December 15, 2019",4," Good app, though has quite a lot of old profiles on it if you are dating in remote areas."
3251,Thomas Kaiser,"December 1, 2019",5, Personally having been online dating for many years this is one of the better apps I've encountered not as many people but better connections. My personal experience
3252,Holly Wallace,"November 10, 2019",5, I feel like the caliber of men on this app are waaaaay better than most free dating apps. No weird creepers or unsolicited pics. The app itself can be a bit glitchy but is pretty good overall.
3253,jarrad ellis,"November 7, 2019",4, Really great! Love the people and haven't hit a scammer yet. Only wish I could send memes and gifs in the chat and filter for women without/do not want kids.
3254,Matt Marek,"December 18, 2019",1, Last update killed all my contacts and deleted my profile also app is alittle stingy compared to tinder before they want you to subscribe but I like the design and implementation
3255,Eric Sui,"November 29, 2019",4, Good app. Easy to stand out when no one else is leaving messages.
3256,Rowan Cooper-G,"November 30, 2019",4," A good fun app, well designed and full of 'real people'. A lovely human layout"
3257,William Griggs,"December 5, 2019",4," Seems to be much more effective at meeting people than other apps I have used, without requiring any money..."

3259,Veronica Dasher,"December 16, 2019",3," I actually love it. I'm only rating it a 3 because it keeps popping up with a screen asking me to rate no matter how many times I click ""no thanks"""
3260,Harprit Kang,"December 16, 2019",4," Depends on your settings you pick here. Once i found too many unattractive woman to my taste. Otherwise, this app is good in the sense it helps you create a profile template."
3261,KaRma Sutra,"December 16, 2019",5, No problems with app so far. Meeting a wide range of people. Great experience.
3262,Ana Cristina Fox,"April 23, 2020",4, It's been a little better than other dating apps.
3263,Tom Byrer,"January 8, 2020",2," Basically Instagram / HotOrNot with a few questions. Can't filter by age, religion, etc. Might as well go on Tinder."
3264,Donald Duke,"January 13, 2020",5," It's a fun app that's unlike any other dating app. It starts with connection and goes from there! There's nothing like it, and it works."
3265,William Lowry,"January 14, 2020",4, I would say Hinge has worked out well for what it is. It's a lot better than Tinder that's for sure. My only problem with it is that sex isn't a preference. I'm tired of guys coming across my feed even though I've stated I'm only interested in women.
3266,terri guarino,"January 17, 2020",4, Used to be able to set filters to refine your searxh for free. Now you have to pay and minimum charge is $20/ month.
3267,James Forsyth,"February 17, 2020",4, Very different from other dating apps and it's refreshing.
3268,Em Se,"March 8, 2020",1, They basically got rid of everything that made the app good.

3271,V Dreams,"December 18, 2019",1," Just like tinder, you match with girls and they don't want to message first. I've matched with a fair few and I just wait. This is 2019, we need to ditch that patriarchal approach of men always having to message first. App works well, users are broken."
3272,Stephen Ireland,"November 9, 2019",3," Overall good but no option to ""go back"" and some limited features based on gender"
3273,Corbin Johnson,"November 11, 2019",4," A bit buggy here and there but a good app,for the most part. Wish it could fix me being ugly though...."
3274,David Baer,"November 21, 2019",5," Very good features, especially for those who don't pay for premium."
3275,Byron Putman,"November 27, 2019",4, So far so good but if you're writing a review before deleting it kind of goes against its slogan.
3276,Jade Neese,"November 25, 2019",3, The app has a lot of glitches. It freezes constantly.
3277,Ibrahim Abunameh,"November 28, 2019",5, Really nice app. Forces you to be more thoughtful in choosing who to swipe on vs some of the other dating apps.
3278,Ace Spitzer,"November 30, 2019",3," While most are non-responsive, This app is at least not blatently virtual pimping. I'm actually trying to do the social thing, you know?"

3280,Will Davies,"December 5, 2019",3," Adequate. Very limited daily likes, distance settings nonfunctional, good profile building, less spam profiles."

They will charge you and then delete your account after 2-3 days, in order to prevent you from getting a refund through Apple or Google Play."
3283,Jordan Johnson,"January 5, 2020",3, The app works fine. Its much more involved than tinder or most other dating apps. Hasn't made it much easier to get a date but thats on me I guess.
3284,Tereza Chytilov√°,"December 28, 2019",3, The app is good but maybe too much pressure to pay for the app to be able to give likes and so.
3285,Loni Reneau,"January 2, 2020",4, The only complaint I have so far is the limited number of characters that can be used in answering questions and chats.
3286,Ash Aminy,"January 11, 2020",5, Gives more options for interaction so even if you have the personality of a potato the app gives you things to talk about.

3300,Meestar Youu,"January 20, 2020",4, It's coo. Got a few solid matches. Women are real unlike other advertised apps. They should purge inactive accounts every once in a while though.
3301,Will Taylor,"November 9, 2019",1," Asked me to rate so often that I couldnt even use the app. Ridiculous... there should be a ""go away"" button. This is what you get for being so annoying."

3304,Arthur Post,"December 3, 2019",4, Great at first but I think it wears off and restricts your communication with people you've matched with
3305,Michael Chapman,"December 9, 2019",4, Not enough likes available for non paying members. Also unable to pay for membership the app would not expect my Credit Card.
3306,Edger Ramirez,"January 4, 2020",1, It's dumb as soon as I logged in through Facebook after installing the app a pop out appeared saying that I violated rules yet I haven't read the rules and got banned after loging in so dumb I uninstalled right away. I don't want other people seeing your info then banning you from it
3307,Jennifer Sveska,"January 6, 2020",5, Easy to use. I like the conversation starters. Brilliant idea!

3310,Clarence Menezes,"January 15, 2020",3, Mostly a good experience. Some glitches with the app and messaging interface.
3311,Jeff Ward,"January 21, 2020",4, So far decent little annoying for the upgrade to keep looking but hey it's better then a lot who wont even let you see who matched if you dont pay so
3312,Jacob Williams,"January 18, 2020",5," I like the concept of commenting on the profiles you like, so it's not just another right swipe. It's a good ice breaker."
3313,Caleb Collins,"January 23, 2020",5, The format and framework of the app is pleasant! It makes interactions with others smooth and painless
3314,K L,"February 6, 2020",5, Best dating app ever uses so far. I wish they were more filters available for free nevertheless.
3315,Matt D,"February 10, 2020",5, Getting way way more matches here than tinder or okc. The limiting factor seems to promote taking action rather than sliding through hundreds of people
3316,Priya Patel,"February 27, 2020",5, Been good so far. Nice selection of people and more catered to what I'm looking for
3317,Santosh David,"March 22, 2020",4," Fun app, different from other dating apps that's out there."

3324,Soumya Suresh,"November 12, 2019",4, Pretty good app but sometimes the messages are slow to load.
3325,Daniel Nord,"November 12, 2019",3, It's kinda confusing at first and despite their promise I still have the app. So you can't help us all hinge. But at least I get more matches on here than other places so we'll see how it goes.

3329,Nash Georgiev,"April 13, 2020",5, 10/10 real people with real conversations. Haven't found a single bot yet
3330,Kevin Schilling,"November 20, 2019",5, Best dating app I've used so far. Leads to way more matches by letting you know who's liked you without having to pay.
3331,Stephen Hensley,"November 29, 2019",1," Can't find an option to turn off my profile for others to view. Obvious oversight from the ""devs"". One word to describe this kind of idiocy: trash."
3332,Gee Wiz,"December 19, 2019",1," Well I did like this app at first but now I've been banned for no given reason. I only reply once if I'm messaged with no reply. I don't stalk or harass anyone, and if I have nothing nice to say I keep it to myself. Their is no way to appeal and they don't even tell you why. RUDE. BOOOO üëéüëéüëéüëé"
3333,Tom DeBerardine,"January 7, 2020",5, A higher quality app than the big competitors. It's gotten better with recent updates.
3334,Eva P.,"December 10, 2019",1," Got locked out of the app because of a glitch, tried emailing their customer service twice, seems like it doesn't exist."
3335,Cathrina Gaussaint,"December 14, 2019",4, The only reason I don't give it a five-star rating is because the profile don't really give you insights on who a person is. It's too casual.
3336,matthew hunt,"December 31, 2019",5, Excellent app layout and three quote answers to get a better idea of the other person and personality by their answers
3337,The LinkWay,"January 5, 2020",4, Better Than Tinder. People feel more real and everyone is generally on the same page. Just here before it gets over saturated with bots and follow my instas üôÑ
3338,A Wheeb,"December 18, 2019",2, It's too slow. I would like to see multiple options and not just one at a time. I'd also like to see their age and location at the top.
3339,Ryan Plante,"January 8, 2020",4," Easy to use, works well. Limited number of users, but it could be very good if it gains popularity"
3340,Adrian Caramihai,"January 19, 2020",3," To show gratitude for the good dates that I get, I'll shoot 3 stars. But otherwise I have mixed feelings about this app. Something smells fishy."
3341,Jennifer Cash,"January 26, 2020",4," Great app to meet people. Easy to use, free portion works well."
3342,Kevin Gunn esq,"March 7, 2020",5," Amazing, I'm always recommending to friends who have actually been on dates I to have also bee a date from the app..."
3343,Yars Revenge,"February 2, 2020",3," Works perhaps a bit better than other dating aps, more streamlined. The entire exercise of online dating still sucks."
3344,Megan Kingston,"February 5, 2020",3," Good user interface, not a great algorithm for me so far"
3345,Vikas S,"February 13, 2020",5, Getting genuine matches... Nice app.
3346,vipin Upmanyu,"March 22, 2020",1, I already completed my profile but when I like someone then it shows complete your profile first to like some one
3347,Michael Bergeron,"March 26, 2020",4, This is definitely the best dating app on the market
3348,Karl P,"December 28, 2019",5," Great app :) but very limited amount if likes, still better than tinder though. If i could afford it id subscribe."
3349,Tim Bowerbank,"November 9, 2019",1, Very limited amount of likes per day and nothing to tell you if the account is active or not. Also the selection of people is pretty dire.
3350,Joe Wilker,"November 7, 2019",3, The app is ok and the profiles are of good quality but not many replies.
3351,alex wyatt,"November 12, 2019",4, Just a better formula for a dating site than anything else. It can be tampered with to still feel kinda halfassed but it encourages your efforts and makes them easy to conceive
3352,David Lee,"November 29, 2019",4," Great concept and function, just not many matches for me."
3353,Melissa St. Louis,"December 2, 2019",3," Even when connected to WiFi, the app glitches and doesn't load info."
3354,Nikki S,"December 4, 2019",4, It's a great dating app. The reason for the low rating is that people are still treating it like every other hook up site
3355,Alastair Smith,"December 8, 2019",2, If someone removes themselves from the site or unmatches then the entire conversation history + any association history just disappears. There is no provided explanation.
3356,Karen Krieg,"December 13, 2019",3," Pretty much the same people show up constantly. You end up liking people, don't match, and they still show up. So either they are not interested or not using the app."
3357,Jake Brannagan,"December 15, 2019",5," It's takes a little more effort than other apps, but I've had much better marches for it."
3358,Mr. Castro,"January 2, 2020",5, Great app. Intuitive and matches you with people who are compatible.
3359,SiahCj,"December 28, 2019",1, Can't even get into the app. The verification code is never sent. Emailed them. Let's see if there's any support to change this review.
3360,Ben Spiegelman,"December 19, 2019",5," Better than tinder, the matches are closer to what you'd actually want to find."
3361,David Rice,"January 12, 2020",4," Quick and easy to setup profile, searches for matches fit the criteria set"
3362,Ankit Shetty,"January 12, 2020",1," I have been flooded with fake profiles after the first few days....i don't Know whats wrong, profiles with just random pics etc"
3363,Fred Carbonara,"January 14, 2020",3, Keeps interrupting to ask if I've met the same person. Can't send pictures in app. A bit glitchy on android
3364,Ewen Jarvis,"January 21, 2020",4," Fun. A few technical glitches, but I am using an old android."
3365,Harish Phadke,"January 23, 2020",5," Simple interface, with people looking for something serious. Great experience."
3366,Jeff Werner,"January 23, 2020",2," Designed to be deleted, so you don't notice any bugs. I don't get notifications, period. Garbage."
3367,Ivy Cappaton,"January 25, 2020",3," It's the same dating app as all the others. Nothing to make it stand out. Have to pay to see people who like you or if you try to ""like"" more then they allow"
3368,Mohsin Khan,"January 29, 2020",5, Much better then most apps atleast you dont have to pay but not alot of people on it but I'd recommend it
3369,Jj Jj,"April 2, 2020",4, Update: They helped restore my membership. Great support. 4 stars because it still shows me alot of plus sized girls.
3370,Jhon Saint Paul,"January 29, 2020",5, I like how this app is not full of bots and your matches are actual decent people not just looking for hookups
3371,Kathleen Rosser,"March 5, 2020",5," Love the height feature,"
3372,Leonard Andy,"March 5, 2020",4," It is one of the best dating sites, I truly love it, hey guys you are going to love this site, I assure you, there is no problem with it??"
3373,Kranthi Kumar,"March 21, 2020",1, I thought it's for free Same like tinder after couples swipes asking for credit
3374,Joe Quill,"November 8, 2019",3, Decent app. Though it doesn't recognize when I click confirm and keeps sending me the same message
3375,Jesse B,"November 18, 2019",1, Tons of glitches everytime I open it. Unusable since the last update.
3376,Jessica Williams,"November 10, 2019",4, Cool layout for profiles. It crashes too often though.
3377,Erica Coca,"November 13, 2019",5, Easier and cleaner user interface. I don't feel stalked. Not bad so far
3378,Jonathan Bond,"November 18, 2019",5, Really easy to chat and meet people. Best app I've used so far!
3379,James Porter Jr,"January 4, 2020",1, I decided to rate one star because the app never fully load for me. I have tried every trick I know.
3380,Micky B,"December 15, 2019",4, It would ask me to rate every time I opened a fresh page. Figured I'd get it over with. Hopefully it will stop now
3381,Daniel Jones,"January 4, 2020",5, Better than others! I like how you can leave comments without matching. You know that someone will see your message.
3382,Thomas Lord,"January 7, 2020",4," Easy app to use. Navigation is made simple, the algorithm seems pretty sound"
3383,Lary Budnick,"January 9, 2020",3," Its vague, lots of questions & quotes , difficult to tell if anyone is for real , thus far not impressed with quality"
3384,Sarah Byrne,"January 13, 2020",2, It doesn't allow you to see your matches unless you pay which I find very misleading
3385,Charlotte SB,"January 22, 2020",1, Terrible. For an app that claims to try and set you up w people you're compatible with it's funny to me that every day my most compatible is not someone I could ever see myself with. Terrible algorithms.
3386,Chris Gavarian,"January 19, 2020",4, Not bad. Need premium though to really do anything. Only get something like 10 likes (per day?)
3387,James Brown,"January 23, 2020",1, Fairly terrible dating app. Constantly attempts to get you to pay for a subpar app. Allows you to put like three sentences about yourself. Generally just a complete waste of time.
3388,Go Irish Boston !,"February 2, 2020",2," Got decent matches but women are not at all engaged, ghost and zero interest in communicating offline compared to other apps or meeting a woman on person."
3389,David Loach,"April 20, 2020",5, One of the easiest dating apps.
3390,ilhan h,"February 24, 2020",4, So far so good. Refined app. Loads of people.
3391,Freddie Heather,"March 11, 2020",5," Great app, easy to use"
3392,MJ Rossetti,"March 28, 2020",3, Glitchy app but decent membership network
3393,Ana Rocha,"March 30, 2020",5, I like how the app is set up and I really like how it works.
3394,Kailash Chimbaikar,"January 19, 2020",5," It's a great app to meet women for dating,friendship, or a relationship. In these busy times when everyone is so busy, Hinge is a great way to meet women."
3395,Michael van Kuijk,"November 12, 2019",1," I had some great conversations going and now I tried to reopen the app, it asks me to log in with Facebook or my phone number. I already had an account... where did it go?"
3396,Bec Cushway,"December 10, 2019",2, Glitchy as hell baby. Also whatever algorithm is choosing these daily picks needs a revamp.
3397,Brandon,"November 17, 2019",1, Keeps asking if i met someone in person even after i press the don't ask button. And the app SUCKS at telling you when you have a message.
3398,Sarah Woodling,"November 18, 2019",3," App and messages are quite glitchy, but otherwise the concept is neat."
3399,Chris Albert,"November 19, 2019",5, Easy and clean looking app. Fun way to comment and meet people.
3400,Jake Pullis,"November 19, 2019",5, Better quality matches compared to other dating apps. Also just generally more enjoyable interface
3401,Daniel Larsen,"November 23, 2019",1," The updates really messed this thing up. I paid, but the app no longer recognizes that."
3402,Shirley B,"November 25, 2019",4, It's going ok it's better other apps other apps delete your site or block you or you can't verify yourself so this one hasn't given me any problems yet
3403,Joshua Hapcook,"November 29, 2019",3, Not enough matches before it tries to make you pay or wait until the next day
3404,Jason,"November 30, 2019",5," Best of all the dating apps, puts the emphasis on the users actually matching and meeting."
3405,Dan,"December 11, 2019",1, Waste of time. The radius is totally off. Settings are within 20 miles and I'm getting people that are 50+ miles away!
3406,Fyre Pixie,"December 10, 2019",5, Much better than other apps. So far I've met a better quality of men than the other dating apps where guys are just looking for a hookup.
3407,Jataura Brown - Riddles,"January 1, 2020",3, The app is okay but unless you pay for it then you might as well have something else as your primary.
3408,paintbing,"December 29, 2019",3," Response to likes (to match them) don't post and instead ""so n so requested you stay the chat!"" Gets posted instead. Terrible!"
3409,Justin Kaiser,"January 4, 2020",4, Makes it much easier to chat when there are questions to give you insight to someone.
3410,sam sattler,"December 28, 2019",3," If the messenger wasn't as clunky, five stars for sure."
3411,Katrina Russell,"January 7, 2020",4, Really good...but glitches a lot. So far so good though üòä
3412,Michael Reida,"January 10, 2020",5," Fun app, wish it would send notifications to my phone when a new message is received."
3413,James Salumbides,"January 12, 2020",4, Simple app. Easy to message someone once you two like each other. I just wish there eas more written about yourself... But I'll say this less fakers and scammers on here than all the other apps. I'll give it 5 stars once I delete the app...
3414,Kyle Gilbert,"March 19, 2020",1, I would rate 0 stars if I could. They have non-existent customer service and will ban someone solely because someone from another country reported them for nothing? Do not download this app! Save some data! It's been like 7 months and they won't respond to me even.
3415,Merle Dixon,"April 2, 2020",5, Informative. Best dating app out there.
3416,Mike F,"April 12, 2020",5, Great app. Had even better luck
3417,Quynh Do,"April 22, 2020",5," High quality, serious dating app. I'm impressed üëå"

Considering the circumstances, you would think Hinge would not charge during these strange times."
3420,libin mohanan m,"December 7, 2019",1, I paid for it and it was showing me suggestions according to previous likes. I unsubscribed and it shows me only profiles out of my preference. This app showed me a notification from 5 days ago today. POS
3421,Detroit ARTIST,"November 18, 2019",5," Better than Tinder. Less shallow, more ways to interact. Reminds me of speed dating - meets blog."
3422,Lindsay Villa,"November 18, 2019",5, Just feels a lot more thoughtful and intentional than other dating apps. Please the design is GORGEOUS!
3423,Wesley Collins-Arms,"November 25, 2019",2, Can't complete profile. I try to upload my last two photos and it will be stuck saving the photo over wifi and mobile network
3424,Joe Browning,"January 21, 2020",5," This is probly the best site and application, and can't believe i can message for free! i joined so i can text more. worth it!"
3425,Brian Marx,"December 10, 2019",2, First Day Fake Profiles The first 10 Discover matches were great. Then day 2 it's all the real people.
3426,Joe Masciovecchio,"December 16, 2019",2, Solid app but I've reached out to customer service four times using numerous strategies and got zero responses.
3427,Kyanne B.,"January 2, 2020",1," this is awful, I paid for a ""preferred membership"" and honestly saw no difference. I kept being matched with people WAY out of my preference (esp my age preference), despite accepting guys from a 100-mile radius. I want my money back."
3428,Terry Dipple,"February 17, 2020",4, App doesnt adhere to age and distance settings.
3429,Freyeesha Hall,"December 29, 2019",4," So far so good, nice app.. Like with all dating apps there are the fake one but you just ignore them.. Chatted to some genuine ones too.."
3430,Jay Quentin,"December 30, 2019",3, Needs to be able to upload audio and video through messaging feature.
3431,M P,"January 7, 2020",1, Used this app before attempted to try it again and giving me an issue for my age sent support 4 emails with no response horrible experience
3432,Brett Hogan,"January 12, 2020",2, Limited likes. Aka very limited. I'm down to buy a month.... But not for $20
3433,Kevin W,"January 12, 2020",1," Constantly stuck on date of birth screen. Scroll options default to January, then disappear. How am I supposed to use an app that requires an account, yet refuses to allow me to make one?"
3434,Jim Powell,"January 18, 2020",3, Very poor customer service EVEN WHEN YOUR A PAYING MEMBER!!! Difficult to understand features. Unclear how to use them Even is survey is screwy.
3435,Sam Midwood,"January 16, 2020",5," Far easier to initiate conversation with the questions and even suggests matches, on a far mor sophisticated level than other dating apps"
3436,Ashley Mapp,"January 18, 2020",3, Your matches disappear if you don't jump instantly which is annoying.
3437,Becky McCabe,"January 18, 2020",4," Different from your usually swipe left swipe right, pretty user friendly. Overall better than many other apps."
3438,OD,"January 24, 2020",5, What in the world? üòÇ This is actually so much better than Tinder or Bumble. No delays trying to find people and a significant value of their personality not based just on pictures. Heck this is the better dating app I have ever tried.
3439,Tessie dowling,"January 29, 2020",3, I don't like that I can't filter without paying but other than that is ok and seems to have nice men on it
3440,Sonya Z. Phillips,"February 2, 2020",3, Not getting much interaction. Would like to see more options.
3441,Isaac Newoton,"February 23, 2020",1," Proably the dumbest dating app in existance, terrible setup, uses extreamly vague criteria."

3454,Alex P.,"January 22, 2020",5," If you want a dating app that's less about casual hook-ups and more about meeting people, use Hinge. It feels like this app is the only one i've tried that isnt just designed to keep me coming back to the app."

Put in some good thoughtful answers into the questions and you might end up catching the right person's attention! Only had the app running for not even a week and deleted my account after that first date! I do have a friend who has tried out the app and he is not having any luck. He wishes there was a bit more options on the preferences.
3460,Valiullah Hashmi,"November 8, 2019",4," Well let's just say that in this modern life hinge may work, but it's like any social media experience - very rarely will you get to know a person through ""chatting"" with them on hinge."

3470,Bianca Houze,"December 15, 2019",4, Great app. But limiting likes is a terrible idea and prices are too high to upgrade
3471,Varun Prasad,"December 23, 2019",5, Great concept. Would definitely start to use when there are a lot of people to swipe on here
3472,Michael Chirgwin,"January 8, 2020",4," Slight technical issues, but lots of good matches."

3477,Saneha Dhanuka,"January 16, 2020",1, I have started using this app lately and every 5 seconds it keeps asking me for feedback and rating. How am I supposed to draw a conclusion without spending ample amount of time on the app?
3478,Car Greyhat,"January 29, 2020",3," It's an ok app. Not totally free, but you get what you get."
3479,Grizzly Cassells,"February 7, 2020",2, 5 likes a day is weak. App is still pretty glitchy

3490,Jonathon Hollis,"December 1, 2019",1, Way too buggy and glitchy. But you better believe the part of the app where they ask for your money is gonna work just fine lol
3491,ghoulishtie,"December 12, 2019",1, I've yet to get a single match after throwing dozens of likes+messages. I wonder if they're even getting them.
3492,Nick Tersigni,"December 23, 2019",1, Constant issues after most recent update. Can barely use the app now.
3493,Chris Golon,"April 7, 2020",5, Stands out from many of the other apps I've used!
3494,BeeZee Rho-Rho,"December 19, 2019",5, Way more fun and rewarding than Tinder. Without having to fork out money as well.
3495,Myles Morrison,"January 6, 2020",5," Easy to use, and discreet. Lovely layout, and plenty of nice ppl!"
3496,Victoria Gomez,"January 5, 2020",5," It's slow in changing the interface, but it's quite easy to use"
3497,ms misunderstood,"January 6, 2020",4, It does freeze sometimes but I am happy with my matches. It's better than tinder to me üòÑ
3498,Alex Hugs,"January 8, 2020",5, The app is as described. You can filter out incompatible profiles and find people who legitamately want relationships.
3499,Haneef Bowens,"January 15, 2020",4, Like all new things you try you are skeptical. But I've come around to giving this a chance. It's very simple which I like.
3500,Grahame MacInnis,"January 15, 2020",3, A nice app except it crashes regularly so patience is required.
3501,Shunaj Ajay,"January 21, 2020",5, Simple and easy to use. I found lots of beautiful women to interact with. Its worth the try.
3502,Marc Indelicato,"February 14, 2020",4, One of my favorite dating apps. Get the most responses here.
3503,Pamela Marie,"March 1, 2020",3, just started but great so far....like the concep
3504,Zachary Kirkendoll,"March 26, 2020",5, So far. It's very helpful and much better than the other dating apps

3506,Dhanish Seedhar,"January 27, 2020",5," Really good App, dating has been quite positive and it's easy to message."
3507,Michael DeTorrice,"November 11, 2019",1," The designed to be deleted is right! No responses from anyone, it's worse than tinder. Has bots on it that are hard to detect at first. Nigeria! No easy way to communicate."
3508,Outback Mai,"November 14, 2019",4, The constant ads are annoying but I think this a more genuine way to connect people
3509,Tony De Barros,"November 23, 2019",4, Limited without subscription. Quality selection of like minded matches in my area.
3510,Bar Fish,"November 27, 2019",5, It scrolls all the way to the beginning on your conversation. Other then that great.
3511,navin john,"December 17, 2019",1, Very bad. I paid for a month membership two days ago and it reverted back to ordinary membership after 2 days. You have cheated me of my money. Pay it back or return the membership.!! Going to take this up in court.
3512,Melanie Wolfe,"January 2, 2020",5, Best dating app! The questions help with knowing people and are great conversation starters!
3513,Pragnesh Upadhyay,"December 26, 2019",1," Doesn't let me login via Facebook as well as when i tried to login through OTP, it shows you are under 18."
3514,Savannah Crane,"January 11, 2020",4, Love it!! Besides running out of like so you will subscriber.
3515,Angelika Rosario,"January 12, 2020",3, With no real matching algorithm claims to have it be an app designed to be deleted doesn't make sense
3516,the one,"January 14, 2020",2," I mark the option that I don't want kids as a 'deal breaker', yet it continues to show me hundreds of profiles of those who do want children. All other 'deal breakers' are accounted for, yet this one is continuously ignored"
3517,Nathan Foster,"January 22, 2020",5, Better than all those other swipe this swipe that. Works for people that have little time and can manage a conversation.
3518,chickenchaser89,"January 22, 2020",5, I like this app a lot more than tinder or bumble. Seems more geared towards making real connections rather than superficial ones.
3519,Nathaniel Gibbons,"January 25, 2020",5, The fact you have to answee prompts and like specific things in the prompts gives a conversation starter that is always jard to come by in other dating apps
3520,Bryce Rhodes,"March 13, 2020",5, It's different than other apps like tinder and bumble. It's more civil if that makes sense.
3521,James L,"March 21, 2020",2," Takes like 190 people to swipe no to, just to find one I'm attracted to without a terrible af info."
3522,Christopher Patao,"April 24, 2020",5, Nicely designed interface
3523,Samuel Bokodi,"November 21, 2019",5, Bugs got fixed that were previously a problem. App works great now!
3524,Matthew Carpenter,"November 12, 2019",3, For grown ups. Great content and idea but buggy as all hell
3525,Mae Jay,"November 18, 2019",1," ""Designed to be deleted"" because you'll soon find out it's trash. Won't be long until they're asking for money. You're better off trying Plenty of Fish. Way better app."
3526,Meggan Winsley,"November 20, 2019",3," I think it is awful that, if you 'remove' someone they can still show up again."
3527,E Oner Mizzy,"November 25, 2019",1," 99% fake profiles with frumpy looking women at best, with plastic smiles wearing costume jewelry on extravagant vacations, in nice hotels on tropical islands, climbing glaciers, skydiving...just pure bs...üëé I open this app about a week ago, you can only see one person at a time which takes forever ...Full Review99% fake profiles with frumpy looking women at best, with plastic smiles wearing costume jewelry on extravagant vacations, in nice hotels on tropical islands, climbing glaciers, skydiving...just pure bs...üëé I open this app about a week ago, you can only see one person at a time which takes forever to browse. Recieved one like the first day and messaged a few times and suddenly she disappeared as well as our chat. Its been completely quiet since. You cant delete your photos when terminating"
3528,Johnnetta Johnson,"December 9, 2019",1," I was enjoying the app for about 3 days til I was banned I emailed the people and they told me due to violation of terms and sent me the terms.

I read the portions that could get you banned and I never did any of them. I replied back to them saying, well what violation they told me to protect members privacy , they dont tell us why we were banned. To keep Hinge safe. I was talking to about 4 people on there and they were actually cool and when I tried to sign in one day I couldnt. Worse App Ever"
3529,Shadrach Wilson,"December 1, 2019",5, Great App. I love it. Meeting new people and making new friends altogetherüëå
3530,Nneka Ebbe,"December 4, 2019",4, I like the questions. It's like I get to know their sense of humor before I actually get to talk to them. I do wish the likes weren't limited.
3531,Bobi Lukarov,"December 9, 2019",4, Its quite realistic and gives you some tangible structure of genuineness and great selection unlike the many other apps or tinder
3532,joseph illingworth,"December 12, 2019",5," Unlike other apps you continue to get matches after a month, no need to continuously reset"
3533,Tom Reuvers,"December 14, 2019",1, Can't even start a profile. App won't send a verification code to my phone number.
3534,Riley Patrick,"December 17, 2019",4," Great app, but they dont give you many likes before saying you must pay for more.."
3535,Alexandra Barr,"December 29, 2019",2, There needs to be a trial for the upgraded version so I can see if it's worth it before I spend a ridiculous $31 for 1 month of use.
3536,Rob Gilham,"December 28, 2019",1, Unless you use facebook to give them your details then it doesn't work. Waste of time trying to use an app that clearly was never tested or written properly
3537,James Donlan,"December 31, 2019",4, Better than the other apps because you can just say silly things and more likely to get a response
3538,Emmanuel Alba,"January 6, 2020",1," It doesn't show people in the same state after I put it in my settings, it is so random, it shows people from all over the country."
3539,Monica Johnson,"January 19, 2020",5," Very user friendly, which is good for first timers- like me!"
3540,Christian Costello,"February 15, 2020",1, Customer support won't respond above a locked account
3541,david pual,"February 13, 2020",1, Everyone I have talked to on this app turns out to be a fake account. They need a way to verify the person is who the picture is.
3542,Jimmy Gonzalez,"February 26, 2020",5, This app is great and convenient.
3543,Laurie Lavoie,"March 10, 2020",2, Settings dont sort what my interests are such as men 40-50 why would I keep seeing 20 year olds. üôÑ
3544,Samuel Panek,"March 21, 2020",4, Positive easy to use
3545,John Andres,"November 8, 2019",3," Despite using the filters, the app sends me profiles that wildly break them. Frustrating."
3546,Shane Rohrbach,"November 11, 2019",5," An app that skips over the fast swiping better, and let's both people pick out a like. I like it alot."
3547,ShortSyd,"November 17, 2019",4," Some limitations, but it's the most interactive app I have dealt with this far."
3548,Feroz Dhawan,"November 21, 2019",1, This app is very slow I am not Abel to chat with anyone and if I got the match then m not Abel to see them . this app shows me the same persons again and again even if I like them ... Please fix that problem
3549,Boricua Bella,"November 22, 2019",1," Worthless. Not only do the people on this app not respond, but trying to get a refund is ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this app. It's not worth the headache."
3550,Steve P,"November 24, 2019",5, Convenient and simplified to take some stress about the dating process!
3551,Precious Connor,"December 13, 2019",1, It's not really sending matches my way. Only people they suggest or think I would be compatible with. Its not very helpful
3552,Jeff Crump,"December 15, 2019",5, It works well but the premium features a bit extreme.
3553,J. C. Goodwin,"December 16, 2019",1, This app sucks because I supposedly violated the terms of service but they would not disclose what I violated specifically. As far as I known I was hacked. Not very helpful at all so I recommend another app.
3554,Clark Downs,"December 16, 2019",5, It's perfect if you just want to see the obese options from all the other dating apps in one place.
3555,Dmitriy Dotsenko,"January 4, 2020",1, Annoying app. It prohibits you to filter and like people until you answer many stupid questions. Deleted

The ratio of women to men on the app is also pretty low, so I can't say how successful it is finding same sex partners for other people but from what my experience was, it's not as common as other apps. There are open format questions that are good icebreakers which I appreciated. Much better than getting bombarded with ""hey"" messages."
3557,Hunter Greenhill,"January 17, 2020",4, I wish it wasn't extra $ for more swipes in a day. I don't like how dating apps hide more potential matches behind a pay wall
3558,Maria Morris,"January 27, 2020",5, So much better than POF. I think the quality of interactions are so much better. Met great people.
3559,ashley henry bradshaw-green,"February 2, 2020",3, Its a good app but there are a few minor issues.
3560,Samuel Paige,"February 16, 2020",2, Very buggy messaging

3562,Mat Z,"March 3, 2020",5, Great Experience! Deleted immediately
3563,Cory,"March 2, 2020",3, Location names can be ambiguous. A lot of times I have no idea if the person is in my state or the state over.
3564,Kristy Owen,"April 3, 2020",5, Great app! I have met some really great people!
3565,chris beutel,"April 13, 2020",5, The best dateing app out there hands down.
3566,gary belford,"January 6, 2020",5, I think Hinge is a definite cut above the typical dating app. The quality of people I have met is very high. It is easy to engage as Hinge does not limit initial contact very much. The premium price is also very fair!
3567,Ryan Oberfield,"November 23, 2019",3," its a little glitchy some times, messages don't get threw all the time. might be my os though"
3568,Andrew Ayres,"November 29, 2019",5," Pretty good. More engaging than other apps, imo."
3569,Edward Cowan de Bondt,"December 28, 2019",4," Good app, but keeps scrolling to the top of my conversations."
3570,Travis Guill,"January 5, 2020",5, I really like that it facilitates the conversation through likes. Just a good set up?
3571,Jamie Pierre-Louis,"December 30, 2019",3," Get rid of ""invite to chat"" feature--it's useless."
3572,Amanda Helfer,"January 8, 2020",2," My app is buggy, it closes and doesn't have the same features as iOS. Disappointed with the function."
3573,Willy Palomares,"January 20, 2020",5, Easy to use and many of options in how to approach someone you like...
3574,Arianna Mariella,"January 22, 2020",3," The only problem is the limited like, you need to pay after. I don't get the point, is a lot of money for a dating app"
3575,Marlon Furyan,"January 28, 2020",2, Search feature is horrible. I put in 3 miles and the results are from four states away.
3576,taken boa,"January 25, 2020",1, Its garbage wont even let me sign up due to facebook login issues. Ive tried everything and terrible customer service
3577,Farah Lubin,"January 24, 2020",3, Need to give more options to click on the like button. It should be unlimited

3579,sunil kar,"February 1, 2020",5, The user interface is nice and genuine profiles are there
3580,Paul LaRocca,"January 30, 2020",3, It's been slow not very effective. Sort of discouraging

3590,Roaming NJ,"November 25, 2019",1," A shocking procession of unattractive people. Compared to Tinder, you will see maybe 10% as many good looking people, and your money will be wasted if you upgrade it."
3591,Omar Bald√©,"November 24, 2019",4, Minor failures like sometimes with the messages or uploading photos or Instagram but is a good app. Fun and way more interesting than other dating apps

3597,JoAnna Enderle,"February 1, 2020",5, Its a great site. Just dont get your hopes up. Dating sites always make us feel less of a person but not hinge!

3647,Madison Arsenault,"January 12, 2020",5," I love the feature that lets you look at other locations, it's great for travel"
3648,Jon Barke,"January 9, 2020",4," The messaging system needs work, possibly add bitmoji or pictures share features and allow a small personal bio"
3649,Patrick Norton,"January 10, 2020",3, This app is decent but cluttered with spammers who are from other Countries trying to get gift cards.....
3650,Carl Armstrong,"January 13, 2020",4," One of the better dating apps, has less of the neverending sweeping feel. Glitches on messaging sometimes"
3651,Ben Mack,"January 23, 2020",4, So far so good. Free chat without the need to pay for premiums
3652,Anna Smith,"January 20, 2020",2, Would be cooler if you didn't have to pay for a membership. It only includes 5 likes or something ridiculous like that.
3653,Mariann Rusinak,"January 21, 2020",3, Unable to add certain preferences without paying which is annoying!
3654,Cody Rajski,"January 26, 2020",5, Great time. Doesn't make pay to use normal functions of the app. Nice edition to society
3655,Jonathan Ballew,"February 12, 2020",3, I'm giving it 3 stars because asking me to rate every damn moment is so annoying.
3656,Kevin Chin,"February 10, 2020",4, Not bad selection of ladies. Seem genuine.
3657,Tracy Doylie,"March 9, 2020",5, Very good. Really positive. Loving the app
3658,Joshua Smith,"April 3, 2020",5, If I have to enter my height. She needs to enter her weight. Save is both some time.
3659,Sarah White,"November 6, 2019",1, Messages aren't sending or receiving after the update; it feels like a total waste of money
3660,Cat,"November 12, 2019",4, Pretty good overall... Its what you make it and this app provides lots of options
3661,Mike Bishop,"November 12, 2019",1," Limited free, membership isn't much better. Choices are few..."
3662,Kyle W,"November 19, 2019",5, Doesn't feel like as much of a money-grabber as other dating apps. The ability to send a message after liking is nice to have
3663,Lavlesh Shukla,"December 2, 2019",1, Too many bugs. Does not run correctly at my OnePlus 7.
3664,Debbie,"December 4, 2019",2, Location isn't accurate and not worth paying for upgrade. Disappointed.
3665,Hans Jalloul,"December 8, 2019",2, Great but too much of a limited amount likes you can send before its blocked for the day
3666,Matthew Gabriel,"January 2, 2020",5," It's a dating app and inherently sort of weird, but it's a good one. Can recommend. Less skeezy than Tinder, more user friendly than my last experience with Bumble."
3667,Bill Patel,"January 19, 2020",5, Best dating app!!! The way it's setup helps you understand someone quickly.
3668,Brendan Rowinski,"January 16, 2020",3, Don't get many opportunities to match unless you pay for premium
3669,Jordan Cullen,"February 8, 2020",5, More effort on profiles makes better dating app
3670,Lou,"February 26, 2020",4, Have only just joined but am enjoying it so far getting lots of matches and so far they seem genuinely nice guys
3671,John Frueh,"February 29, 2020",4, Prompts make conversation easier.
3672,Orlando Irby,"April 5, 2020",3, Would be nice to have more than 10 liked a day without paying
3673,Jaason Haaber,"December 11, 2019",2, The site deletes your favorite profiles as you're getting ready to message them and replaces that favorite with an undesirable. It's a bait and switch. The dysfunction of dating on steroids. A non starter.
3674,Luis Ortega,"November 28, 2019",3, Easy to use! But too many old and unnatractive ppl here plus the distance is always off af
3675,A Google user,"November 22, 2019",5," Much slower dating experience than bumble, far fewer matches but better quality conversations."
3676,C L,"January 10, 2020",1, Requires 6 photos for no good reason.. if you don't have 6 good ones you're sol
3677,MoonPopCorn,"November 9, 2019",3, This app can be good but it's a bit glitchy and I don't like how it matches you with people really far away
3678,Perry King,"November 10, 2019",4, Very easy to Operate and all.. Would give five stars if the daily like limit is high
3679,Greg Gordon,"November 6, 2019",5," So far so good, easy to use and way less expensive than other apps"
3680,Stephanie Carroll,"November 7, 2019",1, The app is too basic. The paywall is too restrictive.
3681,Carl L,"November 17, 2019",5," Better than the other dating apps. People are more willing to meet. Even if nothing comes of it, at least you met and talked."
3682,Fatima Deras,"December 12, 2019",3, Like the layout sucks you can run out of likes. Especially when you findone you really want to say hi too Just trying to make money i get it
3683,Nivaldo do Alamo,"December 11, 2019",4," Good matching but poor app reliability. App keeps glitching, buttons don't respond"
3684,Patrick Baransky,"December 29, 2019",4, Better if you could see more then just one match before having to pay
3685,Cory Hogsett,"December 29, 2019",4, It's a good dating app that has a user friendly interface and feels genuine.
3686,Supamdl8,"January 23, 2020",1, Good luck accessing your PAID for preffered membership! Even better luck getting Hinge to actually fix the issue...
3687,Parker Steadman,"January 23, 2020",4, Pushes upgrading a little too hard but is otherwise a very clean app that provides a different experience from your typical dating app
3688,Infamous Echo Unreal,"January 31, 2020",1," So I decided to use this app just to try and saw alot of well out of my league women, so I thought maybe they are genuinely nice people.

Ya no you message one of them with my looks either you are blocked immediately or given a nasty insult and blocked or just mocked openly. Which usually doesn't bother me but when everyone of the women I have message are down right nasty and trying to sort through it is well difficult."
3689,ThatDaveGuy1,"January 31, 2020",4, Good but very little available as a non paying member
3690,Neil Agarwal,"March 7, 2020",1, App doesn't work on Google pixel
3691,Steven Lucien,"March 14, 2020",1, i Stopped receiving messages or likes from people don't even know why is that....such a waste of time app
3692,Sarcasma 19,"March 16, 2020",5, I'm glad you can filter based on whether or not you want kids. It's very important to me that I meet people with the same outlook I have.

3694,Jake Simmons,"November 19, 2019",4," It's the best dating app for sure, but man it's been glitchy recently."
3695,Shameless Sex God,"November 8, 2019",5, Having the questions in the profile add a personal touch and helps you actually feel the person.
3696,Alex CD,"November 6, 2019",3, Limited free experience. Just not enough to want to pay tor this
3697,Bourbon Derben,"November 21, 2019",1, This app crashes every few minutes. Very frustrating
3698,Jasmine Hill Retreat,"November 21, 2019",5, It's fun. It's designed in a way so that somehow it feels light hearted.
3699,Christopher,"November 29, 2019",4, User interface is great. I haven't met anyone yet but the app looks promising.
3700,Tia McNear,"December 3, 2019",4, I've only been on here for a day and I already like how better it is from the other dating apps I've been on. The set up itself is better and it helps starts a conversation. I hope I can delete the app as like it advertised
3701,Eamonn Doherty,"December 9, 2019",1," Only had one invite for a chat,have changed my preferences but had nothing,to be honest i am VERY disappointed with this site"
3702,Michael Smith,"December 14, 2019",5, The method of communication is really good and it doesn't feel like they're trying to screw you for money like bumble
3703,mantas g,"January 6, 2020",4, Many matches don't text back.. Or maybe it's only me hahaha :)
3704,Sophia Wilson,"January 7, 2020",5," Good dating app, Having questions of our own choice to answer instead of writing a bio really helps to break the ice"
3705,darren hopkims,"January 13, 2020",5, Amazing site. Way better quality dates then something like tinder.
3706,Jack Cooper,"January 22, 2020",5," Great experience on this site, and it feels a bit more ""classy"" than most others"

3708,David Noble,"January 22, 2020",1, Not enough users and the people they automatch you with are terrible. I dont know how people pay for this rubbish
3709,Marcie,"February 9, 2020",5, I like that you are able to comment and like each individual aspect of the profile.

3717,Greg Moulton,"November 23, 2019",1, Installed the App. Very limited likes before it tries to make you purchase the upgrade.
3718,Bunny Baby,"December 6, 2019",1," This app is ass. Before,you were able to see everyone who liked you without having to pay a single cent.Now after the update, you have to upgrade your membership to see who liked you smfh üôÑ"

I DID NOT POST ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE. You are just wasting your time cuz nobody is online anyways. TRASHHH APP!"
3723,Raul Gonzalez,"January 1, 2020",2, It's kind of complicated in a way Pretty much in needs credit card money again.
3724,Marjaneh Espinosa,"January 15, 2020",4," Love the format of how you interact with others. Does suck that there is a limit on likes, but I get it they want you to pay for unlimited access. It's a business at the end of the day."
3725,Brad Oberding,"January 15, 2020",1, Couldn't be bothered to get passed the sign up. Iv never had so many questions from an app b4 so it wasnt worth it to me
3726,Spencer Key,"February 4, 2020",5, It's like tinder without all the 16-year-olds claiming to be adults and blatant phishing bots. People actually respond too.
3727,Kayton marshall,"February 9, 2020",5, Better quality than tinder or Bumble. Less fake profiles
3728,Fellipe Z,"March 16, 2020",1," This app shows one impossible to get Instagram girl a day and the rest is just fat girls, fat girls far as you eye can look."

3730,Robert Highbloom,"January 18, 2020",1, Constantly deletes messages that I send when I swipe on someone. Makes conversations awkward when you dont know what messages they get. Edit 1/18/20: this still occurs.
3731,Vishal Vashistha,"November 8, 2019",5," Hinge is by far the best online dating app. It's a good mix of pictures and interesting questions. I have real, meaningful matches on Hinge. I greatly appreciate you taking the time to develop a good product."

3741,Stevie Wagonfield,"February 2, 2020",5, Amazing! Millions times better than match and POF!!
3742,shalini singh,"March 14, 2020",2, Why are people allowed to comment out to you before you match. Why is matching visible. Bad product design.
3743,Joe S,"January 5, 2020",3, better quality overall but still too many immature ... ya know- folks. hit it or quit it!
3744,Gamefreakfx,"November 13, 2019",5, I feel this app is much more Genuine. I've gotten tons of matches and have been on more dates here in 1 month then I did all together in most other apps.

3747,Zachary Tougas,"November 21, 2019",4, Buggy. Needs a qa egineer to fix it but otherwise better than tinder for sure.
3748,Danellboy,"December 30, 2019",4, Good but WAY too easy to accidently press no on someone.
3749,Mikie Hay,"December 17, 2019",1, No way to filter essentials like smoking and drugs on free version like competitor apps allow.

I've met and communicated with some really nice men. Meeting up hasn't always been so easy as there has been a few deferred meetings. Also sometimes you're contacted and engage in text exchanges and they just disappear with no explanation. I've had a few men who really only want sex. I have encountered what I believe to be two fake profiles and reported one. On balance Hinge is a very good dating app better than most.
3761,Philip McNally,"November 11, 2019",3, Fun to use but the daily free likes are severely limited
3762,Ryan Davis,"November 13, 2019",1, New update severely limits likes. Not using it as much anymore.

3764,Ryan T,"December 3, 2019",2, I have no idea how they did it. But you will get a lot of really good looking girls at the beginning in order for you to run out of likes. Then the girls will become below average. Haven't hearted in about 30 swipes.
3765,WonTon Soup,"December 11, 2019",5, Actually a good app. The only one with I've used with almost no fake accounts. Better than tinder.

3769,Tripleplay30,"December 19, 2019",3, It's ok thus far. I hate that an app intended for deletion requires u to upgrade for maximum use.
3770,MoT Hayden,"January 1, 2020",5," A few positive responses. Though, not enough space to write sufficient replies."

3787,Shane Mitrenga- MacIntosh,"November 15, 2019",4, Ive met lots of woman on line but have only met like one or two women in person. The digital social media is killing ths intimacy and its hard to find a like minded woman for a man such as myself

3792,Bhavin Shah,"December 25, 2019",5, Good app but after a certain point messages rent send or received
3793,Landon Melancon,"January 4, 2020",1, Meant to be deleted is accurate because it doesnt work. Profile is 100% complete but I still need to complete profile to send likes? Lmao good luck with that.
3794,Jasmine Graham,"January 13, 2020",5, Awesome app. Talking to a lot of girls even with the free app!
3795,Joshua Nelson,"January 16, 2020",1, It keeps prompting to rate every time I open the app. Super annoying
3796,DAVID BANKS,"January 18, 2020",2," This site sucks, the women are either fake pictures or to far from your location. And have to have Facebook or Instagram to connect."
3797,Opal Stayer-Wilburn,"February 9, 2020",1, Can't verify my phone number because I never get a code to do so.
3798,Yuca Fries,"February 8, 2020",1, This is the worst app for men. You will be scammed incessantly. You can never know the location of the person you're speaking to. You will make dates with ppl who are hundreds of miles away and you will be stood up by ppl who had no intention of ever meeting you. Beware!
3799,Monica Chadha,"February 15, 2020",4, Positive experience.. limited profiles above 50

3807,Nathan Graham,"November 14, 2019",4, Great but sometimes the app lags or doesnt load properly
3808,Klear Rock,"November 21, 2019",5, Very easy to use but I wish they would let you message more before cutting you off for the day
3809,Nick Jones,"November 29, 2019",2," So far no different from the rest of these cash grab systems. We want help finding someone, and you can not monetize love. Use is more a modern day necessity it feels. I mean really, limiting how many people you see in a day is pathetic."
3810,Hina Skye,"January 26, 2020",4, Good UI and features that make this app stand out from others.
3811,Tina Moutafis,"December 7, 2019",3, It keeps suggesting that I meet people that I dont have things in common with or things i dont like. Needs a way to filter sexual orientation.
3812,Bleiserman ADN,"December 30, 2019",3," They say so you can delete their app, ok, i get on there, like till i apparently run out of likes, now i am stuck with an app that makes me wait to like people, at this rate i am never gonna delete it, genuinely not enough likes available i suppose, great slogan but if you are charging make you to a...Full ReviewThey say so you can delete their app, ok, i get on there, like till i apparently run out of likes, now i am stuck with an app that makes me wait to like people, at this rate i am never gonna delete it, genuinely not enough likes available i suppose, great slogan but if you are charging make you to advertise that too üòê"
3813,Tammy Truong,"January 7, 2020",4, Great so far but limits on text and info is small.. üòä
3814,Yuri Yanu,"January 8, 2020",4, Solid dating app. Seems to have mostly -if not entirely- real profiles.
3815,Tara Rintamaki,"January 7, 2020",5, So far so good. Super easy to use. Happy that I am seeing new faces.
3816,Rochelle Hammond,"January 24, 2020",5, More serious than Tinder. Get to know people's personalities more and is easier to start conversation.
3817,Chris Glen,"February 2, 2020",2," I use/have tried all of the main/largest dating apps. Functionally, Hinge is really no better (or worse) then others on the market.

Functionally, Hinge is really no better (or worse) then others on the market. One thing that really stood out in comparison to the rest would be the female users. In my NY metro tri-state area, 9 out of 10 accounts are significantly overweight women and at least half of these are morbidly obese. So, if women who have to shop at Lane Bryant are your thing, Hinge is the app for you!"
3818,timberpond,"February 17, 2020",3, Great except limited likes
3819,Jinx Caldera,"March 4, 2020",1," It's basically Instgram. It lacks important content, like what TYPES of relationships people are seeking."
3820,Nicholas Halloran,"February 22, 2020",5, Using this and another app which will remain nameless. Have met so many more people here!
3821,Zoie Green,"November 11, 2019",4," Really easy to use, offered a free month!"
3822,Geoff Burrell,"November 11, 2019",5," I was getting basically no matches on Bumble, and Tinder keeps breaking. I have a steady stream of cute girls messaging me on Hinge, honestly too many to deal with. High quality problem, high quality app. 5 stars."
3823,Vladyslav Nepogodin,"November 12, 2019",1, The app feels incredibly dead and empty. Nobody responds either.
3824,John W,"November 13, 2019",5, Easy to navigate and best functionality of dating apps I've seen so far
3825,James Weiss,"November 27, 2019",5," Seems really cool. I just started using it, but the concept is very smart and well designed. I will have to see though."
3826,Siamanto Nazari,"December 4, 2019",4, Great app. Can do better attracting more users.
3827,Melody Alvarez,"December 17, 2019",2," Graphically clean, but not intuitive and no swipes makes it not free"
3828,Brett Meyer,"December 29, 2019",1," $30 a month or cut off after 5 swipes, pretty garbage for the lack of users to begin with."
3829,Gina Rose,"December 24, 2019",5, I like the prompts and how easy the app is compared to Bumble
3830,Bear Tactics,"January 10, 2020",5," Girls seem to make the approach more, every account is real, no Instagram girls just looking for followers. Much more real."
3831,J,"February 1, 2020",1," Constantly recommends people to you that it knows you don't want to meet, after you turn off your paid subscription it starts recommending people with opposing politics an life goals - having to pay to not see people who are politically opposed and do not share family goals is ridiculously manipulat...Full ReviewConstantly recommends people to you that it knows you don't want to meet, after you turn off your paid subscription it starts recommending people with opposing politics an life goals - having to pay to not see people who are politically opposed and do not share family goals is ridiculously manipulative, and not even subtle."
3832,Roberto Lima,"February 6, 2020",1," Just more one app made to owner win money, 0 stars for poor service. Why have a fake app that copies everything from the tinder? It is better to have the tinder then üëå"
3833,Joseph Varghese,"February 28, 2020",2," Bit dull, little to no responses."
3834,I A,"March 6, 2020",1, Random bans. No rhyme or reason. Poor service and app. Stick with tinder.
3835,Alejandra Ordonez,"March 12, 2020",5," It's a good app, fun and u meet great guys or girls through it"
3836,Mark Brien,"March 17, 2020",2," Early days, but not sure how many bots are here, seems a few."
3837,C Eberle,"February 1, 2020",1, People are never in your area. Likes and matches disappear when you click on them. They send them out once a week but it continues to say no likes yet????? REALLY?
3838,Aziz Mehmet,"November 10, 2019",3, I gave it a 3 strar due to not enough local matches even though I've set my preferences and still I get people who's too far what's the point of having that setting?
3839,sandeep jadhav,"November 27, 2019",4, Works well..a different interface..atleast u feel like ur on a legitimate dating app..haha..profiles are genuine and interesting
3840,Kelly Whitney,"November 28, 2019",4, Happy with the amount of use without paying anything.
3841,Jonathan Dinsmore,"December 11, 2019",5, I have to say I was feeling pretty tired of the popular dating apps but decided to give this one a try and it's a major improvement over similar apps. Give it a shot!
3842,Matt S,"December 29, 2019",2, Does not sync with Facebook properly and seems real limited.
3843,Farid Adam,"December 19, 2019",1, Paid for full service but it looks like I'm seeing only bots.
3844,Notorious G,"December 17, 2019",5, Best of all the dating apps women who use hinge in my experience actually want to go on dates and they dont hold back matches with wack algorithms if you decide to use the free version. Bumble and tinder are absolutely awful compared to Hinge. Note: this app is even better if you live in the city.
3845,Kendrick M.,"January 7, 2020",4," Lots of matches, good selection of people they are not fake"
3846,Alan Fate,"January 25, 2020",5, Actually got a lot of matches and no bots most importantly.
3847,Emily,"February 4, 2020",4, I like that you can control the distance within which you match with someone
3848,Evan McCready,"February 9, 2020",4, No dating app gets 5 stars but this one is surprisingly well designed and even I got 2 matches already
3849,Rishabh Chatterjee,"February 20, 2020",1," No Debit card payment,are you living in the 80's"
3850,Salon de Jessie,"February 27, 2020",5, I've had such a great experience with this app!!
3851,David B,"February 29, 2020",5, Intuitive and visually appealing
3852,Afolabi Mayowa,"March 12, 2020",4, Well its nice app getting to explore it more thank you!
3853,Samuel Matukonis,"March 16, 2020",5," So far its a good ""looking for serious relationship"" app."
3854,Brian Guerra,"April 1, 2020",5, Its been fun. Lots of matches.
3855,Paul Stannard,"April 3, 2020",5, So far so good no complaints from me although it's only my second week on here so we shall see better than alot of apps on here it seems yay
3856,Derrick Thomas,"April 15, 2020",3," Users are very superficial, not much different from other apps. Oh the users do seem to be a higher grade on avg"
3857,Hugh Rushford,"January 19, 2020",4, interesting...site keeps refering possibilities for me...very loose with connections
3858,M P,"November 11, 2019",2, A lot of fake profiles!! Very frustrating!!!
3859,StoryTime 2018,"November 28, 2019",5," Exceptional, within 24 hours, I matched with several people. I am super excited :)"
3860,Vanessa YA,"November 29, 2019",2, I signed up and was not offered a free trial nor was I informed on how it works. I am not pleased with this app
3861,andrew bolding,"December 6, 2019",3, They should add a body type for preferences. Im in shape and my past 20 clicks weighed at least 3x as much as me
3862,Wendi Watson,"January 17, 2020",5, I love how you can put your preference of what you are looking for. Great job!
3863,Joshua Glaser,"January 18, 2020",1, Buggy. Not letting me utilize social media connections.
3864,Omar Ogenyi,"February 15, 2020",5, Cool experience. Not bad ladies. I like the match effect
3865,Juhi Sharma,"February 18, 2020",5, Its gud app to connect with ppl sometimes it will nt allow to accept d match
3866,Wesley Fletcher,"March 27, 2020",1, Horribly bugged algorithm
3867,Mike S,"March 18, 2020",1, So far seems like a waste of time. not many attractive women after a couple weeks and those that are don't know how to ask questions. Oh and now my messages aren't going through....
3868,Shana Dow,"November 13, 2019",1, App need serious work! Won't let me upload any photo's. Fix immediately
3869,Daniel Arreola,"November 28, 2019",1, This app is not what it is advertised to be. Hinge should be called ‚Äúdesigned to protect catfish accounts‚Äù. This company does not believe in refunding money to unsatisfied customers!
3870,Eric Notkin,"November 30, 2019",2, Same people appearing over and over. No real value on buying the monthly service other than being able to send more likes.
3871,Joey B,"December 6, 2019",4," It's mostly good. Get an odd number of older women recommend, but otherwise no complaints."
3872,Shawn Paul,"December 11, 2019",1," So far this app seems to be for chubby chasers (which I'm not). I have to go through far too many fat profiles to get to an anywhere decent looking one, but that I have nothing in common with. I'm near Toronto, the pickings should not be this slim (or rather far from it)."
3873,Alex Wells,"January 2, 2020",5," People seem responsive to talking here, like maybe people are looking to actually date. I'd recommend hinge I just wish more people in our area used it"
3874,Robinson Ellis,"January 14, 2020",5," So far, much better than any other dating app. I have yet to come across a profile that is fake or soliciting."
3875,Hans Koehler,"January 17, 2020",5," Better than Tinder. I'm a good looking guy, but I never got very many matches on Tinder, on hinge my very first day I had more matches, and more QUALITY matches than I had gotten on Tinder in a week."
3876,Bill Whitlock,"January 17, 2020",2," Good in theory, but as far as I can tell very few of these women are actually looking for a relationship. At least the pretty ones (I don't message the obese girls. Sorry not sorry). Hinge has all the analytics, think it should kick girls (and guys) off if they don't respond to messages ever."
3877,Peter Conigrave,"March 27, 2020",4, It seems much more genuine than Tinder.
3878,Vishnu Singh,"April 22, 2020",1, Even Paid members will never get Match
3879,Justin Park,"November 7, 2019",4," Software is a bit buggy. I remove people, yet they stay in my contact list. What's up with that!?"
3880,Karim G,"November 28, 2019",5, New user and already several matches and communication. Interface is very friendly
3881,Atul Sale,"November 23, 2019",4, Pretty stright forward and optimum interface with better contacts
3882,David Bennett,"December 2, 2019",5, I've not been a member long but I already feel it's miles better than other sites I've used.
3883,Captain Planet,"January 21, 2020",1, Messages dont come through properly or at all most of the time
3884,Prithvi Karapa,"January 17, 2020",1, Keeps showings the same users over and over again even after swiping left
3885,ginally noneya,"January 31, 2020",5, Sooo much more elevated than the swipe left or right of these dating apps. Only been on good dates !!!
3886,Jason Sullivan,"March 2, 2020",4, Easy to navigate
3887,Shenique Lipman,"March 7, 2020",3, It's pretty good so far some pretty good-looking they seem established for the most part
3888,Keven Vaughn,"March 8, 2020",5, Pretty straight forward and interesting people
3889,Riley B,"April 17, 2020",1, Spams me for a rating.
3890,Michael Farris,"December 12, 2019",1," App decided to spontaneously delete my profile, including all of my matches. Very disappointing, would not recommend."
3891,Sasha Morales,"November 6, 2019",1, The app won't even let me get past the verify number portion.
3892,Katherine Dendtler,"November 11, 2019",2, So glitchy. Messages often don't go through
3893,Annaliese w,"November 19, 2019",5," Good profile lay out, makes it more interesting! Liking it a lot"
3894,Aimee Mattson,"November 30, 2019",3, The app would be better if it didn't limit how many likes you getr per a day on the free version.
3895,Nicola Cummings,"December 8, 2019",5, I really like that this app feels more private as you can't see online status.
3896,Jena Cochran,"December 9, 2019",2," It's a typical make you pay to ""upgrade‚Äù app. Not impressed with it at all..."
3897,Peter Geisheker,"January 3, 2020",5," Just started using the app and I'm getting far more matches than I did on Tinder and Bumble, and so far they are all real profiles."
3898,Elsie Aponte,"February 14, 2020",4, Better than Tinder. I'd recommend to anyone who wants a relationship rather than a hookup.
3899,Odiseas Papasoglu,"February 29, 2020",3, Too many outdated profiles
3900,Clara Molina,"March 22, 2020",5," Easy to used, best dating app I've tried."
3901,Clifford Ross,"March 28, 2020",4, I like that I can instantly message. Don't like how I came see all my likes
3902,U_gonnaLearnToday Lol,"April 7, 2020",5, easy to use and you'll I can connect with people based on their pictures great idea
3903,linda bradie,"April 2, 2020",3, Fun but mostly for the young
3904,Kevin Doherty,"November 20, 2019",1," Does not work, even with the 11/19 update, on my Galaxy s8"
3905,Alejandro Carvajal,"November 26, 2019",5, Best app I've found yet. I really appreciate the approach to these profiles and it seems the guys on here really are looking for a relationship.
3906,Rance Cannon,"January 3, 2020",5, Wonderful and unique! Best dating site today hands down.
3907,Sharon Marie,"December 27, 2019",4," So far, I love a lot about the app but limiting the amount of likes a person can do is kind of ridiculous imo"
3908,Mohammed,"January 8, 2020",5," Genuine people and it's user friendly , so far so good and thats the free service ..."
3909,Andrea Monteiro,"January 12, 2020",4," Loving the app thus far, easy to use and straight forward!"
3910,Marlon Bradshaw,"February 2, 2020",5, Great simplicity with the usage of the app!
3911,Xander Reavis,"February 6, 2020",4," Sometimes its hard to use, wish I didnt have to pay for everything tho"
3912,C Chima,"March 14, 2020",5, Amazing app. Best dating app out there.
3913,Mark Spera,"March 15, 2020",5," Meeting quality people, love it."
3914,Kelby Mcintosh,"November 13, 2019",3," It still has a few bugs, but its still a good experience"
3915,Brandy Dean,"December 3, 2019",5, Very easy to use and love that messaging is free
3916,David Anderson,"December 15, 2019",4, Its perfectly usable without being anything exceptional. Have fun.
3917,Tyler Maguire,"December 19, 2019",4, Great app!!! Only needs weight limit preference....lmao....seriously.
3918,Luke Whalen,"January 12, 2020",5, Best dating app I've used. Way more in-depth than the standard swipe and match.
3919,Joh Joh,"January 21, 2020",4," Really solid app, no hidden fees or BS charges."
3920,Will Barefoot,"February 9, 2020",4," Its a good app, and simple to use."
3921,Christine Chevalier,"February 12, 2020",4, Good but limited.
3922,Brian Woods,"February 17, 2020",5, It's been great. Best dating app I've ever used
3923,Nomi R,"February 24, 2020",1, Another money hungry waste of time app which gives u barely 10 likes and forces u to go through all this bullshitt of filling out ever unneccesary form.
3924,James,"March 10, 2020",1, Cant even log in to the app
3925,Lixnette Marrero,"March 31, 2020",3, So far so good...just a bummer you gotra pay for everything ob here..crazy
3926,Nick Moyer,"April 6, 2020",3, Interface is good. The ladies around my area though...
3927,Beth Grffin,"January 19, 2020",3, I redownload this app after taking a break for about a year only to find that I get 10 likes a day? Also kind of silly that I can't filter out much. I don't want children but all I get is men who want kids. Not real impressed.
3928,Seth,"December 21, 2019",2," I've been using Hinge since around the beginning, and I've never gotten a match, also, your prices are way to high"
3929,Daniel Eguina,"November 18, 2019",1, Messages are terrible at getting through. I like the concept but if I'm not getting messages what good is it?
3930,dukesinhell,"November 22, 2019",4, Okay so far seems to be very demographic specific. Also the algorithm is even more so. But people are friendly
3931,Adam Barton,"January 23, 2020",5, Pretty good to be fair. Way ahead of tinder and it's free which is an absolute bonus.
3932,Joe Machado,"January 18, 2020",3," So, if you designed the app to be deleted, then why is your subscriptions set up by months?"
3933,Andrew Mills,"February 2, 2020",5, Easy to use and to chat to people.
3934,David Concepcion,"February 29, 2020",5, I must say I feel like the matches are really quality
3935,Jess Brown,"March 23, 2020",5," Great app, good to socialise"
3936,Zey - Kon,"April 4, 2020",1, Please allow filter change for race. Spending more time swiping left of hood rats than I do sleeping.
3937,Sam Thew,"November 19, 2019",5, Really great dating app. Its very easy to use.
3938,Brian Grant,"November 9, 2019",5, Actually pretty good. Way more personal and much better matches than Tinder or Bumble
3939,Neil Scaturchio,"November 20, 2019",4," Seems to work well so far, people seem legitimate as far as I know so far, let's see though."
3940,Christopher Holstrom,"November 26, 2019",3, It's not bad for a free app. Not a fan of the limited daily likes but as I said before it's free
3941,Kevin 7,"December 11, 2019",4, Better than tinder imo. I'd give it a 5 if it was better at actually showing you people in your area. Some of the people are from the other side of the country even if yoy set it to 30 miles or something short.
3942,Jesse Lee,"December 16, 2019",4, The best dating app with less nonsense than usual. How refreshing!
3943,Camille Alfaro,"December 15, 2019",4," Wish has option to put pronouns and little bit more info about ourselves, but overall it's a cute app and it's my main dating app"
3944,Gentle Gemini,"December 21, 2019",1," No verification code after I put my number in. I've checked making sure my number is correct, got another sent. NOTHING."
3945,Meghan Kiernan,"January 13, 2020",4, I like that there is not a way to send/recieve images on the app. =)
3946,Denver P.,"February 27, 2020",5," Excellent stuff, well engineered app üôÇ"
3947,Kenneth McGuire,"January 21, 2020",4, It all depends on the quality of people you have that have also downloaded the app. This one is pretty good.
3948,Jake Hamilton,"November 21, 2019",1, App wont send notifications but maybe one out of 5 msgs . not very many matches etc
3949,Zach,"November 27, 2019",1, This app is a complete and utter joke. I'm pretty sure all the profiles on here are fake and the amount of likes that you get are very very minimal. This is nothing but a waste of time do not bother.
3950,C. Franklin,"December 9, 2019",4, Notifications and messages don't always show up or if they do they are out of order.
3951,austin curran,"February 11, 2020",5," Like tinder but not bad. Its actually a really good app, i wish more people knew about it"
3952,Ben Cotter,"January 4, 2020",4, Slow but eventually kinda meaningful connections.
3953,Adam bosworth,"December 23, 2019",3, Would be good if Instagram actually linked and didn't send me in an infinite loop of signing in.
3954,Casey Holmes,"January 12, 2020",4," Runs out of likes too quick, otherwise pretty good app."
3955,Diego Opalka,"January 13, 2020",5, I think this over other apps because it has more friendly feeling then other fasting sites. Feel like I'll actually find someone looking for a long lasting relationship rather then a fling
3956,Rosemary Neigenfind,"January 17, 2020",4, Good filtering options but less freedom with bio information
3957,Marel Montes,"January 26, 2020",5," DIfferent to any other datting app, flexible and cheaper than others."
3958,Danielle Stoton,"January 29, 2020",1," It's just like all the rest of the dating app's, never heard so much rubbish about there intention being to delete this!"
3959,Mohammed Ghalayini,"February 4, 2020",5," Not that love should be statistically assessed but Hinge seems to have a pretty good match and response rate. The comment function means that people often go beyond a simple, and boring swipe to leave a meaningful/thought provoking comment that spurs conversation"
3960,Elena Novello,"March 4, 2020",4, Specific and not time wasting
3961,V S,"March 24, 2020",1, Deleted my account for no reason whatsoever having bought a 1m membership this is entirely UNFAIR!! Will be complaining to relevant authority
3962,Vikky Trevino,"April 2, 2020",4, A little slow but works
3963,Craig Reynolds,"November 11, 2019",1, App is good. Being constantly asked to rate it is bloody annoying
3964,Genevieve Mummery,"November 19, 2019",2, Annoying that they took away features that were free before
3965,Jody Levenson,"December 3, 2019",5, Very great dating app you pick the woman you like if they text message you back then at least you can see they like you... Easy to use... Great app very beautiful women on here... Thanks
3966,peace van,"December 11, 2019",4, I had pretty good experience with app. I have had success talking to people in this app. But I don't know if one of them will lead me to delete this app.
3967,Jarod Lennon,"January 1, 2020",1, Have a bug that reset my date of birth to 2019 so now I can't use the app and the customer service isn't doing anything
3968,nube negra,"January 4, 2020",1, Filled with fake profiles. No responses expensive and limiting.
3969,sugata das,"January 28, 2020",3, Your site would be a more effective if there was more detail in the profiles
3970,David Martin,"February 19, 2020",1, Banned for no reason since a year ago almost. Still not unbanned. Any snowflake can obviously ban you for no reason if they don't like you. Great stuff.
3971,Andrea Henriquez,"April 22, 2020",5, Best dating app compared to the rest!!
3972,Rob Garneau,"November 25, 2019",4, No way to look through all the people who said they like you to decide who you want to respond to first unless you pay for premium plan. No undo of accidental deletion.
3973,ankit manocha,"November 20, 2019",2, Very less likes and very expensive to buy it's subscription
3974,Andrew Woolley,"December 12, 2019",1," Can't get past the ""who do you want to date?"" section. It's just blank."
3975,jack jill,"January 4, 2020",5, Fantastic and I'm sure everyone would love it as they start exploring.
3976,Fiddy Tesla,"January 19, 2020",4, Good concept loses one star for gps accuracy out by many nautical miles.
3977,Lucero Cas,"January 24, 2020",5," Best dating app out there! Still single because I'm picky, but this app provided the most dates and responses."
3978,Andy Jeffs,"January 31, 2020",5, Actually speaking to real people and getting a chance to learn about each other. I get the feeling other apps are full of fakes given the difference in attention on this one.
3979,Spiritual Vibrations,"February 20, 2020",1, Account was banned for no reason at all. Don't waste your time !
3980,Adam Brooks,"April 22, 2020",5, Good quality matches!
3981,Vladimir Chouloute,"December 3, 2019",3, Sucks that they limit your likes. But i like that you can comment on your likes as a sort of an ice breaker. But limiting likes suck.
3982,Matthew Garcia,"November 17, 2019",5, Good dating app. I like the ability to like specific things over a general like vs dislike
3983,Krissy Goines,"November 13, 2019",3, Sometimes my like and matches dissapear then the app shuts down please fix this
3984,Mike Weber,"November 16, 2019",1," I cant pick who i want to date, its blank, so i cant pick who i want to date. 3rd question in. So this app is useless till someone fixes it, i touch the question and it crashes or minimizes whixh is odd"
3985,LIZ MARTINEZ,"November 30, 2019",5, It's been great so far. I'd like unlimited likes though.
3986,John Dalby,"December 20, 2019",5," Meeting and talking to plenty of women. Still haven't found the one, but that's going to take time. A good app for openings"
3987,Stacie Barton,"January 4, 2020",4, Feels like people who are actually looking to date versus some other apps. Never done dating apps before but this is the one I would recommend to start!
3988,Big Cat,"January 16, 2020",2, Slow navigation while browsing. Limited likes per day.
3989,Giffo 13,"April 11, 2020",1," If you have try to have a civil conversation wth a liberal about politics and they report you, Hinge will ban you from their app for being conservative. I've been trying to get a refund for my membership for 2 weeks now. Hinge customer service will not help. Negative stars if I could."
3990,margaret pudo,"February 11, 2020",5, My experience in this app is good its fun meeting new people and im happy
3991,Samy Productions,"February 2, 2020",2, Much less you can do than other apps. And ¬£19 for a month? üòÇ Yeah no thanks

3993,Matt Landrigan,"March 4, 2020",5, I've never had an easier time finding someone that works with who I am with this app. I recommend it to all my friends looking for their person and I will continue doing so for as long as I live.
3994,J welsh,"November 19, 2019",1," I had set it up to people 20 miles away, and it still won't work right. I'm still linking with people in California, or Texas. Also it seems like I like 5 people then it switches to making me pay money for more likes."
3995,adolfo alvarez,"December 13, 2019",5, Amazing app! Really consistent and good matches!
3996,Justin Herbst,"December 15, 2019",1, Doesn't follow the distance setters when searching for people.
3997,Euler S S Ferreira,"December 19, 2019",5," I don't used that much this app, but I just wanted to give a 5 start because the app is annoying me to do it !"
3998,Victor Gutierrez,"December 29, 2019",4, Lots of fake accounts but when you find a real person it tends to work well
3999,Michael Salgado,"December 22, 2019",1," So i downloaded this app and i put i my phone number so it could send me the code to log in but it doesnt send me the code, i dont have facebook so i cant log in that way. Ive unistall and reinstall the app but nothing"
4000,Jerome Moore,"January 14, 2020",4, Not met anyone yet but lots of chats. Encourages you ro slow down instead of flicking left and right rapidly.
4001,anirudh mishra,"January 18, 2020",1, It shows the same profile even you have swiped left or cancelled.
4002,Darrick O'Day,"February 9, 2020",5," Good app, slower easier to connect"

4005,Ashley Long,"November 28, 2019",3, My only complaint is that my dream man messaged me and the app didn't send the notification. He sat in my inbox for 3 months üôÑ
4006,Adrian Zugaj,"November 22, 2019",4," Good app in it's model, but can be quite buggy"
4007,Dominic Re,"December 26, 2019",1, Absolutely absurd. Worst darting app ever. You'll see what I mean.
4008,Metehan Aƒüaca,"December 26, 2019",5, A more personal dating app allows for better connections.
4009,Jason Tate,"February 2, 2020",5," Within the first 48hours I was talking to people about hobbies, video games and love. Great app!"

4011,Sherah Dill,"January 29, 2020",4, I think it's a decent app. Seems like better quality of people also. I wish there was a way to put your body type.
4012,The Clouded Barber,"February 16, 2020",4," Pretty good so far, lots of connections üôÇ"

4015,Grayson Maxwell,"March 8, 2020",5, Great app. Feels more legit than tinder.
4016,Tom Evans,"March 23, 2020",2, I type out a reply to a like and it doesnt go through
4017,Shayna D,"November 7, 2019",1, Terrible! Literally the only dating app out there that blurs out every single person.....I don't get it. Why offer a free version if you literally get nothing from it lol. Deleted.
4018,Ben Swannack,"November 9, 2019",1," Lots of bugs, makes it very annoying to use"
4019,Steven Ramsay,"December 5, 2019",4, It's been decent so far but the app itself crashes ALOT unfortunately
4020,Cammie x,"January 3, 2020",1," Didnt make it past ""who do you want to date"". Even after rebooting the app, and my phone entirely."
4021,Jennifer Foster,"January 17, 2020",4," Good, easy, I like the details and the prompt questions"
4022,Matthew Bilner,"January 18, 2020",4, Not as much activity as other apps but better responses. People actually seem interested.
4023,Paige Boivin,"January 19, 2020",4, This app is fine. I'm doing this review so it stops asking me to review. Thanks for reading love u.
4024,Jessee Arnold,"January 31, 2020",1," No one talked or sent me anything for two weeks only messages I got were from hookers selling themselves, yeah the app is meant to be deleted because you will never find anyone on it and uninstall it to look for another dating app."
4025,mona dwight,"February 27, 2020",5, Better quality people who are more serious about dating and finding the one than most apps
4026,Nick Sultana,"November 23, 2019",1, More like cringe and barely getting any follow ups from the repeating listings.
4027,Marcus Hughes,"January 22, 2020",1, Got banned for no reason at all. I was on military leave (2 months in) when I was banned. Bumble and Tinder will always be better in all regards. At least they treat their users like they actually exist.
4028,C R,"November 11, 2019",4," Good platform, prices a bit steep."
4029,Renee Alden,"November 17, 2019",3," I have talked to some people but never was asked to meet yet, so cant help but wonder if they are real profiles. Also I have my age filter set but I get a lot of guys that are 21 to 35 that are interested and anyone really under 35 is way too young."
4030,Scott Olsen,"November 14, 2019",1," Canceled the app in Google play store. Checked several times to make sure it canceled, but it still took my money out. This is not right. Robbery!!"
4031,tx1 G,"November 21, 2019",5, Great app. A lot better than that famous other swiping app.
4032,Jonathan Henman,"November 23, 2019",1, Messages are sent to the wrong matches!
4033,Jake Israel Herman,"January 6, 2020",5," Great user experience, lots of quality matches. Far nicer than using tinder."
4034,Yancheng Zeng,"January 1, 2020",4, Interface is modern and easy to use
4035,Asuna Yuuki,"December 28, 2019",2, Haven't gotten a like yet not sure it's my problem or something wrong with the app.
4036,Gordon Thomas,"January 18, 2020",4, Lots of users. It has a nice simple interface and is fun to use
4037,Taylor Ellison,"February 18, 2020",5, This app is great for letting me know how unattractive I am!
4038,Michael Boyle,"March 6, 2020",5, Much better than other dating apps as you like specific things about people rather than just vapid judging
4039,Tina,"April 20, 2020",5, Easy to join. Fun!
4040,Quoc Dat Nguyen,"November 10, 2019",4, There was no notification when someone sends me messages. Good icebreaker for conversation though.
4041,Katherine French,"November 12, 2019",5," Simple interface, has good potential."
4042,Scott Smulski,"November 17, 2019",4, Solid ap all-around. Easy to use.
4043,Chris Ingram,"November 20, 2019",5, A great dating app aimed at meaningful connection.
4044,Mehul Ghorawat,"November 25, 2019",5, Nice app does has a few spams but hell of a lot better than most of the dating apps
4045,Alexander sztendera,"December 7, 2019",5, You have a dating app that shows you who likes you and you can like them back without paying for premium. Why not get it.
4046,Trent Struttmann,"December 12, 2019",5," Absolutely the best dating app I've ever used. Quality people, at least in my area."
4047,Michael Berra,"December 30, 2019",4, Good app. Plenty of matches compared to something like tinder
4048,JK Films,"January 7, 2020",5, Better and more serious when it comes to making a connection.
4049,Dan Barnett,"January 24, 2020",5," Alot of effort goes into designing any app. This is a goodie, well done guys üòä"
4050,Justine Klavon,"January 24, 2020",4," It's great for what it is, but you have to pay for unlimited use"
4051,Tessa Bitterman,"February 3, 2020",4, Wish you could swipe instead of click for a like/dislike.
4052,Colin Madsen,"March 30, 2020",5, So hot right now. Good format.
4053,Matthew Hughes,"November 17, 2019",3, Still a lot of ppl flaking. Makes these apps a painful and damaging to confidence. There needs to be a way to incentivise ppl to reply or just say they're no longer interested
4054,T M,"December 15, 2019",5, For best experience get a paid subscription.
4055,Miguel Alvarez,"November 19, 2019",5, Good quality of people and high match and response rate!
4056,catherine Anderson,"January 19, 2020",4, Best dating app...you get hooks up with the right people but there visibility need more work
4057,Andy Sheppard,"February 7, 2020",1, Really bad they won't offer refund have not heard anything from them.
4058,Dominique B,"February 16, 2020",5, Much better than other dating apps. Gets right to it.
4059,Vishesh shah,"February 22, 2020",1, Can't upload pictures
4060,kuji killer1999,"March 4, 2020",1, Cannot connect to people
4061,Jeffrey Gerson,"March 9, 2020",5, Quality people. The right mix of engagement to determine if there's a match.
4062,amanda barker,"March 22, 2020",1, You pretty much cant do anything unless you pay for a membership..
4063,David,"January 8, 2020",1, Cannot change picture after i upload it. Can't replace it. Can only like 6 people per day
4064,David Antonio,"November 29, 2019",3," The constant reminders to rate, are very annoying"
4065,Brant Goss,"November 29, 2019",4," Awesome, but need some GIF capabilities in chat."
4066,AcF ShooTeR,"December 12, 2019",5, Even though I don't get many matches the app works well.
4067,Bahar Arapkirli,"December 21, 2019",1," Just downloaded and already planning to delete, you get to send only 10 likes a day for free, so the possibility that you match someone you actually may like is like %0,001."
4068,Ashley Scheiber,"January 1, 2020",4, You can give only limited likes unless you wanna pay for more but as many denies you want.
4069,Martin Lopez,"December 21, 2019",1," A LOT of fake accounts. Trying to get your number amd have you send pics (probably so they can make more fake accounts), its weird. Bad matching too. No matter my settings, they match me with people too far away. Also, 85% of the real profiles are very fat women smh."
4070,Reynold Wright,"January 16, 2020",5, This app at least in my area is a lot better with matches then any of the other dating apps. Way more attractive people on here then the others.
4071,Loki West,"January 23, 2020",5," Best dating app I've used, so far no nonsensical features and belligerent ads railing me left right and centre, just hot dudes"
4072,Ryanofitnessuk,"January 30, 2020",4, People appear to be more legitimate and app works fine so far
4073,Ashley Cruise,"February 10, 2020",3, Good concept but you only get like 5 swipes a day unless you pay
4074,Scott Carter,"March 13, 2020",5, The app itself is easy to use
4075,Jar Bai,"March 26, 2020",1, Their algorithm is messed up.
4076,Christopher Major,"April 5, 2020",3," Good platform, but not many people on here."
4077,Jourdan Chaney,"April 7, 2020",4, I have gotten replies before but it seems like it works more than a bumble or an OkCupid
4078,Maria Permanand,"November 9, 2019",5," Actually this app better than POF, so if I'm deleting anything right now POF is a bye bye. Really down to earth app. 5üëçüèΩ up."
4079,Kumar Khatri,"December 11, 2019",3, Not able to restore membership extra high subscription charges
4080,Yerachemel Ben Yahudah,"January 27, 2020",1, no verification code sent to my messages.. cant even add the app
4081,Stacie Chavez,"February 25, 2020",4, Everyone so far has been respectful and proper.
4082,Aaron Didcock,"March 3, 2020",2, Ignores distance preferances and i match with people to far away to actually meet
4083,Eric Suh,"March 21, 2020",1, Waste of time. 95% profile are inactive.
4084,Dylan Horton,"March 21, 2020",1, I gave them a low score because of the constant pestering to rate the app
4085,Business Office1,"April 17, 2020",3, Not much using though but i think its working.
4086,Breck Miller,"November 16, 2019",4," Asks if I met somebody, I hit 'don't ask about my dates' and it keeps asking me about my dates every time I log in. Please fix."
4087,Ollie C,"November 27, 2019",4," More control over who you match with than other apps, less shallow clientele imo!"
4088,Kate Wilson,"November 30, 2019",5, Generally a good app. Shame you can't screen out the jerks.
4089,corey dunning,"December 17, 2019",4," Finally, and app that's actually real people. Not swimming with spam."
4090,Nick Baker,"January 4, 2020",4, Good app but tedious if you don't pay for it
4091,Gabrielle Carter,"January 11, 2020",4, It seems really respectful and I got matches fast I gave it 4 stars because i have used it long enough to know
4092,Abby Brown,"January 18, 2020",5, Dope app! Really well designed. Wow! Better than bumble
4093,Isaaca Thorpe,"January 21, 2020",3, Need more quality profiles and matching options.
4094,Rhushida Kashalkar,"January 25, 2020",1," One of the worst apps for dating. Half of the options I see are guys who have marked their gender as Woman, and the rest half are actual women who live in a completely different continent."
4095,Terrell Devon Allen,"February 15, 2020",4, Very well design apps no fake profiles.
4096,william codman,"February 22, 2020",5, A fun and interesting way to meet people.
4097,Ted Sellars,"March 23, 2020",5," Hello ive just downloaded your app and have created an account but when i try to like anyone's profile it tells me i need to complete my account but when i go to my account it sais that it is 100% complete can you help me out at all, thanks in advance"
4098,kutiye sunday,"April 20, 2020",5, I really love the app easy to use
4099,Hazel M,"January 14, 2020",1, It's sending recommendations notifications even though I've turned them off.
4100,michael brogan,"November 18, 2019",2, They want you to delete the app? I'm about to since there is not much difference with this dating experience. At the end of the day all the dating sites don't want you to find love they just want you to spend you money.
4101,alex wolf,"November 12, 2019",1," They ban you if you don't go on it enough apparently , haven't used it in 3 months and just deleted it off my phone. Try to download it again and I have violated the terms of service . No idea, don't care."
4102,Zhenya Jane Salop,"November 16, 2019",1," Annoying, doesn't work until you pay money. Scam."
4103,Tony Lampert,"November 29, 2019",4, I like the way this site is designed. You can like a photo ir an answer and start a conversation that way. I have talked to a few women in here but ghey all seem to be far away. Im sure if i paid i might get more women local. I will see hiw it goes and might pay at a later date.
4104,Jim Robinson,"January 29, 2020",4, The approach is certainly more humanizing than tinder. Seems more geared towards finding relationships than hooking up.
4105,seinna gausman,"November 27, 2019",4, Solid user base of ppl you would actually want to meet. One star off because I think it still needs a little work (keeps asking me if I went on dates with ppl I chat with even tho I have opted out of disclosing that info) also no option to skip someone without rejecting them...and if you accidentall...Full ReviewSolid user base of ppl you would actually want to meet. One star off because I think it still needs a little work (keeps asking me if I went on dates with ppl I chat with even tho I have opted out of disclosing that info) also no option to skip someone without rejecting them...and if you accidentally skip or unmatch with someone you never see them again. Period. I've done that with someone I was really interested in and it was pretty sad.
4106,Tracy Martin,"December 9, 2019",5, New people! Thank you! The other sites are terrible compared to yours!
4107,Kayla Loura,"December 10, 2019",3, I think it's stupid you can't attach photos in the message area..
4108,Yoon Kwak,"January 4, 2020",1," Poor customer support. For some reason Hinge believes I'm not of age. I followed their instructions and sent in a copy of my ID. After two attempts, no response at all. It has been over 2 months since I sent in the first one."
4109,Robin Ng,"January 4, 2020",5, So far a pretty positive dating app. People are real and not too much spam..
4110,Gurbachan Singh,"January 5, 2020",5, Very good app many features are free must download i have used this app my self if u have guts to send msg directly to someone then this app for u
4111,Linda Boyd,"January 3, 2020",3, Better user experience than some of the other dating apps but still no sophistication around matching.
4112,Matt Hessler,"January 13, 2020",5, More engaging than the typical fast swiping apps
4113,Kyle Dexheimer,"January 17, 2020",5, It slows down everything so it isnt the swipefest other apps are.
4114,Colette F,"January 15, 2020",5," So far so good, even without paying for the extras!"
4115,Pie Yeu,"February 10, 2020",1, After they banned my account for no reason after they charge my money. Can't even call or email anyone for the support. Don't waist your money here
4116,Sarah Demers,"March 6, 2020",3," Why does it cost 26.99 for 1 month? That's absurd, no?"
4117,Tammy Tijerina,"April 5, 2020",5, Fun and easy
4118,Davide Pasqualini,"February 5, 2020",3, It sometimes crashes on my phone.

4120,E. Goldie,"December 1, 2019",5, Good way to contact girls compared to other useless apps out there. Hinge matches you with really cool people.
4121,Tatakaten Moon,"November 18, 2019",4," After going back and forth with Hinge developers, it seems as though the moderators have figured out their issues and restored my account."
4122,Jan Viana,"November 23, 2019",1," Tell me why I come across more men on the app when I specifically state I'm searching for women... I rarely, if ever, had this problem with Bumble or Tinder."

4124,Amanda Townshend,"December 28, 2019",5," So far, so good . Easy to use, better profiles:)"
4125,Christopher Snyder,"January 9, 2020",1, So I've had this app for about a week now I have liked many Statements from the people's profile but I have not received any responses if anything this app is more dead then other apps I've experienced
4126,Natasha Grosvenor,"January 8, 2020",3, It's always showing me people from ridiculously far away even though my setting are set to max 1 mile ü§∑
4127,Nathan Markle,"January 19, 2020",5, Didnt pay for extra features and still had a way better time than I did with Bumble or Tinder
4128,Thomas An,"January 25, 2020",2, The app is ok. But there are people who come up more than once after you swiped.
4129,Mike Oles,"January 27, 2020",1, Most of the girls it shows are obese. Think somethings wrong with the algorithm
4130,Reese saint,"February 11, 2020",5, Great so far. Quality prospects and 100% better than POF lol
4131,Miguel Moran,"December 14, 2019",1, Fake profiles and app crashes frequently.

4135,Ryan Godfrey,"December 16, 2019",3, Only rating to shut the damn pop up every minute
4136,marc curdu,"January 14, 2020",4, So far so good. Finds people alike and more prolipherous than rest of apps for me. Like it

4138,Dan Shute,"February 19, 2020",4," Still lonely, but had some genuinely delightful dates in a relatively short space of time since downloading. Pretty decent dating app."

4140,Rose Gonzales,"December 9, 2019",3," I updated my app and lost all of my information I already put in and my matches pretty disappointed, I was having good conversations."
4141,Devan Carter,"December 10, 2019",4, only having 10 swipes a day unless you pay to use the app is pretty silly but otherwise pretty solid
4142,Charlie Davidson,"January 1, 2020",3," Like every other app. Decent, better if you pay."
4143,Tyler Comas,"January 15, 2020",1, Does not give me profiles that are near my location even if deal breaker is on and also shows profiles of men even though woman is selected

4147,Aaron Carrington,"March 26, 2020",4, Decent enough after a week of use.

4150,Melissa Reyes,"December 18, 2019",2, They limit you on how many people you can like through the day if you dont pay monthly. Been on other sites before that dont do that. Literally swipe through 10 people and your done for the day. Stupid
4151,Emily Eichenberg,"January 2, 2020",4, I really like it so far. Only negative is you get 10 likes in 24 hours unless you pay the $$$$. Dating is hard enough and then you want to charge me? ‚òπÔ∏è

4155,Kiki Song,"February 16, 2020",5, I've met better people and had far more meaningful conversations here than any other dating app
4156,char B,"February 26, 2020",3," I like it, but it seems a bit limited."

4164,Charles Rigby,"December 21, 2019",1, You get maybe 10 likes before you run out and it asks you to pay. Doesn't bring anything special to the table. Forces you to give some personal details I would rather not give over right away.
4165,Adam Sellick,"January 15, 2020",1," Rubbish, only gives you 10 likes a day and doesn't tell you as you're doing it how many you have left, then they expect you to pay a fortune for an upgrade!"

4327,Brad Hall,"April 17, 2020",2, This app used to be great but now I keep seeing the same profiles no matter how many times I like or dislike them. The support is severely lacking and there's no way I would pay for the premium account. Reporting profiles is a major pain and there are more and more fake profiles on this app now

And it doesn't show you a bunch of attractive profiles that are either dead, there for validation, or fake. If you actually want to meet people and talk a bit, hinge works.

Therefore I found myself running into a lot of people in my ""matches"" that I was unsure if they were straight, homosexual, etc and since it doesn't identify what people are looking for, it makes it very difficult for someone outside the black and white realm of gender to find someone.

Maybe it's the requirement to leave a brief message or the limitation of likes or the increased ratio of real people, but everything on Hinge feels far more authentic. Also not being able to mindlessly swipe places Hinge above the bees and the kindling of the dating world. Also don't underestimate Hinge as a tool to help forge new friendships. A five star all around experience."

4993,Blaise Richelieu,"February 3, 2020",2," If you're male, do not install this app unless you really enjoy clicking the letter ""X"". This is a dead app yet still has so many damn commercials I don't get it. Constantly seeing profiles of boring ass people with terrible pictures. üôÑ"

5001,Marijana Simmons,"November 19, 2019",1, Worst app ever!!! Full of fake profiles because the app doesn't check. 50% of the matches are fake and this is very dangerous plus not to mention the waist of money. I'm canceling my membership for sure. There is better app out there that are safer!

When creating your profile you are asked to state 3 mini facts about yourself. This makes for a good conversation starter, so you have something to chat about. But here is where it goes off the rails. The MESSAGING FEATURE DOES NOT WORK RELIABLY! This is a big issue. If you don't receive a message from a chat partner, you can't respond.

5078,cristina,"January 19, 2020",2, The idea could be good but in two weeks I didn't get one match. The app was suggesting everyday a person that would have been my best match and that couldn't have been further from the truth. I would have never gone on a date on with those people. So I don't recommend it.
5079,Dave Cunningham,"January 17, 2020",1," Annoying from start to finish. The app keeps telling you that it is an app that is meant to be deleted. After seeing that message 100 - 200 times, I was relieved to do just that. Completely useless."

People are asked superficial questions, give superficial answers and post pictures. It is literally tinder with a one page questionnaire. ""No more swiping"" now we press a button. The only difference is you get told when people like you, which is only a feature if you compare it to tindr. Compared to almost every other nonhookup app it lacks any mode of actual connections. I just go through a list of people who I would have nothing in common with because there is no way to find common ground in their system. Tldr: ""Hinge, all the drawbacks of tindr; none of the benefits of established dating services"""

That's ridiculous period people live busy lives limiting them that much is crazy. 2. You expect people to pay for an app that has been broken for weeks, the notifications do not work...period. They either never show up unless you go into the app and into the conversation. Or it tells you that you have a message only for that message to not appear unless you delete and reinstall the app. You can't expect people to want to pay for an app that is both broken and limiting. Really disappointed would happily have laid when the app was working and with no limits.

Doesn't always update profiles correctly. Additionally, you can't put an account on hold or pause it for a while. Why wouldn't that be a basic feature?"

I love the clean and simple UI. Thank you creators/devs for not forcing users to pay a ridiculous subscription fee just to communicate. Best dating app I've used so far outside of Bumble which is horrible (and I'm a woman saying this). I love how easy the messaging system works and I don't have to match with someone first to see them in my mssg queue..THANK U!! I actually like the ice breaker questions that users can start off with on their profile. It can be a struggle to write something engaging on your profile so allowing others to comment on a photo or how you responded to interesting questions was a good creative move to get the ball rolling. I've had one date so far, almost on my 2nd date and I've only been active for under 2mos so that's a good sign. But a couple of gripes. Make sure that the users profile info is listed first at the top of profiles following the first photo. I don't really like having to scroll down to get to this info. Lastly, there is just a HUGE lack of users. I keep scrolling thru the same 15ish profiles. So I think the user base is really low which is unfortunate because this is a pretty good dating app. 40-50mi is my limit to travel to date someone. But it's kinda like a ghostown :( Kinda feel that this app needs a different name though as Hinge doesn't scream dating app to me."

The app is straightforward and easy to navigate. I don't like that it still says I have messages unless I delete the match or reply.

I've actually matched more and been on more dates since starting this (to the tune of 5x). And I'm actually matching with targeted people.

This is a site with lots of personal information submitted, and photos, and they clearly ignore support concerns. No response whatsoever to my endless requests to delete my profile. They won't do it. The app will arbitrarily lock you out. This leaves your pix & personal information left on their servers in full public view. Good luck reaching someone. If I had submitted a credit card, I'd consider them suspect of potential fraud. The only response I've received is an auto-responder telling you you're locked out because of unknown violations (which don't exist) or you're logging in from a foreign nation (USA based here). It's an app error that I've been able to overcome, but can't now. So, your private information is at their mercy. At which point, you have no control over your photos or convos left on their servers. They're clearly ignoring support tickets, and don't have a care in the world. It's morally wrong! Try another app. It's not the best app by any stretch, anyway. The name even sounds creepy.

So, I've been using a wide variety of dating apps during the 2019 calendar year, and I think Hinge is my favorite. Though this is no glowing endorsement, I think the system of allowing people to send messages with their initial like is ideal, and the ability to see who likes you (albeit one at a time, for free users) is gratifying coming from apps like Tinder and Bumble, which essentially enslave you to a meaningless, obsessive ""Hot or Not"" experience, unless you're willing to pay through the nose to see your matches. Why can't I give this app 5 stars and recommend it heartily? It's so buggy! Recently, after I'd connected with a match via text, the app asked me if I'd met up with her every time I switched to the chats tab for the better part of a week. Further, Hinge recently added the feature of going back to a prior match, allowing you to make some mistakes without consequence. Unlike Bumble, you can undo one dislike as many times as you like (not limited to three per day or whatever convoluted system Bumble has). Thanks for this feature! However, this feature works really weirdly. It blinks the prior profile before going back to the profile you landed on after the dislike, but then shows the profile you disliked after you make a decision on the next profile. It needs polishing; let me leave it at that. Despite these caveats, I still think Hinge provides a better overall experience than the other ones I've used this year. Unfortunately, it hasn't yet meant I've found someone to motivate me to delete the app, but I'm much more confident in my chances within Hinge's app than I am with so many others."

They have no users, repeat ppl you said no to & even ppl you already liked! Non stop. Unless you pay they won't show remotely decent matches, but even paid sucks. 10 daily like lmit?

5585,A Google user,"November 24, 2018",3, I like the concept. It makes you think before you match rather than constantly swipe right without care. The messaging needs to be improved. It does not alert you when someone sends a message. So this is good to match and then move platforms for texting.
5586,Ultan Courtney,"April 12, 2019",3," the concept is great but all my matches are in another region of my country (technically a different country) - and i don't seem to be able to alter my distance settings, or i cannot clearly see where they are on the app - probably my bad. Either way, few ""Hingers"" in Dublin i think."

That's actually why I'm writing this review I hardly ever do this. I think if you have users verify identity in multiple different ways it well deter fakes, more importantly I think if you limit users to about 25-50 people a day this would thin out women's usually large amount of messages. In doing so I believe it will make it more likely for matches to happen because the females will be more likely to return since they don't have to be over whelmed by messages it's an easy daily number to sift through. Finally I think the 25-50 people you are shown should also only see the same 25-50 people inorder to improve match possibility.

I don't think anyone asked for a separate like only tab, seems like an excuse to force people to buy into your app. I do hate that there's no way to share images, and initial message is kinda short. Like trying to message a tweet reply. Starting to not enjoy this app."

Extremely disappointing, given that I've otherwise heard good things. At least the marketing is dead on, when they say it's the app to be deleted!"

I'm not being shallow, I want a lady that can physically keep up if we run, ski, bicycle, etc. Add a filter for activity."

Many matches with meaningful conversations/meet-ups thanks to a great concept and the usability of the app. The new update was unfortunately disastrous. Along with the infinite bugs making the app unusable I was sad to see the tacky design and jarring colours. Reminiscent of some of the more distateful dating apps out there. Truly an eyesore. I'd be firing dev/design and doing everything I can to get the app back on track asap if I worked at Hinge.

Profiles are more informative and effective, and because they take a little more time to set up there seems to be no fakes or joke profiles, but people who actually take it seriously and are looking for something more than tinder can give. I also like the no swiping feature, and actually having to like a certain part of someone's profile and the ability to comment on it. Much better connections"

5994,Joseph Fallon,"May 26, 2019",5, I really like how it's set up. You have to think if you want to swipe on someone and you have to chose why. No more continuous swipes or endless matches that you'll never talk to. You can focus on a small group and can see who likes you in return.

The UI is good, (chat not very much) but the good thing about hinge is seeing quite easily who have liked you, and which photo/thing about you they've liked. The three questions/answers part is a really good conversation starter too.   Giving people the option to filter out others based on things you like/dislike (smoking for example) is a very good thing, it might result in less likes but the quality is much better.  Now the subjective part... It felt like the quality of people I've met there was much better than tinder for example, may be the filters showing people more similar to me or just luck.   I've only stoped using it because I found the best one in there (sorry everyone she is not there anymore!) and things are going amazingly well. So thank you Hinge!  If you are looking for more than sex definitely give Hinge a go!"
6003,brett pree,"April 5, 2019",3," Should not have limit on how many you can contact. Also, no place to put your intentions on profile. All the profiles do seem to be real people, close by. Some women don't have all photos required. Men have to have 6, I have seen women with only 1."
6004,Jeremy Brouwer,"November 15, 2018",5," Yo I've been using this app for a few days and it really does create good conversations. I am having fun being social, which is tough for me sometimes.

6005,Adrian Laster,"December 29, 2018",3," I'm not going to lie this app is better than tinder. I love the quality of the matches I get. One problem is that once a match invites me to start the chat.

6007,Chris Horne,"October 15, 2018",2, So my biggest issue with this app was pictures don't load half the time.

I haven't been on it long but so far I really like it. 6 pictures was a little much especially because I don't want to put pictures of my kids all over dating apps so there's not many pics to choose from other than retarded selfies but I like that they have to have 6 lol
6059,Daniel McEwen,"April 30, 2019",3," I like the style but it's full of people catfishing. When my profile says I'm looking for another guy, I'm supposedly talking to a guy and the person asks if I'm looking for a woman... something's not right. Maybe there could be some way to verify accounts, like a face pic with name and date?"

6061,karan singh,"February 13, 2019",2," Has bugs. When you change your preferences, you'll see all the people you'll previously cancelled before again appearing on your screen and that thing piles up more and more by time and you end up seeing the same people after editing your preferences."
6062,Teron Santeford,"October 16, 2019",2," Version 7.0.3 is super buggy to the point it's unusable. If you send a comment with a liked picture or bio people don't seem to get those anymore. So it's hard to start a conversation. It also mismatches pictures, shows wrong or partial info, and doesn't seem to update the chats."

I did that on 2 December. They note only a few days' time is what it takes, but no one has responded to me. (It's been 7 business days). I sent another email to the same address a few days later to check in... again, no response.  I used the contact form on the Hinge site yesterday. No response.  Seems there is non-existent customer support. Can't use it, so can't even see if it's worth buying premium features if I liked it.  UPDATE: Just saw several other people here have had the same age verification issue. Which means that the UI (User Interface) could use some work. If that many people in just a week report the same issue, think about how many are not reporting it, and then figure it's a massive problem. If people can't use the app, they can't like it. They can't help you make money. So, fix and respond."

You MUST be patient when getting going. People here are very down to earth. You won't have matches immediately or as often, because it's not a swiping app. But the ones you make will be really good. :) I've been on several dates with really good women, thanks to Hinge. Try to narrow down what you're looking for with your prompts. The right people will be attracted to you. Just be patient, and keep trying!! :)"
6068,Jamin Rubenbauer,"March 2, 2019",2," It's a pretty decent app. The one thing they are trying to do to make themselves different from tinder is no ""swiping"" but that's what's annoying, you have to awkwardly hit a button on the lower left side to basically swipe or skip that profile. Not user friendly in that regard."

The person controlling the fake profile typically wants to move to email/chat outside of the app, then eventually angling toward money transfer. Several reports to support within the app went unanswered, so I think they're ok with that. Guessing because fake profiles contribute to their perceived user base."

6071,Nate Riley,"April 21, 2019",3," My biggest problem with this app is that it keeps on showing people you've already declined... Is it a bug, or is the company concerned about the number of users in cities and deliberately repeats profiles? Also, some (if not all) of the pictures in profile will not load sometimes."
