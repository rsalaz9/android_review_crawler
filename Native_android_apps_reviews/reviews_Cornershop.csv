Quick idea, can you make it so that you can add delivery instructions to your address list instead of at check out to prevent having to re add the same instructions everytime you order? It keeps getting deleted everytime you go in or go back to add something you missed."
1,Analia Burgos,"April 22, 2020",2, This app used to be good before COVID-19. Now when you need it the most. The have all kind of service charges that is almost not worth using it. Rather risk it and line up at the store.
2,iftekhar,"April 29, 2020",1," Bug in the app. Didn't allow me to call the shopper, neither could see update on replacement. Too much fees compared to other app. Not recommending to other users."
3,Effie Sosa,"April 21, 2020",3, Mi first experience was great..today however I placed an order and when I put my card info in I was then blocked...and it's the same card I always use and I have sent various messages and still noone has replied.
4,OLIVER MACINTOSH,"April 18, 2020",5, You should be able to put your order in a que and get notified once a shopper has been assigned your order or a notification when shoppers are available. Great service but the app can be improved
5,Trit Sterling,"April 19, 2020",3," Available delivery times do not refresh when they become available, even when closing app and reopening. Had to remove an item in order trigger refresh."
6,Sarmista Barik,"April 11, 2020",5, I liked this app very much. Very helpful for getting essential utilities at our door step. Very quick and ontime service.
7,Anuj Patel,"April 10, 2020",1," I was not able to use the service at all, as since last 2 weeks I am seeing ""Shoppers occupied"" only."
8,Suranjan Das,"April 17, 2020",5, Overall application is good. But please add return policy for some products . Final itemized bill should be provided.

It will not allow me to uncheck it and I'm not sure if placing an order will automatically subscribe me to this service? Additionally the service fees for stores seems like a lot, 20% at many stores... Instacart has delivery for the same yearly price with no fees at the store."

I liked the concept so I did, after registering it tells me the service isn't available in my location yet. Thanks for wasting my time. Edit: After reading through other reviews here I'll definitely Heber use this service, this looks like so much trouble and so many different people have issues with the service."
11,Lisa Ragno,"April 13, 2020",1, I have tried to use this several times but there is never times available nor shoppers very disappointed

13,Jason Sakhai,"March 31, 2020",3, Need to add a notification feature to this app so it can notify the user via email or text when their favorite shop has delivery windows available. It is a simple feature to add and it will make it more convenient for shoppers(users of this app).
14,Hanna,"April 7, 2020",5," Really good! Awesome service. Completely recommend, specifically in this hard times"
15,Donna Pettalia,"April 10, 2020",1, I understand that times are difficult right now but I've had an order in my cart for 2 weeks now.

On the third time, the app wouldn't let me order. An error message prompted me to contact customer service to fix an issue. Representative just told me to wait it for out a couple of hours and that everything is ok, refusing to investigate any further. Absolutely no accountability. No thanks. Terrible customer experience. Evidently, 8 hours later, I was still unable to process the order."
20,Arvind Viswanathan,"April 28, 2020",3, No option to change the app language. Has defaulted to French just because I'm ordering in Montreal.
21,Patricia De Los Angeles R.G,"February 22, 2020",5," I was checking this site I love, thank you Amazing choices and savings, I highly recommend this site for know ones I will choose this site. Thank you"

23,Helen Marshall,"April 16, 2020",5, Excellent service. Good communication between the shopper and myself regarding out if stocks and replacements and fast delivery. The service fee was a little high for Costco but worth it since I don't have time to stand in line right now.
24,hasiba Ajaz,"April 2, 2020",5, This was the first time I tried Cornershop and the experience was AMAZING. I would highly recommend this app. And would place more orders in future... Thank you CONERSHOP

Firstly, the reason why Instacart is cheaper is because they expect customers to supplement shopper pay with tips, which is optional. When customers don't tip, the payouts to shoppers are very minimal. Compared to Cornershop, who doesn't allow tipping BUT they compensate their shoppers fairly. Please keep this in mind when you're comparing the membership fees. Cornershop's customer service is really up there compared to others."
31,Sam Micieli,"April 12, 2020",1, Way to hard to get an appointment haven't seen a single one open and I checked at all hours
32,Fatima Rodrigues,"March 29, 2020",4, Good app but never any shoppers to fulfil orders. I have to use a different service because i really need groceries today :(
33,sabs W.,"April 6, 2020",1, I have been waiting to get a time slot for the past two weeks. I am a person with a disability if I can't use your service it means other people with disabilities are also having difficulty time using your service.
34,Daniel Grzymisch,"April 4, 2020",5, Excelente experience. Staff is very helpful an shoppers are amazing.
35,M O'Brien,"April 17, 2020",2, The app ok but the mark up on the products they charge is outrageous.
36,Chantal Murciano,"April 20, 2020",5, Had my first delivery today and it was great . Loved they don't bring the groceries in plastic bags :)
37,MG K,"April 5, 2020",1," Been checking the app everyday at different times, and NO store ever has any shoppers available. Useless."
38,Peter M,"February 23, 2020",2," I live right in the downtown core of Toronto, yet the app states service is not available in my area??"

My partner tried to order yesterday and it worked perfectly. I Tried to order today and got my account locked (which apparently is irreversible). I tried contacting help and they gave me some generic response and sent me a link to terms and services for paragraphs 7 and 8...which didn't actually answer my query. I guess only one person in one household is allowed to have the app.
50,natasa dragisic,"December 2, 2019",1," App was asking me every time when I buying to confirm my documents and card which takes 30 min to do, and support only answers is we are sorry, if app asks that you do that we can't do enithing about that. So I gave up of using this app"

I get that demand is high right now but put my order in a queue or tell me there just isn't anyone delivering in my part of the city. The fact that I can't get any real feedback from this app, makes it useless. I gave it all day trying to put an order in with only ""Sorry, high demand has all our shoppers busy right now."" It seems more like a generic message, regardless of the issue."

The personal touch in the customer service standards ( such as getting a text from your shopper letting you know that the particular size or brand of product selected on my order, is currently not in stock, and suggest similar item) are great!

Besides having different fees based on percentages at each retailer and delivery charges that change as you increase your order, there's also service fees, deliver charges, taxes, and taxes on the service charges. Sometimes items you order are not in store, and you might end up paying more for something you didn't want. i know it's meant for convenience but that comes at a cost and that cost is sent directly to you."

Primero me anime porque había una promoción de 300 pesos menos pagando con Mastercard, pero al momento del cobro me cobraron el total sin descuento, no me di cuenta hasta después. Segundo tuve un problema con la dirección de entrega que no se dieron cuenta hasta ya la hora de entrega debido a que las funciones de la app son muy básicas creo que necesita mucho más desarrollo como localizavion, poder poner colonias etc. Debido a esto me programaron mi servicio para un día después con entrega de 10 a 11 am. A las 10:50 recibo la notificación de que mi pedido empieza a ser atendido con lo cual me comunico a soporte y me dicen que llegarían a las 12:40 les comento que no puedo esperar porque voy a salir. Me dicen que si más tarde y les explico todo mi malestar y experiencia y que prefiero cancelar. Su respuesta es ""está bien lo entiendo"" sin ofrecer ni siquiera una explicación. Creo que servicio a cliente necesita entender más la parte de el cliente tiene la razon. En verdad no le veo ningún valor agregado a esta aplicación en ciudades donde los mismos supermercados ofrecen este servicio (Monterrey). Y su sevicio aunque sin problemas me dieron la cancelacion creo que necesitan hacer más para tener clientes contentos"

403,Luz Lopez,"September 11, 2016",5,"Excelente todo Excelente servicio. El cobro se hizo sin ningun problema. Me llegó todo lo que pedí y en menos tiempo de lo que la app dice, tomando en cuenta las distancias y el tráfico de la ciudad. El chico de la entrega muy amable. Recomiendo la app"

422,Adriana Montano,"June 29, 2015",5,"No vuelvo al súper El app es súper user friendly y el servicio impresionante. La variedad de las tiendas en perfecta, de Costco a green corner para dejar mi súper completo. Recomendada 100%"
423,Jennifer Ochoa R,"May 1, 2020",3, My first order was just perfect . But the second one was just impossible to achieve! The app mentioned that my account was not allowed to place the order so I tried several times until I got tired and decided to uninstal. I wouldnt recomend it...
424,ıllıllı R V ıllıllı VEVO,"February 1, 2019",1," El personal de recursos humanos en cdmx es prepotente y grosero. En las instalaciones en esa misma ubicación hay un guardia con muy mala actitud y no tiene modos para decir las cosas de buena manera, te habla mal."

Además de que crashea cada 2 minutos se tardaron un mes en regresarme el dinero de un pedido cancelado y solo porque me puse muy insistente porque no querían regresarmelo y tuve que enviarles pruebas de que tomaron dinero de mi cuenta. Encima de todo eso pésima atención al cliente y precios exagerados, es una ESTAFA."

429,Maria Angélica Rosa Silva,"January 29, 2020",1, Não atende na região do bairro Jardim São Bernardo na zona sul e na Região do Brás no centro. Moro nessas regiões e por isso não faz sentido ter esse app que não facilita pelo serviço.
430,Dayana Miramontes,"August 9, 2018",1," Se re remamaron disque añadieron un cupón a mi cuenta pero se jalan con sus

día peleando para que al.final me.cancelaran nomas por que no les convino."
431,Cristobal Hammersley,"August 21, 2018",4, Muy buen servicio y aplicación aunque queda espacio para mejorar. Se debiera poder devolver las bolsas ya que se acumulan innecesariamente y lo otro es que cada vez que hay envíos gratis o promociones la app falla y finalmente deben simplificar la política de cambio de producto.
432,Lina Paola Palacio Hoyos,"April 16, 2020",1, Cobran por adelantado y la devolución del cambio se demora 30 días!!! Hábiles!!!! Si no encuentran tu pedido igual te lo cobraron. Imagínense esto cada vez que compran.
433,Eva Alvarez,"April 1, 2020",2," La segunda vez que internet comprar me mandarin un mail de verification de datos de mi tarjeta (tomar foto ambos lados) y una ID tonar foto ambos lados.
