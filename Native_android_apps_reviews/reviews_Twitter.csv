Now since the news is not in sections like it used to be it feels like there is a major decrease in content shown. I miss all the sections of the search instead of the hashtag and few stories page we have now. I would love if the old way could be back as an option as now this app sits unused for me.

The app keeps me engaged very well, but the only thing that bothers me is the lack of variety in the content I see.

I know you think you know better, but I do actually want to see media that may be sensitive, even the ones that totally don't contain any sensitive content but you feel the need to mark as such anyway. Furthermore, seemingly at random I'll find the app crashing, causing my whole device to power off and restart. This happens at least once a day. This is unacceptable. Fix this."

1525,Maddie Miller,"March 9, 2020",4," Really great way to get the latest news & media! My only complaint is that you can't edit your tweets after they're posted, like you can with Pinterest & other apps. You have to delete and restart. Maybe next update?"

1635,Michael Heilman,"February 16, 2020",3," Well designed, but with some key flaws. It sometimes refeshes unexpectedly and jumps to the top while you are reading something. And you have to keep reasserting your preference to see latest tweets first, they change it without your permission."
1636,Luigi Kapaj,"February 25, 2020",1," This app is litteted with bugs, the worst of which is how it cannot keep a stable view on screen while trying to read anything. At any given moment the app will disappear what you were looking at and replace it without warning or any user control"

1802,Melody Brown,"March 14, 2020",3, A suggestion I would make for this app is if you are locked out of your account for whatever reason. Let there be an option to unlock the account through email or phone number just in case the number is no longer in use anymore.

1862,dollh h,"March 31, 2020",4, App is ok. But has an infuriating quirk. Refreshes your feed while you've just scrolled to the tweet you want to see. Annoying.
1863,Ashwini Sovani,"April 7, 2020",5, Excellent for short messages and updates about the country.
1864,Soumojit Sharma,"April 19, 2020",1," It's 4th time when my account got suspended for no reason, literally for no reason, other people with abusing, vulgar tweets has no issues but my accounts got suspended continuously, please mail us the reason why our account got suspended again and again and why twitter is not taking any action and ...Full ReviewIt's 4th time when my account got suspended for no reason, literally for no reason, other people with abusing, vulgar tweets has no issues but my accounts got suspended continuously, please mail us the reason why our account got suspended again and again and why twitter is not taking any action and remove suspection"

1866,A Google user,"March 17, 2020",3," Twitter keeps taking back the likes and retweets I did to my favourite artists’ tweets. What's up with that? It's frustrating. Also, please let the users upload HD content peacefully without decreasing the quality. Please fix this ASAP."
1867,Hastur xix,"February 18, 2020",1," Absolutely love how the app thinks it's okay to censor posts even when you turn that option off. Makes it even better when they then turn around and say ""this post contains content YOU'VE chosen not to see"" like what? I'm pretty sure I have that censor option turned off by default."
1868,Сергей Пуриков,"February 9, 2020",2, Constantly forgets is settings and switches from the Latest Posts timeline to some ridiculous messed up Top Tweets mode. I can't believe this simple bug can't be fixed for so long. Almost makes you think it is intentional (sarcasm).
1869,Earisu Sagat,"March 10, 2020",2, The application was working very well until now. Sometimes doesn't retrieve tweets and is like you don't have internet connection. Even you try to contact help and is not working neither.
1870,Jakawa Davou,"March 17, 2020",4," This is a highly addictive app, still beats me how the app is free. In my opinion, the only part that needs some tweaking is the option to edit your tweets instead of taking the whole tweet down, otherwise its a fabulous app"
1871,Jo Sprague,"March 17, 2020",2," The app is ok, but somehow worse than the web experience. Missing key features that exist on the web like the ability to easily set font size and accent color, and the ability to easily add or remove people from lists."

1883,charlie,"April 3, 2020",1," They're removing worldwide trends, when the whole point of this app is to see what's going on in the world. It's like censorship of everything that you can't see just by turning on your local news. Please do better, twitter."

1892,Steven Hermann,"March 11, 2020",1," Decent app when the developers aren't telling you what they think you want to see.

1991,John Sostrom,"April 18, 2020",4, My one real problem deals with the followed/following counts. They don't jive. This results in not being able to follow additional people unless I unfollow others.
1992,Jamie McLaughlin,"April 22, 2020",4," Quite aside from having a twitter being an awful life-sabotaging idea, in terms of execution the app is excellent. Okay lost a star for pestering me to write a review when I already had."

You are time and time after time removing features that are some people's only way of finding out about important news. Especially in a world that is now even more open than it has ever been.

2025,Ray Ontario,"February 9, 2020",5," So far I have started liked my the app, as long as they don't shadow ban me or trick me to pay a fee to promote something I'm fine. This is the only reason I don't use FB much."

There are third party Twitter apps that just do this much better so please don't tell me it's just Android being janky.
2076,elizabeth white,"April 3, 2020",1, Updates are poorly thought out. The recent elimination of worldwide trends has only increased the isolation we are all feeling during a global crisis.
