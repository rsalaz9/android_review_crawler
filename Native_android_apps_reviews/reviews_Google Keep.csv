Overall ,I love this app .I would have given 5 stars but there are cons.Lack of draw tools,no schedule ,no private notes, no option to resize,move or rotate picture or drawings in a note,if a pic or drawing is added, it's at the top, can't edit size. Other than that 5🌟"

I love that to-dos can be nested Everything can be categorized, rearranged in various ways and highlighted with colors. These features really help in keeping notes organized and accessible. Ability to set reminders and use Google Keep in the browser or from a phone are also very helpful."

It's been my loyal companion throughout these many years now and I just can't imagine my life without it. I'm using it on a daily basis. The one little thing that's bothering me is the absence of text/font styles, because I always need to mark some text in bold when writing my notes... And also a reverse button 🔙, to cancel the last action (e.g. if I accidentally erased a block of text, which happens quite often 😓). I hope these features are added soon 🙏❤"
7,J Torres,"April 17, 2020",2," Great app!!! Wife and I love it! But 2 stars because it frequently says this app needs to ""refresh."" So you click refresh and it takes FOREVER!! Then it says refresh failed.... what needs to refresh for so long? It's a simple list making tool. If this wasn't an issue it would be 5 stars for me!"

I want my toggle back within the app that lets ME control the light or dark mode not my phone (I like this app on light mode). Can you please push out an update to this app that puts the option back in for light or dark mode? Or at least make the colors in dark mode less hideous?

When I try to view all my notes under a certain label it will show them but upon clicking on one note the label view will revert back to all notes so when I exit that note I'm no longer looking at just that label despite the label selection saying that I am. Also my app just force quit 10 minutes after updating whilst I was typing, not sure why though?"

53,William Nito,"April 24, 2020",5," This app is easy to use and very convenient because it easily sync across devices. For improvement, however, I would like to suggest to put scan documents feature like that of Apple's notes feature. 👍"
54,Ramith J,"April 7, 2020",1," Unstable is the only word to describe it. Heavy memory usage, freezing, loss of data. This is unexpected of Google. But of late the integrity of those making apps for Google is doubtful. So not surprised."

Kindly add the said features. Else everything works flawlessly, very useful. Regards Muzzammil"
57,Harshit Tyagi,"April 21, 2020",2, There has to be a feature of locking notes. Used iCloud notes for so long and there i could lock my individual notes. Giant tech google atleast should have features which apple offer if not more. Secondly there is no feature of bold text or italic text. So disappointing.
58,Adel Neo,"April 4, 2020",3," The widget is very poorly designed and not practical: instead of choosing a note, we're only stuck with one widget with a label and a giant title taking up the space, it's very uncreative and shoud represent a single note on the home screen."
59,Jacinta Bouvay,"April 10, 2020",1," Not sure what happened in the last update as the app was wonderful for the past year or more and now it keeps crashing. My family uses it for everything, including our shared grocery list and now I, Mom,, can't use it, despite clearing the cache and reinstalling it and restarting my phone TWICE."
60,Phil A,"April 11, 2020",4, Love it but... Wish I could make the checkbwck like font a bit smaller and add a second column to the list. This way some lists wouldn't be so long. But otherwise love this app. Would give it 5 ✨ if I could add a column
61,Euclid Quemada,"April 9, 2020",5," I'm full on in the Google ecosystem and this offers amazing syncing with my devices. I would really love to have the option to bold, italicise, and underline certain words. The widget is also not optimized."

65,Gabriel Nwankwu,"April 18, 2020",4," I think you should add an option of a passcode before you open the app, as I sometimes note down some important things with it. aside from that the app is very OK to keep notes and for reminders, is so helpful to me."
66,Lea Mae Divinagracia,"April 4, 2020",4, The app is nice. I prefer using it than other note apps but i just gave it 4stars because i prefer that it has 'pin it on status bar' option. It would be more convenient that widgets. Thanks. Keep up the good work.

86,Yash fun,"April 20, 2020",5, Too simple to use. Love this notebook app. But one thing that disappointed me is that there is no locking system in this app. I hope during next update there will be locking system.

97,A Google user,"April 15, 2020",4," A little daggy to use but does a job. I'm puzzled as to why it needs constant updates ""to improve performance and remove bugs "" when nothing seems to change. Is this a Google product ?"
98,Muhammad Waseem,"April 18, 2020",5, This is a very good application but you should also give it a locked system so that we can save some of our pictures or our secret documents and password it so that they are always in our access.

There also seems to be an issue with hand detection on a Chrome OS tablet while drawing/writing. It is very jittery like it can't keep up with my hand, but the Squid Notes app doesn't have this issue."

App needs improvement in terms of basic functionality and shouldn't run in background unnecessarily. Should support handwriting, should extract text from shop board or billboard text, when scanned through camera."
404,Amithes S,"March 20, 2020",5," It's good and handy, solved the purpose. But need this suggestion taken by goigje fir next update . Need seperate settings for dark mode . Now I'm using phone theme in dark mode .but need Google keep in light mode , but couldn't change it"
405,Ifeoma Onyekwere,"April 2, 2020",2," Why did the dark mode disappear with my android 10 update? Please, can it be returned? I would really appreciate it. It was helpful. Thank you."
406,Danny,"April 5, 2020",1," Much like the messenger app, it freezes CONSTANTLY and takes forever to actually open. And then it's glitchy as hell. It's basically useless."
407,cindy elephantcoll,"April 6, 2020",5, I love this app I'm just happy to know now when I see something important to save it is awesome 👍😀😊👍
408,anantha krishnan,"April 12, 2020",3, Wish it had a popup option which might make easy to record data when on another application
409,Abiodun Bello,"April 15, 2020",4, Easily one of the best note app in the market. Please provide pin or password protection for the next Google Keep update as well as data encryption. Thanks.
410,Mahmut Tunahan Altıntaş,"February 15, 2020",3, so little options of markup. i cant have normal text and checkboxes in same page. i cant add hyperlinks in a page like page in page. no heading or bold text option. i would say most reliable note taking app yet so limited.
411,Vimanyu Beedasy,"February 21, 2020",5," Great app, I use this everyday for lists and reminders. I love the integration in Google calendar. Next thing will be to include a ""READ-ONLY"" option to avoid unnecessary/unexpected editing."
412,Jin Wu,"March 8, 2020",2," I use it but hate it, too. It overly simple. Only one level or organization. And you can't hand-draw any lines on the content even when it's an image."
413,Eri G.,"March 5, 2020",4," I've been using this for the past couple of years and I've considered it the best organization app for me. However, in the recent update the toggle for the dark mode is gone. I don't really like dark mode on Keep."
414,Tex Arcana,"March 13, 2020",1," It WAS the greatest app ever, until Dark Mode disappeared. After my s9 updated to the latest Android (v10, OneUI 2.0), Keep went back to light mode with no option to turn on dark mode. This sucks. Big time. Y'all screwed up, Google."
415,kittu rishikesh,"April 25, 2020",4," It will be great if it had an option to hide notes which are important, with a password."
416,Raul Morales,"February 13, 2020",5," Great application, the one bug I've found is the default time cannot stick to a change (say from 8 am in the morning to 7) once the app is swiped closed. The change doesn't stick."
417,Asif A. Ali,"February 1, 2020",5," I was doing fine with Snote, and then came the Google Keep to take over my existing choice of app for taking notes. The best thing about this app is that whether you use edge browser or chrome... you can use this app on it, or install it as an app."
418,Awais Usmani,"February 6, 2020",4, Very user friendly. Very easy to use. Great sync. Just one thing is missing that is font customisation. Please add it to make the app more exciting.
419,Russel Jao,"February 19, 2020",1, What happened to all the vibrant colors? I've used this app for a long time and suddenly you just decide to make the colors dull? Also in dark mode? I hate using this app now. Give me back the normal mode with vibrant colors.
420,รeคy,"February 25, 2020",4," Overall a very usefull app; however, there needs to be better visibility and diverse tools so that Samsung Note phone users can choose Keep instead of the default Samsung Notes app. Having google as a central hub for pretty much all important apps is a gamechanger."
421,OtakuAndKai's Wifeu,"March 7, 2020",5," This app lets me keep notes no matter how long are they. Words are limitless! Not only that, notes are also saved online depending on which google account you use. Whenever I open my gmails through PC, this app is also there, making it convenient"
422,Akanksha Choubey,"March 7, 2020",5, I was writing something very important on my computer when it suddenly died and I had a minute heart attack. But Google Keep had already synced it with my phone. This app is a keeper for sure! Thank you for making thisss.💕
423,Veronica Dent,"March 10, 2020",4, We find this app very useful but feel it is missing a diary for planning. I've searched this option - can someone tell me if I'm missing it? We feel it would really complete the app.
424,Hey Z,"March 20, 2020",4, Its a good app but please add an option to organize it by date or when it is written. I find it hard to adjust everything when all i want is to keep it according to their date.
425,Mortaza,"March 28, 2020",4," Hey, Please add the 'Swipe action' settings like Gmail. I want to customize the Left, Right swipe action in Google Keep. And, also add 'manual saving' option instead of auto saving."
426,Oluwatobi Elegbeleye,"April 7, 2020",5," I looooove this app. It's easy to use and I don't have to worry about ever losing my notes, even if I change phones. Thank you!!!!"
427,Caroline Serene,"April 10, 2020",3, Needs sort function - would like to be able to sort through notes alphabetically
428,Dallin Larkin,"April 8, 2020",5, This is so useful. I use it a lot to keep track of things I need to get done.
429,Ugomma Marietta,"April 11, 2020",5, I jumped on the opportunity to audio-record my thoughts and have them transcribed for me. It was worth it. And I could edit them with a friend simultaneously. You know?
430,qhawe luthuli,"April 23, 2020",5, Love it cause I don't lose my notes since it auto saves to the cloud.
431,Sergio Magas,"April 24, 2020",3, I would like to have folders. I know we've got already labels but the notes still remind in the home screen. If you add that option would be amazing for those who have a lot of notes. Thank you
432,Ripon Bhowmik,"March 19, 2020",1," Everything is, The best there could be for this app... Just to draw your attention... An option, to turn off the dark mode in settings would again make me fall in love with this app, once more. Thank you."
433,Eric Hitchcock,"February 4, 2020",5," Very handy app,I use it for all my quick response note taking, passwords,etc. Voice response is a little irritating because of the lagg otherwise a great app for the home screen."
434,Iulian Cristian Moise,"February 23, 2020",5," The best app for taking a note and making sure you don't forget about it with the notification functionality. Another great thing is that you can access it from the web, so it's very versatile for a notes app :)"
435,کژوان زمانی,"March 1, 2020",4, Really great but when i choose images it downgrades its quality and make them hard to read. also it doesnt let me to record a long voice record or attach a previously recorded voice to my notes.
436,Daniel Hermes,"March 17, 2020",5," Love Google Keep! I keep track of everything with it, I even have a list to remember things about my girlfriend such as what she likes and doesn't like to eat and possible gifts and so on."
437,Anita Clausen,"March 24, 2020",5, Google KEEP is the single most awesome app ever. It's so easy to use and share every single important and interesting thing that I come across. I have more things in keep than I have in notebook.
438,Sanjeev Chaudhary,"April 16, 2020",5, Best app for quick note writing and sharing on mobile and laptop.
439,Sureshbabu Anisetti,"April 22, 2020",4, Read only mode not available so that moving back to Drive Undo redo readonly should be protected by 3rd party or devce hardware vendor
440,Silvio Mario Luciano Greco,"February 9, 2020",3," It was wonderful until one month ago: now my shared notes are not syncing with the other collaborators any more. Please, fix this single issue and it will be back to a great app!"
441,Vivek Pandit,"February 29, 2020",5," A well balanced all platform compatible app...great for keeping records, notes and important data. Just one request as an honest customer..kindly add an option of app lock which can help keep our data safe. Thank you for this wonderful app"
442,සුදු පුංචා,"March 3, 2020",4, No worst experiences yet. Great app. I moved to Google Keep from Samsung Notes and Xiaomi Note application. Pretty great and can share our notes between computer and smartphone. It's really helpful.
443,Yamit Vargas,"April 4, 2020",5, As usual Google make apps which are simple easy to use and trustful.
444,Christeen Vader,"April 3, 2020",4," Can easily add attachment, audio, pictures to notes and lists. Very user friendly even for people un familiar with technology."
445,Future Consoles,"April 14, 2020",5," No problems with keep notes, very interesting application"
446,Matthew Tracy,"April 14, 2020",1," Was great, until I opened the app one day and all of my notes for the past few years was erased. Use something else."
447,Its AnamiKa singh,"April 18, 2020",5, This is the cool. App which we write many important things 😅when we forgot our mind but our phone is alway their and we use this app it's just ❤️😘🔥 amazing
448,Nabeel Abbasi,"April 22, 2020",4, Its good app but if you can add password protection for each note.
449,Rick England,"February 4, 2020",4," Please add a setting to automatically open the note at the bottom, so I don't have to scroll down lines and lines of text every single time 😕 ... And an option to lock the position of note previews so the don't change while scrolling..."
450,John Delius,"February 9, 2020",4, Could not live without this app. Only thing I would like to see is nested folders so I can keep work and private interest separated. Maybe it can be done and I haven't found it. Love this app
451,Rajat Gosain,"February 18, 2020",4, Wonderful app. The search words need to be highlighted. The option for the notes to be password protected. Please incorporate such features for ease.
452,Karthik Sk,"March 26, 2020",4," The app is good, but I give only 4 starts as there is a drawback that the new notes come at front and old notes go back. There must be an option to sort either by newest to oldest or Alphabetical order"
453,Faisal Khan Gaming,"April 3, 2020",4, It's good app but due to some bugs I not rate 5 star And I recommended to who importance of notes
454,Yafet Tekle,"April 15, 2020",2, Excellent app. Please I beg. Add password protection on the notes. This Is the only reosan I havent fully switched over yet. It is essential.
455,Sarita Sinha,"April 21, 2020",5, Very clear app with great features and personalization settings.
456,Isaac Intsiful,"February 19, 2020",3, Unfortunately this app doesn't work in offline mode. It crushes without internet connection. I sometimes want to use in airplane mode but it won't work.
457,TheGreat CG,"March 11, 2020",5," It's a really good app, but i advise you not to use it for more than 4 hours, or else it's gonna drain your battery like crazy and your device care is gonna think it's a problem lol"
458,Ms R,"March 19, 2020",5," Great app. Wish it had some more functionality, like bolding, highlighting etc... And also the ability to reorder labels manually. But, it's still a great app I have to say"
459,Martin Price,"April 2, 2020",5," Very well laid out, easy to use. Perhaps some templates could be added some time but it is named-notes"
460,Rebecca P.,"April 11, 2020",5, Love this notes app to save important info from time to time!
461,A O,"March 27, 2020",1," Edit: PLEASE FIX THIS APP GOOGLE DEVELOPERS, OR WHOMEVER. IT HAS BEEN LAGGING FOR AWHILE. THANKS. I like the app, but as of late it's been operating really glitchy/ slow. Why is that happening after the new update???"
462,Doug Grinbergs,"January 31, 2020",3, Jan 30 app update: sync now seems to work: wasted a bunch of time trying various things to push phone data to server. (:-( (So unhelpful that many app developers don't bother to include bug fixe lists in update notes.)
463,Amir Hosein Ramezani,"March 18, 2020",5, I'm so glad that it has infinity space for saving my endless notes! As if it has some other options likewise OneNote and make it the best! But I frankly assure you it's unique!😎
464,3x With Fatih,"February 24, 2020",1," Lost my voice note. I was leaving a voice message, together with a image I uploaded. But after 2 minutes recording stopped and the massage got lost. This needs improvements. Back to Otter."
465,G C,"February 27, 2020",5," This is a great app. I use it all the time now for keeping track of things, reminders, and links to web sites. Also good for sharing shopping lists."
466,Dmitry K,"April 11, 2020",1," Always telling me to turn on sync, forcing me to press on ""dismiss"" all the time."
467,April Fernandez,"April 5, 2020",1, Unable to delete images in a note. Doesn't give the option to delete it only says cancel
468,Seema Jain,"April 23, 2020",1," From last 7 days app is not syncing data, hence could not open it. Alsi i lost all notes."
469,John Blount,"February 19, 2020",4, Easy to use note taking app. The ability to pin note is great also. Good for grouping things together. Easy to use list option.
470,arun verma,"February 9, 2020",5," Grab a photo of a poster, receipt or document and easily organize or find it later in search. Google Keep makes it easy to capture a thought or list for yourself, and share it with friends and family."
471,Cynthia Robinson,"February 23, 2020",3," I really like this app, but now it's light instead of dark! I have a vision problem that dark backgrounds help me see better. :("
472,Real,"March 1, 2020",3, Simple and minimalistic UI...but i have some serious privacy concerns- lock feature is not available and it can be easily tracked. Also developers rarely respond to your feedback.
473,Susanna Handow,"March 14, 2020",4, Overall very easy useful app. Just wish that only one side was for moving items and the other side was for scrolling. It's waaaay too easy to accidentally rearrange your list when you're just trying to scroll.
474,tin tag,"March 13, 2020",5," I love your app kudos to the devs and designers! I'd like to suggest to have a default note color everytime I add a note, either random color or fixed. Thanks!!!"
475,Mercedes Salter,"March 18, 2020",5," Love it, love the ability to share my notes/lists with my husband so we can both edit. This is how we make our spying list and still be in the loop with each other"
476,The PianoChef,"March 19, 2020",4, Great app! I really like Google for many reasons. I am always quick to write something down and Keep is very easy and quick.
477,LAST FATE,"March 25, 2020",5, It is a nice app to use I always use it store my ideas but I request a feature which is info about the note or achieve you have written like when you have written I want that when I have written not when I have edited it will be great feature if we get so
478,Charbel Elias,"March 26, 2020",4," Great overall + transition between different devices. However, should add ability to bold/italics/underline/font size etc all the usual font editing tools so we can take more effective notes"
479,Avinash Choran,"April 9, 2020",3, There is no way to add audio files which is disappointing.
480,Keith Lim Hoe Keat,"April 15, 2020",1, Can't sync at all after last update. Failed!!!
481,Abhudaya gupta,"April 14, 2020",4, Good but needed security...I think there should a security features like in apple..that to lock any particular note as per our requirement..so that public may not see it as n when app opens..or a locking feature for app itself..
482,J Niemi,"April 22, 2020",5, I like this app and use it a lot. Like having my own private brain trust 😁
483,ALBERT AIKINS,"February 5, 2020",5, Fantastic app. My favourite notes app. I love the ease with which I can sync accross platforms. I use an android and an apple and this app makes it easy to transfer notes from one to the other.
484,Vineet Dhir,"February 6, 2020",4," This app will become more effective if you can provide ""Search"" Option within à particular note too which will be easier to look out for something within 1000+ words of larger notes too."
485,lee coates,"February 17, 2020",5," Mine has been in constant use across multiple platforms for years, cant live without it, I just wish it had more advanced features."
486,Kunal Phadte,"February 27, 2020",3," Should add the capability to have checkboxes and normal writing on single page. Currently if I chose checkboxes, I can't write anything without checkbox at the beginning."
487,Lisa,"February 26, 2020",2," Was great and simple to use, now it's awful. Ticked boxes don't move to the bottom anymore. Information missing...what happened?"
488,Mayis Xaspoladov,"March 16, 2020",3," Good, but some futures does not exist. Example: cannot install password on notes. Example 2: when opening doesn't restore last opened label. And other important futures.... please upgrade to multifunctional version..."
489,Ezekiel Paris,"April 10, 2020",5, great notes taking app just that the developer has to implement some sort of privacy for users not everyone wants their personal notes to be seen by other's in my opinion a password protected feature seems cool
490,A Google user,"April 21, 2020",4, The app is quite useful for taking down notes and can be accessed on several devices thanks to its sync functionality.
491,Tuhin Garai,"March 6, 2020",4," Google Keep is awesome.... It will be much better if you will provide a separate Locker to lockdown some secret things just like govt. id, userid and password for different websites for increased Privacy..... Otherwise Keep is awesome..."
492,Joshua Vilander,"February 9, 2020",5, Exceptional app. I use this for everything I need to keep in mind and many things I don't. I really appreciate the feature that pins notes to the top; would it be possible to create a widget that is a shortcut to a specific note?
493,Cristian,"February 11, 2020",4," Switch between white and black theme and you will see that the text size is not the same. On the white theme, the font is bigger and better. Why?"
494,Dusan Stankovic,"February 14, 2020",4," It is FAR BETTER in iOS Notes app, because it is simple and elegant. I do like labels (which is like tags) but the structure and makeup of app can be better."
495,Mike Brehm,"February 18, 2020",4," Really enjoy the simplicity, labels, lists and Cloud storage. Now it needs some minimal text formatting options (bold, italics, underline)."
496,Phil Bodley,"February 24, 2020",4," Love it, but PLEASE could you make list items indent to right (or back to left) ONLY if my finger scrolls at an angle of GREATER THAN 45°. Currently the slightest scroll movements off vertical sometimes cause indentation and risk inadvertent archiving."
497,Pawan Thisara,"February 27, 2020",4, This app is best for keeping notes. It would have much better if the app has the function to keep secret notes (to lock a note with a password) and to export notes as pdf.
498,nayandeep chawla,"February 26, 2020",4," Hello keep notes team after your latest update, my app is getting frozen for some small seconds when i am scrolling or typing. Pls solve this issue with your next update. Thank you!"
499,Kishmita Thakur,"March 2, 2020",4, I love this app. So well developed. Amazing organization options. Would love it more if I could edit the text's font and bold/italics.
500,Artur Kharchenko,"March 13, 2020",1," Do you really think I remember all addresses when I set a reminder that corresponds to place? In other words, Would be super helpful to set reminder place using map along with manual address input."

502,ارسلان ضربی,"April 2, 2020",5, Thank you for your time for making this app... I write a lot about my days and times and this app made it very easy to keep them in my sight and most importantly not lose them
503,Vladimir Nasonoff,"April 2, 2020",4," Please bring: Subcategories for Lables; Colors for Lables; ""Make a copy"" for multiple notes;"
504,Anthony Cooper,"March 17, 2020",2," No notifications when shared keeps are updated. It is great for creating a shared shopping list, but it doesn't notify if someone else has made changes. What good is the sharing without notifications?"
505,R E,"February 13, 2020",4," Update: shopping list function seems back! Will test for a while and will increase this to five if it's all good! Would like to select colour and filter view my notes by colour - ""show me all blue notes"""
506,Dima Slivin,"February 5, 2020",3, Items with the tick boxes (created using web UI) only show the first list item when you click on the note to expand it. The rest of the list is not displayed.
507,candy Yeo,"February 10, 2020",5, Excellent! This app help me to sync my notes from my old phone to new phone. Save me so much times. And it's easy to use. Recommend it!
508,George,"March 5, 2020",1," Very terrible at sync. Jesus this app frustrates me all the time. After editing notes on PC doesn't show changes on app and vice versa. Even after resetting app, it takes like forever to show earlier stored content."
509,laura roy,"March 6, 2020",2," The app required a refresh, after the refresh all my notes were gone! The information I had saved there is lost. The checklists I used for groceries and bills disappeared."
510,Sajid Hussain,"March 8, 2020",1, As i added some nites and reminder and have a widget on home screen to keep an eye of my upcoming notes and reminder every time but after adding note or reminder it automatically disappeared from widget on screen but it remains in apk but it is not showing on widget
511,Josh Langer,"April 1, 2020",3," only three stars, because it keeps your notes, sure, but it is annoying how little custumizing you can do with the the individual notes."
512,Fabian Patin,"April 13, 2020",3, Great idea that is very useful except needs some updates and refinement
513,Ramesh,"April 10, 2020",4, Create an option to underline the words and whole app is good
514,Karan Shripuram,"February 6, 2020",1, After the New update the dark mode option is not there. It only enter dark mode when the whole system (UI) enters the dark mode. But I want to keep this app in dark mode forever.
515,Aashis Shrestha,"February 10, 2020",4," A must have app for notes and reminders but Reminders must be sortable by alphabets, due dates or labels. I would love to have this feature and gladly rate the app 5-stars."

517,Jo Avila,"February 21, 2020",3, I've been relying on this app for a long time. But the latest update is buggy. It freezes when I need to add an image as part of the note.
518,Andrea Elizabeth,"March 3, 2020",4," App is so good, but one of the things that are missing is color, i need app be colorful and use different kinds of color to put in all notes we only have 12 colors!!!!! Please more colours Thanks :)"
519,Clemencious,"March 14, 2020",2, It does what it does. But I have some personal notes that needs to be protected. Google should add the ability to lock some notes with PIN or something.
520,Devon Woolard,"March 22, 2020",5," Super neat, with options like pulling text from pictures (amazing), check boxes, color coordination, and easy organization, I use it daily!"

529,Wesley Dechavez,"February 9, 2020",3," I would like some customizations like making letters bold, italicized, underlined, etc. and more accuracy to its numbering lists because it tends to be annoying for quite some time."
530,Emma Moneyang,"February 6, 2020",5," Like I said I like to write. I usually start writing here when inspiration smacks me, then I copy and paste onto Google docs. I keep my mental notes (the ones I wanna use) in here, it's great."

541,Akshay Thorat,"March 7, 2020",1," App lacks text formatting options. At least they should provide an option to link a label with a colour, so all notes with same label are displayed in same colour."
542,Ijo Asik,"February 18, 2020",4," Nice apps, but it would be perfect if the notes/writing can be added with bold, italic, highlight etc like word tools. Can you guys make this improvement? 🙂👍"
543,Winnie Chin,"February 21, 2020",4, Great to do list - one comment is that the widget looks outdated. It could use a more modern look and/or have a dark theme.
544,manjari bhargava,"February 26, 2020",4," Very useful. Must add another tab for sub sections. Changes made by a member should be highlighted, and notifications sent to all collaboraters."

549,Subhashish Das,"March 25, 2020",1, Terrible experience. Not at all user friendly. Unable to reactivate my account... Options are unavailable... Recharge amount is getting debited.. Although I am unable to view channels...
550,Divyanshu Tomar,"April 8, 2020",5, I keep all my important notes & information on this app. It usually helps me in writing my quotes & poems.

560,Gopi Krishna Jasti,"March 3, 2020",3, It is better if you add a password protection for the required notes to open. Because if we saved any important information in notes there is no security for that. Please look into that.
561,Jenness Johnston,"April 10, 2020",5, Love this!! Ive switched my info to 4 or 5 phones by backing it up to google and its awesome!!

585,Derek Schell,"April 9, 2020",4, Why can't I decide the app's light/dark theme independently of the system's theme anymore? The dark theme of this app looks horrible.
586,Mandy Ingram,"February 8, 2020",3," Okay. So, the fact that ""Dark Mode is controlled by Android 10"" is not cool. I use themes on my phone and not having the Dark Mode toggle in the app means I can't have dark mode at all. Since Dark Mode in Android cannot be used while a theme is being used. Please correct this."

Using on a Samsung Note device, rather use the Microsoft alternatives. The app detects both your hand and stylus and does not allow for any exporting. Otherwise the notes and lists are ok, but Microsoft supports the writing as well as better integration with Windows and lists.

I wish it had a permanent date stamp for notes. Things happen and you often find yourself looking for a day when a particular event happened. The event may be linked to a particular note and when you open up that note, the date that appears is when it was last edited. It has frustrated me a lot of times. Sometimes the day you created a note is just as important as the day you edited it. I wish you could find a way to incorporate both."

However, I cannot add pictures from Google Photos, which seems counterintuitive to a Google app, and the photo is added at the top of the note so it breaks the continuity of the note. Also there are no option to select bullet points, or a numbering system for continuous notes. I have noticed that sometimes it will continue numbering if I start a paragraph with ""1."", but it will not continue the numbering if I need to move the cursor or open another app or program. I recommend this app for light note taking or quick on the go use, but not for more in depth use that is needed with work or school."

Sync/integration with Google Assistant. If I ask the Assistant to make a note or list, that list only sits within the Assistant. It would be amazing if it could also sync with this app. 2. Text editing i.e. bold, italicize, underline, size, etc. Nothing too crazy but for the sake of making lists that have sub-categories to the items within them, it would be nice to be able to make the headers to those categories pop-out more.

In dark mode, the color scheme used to color code notes is different fr when dark theme is not used. They should keep all the dark mode shades, but also allow the normal shades of colors to be used additionally. The color choice shouldn't change based on the dark theme being enabled. If they fixed this, I'd change my review score drastically."

1520,Mars Allred,"December 16, 2019",2," If I share something to Keep I should be able to set a reminder the. It's an unnecessary set of steps to have to save what I've shared, then open the app, find the note and set the reminder."
1521,Chee Hong Wong,"January 1, 2020",5," Great app and I use it daily. Just one request: can you please add a ""read only feature)? A lot of times I just want to read the texts I wrote but edited it without knowing. Please and thanks."
1522,Poppets Heart,"January 3, 2020",5," I enjoy being able to jot down quick thoughts, prayers, etc. with different lables, colors, etc. for easy reference. This is an easy to use and fun tool."
1523,Alvin Veras,"January 10, 2020",4, A lot of room for improvements. I suggest you create a separate tab where user can create table of contents of notes. Then each title on the table of contents tab is able to hyperlinked to the corresponding note entry.
1524,john jay ocio,"January 25, 2020",4, Made my medical notes organized. Handy. I just hope the searching for keywords on my notes would be easier such as highlighting the word i am looking for because sometimes i forgot which note title or titles has/have this keyword and there are bunch of words on my notes.
1525,Mickaela Baker,"January 26, 2020",4," Nice and simple, perfect for more casual notes like grocery lists. If you want something with more features, then this isn't for you. My complaint is the lack of tags, which I find crucial for my organization."
1526,Paweł Skowronek,"February 1, 2020",1, Recognizes every sequence of numbers even with dots or other signs between them as phone numbers. Very annoying.

1534,Fernanda F Affifah,"December 28, 2019",4, It's simple and minimalist. Also you can access your notes everywhere just log in to your google account but that is also the weakness. It errors most of the time when I open it on pc (not responding were on the browser).
1535,Bryan Dial,"January 5, 2020",5," Note apps are a dime a dozen... But its been years since ive looked at any of them. After I found keep, i have been completely satisfied with its simple format and numerous features... I use this app weekly."
1536,tashataffy Douglas,"December 27, 2019",4," Love it for a grocery list. What would make it better was to list items alphabetically within the checked list and the unchecked list. Ours is shared between everyone in the house, works better than any grocery app I`ve ever used. Thanks!!!"

1543,Rose Boyd,"November 27, 2019",4," Excellent place to keep your notes across phones, and not lose them. It would be nice to be able to merge notes or copy and paste more than a line of a checklist. Just thoughts. Great app tho. Love collaborating with others at the click of a button."
1544,Lord Dominator,"March 18, 2020",1, It's lagging. Takes me three minutes to write a sentence.
1545,A Google user,"December 10, 2019",5," Good app, but needs to be able to alphabetize lists. Thought that would have been a no brainer. Shopping list takes forever to find items if not so ordered."
1546,Sharmila J,"December 23, 2019",1," Horrible. One day I open this app to find all my notes are vanished. It looked brand new as the first day I installed it. Please dont rely solely on ""keep"" app. Keep a second copy of your notes somewhere else."
1547,elius ahmed,"December 30, 2019",4," I love this app very much for it simplicity & functions. But I think there should edit option like facebook post, i.e- we can view previous and version also with time. Or, At least time info i.e- created date+time and last edited date+time..."
1548,youssef raouyane,"December 17, 2019",5, The app is fantastic..it would be even better if we can highlight the word we look for within the note ...sometimes the note contains too many words /paragraphs so it would be very nice to have such option

1551,asher ngoma,"January 8, 2020",3, Its a great app. The fact that if autosaves is so convenient. Can it show the date the note was edited as well as created. This is important for an app meant for record keeping.
1552,Mary Hodkinson,"January 12, 2020",5, I absolutely 💕 LOVE 💕 this app!! I use it daily. It would be awesome if there was an option to choose colors for the labels!! I'd like to have the ability to add pictures anywhere on a page.

1556,Gyan Ranjan Pruthal,"January 10, 2020",4," Nice app for saving notes, lists etc. But, sync should have been automated in app, without being reliant on device settings. Also, password protection for individual notes might be a good idea."

What benefits do we have buying this product? Having an smartphone? Even the 90's cellphones had recorders. As an student I need to record lectures and I can't using third party apps because they don't let me block my phone and the annoying ads. Google keep stops recording when you make a pause or doesn't understand you. Google recorder just for pixels? Come on Google!"
1563,Nivedit Kumar,"December 20, 2019",4," Only basic word editting features which are available in Microsoft office needs to be incorporated I. E. attaching hyperlinks, docs, making fonts bold or italic etc. Please make it possible asap in your next update. I love to use Google keep."
1564,Nahom ናሆም,"January 5, 2020",5, Great app! Just prefer the url to be below the text when I select and save from a website. And also make the color of the link lighter from the text. It's secondary info after all!
1565,Dhrubajyoti Mandal,"December 28, 2019",4, Overall works good and easy to use. Though there are some issue in drawing part. Smart bullet makes easier to sum up things and very much compatible with native languages and there's online support. Waiting for the coustom fonts.
1566,Emily Heidi,"December 21, 2019",4, Great app for taking notes One improvement - make the widget more accessible please! I want to be able to tick off tasks from my home screen. I also want to be able to edit notes easier using the widget.

1568,hossein sheikhian,"April 3, 2020",4, Everything is great but it doesn't have locking option
1569,Justine Guerriat,"January 16, 2020",4," Very good! This is my most used app on my phone. Although, it would be very useful to have a ""merge"" option when you need to merge different notes together! That feature would make the app even better!"

1579,Henry Chan,"December 20, 2019",4, 1. Please highlight the 'found' text on searching of notes 2. Please add calendar user interface to allow notes to be organised by dates 3. It will be great to add simple calculating functions (+-*/ etc) in the notes
1580,Iestyn Evans,"December 19, 2019",5," I love this app - it keeps my life organised and I'd be lost without it. I would love a feature where you can move a note to the top of the list though, I have so many notes."
1581,Munjalsinh Mahida,"December 27, 2019",5," This is the best app for quick notes. This notes are also important and needed to be in seperate secure folder,for personal stuff. So can you add the app lock as we got in Google pay."

1601,yenasdfgay,"November 25, 2019",5, I restarted my phone and then I realized I wrote alot of important notes. I thought I lost it all but little didn't i know Google Keep Notes kept it all. I'm so thankful for this app and of course on Google. It has no ads btw.

1613,Tyran,"November 30, 2019",5," Great app for Productivity but... Please let us search notes and archived notes and have the text highlighted in the note. This would be so helpful for LONG notes like all your passwords. Please allow us to lock notes with a fingerprint, pass or pin."
1614,Craig Veness,"December 6, 2019",4," Great, especially with dark mode. Really wish I could integrate it with google assistant though, designating lists by name so I could add to them verbally without mucking around. Otherwise, it's pretty good!"
1615,Raimonds Katsens,"December 19, 2019",3," Since my Galaxy S10 Plus got upgraded to Android 10, there is no option in app settings to toggle off the dark mode. Please enable this, since the design and note backgrounds look more pleasant in light mode. Thanks."

1628,Tami Taylor,"November 23, 2019",4," Works as intended. Missing key features to make it a 5*. Such as being able to indent without checkboxes. Or allow headers (checkboxes are all lines or none, so you cannt have headers if you split the list by category)"
1629,S L,"November 23, 2019",2," All my list suddenly disappeared. Maybe, due to the touch screen. No toast message appeared for undo or any feedback so I thought at first it was gone. Also, this app is slow to open."
1630,CN Mann,"November 29, 2019",5," Good for those thoughts always running so I don't forget. It doesn't like ""new line"" in voice. Return kills Mic. Keeping Mike on while creating listing would be a great enhancement! Thanks."

1633,Alex Aerulight,"December 20, 2019",5, It's exactly what I needed. It integrates seemlessly with the way I think letting me take notes of all types and coordinate reminders into my daily routines so I end up more productive and flexible.
1634,Mohsin Ali,"January 7, 2020",4, Great App to handle the stuff with reminders. However it should add some security feature such as PIN or PATTERN. It will be lot reliable to save confidential data as well. 💯
1635,Hal Sandick,"January 10, 2020",4," Pretty Good. I like the assorment of notes, I even use the drawing. Two things. 1) Biggest issue no way to sort lists. 2) need to be able to encrypt or password protect some notes."
1636,Enslin Seekoei,"January 20, 2020",5," I truly appreciate this app, tickboxes that automatically move to completed area when ticked and the highlight option to colour code each catagory, as your ideas become hoarders you can just drop them on the app."

1653,K. M.,"January 23, 2020",3," Awesome app, should be the default note app on all devices! Loses 2 stars because it doesn't integrate with anything, especially Google Assistant or Amazon Echo! Please create an Alexa skill, for this wonderful app."
1654,Epiclifery Active,"November 15, 2019",5," Really love this app. Comes in a lot handy. Great functionality. Though it lags for me and animations are not too ""smooth"" probably because i have a ton of notes. Sync is sometimes slow."
1655,Sam Skipsey,"November 21, 2019",4," Most recent update hangs when phone has no reception and you try to add a new note (I think it's trying to make a thumbnail). This renders offline note taking risky, at best."
1656,Mabs A'Mabbin,"November 24, 2019",3," I love this app. It's so very frustrating to love a thing, make sure it's up to date then all of a sudden, it crashes and burns every time I try to use it. Thanks. Appreciate all your hard work."
1657,April Zahn,"December 1, 2019",5," Amazing App!! Use this app at least 4 times a day! I use it for grocery lists, shopping lists, reminders, keep track Christmas shopping, etc. Highly recommend it!"
1658,Robert Ford,"December 17, 2019",2," What's the point of sharing this app to allow others to change information if they still have to email me or text to tell me the changes since they can't change font color, size, bikd, underline, strikeout, anything. Samsung notes sharing is just useless and this is also. Put forth an effort google ...Full ReviewWhat's the point of sharing this app to allow others to change information if they still have to email me or text to tell me the changes since they can't change font color, size, bikd, underline, strikeout, anything. Samsung notes sharing is just useless and this is also. Put forth an effort google and fix this app."
1659,Roger J,"December 26, 2019",4, It would be great if the checked (completed) items on a checklist could be alphabetically ordered so that I can find them to reuse them more easily.
1660,Bryan Steven Lara Gómez,"January 7, 2020",5," Amazing! To the point. Easy to use and very very useful. I could say more, but I'll kept it just to a note-sized review. Wink wink."
1661,Wayne Boxall,"January 22, 2020",2, Very poor on a chromebook. Can't switch users and the lines are WAY too small. Wish you could also reject fingers and turn it into an eraser or something when using an Active stylus.
1662,Sean Jones,"January 16, 2020",4, It would be nice if images could be added in line with notes instead of like attachments. Also it would be nice to sort by multiple tags simultaneously
1663,kuber singh,"January 27, 2020",5," App is great with good looking interface...easy, handy , . But just do one thing add a lock app feature with *keep* it will be usful to private our secret notes"
1664,Devin Balentina,"February 3, 2020",3, Best note and to-do app. But why remove the manual dark mode. You should be able to set this indepent of what the OS does.
1665,Joko Nugroho,"March 31, 2020",2, Please give more feature (draw like in ios) and add pass lock with fingerprint. Thanks
1666,Bharat Litoriya,"April 14, 2020",5," Great app, work smoothly"
1667,Andrew Kalis,"November 26, 2019",4," Great notes app. Although I feel it would be better when you update your notes that the latest update would go to the top, instead of having to keep scrolling down to it."
1668,Daniel Anderson,"December 5, 2019",3, Moved over from apple and one of the main inferiorities this app has is not being able to host photos. I keep lists and soemtiems I need photo references in them but I can drop pics into the note file wherever I need to. Very annoying and dissapointing
1669,Sammy Peters,"January 5, 2020",3, There is a character limit per note which is irritating. Unable to highlight and color part of notes. Should look to Samsung notes for tips and tricks.
1670,Ahmed Nouralla,"January 4, 2020",4, Perfect app. Would be better if you added these features: 1- Password protected notes 2- Adding photos/drawings/voice/checklists notes inline with text 3- Rearranging notes in the archive 4- Live collaborative editing for notes 5- Custom colors for notes
1671,Troy Roberts,"January 1, 2020",5, Great app! I can link it with my google assistant! I would reccomend this app for anyone who does not habe the time to type in words all you have to do is tell your google assistant what to write in your note ! Excellent!
1672,Pawan Singh Tomar,"January 5, 2020",1," Worst app, as i updated the app yesterday, all my saved notes & important passwords were deleted, not a single note was remained in the app. Please do not save your notes in this app. It is a request to google team to solve this issue."
1673,Lazuardi MR,"January 30, 2020",2," The loading process after the first app installation way too slow, stuck in the loading loop"
1674,Kinley Bano,"March 11, 2020",4, I have to learn more this app how to use very well.. but was it so good.
1675,Shivendu Thakur,"April 12, 2020",5, Helpful but needs some changes
1676,Ben Schrum,"December 3, 2019",1," Latest update keeps showing toaster message ""x items remaining in list"" whenever typing on a list. It covers up the text so you cannot see what you are typing. Just started with latest update."
1677,Shane K,"December 4, 2019",1, App no longer works on wear OS. Emailed developer with no response and has not corrected the issue that has now existed over 2 months. Guess I'll have to find a non Google product that will work on their OS.
1678,stgermainb,"December 7, 2019",3, Please ad a search function within the notes. And please make them highlight the words you searched for. Similar to how it'd be on a webpage.
1679,Aleksandre Lelashvili,"December 19, 2019",3," It would be better if I could choose location (of note I want to pop-up) on a map, and adjust radius of coverage."
1680,saikat paul,"December 27, 2019",5, Been using this for nearly 2 years. Still have memo and notes of that time. Very easy to use and works very well on my phone .
1681,Highwave Vortex,"January 22, 2020",4," Really nice design and works well for note taking. Good for short notes and lists but I wish there were more formatting and rich text options (e.g. headings, subheadings, bold, etc)."
1682,AMamalala A,"January 8, 2020",5," My go-to for notes! Its easy to access & available synced everywhere! If you use pocket, Pinterest, or anything to save bits of information or pictures weblinks anything it so much easier & all just for you."
1683,Brendan Engel,"January 17, 2020",2, I was so disappointed to see that 4 days worth of important notes had been removed after a crash. Not in the archive. Not in the trash. Just gone...
1684,Soikot Saha,"January 27, 2020",1, No category system!No text export system!!No support for .memo(extension) file!
1685,Alexander Zabolotsky,"January 31, 2020",5, Cons are 1) you can't create text links 2) you can't embed pics right after the text Pros are This is the best note taking app
1686,anubhav ruhela,"January 30, 2020",5, It will be very beneficial if we get an option to include pdfs too.
1687,Lemuel Bell,"January 29, 2020",5, Good app for keeping notes. Backs up to Google drive and and reinstalled pinned notes when I updated my phone.

1700,Shravan Binani,"December 21, 2019",4, Great application linked with Google. Could you please add feature where notes can be password protected. It would be great additional feature.
1701,Antonio Namnum,"December 24, 2019",5, Best note app I have used. It will be great if it integrates with Google assistant so that I can ask Google about my groceries and it finds them in that app instead of in the assistant app. But def better than the regular notes app that comes with the phone.
1702,Pradeep Valva,"December 19, 2019",3, Very good application... I need one for feature if possible or just give an option for it Can you plz give option like last edited note shows at first place and continue I want to sort notes by last edit Thank you.

1714,Euis Maryani,"December 27, 2019",4, Please add notification when any collaborators adding data or editing notes... So we wont missed any new updates on a shared files. That would be awesome. Also can u add like a watermark or sign on whom is writing what on the notes.. So we know who's writing or editing it.
1715,Miljan,"January 23, 2020",3," Create ""Zones"" for add Location, Home place, no history on click input field for location.. App does not work as it should. Take a look on iPhone to see Reminders."
1716,Adamah Mashiach,"December 3, 2019",3," Eh... when a note is updated, it needs to be moved to recently edited to the top of the list, we have to go searching through notes to find it again... really? 'take a page' from Samsung Notes"
1717,Mohamed Emad,"December 9, 2019",5," The best noting app on android so far With dark mode and auto sync across all devices, and caring for languages direction I consider it as must-have and essential app in every phone."
1718,Sravani Sangem,"December 10, 2019",3, It's a good platform for notes copy..helps in piling pics according to need using title..but picture clarity looks great when clicked..but when later viewed..it becomes blurry..50%.
1719,S M,"December 11, 2019",5," Well I really enjoy taking notes on this app. Use it for lots of purposes! If you're looking to strike gold, use Google Keep throughout the day."
1720,Justin Rhodes,"December 13, 2019",5, Love it! Suggestion: Labels can be edited to have collaborators tied into them. You'll then be able to assign a collaborator with the label itself.
1721,Carlos Eduardo Garabito,"December 23, 2019",5," Suggestion When swiping a note at the ""Note"" page, the swiped note is archived no matter what direction it was swiped to. It would be better if the note would be deleted if swiped to the left and archived if swiped to the right"
1722,William Cooper,"January 9, 2020",3," Good app, but almost useless without a sort feature. Would be 5 stars, but alphabetizing is so essential to a checklist that it's worth 2 stars"
1723,Richard Wong,"January 22, 2020",2, There's no option to sort view by modification date / time. Users should be given more options to sort the view whichever way that suits their usage.
1724,sarim khan,"March 25, 2020",1, why there is no option to lock the notes either by finger print or by password just like samsung notes???

1737,Ali Langarizadeh,"January 11, 2020",4," Good, but OneNote is better … There isn't search within note, therefore it's useful for only short notes … Also there are some limits in features …"
1738,Mark W. Craven,"January 11, 2020",5," Use it all the time for grocery list with checkboxes, and notes with no checkboxes. Links to webpages show preview, and photos for notes and lists can be added when needed. Excellent."

1759,Lee Deskins,"January 9, 2020",4," This is a very good task management application. It can be slow and it is confusing that Tasks by Google is similar, I have settled on Keep until it gets deprecated."
1760,Donny Nizar M,"January 22, 2020",5," Great app for taking notes, especially I can keep it on my wear OS watch so it would be easier for me to catch all of those."

1765,Dinabandhu Krishna Dasa,"November 17, 2019",3," Good app. But little improvements: 1: need Notebook facility to make a group of notes like in Evernote. 2. Need tick boxes and regular text facility , both available in same Note."

This was years ago, today they make their product one to go with the other. Now the end user, you, they would rather give you the basic to fix many different issues. But documenting its every move and every update, they are making it to where the end user can fix their own issues. With the documentation that goes with every driver, switches and gateways, you can have you issue fix faster then sitting half the day on the phone waiting for tech support. Easy to use interface with many features on it, Google Keep app and other products interact, one to another. I'll not only sit here tell you how they Keep Note is. You know just download and try it for yourself. You'll see, Google, make it yours!"

Very easy to navigate because of the layout and I find that by applying different colours to different forms of note, it's a simple way to create collections.

2877,Dipen Lavana,"November 5, 2019",4, Everything is ok. But there is one loophole. There is no password protection (with fingerprint access) for your notes. It will really helps to update your undisclosed details. Just for this reason I had installed external notes app. Hope you introduce this feature ASAP
2878,Sheridan Ackiss,"November 6, 2019",5," This is the best notes app I've ever used. Would love more integration with Google Assistant though (as Assistant now just saves notes inside itself, which is annoying). Also labels and colors are super useful and I love them but folders would be useful too! :)"
2879,Shayan Azimi,"November 12, 2019",5," Such a goooood application. But it's better if i could make a labeled note by using a widget wich is specified to that label, by tapping the + button on the widget.

2900,Sanjay Thapa,"October 31, 2019",3, 3 star for the overall features. I guess the most important feature is not present- to be able to lock the notes individually which could make it a 5 star note keeping app. I hope this feature would be available in the next update.

It's great just for shopping lists and much much more it's by far the best note taking app I've found to date. It saves and loads on all devices that can either run the app or access the internet.

I'd been trying to make or find a real time shareable solution for multiple reasons for years. This app has everything I was looking for, although I'm not sure if it still has picture capability.

I like that you can check things off (haven't figured out yet how to un-check at a later time). Like the colour coding and the archiving. I like that you can ""tab"" points in to create a sub-list within your list, although I'd like to be able to do this at least twice. 4 things that would make it a 5 star app: 1) Being able to make collapsible/expandable points so that tabbed points or sub-points can be hidden. This would be great for listing recipes or managing complex tasks. 2) Having more layout options when you open the app to your active lists, such as only seeing the titles in case some things are more private. 3) Being able to create folders in the archives. I know there's a labelling system too which some people might prefer, but I do like the look and organization of a folder system, would be nice to have that option. 4) Little annoying that the tabs keep moving if I'm scrolling up and down a long list with several sub lists. Can it have be modified so you need to double tap to edit then press back to just view/tick off list like in other similar apps?"

However, the Android app is a bit frustrating because I use tags extensively - when I tag something in chrome, I cannot search my tags, or create new ones, and they are listed chronologically from when I made them instead of alphabetically, so it makes it very difficult to find the right one. To make a new tag I need to open the keep app and create it, go back, cancel out of the share screen and reopen it to see the new tag. Half the time I discover the tag already exists, I just couldn't find it in the jumbled list. :P I wish you would update this feature, it would make this app a lot more usable."

2953,Saints Tigers,"November 15, 2019",5, This is unbelievably handy and convenient. I can just make a quick note and delete it at my leisure or save something I need or won't remember for later. And it stays until I delete it no matter how many times I restart my phone.
2954,Nate Miller,"November 21, 2019",4," Great app but adding a functionality to share notes between users would make it even better, for example I'd like to be able to have a shared grocery list with my roommate to know what he's got and what I still need to get."

Icons, which used to be easily identifiable by shape, are now uniform and indistinguishable from each other.  The white color background on everything (within the desktop versions of the apps), from Gmail to Keep, makes it much more difficult to easily distinguish one item/e-mail/note from another.  Even Google Home has become a near-indecipherable mess compared to what it used to be.  This so-called 'progress' for the sake of this hypothetical 'design unity' is nothing more than an attempt at hiding the reality that Google no longer cares more about the functionality of a product than its looks.  You can't even paste text written in another app within the review field in the Google Play Android app!"

This Google-supplied service called “Google Keep Notes” is the perfect answer to this problem. It’s an app that can be installed on Windows, Apple, and Android systems and is linked to a specific Google account that you designate. You can use it to enter not only text notes and lists with a real or virtual keyboard but also hand-written notes (using a finger or stylus), pictures (that you can annotate), and (wonder of wonders) even dictation. The dictation feature is especially useful. It transcribes what you say into text and so far it’s been pretty good at getting it right, so long as I speak English. (Turkish *really* confuses it. ;-))  I never have a problem not writing anything down any more because at the very least I’m sure to have my phone with me at all times. Notes entered on one device are instantly shared across every other system that logs into your Google account and has the app installed on it.  Great app and great service. Thanks Google. --  Bob"

They blend in with the background and it's hard to locate specific notes. It might work on a larger desktop or tablet screen, but it's a nightmare on a phone. Google's new font doesn't work in a compressed note setting. The text is so large and awkward that it makes it hard to scroll through and read multiple notes. Titles are squished and condensed for pinned notes as well. I loved Google Keep and used it mostly for quick notes and shopping/book lists; however, I also liked to turn to it to write longer thoughts and ideas. The UI felt very warm and inviting, and I enjoyed the writing experience. Now I can't wait to get out the app. On the whole, I've liked Google's new UI changes and feel the draw to spend more time in their apps because the overall user experience feels pleasant. With Keep, however, the app just feels really unpleasant to be in now. Its hard to read and feels very unorganized. I'll likely be moving completely to Notebook now."

Google Keep constantly forces their own colour choices on people which I find visually irritating. Part of the benefit of having a digital product is being able to depart from the limitations of pen and paper. but Google still wants everything as black print on white (light) background. Google also forces users to think the way that Google wants them to think whereby forcing people to use labels and look through a myriad of post-it notes when it would be easier to just allow people to group things into folders, for those of us that process information visually. If I'm quickly running to a meeting, I need to be able to quickly visually retrieve the collection of notes I was working on, not trying to remember labels and look through endless notecards. I do use Keep but very minimally never anything important."

There was nothing wrong with the previous setup or font styling. It resembled a sticky note. This new rounded edge rounded font style makes things a little hard to read. The previous one had bold crisp headings and a font that everyone was used to seeing on most any platform, easily readable. If anything I would have loved to see changes made in more options (customizable) note colors, italics and bold option, highlight option, or being able to create a list with checkboxes within a note that could be struck out in place and not moved to the bottom somewhere ( I used to like that in checkbox I could strike out items and still keep them in place to use again later), etc. Also, the thumbtack is now gray and is no longer easily recognized as pinned.

It's better than Microsoft's alternative, OneNote IMO, and it is more lightweight, another benefit of this app. However, the colour palette is a bit eh, kind of hard to explain well but it doesn't really look aesthetically pleasing and a bit annoying to read on, there is room for improvement. Also, there really should be a dark mode, most people would probably agree with me here I think"

This is a great note taking app when starting off with a nice UI but eventually there becomes a point where it is impossible to organise everything because there are hundreds of notes in one long list. The tags and colours do not help much anymore as you cannot reorder notes while having a tag selected. It would also be useful to be able to minimize notes so that only the title will show before opening it to be able to view more notes on one screen at a time. The app is quite buggy with the reordering of notes as when dragging notes to a different position sometimes they change order by themselves and it takes multiple tries to get them in the right place. I don't want to change to another notes app as all the others seem to be terrible but if folders are not going to be added I will be forced to.

I need to have it on my configured-as-internal-memory SD card, and it moves to and runs from the SD card fine.

In fact the only way to deal with this is, whenever there is an update I have to actually uninstall the app, then install fresh (now the updated version), then move it to the SD card. Which is REALLY annoying, especially as there seems to be an update at least every two weeks.

I use it for remembering names, gate codes, apartment numbers, etc. It's also great for maintaining lists for everything from shopping to favorite karaoke songs.  The *ONE* feature holding me back from a 5-star review is the ability to sort lists in alphabetical order.  My shopping list, for example, is an infinitely reusable resource, since I tend to require the same things periodically. I'll check things as I purchase them, then go through and uncheck them when I need to replenish my supply. Over time, it has become a holy mess... I'm constantly scanning up and down to see if I need to add a new list item or uncheck an existing one.

The ability to sync across multiple devices automatically PLUS the fact that they have a browser based app that allows me to access the notes I typed on my phone directly to my desktop or laptop WITHOUT having to export or upload anything is honestly A DREAM. It's the most convenient thing!!! It is a shame to find out that there's noticeable latency when I'm using the handwriting function to write down notes using my Galaxy Tab A with S-pen. If the team can make the handwriting experience as smooth as Squid with its existing sync capabilities, then I'll come back and give it the 5stars because that will make this app almost perfect."

This app is just okay and suitable only to small lists(like upto 30 or 40). Anything beyond that simply makes the app slower. 2. When opening the app, it takes few seconds to 'sync'. The issue is that the editor is not locked all the while it syncs. So if you begin editing or adding a new list item before  it finishes syncing, you will get a complex cocktail list-item. Example: Assume that the first list item on the list edited on the PC is""PC last item"". If you begin typing a new list item ""NEW LIST POINT"" before it has finished syncing, then after syncing you will get a wierd list item that looks like ""PCPC lasLIST POIt itNTem"". So annoying that it made the app unusable for me. 3. Limited to only 1 child level 4. Adding collaborators was not that easy. 5. No in-list search. You can search if a given string is part of any of the multiple lists, but you can zero-down to the exact list-item line within one given list. 6. No serial numbers to help remember on which line a particular list-item appears. 7. Order of list-items used to change randomly..  Due to lack of space, I can't write more. But I am willing to help developers with specific inputs if they contact me."

There is no way I can export all my notes one at a time, it would take weeks until I finally selected them all. Why doesn't Google keep have the select all feature? Every other simple and advanced note app has that feature.  please get back in touch."

When I open the app all the notifications are flooded at once. Without notifications in time, the app misses the whole point of reminding in time. I have checked all my galaxy s9 configuration regarding notifications, deleted and re-installed the app couple of times and nothing fixes it. Feels like this app has been de-priotised and is falling back in regular bug fixes and future development. No longer an useful app, has started looking for other alternatives."

Sometimes it is very important to add some description to the notes........ 4. Not only labels, but also ""Folder management"" options. For heavy duty users....... 5. Please add some features for writing mini journal type things. Like ""Evernote"" app. I am not getting you to steal it. I am just requesting you to make features so we can decorate/change font/highlight/quote/change alignment/add list in the middle of a writing etc... 6. And etc etc.... If you find these options/feature complex, and if you are trying to give everyone a ""Simple UI"" app (with less cluttered customisation options), then please, make an option in ""settings"" menu for showing/hiding the customisation options. So only the ones who want to customise it, will turn it on and then customise it. I will write them in developer email too."

I was frustrated with the list app built in cell, so spent days trying out others. Tried by cuteness factor, but they weren't user friendly. Saw this last & thought, it's by Google, what can go wrong? I love it. Used my Bitmojis as list photos, now it's cute too. Just learning it, a few accidental deletions of lists. Can I pin it to my notifications? Then it'll be perfect"

4009,A Google user,"January 25, 2019",5, This app is useful for making and keeping notes as it syncs across devices. So one note made in one device is also made available on another device you might have using the same Google account. It's a very useful app for forgetful people like me.
4010,Siddhie Shirsat,"April 14, 2019",5, This is my favourite app for note keeping. I would love if there were some nicer widgets. You know like one with a grid view and many more.

4018,A Google user,"January 28, 2019",4," Pretty good, easy to use. I just wish there was a way to sort notes within labels, like being able to drag the notes around where you want instead of it only being in order of newest to oldest. I think folders would also be nice, overall the app is good though."
4019,Nihar Mehta,"October 19, 2018",5, The most used app on my phone. It was a hassle keeping notes of everything before I started using Keep. The latest update has brought new UI which is beautiful to look at and super friendly. Accessing notes is easy too when you're using multiple devices..
4020,Ger Vf,"October 29, 2018",3," It's a pretty simple app. What would really be helpful is when you search for something only the notes where the words you search for appear, it would be great if inside the note the word is highlighted. so it's easy to find."

4024,Katherine Monroy,"February 13, 2019",2," I really wanted to keep using this app but the main problem for me is that the ""list style"" notes does not allow to combine plain text (sub-tittle), add checkboxes and images when needed (Like Evernote does).

4070,Florentina Twongyere,"June 16, 2019",4, Great app! Minimalistic & simple to use. Highly recommended. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a security functionality that allows you to lock selected notes. It would be great if that was added.

4158,nelson cabrera,"January 14, 2019",4," This app is really good! very easy to use. One thing though, please add a feature that you could also add a table on your note so it will be easier to take note for example a price list with rows and columns."

4160,Anashya Jugmohan,"December 9, 2018",5," Easy, quick, I use this daily for everything from scheduling, reminders, to do lists and shopping lists. So easy to use together with ok Google. I just read my list out as I'm busy with other things and its saved on keep notes."
4161,Super D,"March 22, 2019",1, I have found the app called notebook it does the same things as this app but with much more features and you can set up a password so your private notes are not viewable to others. so far a much better experience. they also respond to your questions unlike google keep.
4162,Zahid Sardar,"February 1, 2019",5, Great little quick note taking app with sufficient features. Syncs with your gmail account and access the notes from a PC and i find the shared notes feature very handy. Can work on a to-do list with the Mrs and it updates for both when either party makes an edit.
4163,Donnie Maclean,"June 11, 2019",5," Superb app. Used to use Evernote, but limited to 2 devices. This app has much better functionality and useable on seemingly unlimited devices. I use it on my PC, phone, 8"" and 10"" tablets and smartwatch and it works seamlessly between them all. 6 stars. 👍😁"
4164,Mark O,"July 21, 2019",3," It's a pretty good note-taking app, and it's integrated with Google's ""ecosystem"" which is super convenient. I just wish it had text formatting. There is no way to make text bold, italic, underlined or highlighted."
4165,Raj Vinjamuri,"July 30, 2019",3," A pretty basic note app, lacking some features of apps like colornote. I use it because it is integrated into Google suite tools, like Calendar. I wish the app update notes actually were descriptive and said what they are doing to try to make this app nicer."
4166,Phillip Truong,"August 7, 2019",3, This app is great to take some short notes but it really needs a bit more features. Something close to or competing against microsoft's one note. Using the pen on my pixel book is a bit laggy. Will wait until the next update to reevaluate.
4167,Joy W,"August 23, 2019",4, Google Keep is great but it’s so easy for the finger to swipe the list and mess it up. I would suggest at the very least an area at the edge of the screen that does not trigger the list editing while swiping up and down.
4168,Sylvaen Roid Paras,"August 30, 2019",2," I REALLY wish the drawings could be better quality. If I wrote smaller, the whole thing would get blurry and I wouldn't be able to read it. Also, allowing people to send drawings as photos would be very nice."
4169,Renrumata,"September 24, 2019",4," please add multi-column view but not detailed, so it is only show the title. and also fix your highlighted text color in dark theme, the note color is dark and the highlight color is black.. i know i can change the note color, but dark is the most color i use and it's default color"
4170,Sanjukta Sarkar,"October 9, 2019",5," I still haven't used a phone, where the first thing I did was not to download this app. I have been using this app, since forever, since the Xperia days, to be precise. Keep never disappoints! Keep never lets you forget! This is definitely a very, very special app!"
4171,Michael Chow,"October 10, 2019",3," The app is great until I've reached the label limit of 50. For someone who uses it for day to day note taking, 50 labels are definitely not enough to keep all his notes well categorised. Sent a feedback to Google and desparately want to have a corresponding update coming out shortly."

4190,Tim Gage,"October 19, 2018",1, This latest upgrade is a step back in terms of visual design. Fonts are harder to read. Alignment of check boxes is off. Colours are less appealing. As a frequent user of this app I am very disappointed.
4191,Valentin Dugan,"March 19, 2019",5," Using the app for years now and is an amazing app, but lately got issues with it: when open appears a blanck screen and i have to reinstall the app, and when i try to reinstall from google play it takes for ever. I hope you fix it."

4193,Scott Stenman,"February 6, 2019",2," It be useful to be able to have a shortcut to the main page or to have it displayed like 'memo', but no. Also, if you accidentally turn off checkmarks, you have to create a new list to get 'em back, not good."
4194,Ayo,"January 18, 2019",4," Just one thing is lacking and I'll appreciate if it's added. The ability to add voicejournals and videojournals for unlimited duration. Also, I'll prefer you remove the Google voice for recording the voicenotes. Thank you and God bless you."

4196,Zaved Ali,"January 25, 2019",5," The best note keeping app. The best part is I can use it both in web and mobile. I don't frequently need to use my phone in work; if something is interesting I can save it on ""keep"" and later look it on my phone at home."
4197,Divesh Thapa,"September 29, 2018",4," Thanks for such great app! 🤓😘Which I'm searching for last 7 years. Finally my wish complete. Awesome features, makes easy every task and work. Adding more, if you have save/backup option for phone or external memory. Hoping for updates. 😀"
4198,Bhavesh Rathod,"November 13, 2018",3," Please make so that when a keyword inside a note is searched, tapping on the result takes the user to that specific line where the word is inside the note. highlighting the word will also help along with what I just suggested. Hope u add that functionality!"
4199,A Google user,"January 4, 2019",3," Very nice, available across all Android and online for free unlike others. Unfortunately shared notes in particular and notes in general crash frequently on Samsung devices. The app also has pen handwriting to text input support but crashes very frequently when you try to use it."
4200,D E,"October 3, 2018",3," Nice and easy to use. Todo list is a nice feature. However critically lacks in a proper search function that jumps to the key word in a long note, and not having basic text formatting (bold, italized, underline) is quite a drawback"
4201,Ana Kovziridze,"September 29, 2018",5," I don't write reviews, but this one is my FAVORITE app! Just amazing for organizing thoughts, lists, and everything! And it saves online and offline. Thank you!! 👏👏👏"
4202,William Dodd,"October 26, 2018",1," Why do you have to make major appearance changes to familiar apps? I DO NOT LIKE the new, smaller, san-serif font that I had no choice to accept or not. Please add a facility for the user to select fonts more appropriate to his/her circumstances."
4203,Chahide Filipe,"December 21, 2018",5," I like the new design - clean and amazing to the eyes! Good job guys! Suggestion: I feel like the app would improve a lot more if there was an option to save the words in bold, italics and underlined forms..."
4204,Kevan Sheridan,"January 15, 2019",5, i use this app for short term and long term notes. Labels help keep things organized for quick searching. being able to set one time and/or recurring reminders also helps a lot.
4205,Joseph Katala,"May 7, 2019",3, not bad. it's functional but I think I can be better if a feature that allows me to add pictures to my list or notes was included. That would help me a great lot. I remember more when I see a pic that just words
4206,DL Nation Media,"April 12, 2019",5," life saver, Had a problem with my phone so i had to restart it. lost half of my apps and stuffs. But i never lost any of my memos. Everything came back the moment i logged in. All my words are back. Perfect App!!!"
4207,Keith West,"October 31, 2018",3," Good replacement of my Colornote app but I am forced to keep using Colornote because this app has no locked note feature for confidential notes. The other issue is that at first, it was difficult to find the new note icon."
4208,nilesh patel,"May 18, 2019",4," One of the best apps to make and take notes....

4210,Jens Krämer,"October 29, 2018",1," One of my most frequently used apps, and they just ruined the looks of it. Why does everything have to have rounded corners now? What happened to material design? Don't break things that simply worked, just because you can."
4211,Kevin Schmitt,"February 15, 2019",4," great app and love the ability to collaborate with others real time, but transferring notes from my samsung notes app to this app is prehistoric. I have to basically have to copy/paste 5 years worth of notes to make a full crossover to this app"
4212,Aashish Bomma,"April 23, 2019",4," The app is very good..I have been using keep for more than a year now but, the problem is, we store secretive information like the passwords, it would be appropriate to provide app lock for the app alone as not all phones come with inbuilt AppLocks"
4213,Alexandru,"March 1, 2019",3," The awful thing about this app is the fact that the actual number of characters is limited. And the limit level is pretty low, like I've noted about 20-30 (approximately) standard book pages and now can't continue bc of that stupid restriction."
4214,Willian Macedo,"May 4, 2019",1," Very limited. No options to import notes database from other apps, modifying creation dates or even adding passwords to your notes. The ability to tag notes should also be added. So... a good app if your life is basically going to the grocery store."
4215,Mississippi,"October 31, 2018",5," Alright listen up, 1. We need a search button to find things within one note 2. We also need a way to convert check boxes to a numbered list and vice versa. In case anyone was wondering what else could be done."
4216,Paulina K,"May 2, 2019",5," works 100 times better then evernote or pocket. I just discovered this and I am amazed. I also downloaded an extension on my pc's chrome browser. Please keep this app- it is great. Pocket doesnt save my clips and evernote , you can't paste a URL. This is my favorite app as of now."
4217,Paul S,"December 8, 2018",3," Although it's one great, simplistic, go-to app for making a note of what I need to remember, my saved notes have gone all over the place for no reason – like words that have been deleted and scrambled."
4218,Bianca MM,"February 4, 2019",4, Great little app that you should publicise more. It does so many things and is extremely useful. I use it from storing recipes with the excellent grab text function to sharing in real time collaboration lists with my family. Love it! Should integrate it better with other Google apps such as calendar
4219,Brian Njihia,"May 30, 2019",5," Really good app!! This is the 'Notes' app I've been looking for; it has both light theme and dark theme, and the notes written are accessible in every device as long as you sign in to your account. Thanks for the app!!!"
4220,Rocco Pasquini,"June 9, 2019",4," I think its a greqt application. Very Helpfull and really really easy to use. my biggest gripe wirh it and is probably the rrason why i dont use it as much, is because i can't password protect what i think are sensitive notes. Hence the 4 stars."
4221,Christopher Beckmann,"June 15, 2019",4, I really like this app and the fact that all your notes are saved across devices. This makes it easy to not forget anything. I would really appreciate simple text styling possibilities...like being able to make the text bold or italic..
4222,Stephen Laurette,"June 26, 2019",3," I've been using Keep for years and have always loved it, but I have to downgrade the rating because it's suddenly killing my battery. Just running in the background, with no widget and not having opened it all day, it has used 23% of my battery."
4223,Meahgan Renee Feudo,"July 16, 2019",4," Everything's good and fine BUT when I was memorizing the notes I took, I thought of highlighting the already memorized lines but I couldn't find an option for it. It would be great if you could highlight texts."

4226,Dianne McLay,"August 1, 2019",5," Easy to use. You can arrange your notes in a way that makes sense to you, simply by dragging and dropping. They sync across my devices. I like that you can also capture drawings and photos and paste text from other apps."
4227,charli SEX,"September 6, 2019",5," I love it. I've been using Keep for years now. It's customizable, user-friendly, and simple. It is also fun seeing my notes from years ago through its Sync feature. Thank God for this app, my life's at ease."

4230,Barbara Rolfes,"October 26, 2019",5," I have just used it to write things down that I normally would have written down on anything.

4231,Rennan Reis,"October 28, 2019",5," I use it in a daily-basis. Very useful and intuitive. The feature I like the most is the ability to have all the information shared between my devices. But, it would be very useful if we had new ways to organize our notes, suck as a flip chart ou maybe a kanban."
4232,Tim Galos,"October 31, 2019",4," Usually great, sometimes it will be buggy, such as unable to copy /paste. Restart fixes it though."

4264,Faith Smith,"August 7, 2019",4, I love it but ... not integrated with Google assistant! I will give 5 stars when I am able to use my assistant to add to my Google keep lists again. Which is what I used my Google home minis for when I bought them. I HATE the new shopping list app that my Google assistant defaults to now.

4266,Andrea Hughes,"August 31, 2019",5, I really like all of the options for prioritizing my everyday routine by using the color pads. It becomes essential tool for me getting in things done in my daily life. Like getting my grocery list down to sending off work on a time deadline.
4267,Shaden Hartze,"September 14, 2019",4," Absolutely love this app. Never have to worry about losing my notes again... Small suggestion could you please add bold, italics, underlined and highlights features if possible. Thank you for a great way to save my notes"
4268,Kerman Mistry,"September 18, 2019",3, It's a very basic notes app. Please add the feature to search within a note and I'll give 1 more star. Please allow handwritten notes to co-exist with normal text within a note and not just at the top and I'll give 5 stars. Thanks :-)
4269,Ibtissem Ouzaa,"October 1, 2019",4," The app is amazing and greatly helpful. HOWEVER! Those two arrows down page the app are not working and I can't know why. Whenever I press the ""previous"" or ""forward"" arrow, the app directly shuts down. why so?"
4270,Prabhudatta Dash,"October 10, 2019",3, Well this is really a simple and fast tool for notes and reminders. But few additional features would make it awesome:- 1. Password protected 2. We can add checkbox to notes ( without converting whole note to checkbox that is currently present)
4271,Maureen,"October 15, 2019",1," This was my most reliable app until a week or so ago when ALL the information on it disappeared. I can't replicate the loss. I notified Google about it twice, but, of course, there is no reply. Extremely upset."
4272,Buang Monaledi,"October 15, 2019",5," I am so thankful for this App! I absolutely looove it! It lives up to its name by keeping my notes. My phoned had crashed and I thought I lost all my notes, but Google Keep kept all of them for me. Thank you for your excellent work!"
4273,Joey McNeill,"October 17, 2019",3," Major problem. You can't save your information to your device. It only exists in the cloud. So if you get your Google account hacked and you can't access it, you lose all your information instantly until you get your Google account back. It's a very insecure situation."
4274,Leppy,"November 14, 2019",1," Orginally had massive slowdown issues, tried to reinstall and now I cant even scroll through my notes. How could google make such a broken mess"
4275,Debbie Dean,"November 30, 2019",4, I love Google Keep for lists and quick notes but I really want Google assistant integration so I can add to my shopping lists on the fly.

4282,El-Rey Ortiz,"March 25, 2020",4, Its always came in handy
4283,Goku_Senpai,"April 24, 2020",5, This app is just amazing.
4284,Jessica Leong Sin Yi,"November 4, 2018",5," Fantastic app! Please consider to add font, for us to bold, italic, underline etc. It will also be more useful if we can highlight the text. THANK YOU! Please consider using less neon colours for the note background."
4285,vincent holloway,"March 19, 2019",5, I can type when inspiration hits and drop information on to a page with ease. Helpful for shopping with the tick box. I am able to draw or insert a photo to illustrate what I am thinking.
4286,Ahmed Tayea,"November 23, 2018",4, The app is Great but a little suggestion .. Could you add the option of making labels coloured ? Like every label has its own colour and once i label a note it gets that colour automatically .. i think it will be much more helpful and visually easier

If you can do that you will definitely get 5 stars."
4288,A Google user,"March 24, 2019",5," Clean and easy to use, I use this app daily and its never let me down. The UI is simple and uncluttered, sync across all my devices is very handy. If Google can bring back assistant saving shopping list to keep it would be better."
4289,A Google user,"March 22, 2019",4," When i try to make a drawings it doesn't respond well. For the next upgrade please try to fix it. Overall the application is quite good but not the drawings, Thanks!"
4290,Cody Taylor,"May 25, 2019",5," Every update this gets closer to a perfect notes app. The only reason I still use more than one app for notes at this point is that Keep, as far as I can find, does not have an option to lock a note with a password."
4291,Kewal Haria,"April 30, 2019",2," Sometimes it just takes so long for the notes to get updated and sync!! Really annoying!!! Sometimes because of it, I have lost some of my information which I thought got saved. Otherwise I really like the app."
4292,William Jenssen,"October 25, 2018",5," I love the app, and the new sleeker minimalistic redesign of the website! Much easier to use, and even seems speedier, after initial load in. Great work! One of my most used apps, and websites!"

4294,Musique Munkiiedude,"October 18, 2018",5," Awesome! The latest update has a great font and UI which are way better than previously. Now looks cleaner, short sentences not enlarged like used to. Gosh I only found out later evening and I had to review this on the spot!"
4295,Eloi Bigorra,"October 20, 2018",3," Great app, but I have a suggestion, it could have the option to put notes as a notification in the notification panel. It would be faster for quick reminders than selecting the time and day..."

4297,Laxmikant Mali,"February 12, 2019",4," Best Note Taking App, but - 1. Should have Multiple Notebooka in it 2. Should have two notes inside a note feature 3. Should have 'Lock A Note' feature for security purpose 4. Should Have More colors options. 5. Should have More Handwriting options."

4300,Patrick,"April 4, 2019",2, I feel every personalization application should be in-app password protected. if not necessarily then you should provide an option to set a password to open the application. that's what privatization means. otherwise it is like all common apps available.
4301,Cristian Pannuto,"May 14, 2019",3," The UI is very pretty, but I'd prefer it if everything in all of my notes didn't appear on the main screen. Missing simple text editing (bold, italics, underline), and making notes password protected would be nice."
4302,Nikolay Sokolovskiy,"October 9, 2019",5," helps to keep track of all sudden thoughts and ideas. I've reached the maximum labels (100) limit, and I need more. now i had to use titles to mark separate category of idea. but thats is limiting, can't do review by tags."
4303,Ryan Brooks,"October 27, 2018",2," Been using Keep for years but the recent update change to the UI has made it very slow to operate, especially if you have images. When re-ordering items on 'list' mode they will also go out of order."
4304,Jason Peters,"December 4, 2018",3," Awesome app - but could you please look in to why the search functionality doesn't work any longer? I use keep all the time and need that search working please. Tried emailing the app help address for this, but it's a no reply address."

4306,rahul pathak,"October 25, 2018",1, Why this new update. Previous version is good why you are making it worst. No colour to pin. Font is very bad to read why you make this update when original was very good. Very disappointing. Horrible version. Please bring back old version
4307,A Google user,"October 27, 2018",4," Everything is good. Especially I like the new Material design. It makes an interaction with the app easier and more enjoyable. But unfortunately there are some freezes which ruin all satisfaction. Fix them, please."
4308,Bala Krishnan,"September 18, 2018",4," Hi, I love this app. But the small issue is I am not able to set the reminder properly in my desktop Google chrome. If I customize the time and try to save. The time is not at all changing."
4309,sami hailu,"May 4, 2019",5," Downloaded it and opened it, and straight away the design and layout impressed me. Even the extra features like being able to pin something was really nice. I'm happy I found something better than Samsung Notes and it can help me a lot"
4310,Shikhar Sinha,"November 30, 2018",5," Great job! I love it and I'm now using this app instead of docs! Very impressive. Just want Google to bring security feature to lock this app, like you have done with G-pay! Loved it!"
4311,Tino Khobirudin,"January 2, 2019",5," application that really helps me to remember anything and what I need to note. without having to bother carrying notebooks everywhere.

4312,Sathya Narayanan,"March 20, 2019",4, Great app. Only problem is this app doesn't have lock option. So I can't save some important files and documents which I don't want to be seen by others. Please fix this problem in next update.
4313,Christopher Parker,"June 2, 2019",5, In my opinion this is the best note taking app by far. Mainly because its a Google app so you know whatever you save to the cloud will be there an be safe forever. I use this app everyday for everything having to do with notes or documents.

4317,Ayeni Emmanuel,"July 17, 2019",4, The app is quite good and I love the fact that it synchronize on time. But I'll like it to have a notification sound when a collaborator edits a note. Either a sound or pop up notification will be good.

4321,Meet Sheth,"September 22, 2019",5, This is great app to keep all your important notes across all devices just by syncing it with your google account.. My personal suggestion is that if you can add tables in this to keep some notes organised in a tabular format. Please add this feature if possible
4322,shotsbyehsan,"September 28, 2019",1," The app is not bad but for a company like Google I was expecting alittle bit more of a user friendly platform. The tick boxes are so annoying. If you tick one line then the whole note gets ticked, make it so where you can choose which like get it or not. Similar to one plus 6 notes"
4323,Piolo Aralar Pascual,"October 7, 2019",3," App is great, but the widget isn't great, looks outdated. The reminding system for daily list/task isn't great. You guys should merge ""Google Task"" and ""Google Keep"" for a better UX. Task should be integrated with Google Calendar."
4324,Vishesh,"October 27, 2019",4," It's good, but y'all should add an option to group notes together and while adding an image, just add a some basic tool like to crop, flip or rotate the image inside only! Right now, I've to crop the image externally and then add it to a note! Rest is such a great experience"

4332,Amantin Mehilli - Panos,"November 3, 2018",5, I think it's great. Please ➕ add a minimize button on the tags in the left. Sometimes when you want to go to archive or settings you don't always want to scroll down. Thanks!
4333,Marty Galvin,"April 21, 2019",3," Needs additional views. this is a good app, but it would be great if you could display just the title. this would really cut down on the scrolling. there's no need to display as much of the note. add one more view option..."

4337,Jamey Tollefson,"May 6, 2019",5," Keep is one of my favorite apps. Seriously. My wife and I share list's often, and Keep makes it easy for either of us to edit a list and the edits show up on both of our devices."
4338,Ray Wang,"November 19, 2018",4," Great app overall. One thing that is really annoying for me. When you have really long notes and try to search for a keyword, it can only show you which note it is in due to the limited space."
4339,Bassam Bussal,"December 20, 2018",2," It's a very nice basic notes app, one major drawback is that it doesn't have a Windows app to access the notes (like desktop sticky notes), and you can only access the notes through a website"
4340,Carson Cheung,"December 17, 2018",3," Generally speaking, the app is great, love it a lot. What I really hope to see is the function to let user has more various options on editing the text and the layout. Eg: Bold text, underline..."

4344,Herman Shipalana,"January 7, 2019",4," This is a great App for taking notes, its very light on storage and processing, the notes display as tiles this is great but the notes tend to get scatered though it would be great if they could be dragged to different locations."
4345,Faiz Akmal,"October 30, 2018",4, Love the new updates! I would like to suggest for Google team to put the total number of notes for each Label in the main menu section. Makes it easy to monitor if there is any notes missing.

4347,Shkelqim Ahmeti,"October 24, 2018",1, After the update it's a nightmare.. you can't find the content when you are searching for a specific note. Before worked so good. Now after the update total garbage. Please do something to fix it

4350,CameronAndMeredith Nelson,"March 18, 2019",1," Worked fine until the most recent Android security update patch to my phone, now the app just freezes when I try to open it or do anything with it. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't even help."
4351,Jani Nummela,"October 26, 2018",2," Another update rolled out, but one bug just stays year after year. Any number with more than 3 digits still gets underlined and treated as a phone number. This makes Keep totally useless in any role that includes finances, budgets etc."
4352,BEING NETWORK,"November 8, 2018",5," Great for keeping a memory log, quick & important notes reminders.It is also a great tool for writting mini stories or blog updates. We use it everyday for our daily to do list with check off boxes. Highly Recommended for personal & business use."
4353,Kumar Gaurav Singh,"December 7, 2018",4," Awesome, material design update gives a new life to it. Google made it more attractive, and reliable. One concern, please integrate it with Google task. It is so helpful."
4354,Robert Novak,"May 11, 2019",5," Simple, easy, and effective. I keep re-downloading this app to sync notes across every device. It's the only reminder app that works for me, and the best note-taking app. Bravo!"
4355,Garvey Smith,"October 18, 2018",3," I LOVE Keep. I use it for everything, but the new super minimalist UI is very hard on the eyes and I find myself assigning colors to every note just to make them stand out because everything is very white."
4356,ליה סבלסקי,"December 10, 2018",5," The app is great, but sometime, if I use it for a long time and use many functions (like moving notes to the archive, using tabs) the apps closes and I can't open it again."
4357,Mohammed Sirajul Islam,"September 15, 2018",5," It is light and simple.. thus fantastic. However, I am having some issue of using google keep widget in the front screen. It shows "" Apps is not installed in your device"". Earlier it was working"
4358,Sydney McCracken,"March 5, 2019",4," Great, simple app! My only real complaint is that I wish I could lock the note with a pin or password like on Apple. It was the most used feature for me and I do miss it since going to the Pixel 3!"
4359,Ahmed RS,"November 9, 2018",5," I like it because I can share my notes across all my devices Android iOS and chrome… sorry I mean Windows, no really why there is no app for windows?! That why I gave you three stars, just grow up and released a windows version. Otherwise I love ❤ it."
4360,Dave E,"March 22, 2019",2," re-sorts different lists. say you have shopping list on left and a few others and a couple of other lists on the right. It sometimes swaps them over!! Why? if i put it on the left, i want it to stay on the left!!"
4361,A Google user,"November 6, 2018",3, Would like to give 4 stars but it has one issue of search.If I search some word then it will show the list in which the searched word is. But it does not show that particular word in the list. I have to check whole list to search .

4364,Brandi WL,"September 18, 2018",2, Lists that are accidentally deleted which this phone tends to do are not recoverable with this app. I have lost so much information. It just deletes whole lists and there's no undo or recovery. Searching for another app to keep my lists.
4365,Miss Pix A.,"September 29, 2019",1, 29 September 2019: No change. Still junk. Still frequently hanging & freezing. A long time ago it was ok but Google ruined it when they stopped letting it store data on the device. It scares me to think that a company which has this much trouble with IT is supposedly safeguarding my privacy.
4366,Ernesto Wong García,"May 28, 2019",4," Great app, use it all the time. I'm just baffled by the first screenshot here: Google complies with US blockade of Cuba by making some services unavailable to the country, but won't hesitate to use it for advertising purposes."
4367,Rakibul Islam,"August 3, 2019",3," 1)Word limit should be increased, I can not save a longer Paragraph, story or others. I can't save long paragraph. 2) a security system could be added. because some notes or writing we have to hide or save safely."
4368,Joshua Doxsee,"July 8, 2019",2, Needs a widget for a particular list or checklist - similar to google drive documents. without a widget the app is more cumbersome to use. I'm sure i would use it more with the widget. Otherwise it has potential to use daily.
4369,VIJAYA SANKAR ALURU,"July 27, 2019",4, Excellent. All the data stored was retrieved even installed and opened in other device also. Just experienced it. Thank you Google Keep for providing this. I am sure with Google Keep you can always protect your files and data safe. It is as good as its name KEEP it SAFE.
4370,Douglas Scarth,"July 25, 2019",3," It works fairly well and is really easy to use, however the reminder functionality is very lacking. whenever i set a reminder it forgets to tell me in 9/10 cases, which is kind of idiotic."
4371,Taylor Gastineau,"August 2, 2019",4, I like this note keeping app especially cause it's by google which means I'll never lose them. but what would make this app a 5 star for me is if it had a voice recorder too. or if google made a a voice recording app so I wont lose my recording if I lose or brake my phone. please Google help me out.
4372,Violet Skye,"September 23, 2019",5," I love that you can draw, make checklists and include images. It has been an amazing tool that helps me plan and sort my daily and long term tasks and events. I give it 7 🌟 out of 5!!"
4373,Douw Steyn,"September 12, 2019",5," I love this app for one reason. It is simple and slick. No complicated setting or keeping a note. Since I started using it years ago I went though a few phones. You just download it to the new phone, log in, and all your notes will be there."
4374,Ashton Michael,"September 29, 2019",5," This app is great for keeping notes, and making reminders. My phone didn't come with any note app so this was the next best thing and plus the reminders sync up with my Google Calendar so I can just view my calendar for my reminders as well the app too. I strongly recommend."
4375,Filip Žužić,"October 8, 2019",4," It would be great if you could use checkboxes and normal text in the same note simultaneously (something that Samsung notes has). Also, the possibility of indenting checkboxes twice (instead of just one time) would be nice."
4376,Sudhin NS,"November 5, 2019",5, Fantastic app with great UX and UI. Its really user friendly. Good work team... Keep it up.
4377,Ranak Merchant,"November 6, 2019",2," Hi, having multiple accounts on same device, keep is not providing correct labels in correct account, whats the solution?"
4378,Manta Pogi,"November 26, 2019",5," It's a very nice app to use for organizing my plans, reminders, checklist and notes."
4379,URIEL GONZALEZ,"January 22, 2020",5, Perfect. Better than Evernote
4380,Victoria Richardson,"January 28, 2020",5, Very nice app.... Keeps me organized
4381,Jalos Matukang,"February 4, 2020",1, The new update this apps isn't working and. How to do the notes
4382,A Google user,"October 31, 2018",2," The new UI update sucks compared to the old one. It just looks bad and cluttered. I was hoping for some Classic UI options in the Settings, but there is none. Too bad. Hopefully, an APK of the older version resolves this."
4383,Katie Lam,"March 25, 2019",3, When I would want to scroll down or up my fingers would cause the dot points to move (then I have to put them back) which is why I stopped using the app. Every other feature of the app is great
4384,Windle Dela cruz,"October 4, 2018",5, This is the app note that im looking for. I really liked it! Great app. One thing i think is missing with this app ' password protection' if you include it on next update that would be great! This app will become perfect! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
4385,Aloke Banerjee,"November 15, 2018",1, Notes of my one phone is not appearing in my other phone which have the same gmail id . The only reason i installed this app is the cross platform compatibility. but it seems like it is not working properly.
4386,PJ Murdoch,"October 9, 2018",4," Great app. Love having somewhere to take notes easily. I would like an option to have to enter a pin, password or biometrics to open the app or certain notes. Please try to add that Google."
4387,Chris Aylward,"December 8, 2018",3," Was great and used for years, but now can't search for notes on android phone, so it's become useless for me. Have uninstalled all apps that could conflict, restarted machine, cleared cache etc., no joy."
4388,A Google user,"January 19, 2019",5, Love using keep. It helps to learn how to get organized or at least let's you know you need to get organized. It's a great customizable and multipurpose utility.
4389,Sherice Hayes,"December 3, 2018",4," It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles but it gets the job done. I would like to be able to change the color of this and the calendar app. I would also like to be able to to set multiple alarms for a note. Like a to-do today, this week, or this month option."
4390,Educated Lady,"November 5, 2018",3, Some time ago my app stop sending me notifications for reminders. I did the update hoping that the reminders which start back up and this is not happening I cannot find any help online to make the reminder start again when I set the time. Please help
4391,Pedro.G B.S,"November 6, 2018",5," Really great app. One suggestion is: make the text of the notes a little more editable, so we could be able to at least change characters to Italic, Bold; maybe even Strikthrough and Monoscape..."
4392,David D,"November 13, 2018",5, Seems like a convenient way to sync notes across various Android devices. Doesn't have a bunch of distractions and complexities. One of the best Google phone apps.
4393,Vimal Bhatt,"March 8, 2019",3," nice app but still it should be protected by password just as in Google pay. please provide the protection because we stored password,pin, personal details,etc in this keep app. please provide it. currently i am giving 3 stars only because of lack of security"
4394,Adrian Wood,"October 19, 2018",3," Great in theory, but it keeps screwing up my notes upon saving them, losing or mangling the content. I can't rely on it, so it's useless to me. This didn't used to happen."
4395,Tibor Keser,"May 1, 2019",5, Best note taking app by far. Long time user of Evernote but just can't stand the design any longer. Keep is great and storing things in it doesn't count against my storage which is great for organizing snapshots of things I have in my closet or garage etc.
4396,Asish Kumar,"January 5, 2019",3," Keep is very useful for jotting down quick notes, grocery list, etc. But most of the time I miss some text formatting options, like when I need to make a line bold/italics/coloured to hightlight tge major detail in the note."
4397,Mel B,"December 4, 2018",1," I've used Keep for a while now, but it suddenly started using excessive mobile data. It used half of my data for the month running in the background. Uninstalling and looking for a new note app"
4398,dongxu he,"December 18, 2018",5," Best note I every used. 2 suggestion: 1. Remove the ""Remove"" button if you don't want us use it. or rename it as destroy. It is confusing with document. 2. link the color with tag. Good job!"
4399,Kamil Olah,"October 28, 2018",2," Good app, but last update disabled search!!! It does not work correctly! Please fix it. Please give option to order notes based on the last change! Lastly edited note should be on top! Please implement this option!"
4400,A Google user,"October 18, 2018",5," I love this app it's just what I need for taking little notes without all the garbage that some of the bigger apps have. Only thing I could wish for is Alexa integration but, I just don't see that happening."
4401,Lucy Guzman,"November 30, 2018",5," Perfect for short and long notes, to do lists, sharing info and lists with others and for others to edit as well. I find it very useful and I use it almost every day."
4402,Μήτσος,"April 10, 2019",1, Doesn't allow you to select all notes. You have to manually click one every one of them. Doesn't show you how many notes are in each category. People complain that they lost data from updates. Of course I'm not going to use it.
4403,Alex Z,"March 18, 2019",1," Doesn't work at all right now. When I click the + to add a new note, or when I tap to look at a note I've already made, it white screens and doesn't do anything else. Reinstalled and it still doesn't work."
4404,A Google user,"October 29, 2018",2, We want a dark theme already. Hurts the eye at night when u dont have lots of notes. Also add some Nice sounds when you check an item for checklist. Currently feels plain and boring. Other than this good app.
4405,Peter Gordon,"November 14, 2018",3," I hate the new theme. It has NO colour at all, just white on white. Come on Google, surely your design spec mentions it's a bad idea to have everything the same colour? Even the title bar being yellow would be enough to fix this."
4406,James Kozel,"November 11, 2018",5," Love this app, but it keeps reordering the items I move around. I wish they would stay where I drag them to. Sometimes after signing out and signing back in a while later, checked items are then back on my list unchecked."
4407,Freida,"November 3, 2018",4, The only thing missing is the ability to sort notes into albums or subcategories. I've been using it to catalog my makeup and track what I use in different looks. It's very simple!
4408,Viraj Mathur,"December 3, 2018",5," The Material 2.0 design makes the looks of this app incredible! It does what it's supposed to do making it super handy to pick out notes from any of my devices. All I'll say is, an app well made!"
4409,Carl Laraway,"January 18, 2019",5, A nice app for taking notes that I have used for years now. It syncs with your Google account meaning you can access your notes elsewhere. Like a PC or whne you get a new phone.
4410,Advait Lohokare,"May 7, 2019",3," The app is really useful. And I would rate it higher on the scale if Google provides a feature that would allow us to delete duplicate notes. Currently, that is the only issue that I face. Are you reading this Google?"
4411,MW,"September 26, 2018",5," Love this app, notepad I can write on when I don't have paper. Link reminders with notes. Take pictures, widget on homescreen allows me to see notes and scroll through for easy access. Really makes life a little easier."
4412,Mad Mysterious Cat,"December 14, 2018",5," Oh my goodnesssssszz!!!!! Yes! Thank you Goggle for making this! I really loved it, as iiiinnnnn!!!!! I have saved more than 50 notes on this app and it still works swiftly!!!! All I saved was prayers, bible verses, etc."
4413,Himanshu Bansal,"April 13, 2019",2," 1. although app is good, but i am missing copy pasting stuff from keep to other application and vice versa. 2. There are no proper way to organise our notes. 3. No way to remove all checked items list out of our dashboard."
4414,Linden Leishman,"November 7, 2018",4, ATTENTION GOOGLE! Please put a feature in keep to be able to search for a certain phrase within a note and then have it display as highlighted text! It would make it so much easier to be able to locate text within parts of a notepad!
4415,A Google user,"November 27, 2018",4," The option to add a specific time to a reminder should be the standard option, rather than having to select it from a drop down menu of vague morning, evening, night time frames."
4416,Melissa Heldwein,"October 4, 2018",3," Scrolling to the bottom of the list to add to it is inconvenient. Should be able to add directly under headings and subheadings. Also, would be more helpful to be able to indent more than once."
4417,Ray WH,"December 27, 2018",5, I love Google Keep and how it helps me organize all the things I need to be in one place. It's amazing because it doesn't make you pay for any special features like other annoying apps. Thank you Google!
4418,praveen kumar,"November 4, 2018",3," Great app but the only small problem is that if i have a sudden idea and open up keep and start typing, i lot of times end up typing in the search bar. Then i have copy paste them into a note while forgetting half of the idea."
4419,Akshay,"February 17, 2019",4," It'd been perfect if the following features were present: - Ability to merge notes/lists - Move selected items to a different list/notes - Auto group items based on category. If you can, forward this to the right team. Thanks! 😉"
4420,Alexander Emmanuel Pacheco,"December 29, 2018",1, The all-white redesign is blindingly awful. And switching between accounts is now in the upper right as a drop-down rather than swiping left twice in the upper left as in Every Other Google App. Who asked for this? Who approved this?
4421,Angela Liu,"July 23, 2019",1, Keep usually doesn't show me my reminders even if I wait hours. It's also not consistently showing me my reminders on my Google calendar when that happens. Please fix!!! I'll update my review and rating after it's fixed!
4422,Zoltan Pruzsinszki,"November 15, 2018",2," I like the new simple design, but since the latest update the search function doesn't work at all on Android 8.0 (Samsung S7). Without this function the app is quite useless for me."
4423,SoulHee,"July 5, 2019",4," I liked this app it is very useful... I think it would be better if you add the option to underline words on your notes, if you add this option it will become much better. Thank you!!"
4424,Dawn Mccoskey,"June 11, 2019",5, great app.does everything . i can draw my project put the measurements with color. list what i need for my project . along with it has reminder. couldn't live without it. i recommend it to everyone.
4425,Sjors dW,"June 15, 2019",1, Absolute rubbish. Trying to use it for sharing a groceries list at home but half the time does not sync up. Just keeping notes for yourself is all it does well. but there are hardly any way to markup the text.
4426,Denise Gandelman,"November 11, 2019",4, After the last two updates it crashes every time I open it.
4427,Thanapong Niyomkar,"July 8, 2019",2," It was amazing at first, but the last few updates makes the apl super slow to the point it's unbearable and unusable. I even think that make a note on Google Docs might be a better choice at this point. This app have potential, if we can use it."
4428,Tahir Bayramov,"July 12, 2019",5," Best out there, but please let us have an option to choose whether we want to archive the note or just save and exit it. ""Undo archive"" is not that much good to do everytime you save the note."
4429,Norene Griffin,"July 11, 2019",5, I've tried a lot of apps for keeping lists. this is the only one I've wanted to keep using. It's very intuitive. Has the features I want. Not cluttered with features I rarely or never use.
4430,Agus Fadillah Sani,"August 2, 2019",4," This application is great! There is only one that I don't like. Please update in the future plus the Quick Reply feature in the notification panel as ""Mark as done"" for reminders, so that I don't have to always open Keep first, then give it Mark as done."
4431,Jim Noonan,"August 26, 2019",5," It works! Great repository for all the loose ends accumulated every day (photos of receipts, written and verbal dictation of thoughts, checklists for projects); all tagged for follow up. Best reason is the nearly flawless cooperation with other Google products."
4432,Glenn Troester,"August 19, 2019",1," totally unintuitve. i have quickmemo+ but i want a simple, easy to use notepad for shopping, to-do, or just plain simple reminders. try as i might, i cannot get this google app to do what i need it to do. i will uninstall as soon as i post this review."
4433,The Abhishek Patil,"September 1, 2019",5, This is an amazing app with great features. Just one thing is needed the option of sharing this app with other. I recommend most of my pals and they ask for link. I don't get it. So google please add this option !!
4434,Nitin Rangarajan,"September 16, 2019",4, The app is fantastic but why is it not password/fingerprint protected ? I store a lot of secrets on Keep as it's easily accessible over the cloud. I can't let anyone with access to my phone access Keep. Kindly ensure the future updates incorporate password protection
4435,afax averon,"September 21, 2019",1," I noticed recently that Keep draining my battery without reason. 10-15% of my large battery is reported to this app with no use during the day (@3pm; active use 0m / background use 2h:22m / battery usage 10%, 303mAh).

4436,Susie Troxler,"October 20, 2019",3," Love this app except for one thing: There's no way to sort the entries without having to move each note manually. If the notes could be sorted by title, date created, or date modified I'd gladly give the app 5 stars."
4437,Dezard Syah Rahman,"November 1, 2019",5," Super easy to make notes across devices, but why does my draw/brush greyed out in Ativ smart pc with touch screen?"
4438,Mike Lee,"November 7, 2019",2," Text editing, font sizing and keyboard actions became so bad it was basically unusable so I uninstalled it."
4439,Michael Hidalgo,"November 14, 2019",5, Works definitely with all the devices I have used. Definitely my personal planner/journal

4449,A Google user,"March 1, 2019",5, this app os amazing. if you need t save some logins or just make a grocery list. this app is just for you. you can add pictures and change the background of the notes to make it colourful. i recommend this app 14/10
4450,Fisayo Adeyemi,"December 31, 2018",5, One of the Best note taking app ever. I've tried dozens and the simplicity and integration powers of this is just plain phenomenal. I would recommend it and would appreciate if the text typed can be formatted e.g Bolding and Italicizing.
4451,Shyla Jones,"December 30, 2018",4," Love this app and I use it all the time. I just wish it had a folder function so I could group like items like recipes. The label feature is nice, but doesn't quite achieve what I need."
4452,Arnel Magpantay,"March 14, 2019",4," Impressive application!!! However, the colors to chose for every notes that I make is quite limited. I wish there would be more colors that I can choose."
4453,Rod Read,"February 16, 2019",1, A lot of potential if only the widget would stop going blank. Works for a few days. Then you have to remove and replace the widget. Just a blank note space and tools
4454,Q. Davis,"September 22, 2018",3," It's basic. Nothing fancy. Doesn't have any security features (locking notes, finger print login, etc) so I wouldn't use this for private notes. Add some security features and this app would be pretty solid."
4455,Fady Yousef,"November 14, 2018",2, The new UI design is very bland and unattractive. I preferred the older design with font size/shape and the yellow theme. There are more competitive options out there.
4456,Atul Singh,"November 23, 2018",2, Earlier it was working great but after updating it. Search option is not working. I have to search everything manually. That is really frustrating.
4457,bregamos,"November 1, 2018",1, Interface sucks. It looks like Google search results page. Micro font used; you cant read notes at a quick glance. Swipe doesnt delete note. So you end up with tons of notes in your list.
4458,Kwame Bindan,"April 25, 2019",5, Very good app. I use it everyday. It helps to increase productivity through real time synchronization on all my devices. Efforts made frequently to add new features and fix bugs is also commendable.
4459,Geshat Reuven,"October 25, 2018",3," It has all the basics. I like the five options. However, at this level, I expect to be able to color-code, create Bullet point outlines, etc. I'm going to keep searching..."
4460,A Google user,"October 28, 2018",5, It just 'keep's getting better n better! The latest update made the appearance so 'human' and real like. I just love it. It's simple yet sufficient. Everything you'd need from a notepad-memo app.
4461,A Google user,"December 20, 2018",4, This app is great and so helpful! Only thing i wish it had was fhe option to move notes/checklist/s from one board to another. Saves me having to rewrite notes on another board or copy and paste which is slightly fiddly
4462,Mark Jason Manalo,"November 9, 2018",4," It's good but it's less secure because there is no password option. My friends can see my secret notes. Then, please add a folder option so that it my notes is not messy to look. Please add it and I will rate it 5 stars and I can recommend this app to my friends."
4463,Somarun Das,"May 14, 2019",3," well, i really loved this app for its easy and valuable features. but this app should have a lock/password feature with it as we keep lots of our important info in it. and i strongly recommend it. so google, have a think on it for betterment of this app."
4464,Hlanganani Hlungwani,"May 2, 2019",3," its a good app but i can't record audio. all it does is write what i say in English and saves the audio, but what if all i want is to just record sound which it cannot do."
4465,A Google user,"December 14, 2018",3," Drawing notes on photos has taken a big backward step in the latest update. It's no longer possible to zoom out and see the whole picture when drawing, which is really inconvenient."
4466,Hunter Poelsma,"October 20, 2018",4, New UI is too hard on the eyes. Too hard to read. Lots of wasted space in the design and the notes themselves feel less important. Please revert back to the old UI.
4467,Doug Roberts,"December 10, 2018",4, A simple but surprisingly useful catch-all tool for tracking all kinds of information. Quick at search and retrieve. I wish it had the ability to assign a URL for each note.
4468,Kallista Metropoulos,"May 21, 2019",5," I absolutely love this app. My go-to app used to be Evernote, but I'm not gonna pay premium for it. This app is entirely free, and it gives me way more than I was expecting. I absolutely love it."
4469,Mr. Yamamoto,"October 25, 2018",5, Please add more colour for notes like black and other solid colours. I know its hard to update an app and sometimes it lag too much but if you guys do add some more colours it'll be more easy to find notes and it'll look beautiful. Thanks in advance.
4470,A Google user,"November 18, 2018",4," I like this app very much. The only complaint I have is in this update, the font changed into normal calibiri (?) font. I liked the previous one better."
4471,Seb,"September 20, 2019",4, Almost perfect for me. needs 3 things in my opinion : 1/ a color picker tool to get more color choice 2/ being able to get ticked items and simple text in the same note 3/ a lock system so the note cannot be edited or deleted without a warning
4472,Collin Neri,"January 15, 2019",5, Google Keep is the single best note taking app I have ever used. Being able to have a note taking app that's integrated into the Google ecosysyem so seamlessly makes it a must-have on both my phone and PC (via Chrome extension).
4473,Sara Orozco,"January 14, 2019",5," I love the app! I now use the drawing canvas to take handwritten notes. I'd like an option to keep voice notes, since the existing tool admits too short voice recordings and only to transcribe the content."
4474,Braam Smit,"January 14, 2019",5, Great app thank you! One suggestion: could the bar for taking a new note be on top of the screen instead of at the bottom? Maybe just a magnifying glass icon for the search function?
4475,Linda Smith,"April 10, 2019",5," love this app use it all the time, the visual aspect in particular as it helps speed up the process of finding the item you're looking for, also can find by typlng in the search bar. So easy to use."
4476,Rachel,"March 26, 2019",3," I like that the app syncs, but I don't understand how they managed to build a decent note app with a checklist option without including the ability to sort lists alphabetically. Color Note does that and I'd rather be able to sort than sync."
4477,Hendy L,"May 8, 2019",3, works real nice but lacks a search function within a note. I had a huge shopping list and wanted to quickly see if an item had been bought but I had to scroll thru your find and it made it very time consuming.
4478,Daniel Mothershead,"January 15, 2019",5, I find this app very useful in jotting down everyday task to look over. so far so good and look forward to continuing to use this. also its a big plus that if deleted you want lose your stuff.very nice app well thought out!
4479,Ryan Trevena-Ward,"October 25, 2018",2," It is a great looking app and does the basics a notepad like app should do, but this is 2018, it won't sync between users. We tried everything but just never synced the lists shared between users"
4480,Pranav Gohil,"November 6, 2018",1," The font is too small in the new version. Short notes before used to be bigger. It had a collage feel to it, the new version feels less creative."
4481,A Google user,"March 17, 2019",1, The latest update completely broke this app that i heavily rely on. It crashes on start every time. Doesnt matter if I start from the widget or the app icon. Otherwise I love this app! Ill change my review once the bug is fixed.
4482,Kate Wetzel,"February 8, 2019",4," I like it, you can organize notes however you want and change colors which i like. But is it possible to connect it to Google Home? I tried to add things to my list on this app though my GH and it didn't work. I can't find a way to add it"
4483,Melih Ergundogdu,"November 15, 2018",2," It was amazing until the last material theme update, now it's super super laggy when I create a note, edit it, move it, etc. Like annoyingly laggy, the keyboard even doesn't work properly on it, I use SwiftKey"
4484,Jim Paton,"September 22, 2018",3, Use this app for about everything but it seems to be getting less stable. I gave up checking a box in one of my lists today because it was crashing constantly.
4485,Rune Calarook,"January 24, 2019",5, This app is SUPER helpful. I love that it stores the notes on your google account so they are accessible on multiple devices. I like the checklist feature and how you can remove checked items with a single click.
4486,Stacey Simmons,"November 5, 2018",1," Loved this app until the latest update made it useless. Can no longer use the search function, so have to scroll and find notes. Anything archived is no longer accessible. Please fix!!"
4487,Colin Turner,"November 29, 2018",5," Great little app making it easier to do my shopping, the only thing that bothers me is the completed list should be shown in alphabetical order so it easier to find."
4488,King Shinys,"January 18, 2019",5," Thank you so much just for not giving tons of pop up ads you gotta pay to get rid of, plus i like the way the app works too. ill be using this for a long time!"
4489,Rudi Csomor,"February 2, 2019",3," I really miss security function, lock app or reminder on password, and the location reminder does not bring up embeded map to pick a specific location from. It worked in older versions though. Anyway, it is a great product."
4490,Sagar S,"November 15, 2018",4, Very nice app. Auto sync feature is cool and typed text is not gone if the app is accidentally closed. Font shape and size could be improved. The thickness of fonts must be minimized.
4491,Bruno PRESTA,"May 6, 2019",4," Everything is great BUT the delete button could be user friendly trying to navigate to it is frustrating, can you please make it available as a one touch button on the main page for each note."
4492,Alec Watungwa,"November 4, 2018",4," Awesome app, sync very fast and it's beautiful and smooth. But could be 5 star if they add more text editing features like Bold, Italics, Font size, colour or font type and numbering or bullet points."
4493,James S,"October 28, 2018",1," Was pleased to see that the hand written notes feature was better implemented. Otherwise, the app was pretty much useless. No S Pen support though? Other apps, from much lesser known names, have S Pen support"
4494,Bobby Gafford,"February 21, 2019",1," Came pre-installed, I disabled because I use another similar app already, it keeps popping a message saying Google keep has stopped up anyway. too invasive. So many apps using background data and causing failures."
4495,Vikram Singh,"December 21, 2018",2, This app would be more appreciated if we get search option as the schedule we prepare is not arranged in ascending or descending order automatically. each time we have to find the current date/schedule to take notes.. please make necessary updates......
4496,A Google user,"February 1, 2019",5," one of the good app from google, it saves my lot of time and keep reminding me that what i have to do in future, i don't need to carry hard copies of reminders, i can view or edit notes any where ether my pc or smartphone. thanks google"
4497,Bryant Brabson,"November 5, 2018",3, Used to be pretty great until I lost the ability to search note content after a recent update. Hard to use now unless I want to do a lot of scrolling to find an older note.
4498,Courtney Roper,"June 9, 2019",5, useful for daily organizing and quick note taking that is accessible quickly across platforms and to multiple people. It mow has a dark mode that is great and overall the app is continually being improved with useful features.
4499,Elliott DuCharme,"July 2, 2019",1," The fact that you can't rearrange the order of notes when viewing them under the same label makes absolutely no sense at all. Fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Also, dark theme is nice; thanks for throwing that in.👍"
4500,nathan farley,"May 27, 2019",5," I have tried a bunch of other apps and I come back to Keep. My tablet, laptop, phone they all sync perfect. It is the best if you are part of the Google family. And now it is even better with you can use dark mode."

4502,Kadin H,"June 13, 2019",4, Love it! Abiltiy to lock checklist items from being changed and hiding the indentation button would be great featues too! Especially since I use unindented checkboxes for headings in my shopping list which i always seem to check or indent by accident!
4503,SARTHAK LOHIA,"June 23, 2019",5, best app for digitally storing the wandering thoughts .... just some upgradion such as availability of different fonts and color which could make it look more eye catching and distinguishable with word's or sentences that we want to highlight.

4505,Robert Noronha,"July 27, 2019",1," It was very good before, but of late it is hanging and not responding when you insert a new entry and you goto write it all over again as the page just freezes. Kindly update the app. Otherwise time to shift to a newer app."
4506,Dea Del Carmen,"July 17, 2019",4," Simple, straight-to-the-point type of checklist. I would just like to suggest that we be able to re-order the images placed on the note - perhaps either by being able to drag it or by having an order list of the images in the setting."

4508,Ben Ram,"September 7, 2019",4, I use it for making lists and I like how you can tick items and the don't disappear but are recorded as ticked. I like the delete option on the side that enables an item to be completely removed without having to tick it.
4509,Philip Reid,"September 24, 2019",3," I would like more reminder options including being able to set custom monthly reminders for such things as ""last Monday of every month"", ""second last Tuesday of every second month"", and ""two weeks before Easter"""
4510,Ryo Stonewell,"October 3, 2019",2," Listen. Everyone nowadays seems to be missing a very important feature of notes apps. The ability to scroll through the lists and check and uncheck them while still on the home screen. C'mon guys, add this to the notes apps already."
4511,Shubham Garg,"October 10, 2019",3," A nice app, but lacks basic functions such as Bold, Italics, Underline and font size. Will be great if such functions are added. I don't think that they are difficult to add."
4512,Jaime Negrao,"November 14, 2019",1, This app was working really well for over a year when all of a sudden all my notes disappeared without me doing anything
4513,James Cribbs,"November 16, 2019",5, This is by far the best helping app I've ever used .love it it's as important as the phone itself.
4514,Brison Pinto,"November 16, 2019",3, Please add a shortcut to delete the note after long hold. Also add a button to directly open the notes from the widget so that we don't have to rely on the icon everytime we save a note using the widget
4515,unknown unknown,"December 1, 2019",5," This app is super handy, with well everything"

4520,Soheil Abed,"May 28, 2019",5, It is very helpful and my only live checklist. I just need 2 other features that might be easy to add. ➡ #1. Classification of labels instead of having a single big list of all labels in navigator page #2. Alarm setting for single actions of lists
4521,Mark Tidman,"September 12, 2018",4," Much better than Google Task. Simple to arrange boxes, checklists are easy to create and edit. Deleting a major item requires a two-step process (unavailable on Google Task)."
4522,K.B. Tidwell,"November 12, 2018",5," It keeps getting better and better. Everything that's not long-term storage goes in here. One thing I'd like to see though is an ""Are you sure?"" dialog before deleting notes."
4523,Michael Nodo,"December 11, 2018",5," I've been using this app over three years now, and it's still lovely the new update is awesome. Gave it a polish and new set of wheels please add, a recording option longer than a minute otherwise love the app and will continue using it 😉"
4524,Anil Tanwar,"January 25, 2019",5," I loved the app, its simplicity and usability and concept of notes under tabs is very productive and organised. Its versatility & accessablity is also on web browsing with same functionality and user interface... 👌👌 amazing work google geeks...!!😘😘😘"
4525,Arve Løtveit,"September 20, 2018",5," Great app but since I can't share and sync my checklists with my wife it's ""just another app"". I really thought including sharing the same way that Google drive and documents was the selling point. Uninstalling until this feature is implemented :-("
4526,Rick Patel,"September 17, 2018",3, Still has sync issues between devices. Notes often do not appear both places. Often shared get disconnected and edits become 2 independent notes without any notice. Basic functions needs to be revisited.
4527,Fredric Saunier,"October 2, 2019",5," This app easily and neatly stores and presents my ever-changing lists of goals, projects and management decisions. The latest design upgrade was right on the money. Keep refining it, please."
4528,Zach Bollinger,"March 20, 2019",2," I historically have liked this app a lot, but recently has been freezing when I open it up and only showing a blank screen. So basically, this app is currently a ""brick"" for me."
4529,Gautama Savantchrist Sang,"April 15, 2019",5," I must say that this has become my most used app through the day. I love that though it has a lot features, it feels very intuitive and simple enough. it's awesome to use cross platform. Very useful app."
4530,Steve Hulowski,"October 24, 2018",4," I think the reviews of the last update are overly harsh. I like the new presentation. Would love to see some basic text color options. More than anything though, I'd love to be able to move notes around while in ""label"" view."
4531,ambiguous username,"September 20, 2018",5, Great note taking app. Sync feature is nice too. You can take notes from computer and phone. It only takes a second to sync between the two.
4532,A Google user,"November 17, 2018",2, The app used to be brilliant but following the most recent update at the beginning of November it now crashes seconds after opening each time and it's pretty much useless now.
4533,Olly Owens,"March 17, 2019",4," i love it, but i use lots of characters in my notes. And when I wanna find something there is no Word/Charater finder for looking for certain words you wanna see in the Mobile App. ie. Onigiri"

4537,SANDEEP BHANDARI,"November 8, 2018",5, I always liked it back then. But after the update and it sync with my google account it will surely replace my all other memos... Great work guys at google really enjoyed the app and UI after the update is damn good.
4538,Jake Karl,"October 23, 2018",3," I liked the app but really dislike the recent UI update. They eliminated the grey shading between notes, titles are less bold/noticeable, notes are significantly less distinct. There should at least be an option for a dark theme."
4539,Ray Brauer,"November 21, 2018",1," I did like it, now it will not even search for key words in your notes. I wasted a lot of time making notes that I have to scroll and scroll and hope I see the right one. Do not use! Google broke it."

The name raises the expectations, very much to my dismay, this is probably the first time I have seen bad engineering in a google app. Developers, you need to find a better way to search and find inside a notes.

4541,Nab R,"October 25, 2018",3," Love this app, had some apps for note taking but this beats 'em all in terms of usability. Recent update changed the UI which is too bright now, not comfortable for eyes, hope you guys will add Dark Theme/Night Mode soon."
4542,Mirza Adil Ahmed Mughal,"April 28, 2019",2, This app is good overall but there is no option to format the fonts i.e one cannot change the colors of the font. I hope the next update will overcome this deficiency.
4543,KenZ Tran,"September 22, 2018",1," At first, I love it very much, but later when I open the app, it always auto stop after few seconds. I cannot find and read my old notes. So disappointed. I am using Huawei Nova 2i"
4544,Jorge Spina,"March 27, 2019",4," The app is just great and the fact that I can use it either from my phone or on the web it's just great.  It would be a 5 if the app had password protection for each note (or,  at least, to access the app itself)."

4554,Chandan Sah,"November 5, 2018",5, I have been using this app for last 2 years and love it. My suggestion is please provide note locking features so that it will be more secure to write the note. Thank you Google. Thank you Keep team.
4555,Shivam Acharya,"October 18, 2018",4," It would be better if it includes the time and date of when the note was made. Also, if I t can add a reminder option too. Also, if it's possible to get a note made via Google assistant."
4556,Faiz Hakimi,"November 26, 2018",4, Everything seems great. Thanks for the developers! But I hope it can have a password option too for several notes that I need to keep encrypted from outsiders considering it can be sync across device. Keep it up!!!

4561,Marissa Hietpas,"June 24, 2019",5, I love using this app to save pictures and memories. I also love using it to keep organized. The only thing I wish is that you could swipe through your notes once you click on one.
4562,Len Yabloko,"July 10, 2019",4, I love it! Instant synch across all devices. Off-line access to latest notes. Integration with G Suite etc. The only thing missing is third party API for more advanced feature development.
4563,Arka Sadhukhan,"July 18, 2019",5," I like this app. This help me remember and keep note of important data like passowrd, appointment notes, meeting notes. It has come up with many new features recently including styling, share options etc."

4567,Gerson Luca,"August 20, 2019",3," Some weird bugs/syncing issues in regards to ordering of notes. Other than that, sweet and simple. Also super annoying: when you have a note selected, pressing back exits the app instead of clearing the selection."

4573,umang ojha,"October 25, 2019",4," It will be a good option to have ability to create nested notes, main category and sub category and then have different notes under sub categories. Tags are helpful but a little hard to organise if you have lot of notes."

4583,Kelsey Murphy,"May 22, 2019",3, used to love this app. then suddenly it started changing the colors on the widget depending on if it was in night mode or not. The night mode colors are too dark and the regular mode has white text on light colors which is hard to read!
4584,Jonathan Senne,"May 1, 2019",5," Overall, great app for keeping notes on multiple devices and easily accessing them; especially between Apple and Android products. Would love to see more font editing option! (Bold/italics, different colors, etc.)"
4585,Boopboop Octomen,"March 25, 2019",3, its good. i just wish you made it easier to download pictures. if anything just make it so if there is two accounts on google at once you can send or move pictures to the other account. but other then that it works very well.
4586,Fazal Ur Rahman Khan,"October 14, 2018",5, It's work like a diary and the best thing in this app is that if you uninstall the app and after some time you reinstall your data will not lost. It will be save until you delete it......

4588,Alexander Impertro,"October 9, 2018",5, Great app for note keeping. Love the simplicity and intuitive usage. Be sure to take advantage of the widget. No real alternatives out there!
4589,Peter Viernik,"November 5, 2018",3," I really hope you will add the the ability to write check lists from wright to left too, because it's kind of annoying for me writing in Hebrew. And please add the option to bold text so we could do a second title."

4596,Daniel Lagerstedt,"February 2, 2019",5," It's Way better than scraps of paper, and it's from a great company. Takes a little while to figure out, but it's worth it. Transcrption and integration with other apps would be super."
4597,Jenia Habinsky,"October 2, 2018",3," The good: smooth and easy to use interface. The bad: lists can't be sorted, can't use Assistant to add items to shopping list."
4598,E Fox,"March 12, 2019",1," After most recent update app stopped working completely. Crashes when opening, can't open any notes, create new notes, or even open app. Blank screen that hangs until notification says ""app not responding"" and force quits over and over again."
4599,Sanket Trivedi,"November 1, 2018",5," This is very simple neat and productive app. Latest update is really good and enhances productivity. It would be good if google combines this with shopping list and reminder saved through ""OK google"""
4600,Renick Lawrence,"November 20, 2018",4," One of the best app to take notes. Lot of good options like checkbox, color pages and reminders. One suggestion: Please add the option of adding Bold and Underline option."
4601,martha orange,"January 16, 2019",5," Love it, use it for everything. Especially like shopping lists that I can set location reminders for to pop up when I'm at the grocery store."
4602,Rui Castro,"January 15, 2019",4, Great app. Easy to use and fast. Wish it had OCR for better keywords for search. Perhaps a scratch feature would be great too. A Evernote import would also great so I also stop using it
4603,Rahul Pote,"February 5, 2019",4, Time is money so use this app and save your time anytime anywhere.. best app ever.. need some updates like.. 1. move check list item or note to other lebel. 2. prioritise check box 3.need more background colour 4. three multilevel check list very needful..
4604,Charlie Sears,"March 18, 2019",1," Since the last few updates, widgets with a task list don't work any more, they constantly flicker, perhaps while attempting to sync. It's a shame, this used to be a useful app."
4605,Bhavik Ranpariya,"October 18, 2018",3, 1 big thing required is locking notes. This feature would help us to save details of several login & password on Google keep. Which would be safe & can be accessed from anywhere at anytime from any device. Thanking Team Google
4606,Roy Conn,"October 31, 2018",4, I like the app... But I would like to add a feature suggestion: would please make a feature to upload all notes from your phone to Google Keep? It would make it a lot easier for us Samsung users to transfer our notes to Keep.
4607,Marcus Belizaire,"March 29, 2019",5," Great app, but it could be made even better by asding the ability to scan documents and save them as PDFs. Adding a privacy feature that password or pin locks certain notes would be great as well."
4608,Tim Ryan,"November 13, 2018",1, I can no longer search for keywords in my notes since the last update. It is so frustrating relying on Google products because there's absolutely no tech support when things don't work!
4609,Gabriellyn*,"November 1, 2018",5," I love this app. It's really helpful in so many ways. I'm sure I couldn't even explain all of the available ways as I'm not as tech savvy as I could be but for my purposes, I really love it.. Thanks!"
4610,A Google user,"September 18, 2018",4," Good but, please add the ability to add multiple images to a note and also change the icon into an adaptive one because it doesn't look good next to the other Google applications."
4611,Ajay Zachariah,"April 19, 2019",5," Overall a great Notes app but I have a recommendation to make a ""keep"" toggle icon and when you click on it, it will open up a small pop up notes panel, where you can quickly write and save a note."
4612,Grace Sipalay,"October 8, 2018",3, It kept crashing with the recent updates.. I get the message Can't open Google Keep randomly when multitasking from one app to this.. I hope i get this fixed as I rely here for my notes and important details.
4613,Christine Doerksen,"March 14, 2019",2, Used to love app until swipe to delete. I have lost a few lists accidentally because it is too easy to delete a list by swiping it to the side. would give 5 stars if that was fixed.
4614,Unnikrishnan A.K,"January 17, 2019",4," Very good, everyday tool. I use it to scribble down every information I need to remember. I also access it from my laptop as chrome extension."
4615,Samantha Ahlmann,"November 8, 2018",2," I used to have iPhone and on one note I could insert a picture, doodle , a check list, and regular ? Why isn't this an option? I would like to plan my trips with pictures , and add check lists and regular writing."
4616,ahmad agbaje,"November 10, 2018",5," I love love love the user interface and how functional everything is, it's so easy to use and INCREDIBLY useful, I love it, it's the best notes app on the play store, hands down."
4617,Redzuan Suhairi,"October 23, 2018",4," It's great, just what I need - a simple note app. However, the new UI is laggy on my not-so-powerful phone. Would be great if there's an option to turn off those fancy effects."
4618,Jacob,"January 20, 2019",1," This material design is AWFUL. My eyes literally hurt when I ooen your app, the lack of color to break things up is overwhelming. I really don't understand why it's like this."
4619,Tomer Nosrati,"January 12, 2019",4," The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars are: 1. Missing dark theme. 2. Rich text (bold, italic etc.) Except that I don't understand how i lived my life without this service !!"
4620,Susan Smuk-Jorgensen,"June 4, 2019",5," Nice app for quick notes, lists, reminders (even recurrent reminders), text extracted from photos (that were taken using the app). I like both the light and dark themes. entries can be put under multiple tags/labels."
4621,César Camargo,"May 28, 2019",5," i love this app, is incredible and i use the app for every note that I need to writte. You can sync this with your Google account in your PC and check everything. And now the app have dark theme. 100% recommend."

4624,Stacey Brashears,"June 18, 2019",5," Been using Google Keep as my primary note taking app for years now. They have added many useful options & handy capabilities. However, I love that I now have the ability to indent checkboxes. Thanks Google for helping me stay more organized than ever!"
4625,Benjamin Starr,"June 28, 2019",4, I love this app and use it extensively. My one missing star is because of a simple feature that would really help make it more useful: please add the ability to select multiple labels (tags) at once. Thanks!
4626,Reid Elledge,"July 29, 2019",4," Great app for the most part. Although I use it in a situation where I adjust something, lock my phone, then come back. Every time I unlock my phone Keep freaks out and scrolls to some random place. Very annoying."
4627,ronald chong,"July 29, 2019",5, i came here from colornote looking for better UI and other features. it looks & works nicely but disappointed that there is no option to require authentication to open the app or a particular note. i hope that will come soon.
4628,Bhupender Kumar Nimavat,"July 18, 2019",4," it's a great app & I've been using this since more than 3 years. I use this app majorly for content writing. if you can add W"" counts"" feature also then it will be more helpful specially for Content writers. Thanks, Bhupender Kumar"
4629,Patricia Marisco,"July 12, 2019",5," This app is my most daily used app. I use it to store useful info. that I read or hear. Saves on paper note taking and when on a website and find that I want to read the article later, I save it to Keep. Keep also has labels to subdivide the things I save to Keep."
4630,Phoebe Nicol - Pheology,"August 10, 2019",5," I absolutely recommend keep, its easy to use, customize and organise lists . You can save links and indent checkboxes which is so perfect for notes. Constantly making excellent improvements and has the nicest dark mode UI."
4631,Mylen Alverio,"August 9, 2019",3, I love google but there are way better note apps. I was looking for an app that I could log in daily so maybe that is why it failed me. I would only suggest this app for grocery or to do list. very simple.

Thanks Google. Update Sep. 6th: I've been more productive using this app. I have to-do lists with check marks. I just found out that lists with next lines add check marks for u in options. This helps with my forgetfulness."
4635,Vishan Jayasinghe,"September 2, 2019",1, Avoid if you want to make it your primary note taking/clipping/saving app. Terrible app which slows down and becomes unusable over time. I've tested the slowness on multiple phones and the same thing happens. It almost punishes you for relying on it.
4636,Rian Waldron,"September 6, 2019",4," This is a wonderful note taking app, simple and easy to use either on the computer or phone. My only wish is that it also had an audio recording option so I could take voice notes."
4637,Surya Santosh,"September 12, 2019",5, Best app for saving notes. Backup option would be good for backing up files in the format of text pad to the cloud server. Create a restoration point so that we can recover deleted notes and accidentally erased notes.
4638,Yo Day,"September 12, 2019",5," Everything's so good. Colored schemes, archive and trash list, collaboration options , photo, text, points, etc note formats . Best thing , even if you lose your device , all notes are safely backed up so login to keep and no worries :)"
4639,Firdaus Salehuddin,"September 16, 2019",3," I used this app for a long time, and I loved it~ But lately through the app, I can't open my notes at all.. It keeps loading and nothing comes up.. I tried the browser version and it's working fine, my notes are there.. Please help and fix this problem..."
4640,Kyle Albrechtsen,"September 16, 2019",3, Bring back being able to reorganize the location of the notes by tapping and holding! I need some of the notes at the top and the latest update doesn't let me reorganize them! I love this note system! Will be 5 stars if they bring back being able to move the notes around.
4641,Akshay Shukla,"September 30, 2019",5," Great app, fluid and simple. Just a suggestion, ""Restore"" feature could be implemented within the note and not just from trash bin. If user deletes some lines then with in that note restore to a previous time could be introduced to get those lines back."
4642,Marie Willard,"October 13, 2019",5," So easy to use. There is such freedom in adding notes, checking off and re-adding items. From quick notes, to long term, to standing lists, all are easy to access. Love my quick notes!"
4643,Aseel Hussein,"October 24, 2019",5, Great app. I suggest adding a copy and paste function for the drawing. Sometimes i use it for drawing. It would be very helpful if this feature is implemented. A wider range of colours and tools would be great too.
4644,Miro Fumfera,"November 5, 2019",1," Lot of bugs, almost no progress in last few years..."
4645,Holli Paskewich,"November 16, 2019",3, Please fix the search feature. Will give 5 stars if that starts working. Does not work on phone app OR desktop. Thanks!
4646,Avago24,"January 11, 2020",4, Overall good but missing one little feature: make it able to reorder labels in the drawer.
4647,Alex Joseph,"April 15, 2020",4," Nice one..... Including more security features...... Add lock system each notes , eg for color notes....."
4648,Nemai Adhikary,"April 23, 2020",4, Helpful app to me
4649,Centurion R,"November 7, 2018",5," Been use Keep for years. Let me say this is way more better than Apple Notes because thw sync system is more simple. For the record, this is more useful for me than google docs. Haha"
4650,Anthony Loya,"January 27, 2019",5, A great simple and stable app. It syncs well with others logged in devices on same account. I love the tag features as well as sharing notes with others. I use this app all the time.
4651,James Moran,"February 3, 2019",4, I love this app as it is easy to navigate most of the time and is very ascetically pleasing. However the lack of the ability to be able to create folders is extremely frustrating and would be an awesome implementation into the app.
4652,Allen Ketter,"November 15, 2018",1," Can no longer tell Assistant to add something to my shopping list, goes to google express instead. Uninstalling both. Classic google. Fixing stuff that ain't broke. Using Samsung Reminder and Evernote instead."
4653,Hope Mitchell,"September 20, 2019",5," I've been using Keep for a while now and I love it. Recently though, I updated the app and now whenever I press the undo button the app freezes and then crashes saying that Keep Notes has stopped working. Please help."
4654,Philip Puspalm,"December 12, 2018",5, This is the best Note App & I have been using it for years. It does not have all the unnecessary bells & whistles. I am able to sync it to my LG watch & this is great!
4655,A Google user,"February 28, 2019",5, I use Keep every day. I love that it integrates so well with Gmail and my calendar and my other Google applications. With each update it keeps getting better.
4656,Iam Deirdre,"October 9, 2018",4," Pretty good app,I wish it had text styling (bold, italic, headings, etc.) That would make my notes more legible, I love being able to format my info."
4657,A Google user,"November 13, 2018",1," Garbage. Used to be good, but search has been broken forever. Was hopeful recent update would fix it, but still doesn't work. Terrible."
4658,ncae95,"September 17, 2018",1," Update always driven me crazy. Plz check the crucial bugs before the update. It cant makes widget so I had to download 4.1 keep & update it. also.. Two month ago, I cant write a memo because of this bug."
4659,Galileo Garin,"January 28, 2019",5," Overall good and useful, but please add ""search words"" feature on a notes. i mean i wrote a lot of stuff in a single note, but i need to scroll and look around to find a words that i need to edit."
4660,A Google user,"March 21, 2019",1," Poorly supported, if it stops working you're on your own. Keep is constantly freezing on my Pixel and has become unreliable and useless for quick notes and reminders. I'll update this review if I ever get any support."
4661,Артём Аганов,"April 21, 2019",4," In general, the app is great but for the rare bugs. However, it appears to be a mystery why links attached to the notes are not displayed on the widget, which would be very convenient"
4662,Hawa Jade,"March 10, 2019",5, I really appreciate this app. It has been a huge help with staying organized. I use it to make list & to type up things I don't want to forget. It also comes in handy when I don't have paper on hand.
4663,أبو عبدالرحمن,"April 23, 2019",5," It's great note ,, # but it needs more improvement in sapareting links 🔗 in each category....... #Aslo add any chosen note in the widget.. #Easy way to add any cooperator to follow the note, like by mobile phone number or codes 🗒 # Also add alarm in each Task to mark in specific details"

4665,Beau-Jeffrey Gaudina,"September 17, 2018",5," I totally LOVE this app! I've been using it for some time now to keep track of things I need to do, grocery lists & just notes in general. This is a KEEPER!"
4666,Kelly Hunt,"February 10, 2019",2, i loved the app before but recently something happened and it deleted all my notes from the last 18 months and i can't get them back!! i use this app pretty much everyday and its deleted loads of my notes and its also stopped reminding me and giving me notifications
4667,José Pedro Santos Nogueira II,"May 22, 2019",1," Great app, but I'd like to see an option to create private and encrypted notes, so many apps are doing it, so it's time google step it up and do it, it'd be awesome"
4668,Sanjoy Hati,"April 9, 2019",1, it's working fine with expanded Canvas and you can put in more in information in 28 while writing with finger. but once you save the note and try to reopen it it doesn't expand anymore and lot of information cant be seen.
4669,Shir Chorev,"November 1, 2018",2," Search stopped working on S8+ after installing update (shows blank screen for search results). Other than that great app, but currently very problematic, not possible to retrieve notes efficiently."

4671,Anthony Williams,"September 22, 2018",4, Great app. Brilliant for quick lists and nice colourful layouts. Great to quickly scribble on screen using your finger or even better using the Note S-Pen. Would like more text formatting.
4672,Nick Manganas,"May 10, 2019",2, very useful. use it for all my notes and would recommend to everyone. marking 2 stars and hopefully someone@ google reads and adds a sort for list items (alphabetically). would give 5/5 with a list sort
4673,Craig wooders,"October 31, 2018",1, App was amazing until the latest update. Now can't search. My wife still has the old version that works fine and we have exactly the same version. Please fix Google!
4674,Daniel Beyda,"January 25, 2019",2," I like being able to extend the canvas, but once it's extended you can't shorten it again. So now I'm left with really long canvas' with empty space at the bottom!"
4675,A Google user,"November 15, 2018",2, Please improve the design to increase white space and reduce information density. I can still see nearly two whole notes on my 1080p screen. This is an overwhelming amount of information for a google keep user.
4676,Luwayne T,"October 22, 2018",4," Simple and efficient note taking app, that can be used to make lists. Looking forward to the integration with the Google assistant for shopping list - will give all five stars ✨ then"
4677,Ron Taylor,"May 5, 2019",5," It just makes my life more organised. 😜 Quick and simple to use, exactly how I like things to be. The finger ""slide"" action that *deletes* is a big trap though. Ouch! Why no Y/N option to confirm? 🤔"
4678,A Google user,"November 28, 2018",5," Very solid app. For the longest time, I thought Google didn't provide such a simple program like this, and to my amazement, realized they did. Does everything you really need it to."
4679,Winston Byrd,"March 12, 2019",5," I use Keep a lot. It is very reliable and easy to use. So many features it's hard to remember them all. I'll Google something I'm trying to do and am often surprised when Keep is the answer, again!"
4680,A Google user,"December 18, 2018",4," I really like google keep, the lay out is amazing, love the fact that you can tag notes. However i would like to have an option to password protect notes and if i could group my notes into various sections, i swear i will delete my Microsoft onenote!"
4681,Trevor Peter Flaid,"April 27, 2019",3," Give it some dark mode, and make the character limit like way way more like 200,000 characters more. Maybe I'm the only guy here who's divided one note into three because of that limit, and yes such note exists."
4682,A Google user,"December 12, 2018",5," Just great ... It helps me in my life and my business, very handy, very friendly UI, it has many features that make it just perfect with simple and direct UI"
4683,Despoina Paspati,"October 26, 2018",5," Finally a UI update! It looks clean, in line with the rest of the google apps, the colours are pastel and don't hurt our eyes anymore💁. Also, liking the new font. Nicely done!"
4684,Joshua Mann,"September 21, 2018",1," Deleted all my notes. Good job. Not in archive or trash. Looking it up it's been an unresolved issue since January with lots of complaints. Be careful, backup your notes or use something more stable."
4685,Jay Bayona,"May 9, 2019",5, I am using this app everyday. But I wish i can use this app to manage my espenses. For example I made a grocery checklist what I want is that i can alot the buget allocated for that and as I buy them I can add the amount so that I can track the cost so I wont go over budget.
4686,A Google user,"February 23, 2019",4, It is very good app. The one thing I am missing most is password protection on notes which is available on most of the other similar apps. Please work on this suggestion.
4687,Xesia Anaya,"May 29, 2019",5," I love this app. I use it all the time. I love to keep lists, and this is a great way to do it! Plus, being able to set notifications, lots of setting options, and easy use."

4689,zzzSleepyCreeper,"July 9, 2019",3, Widget is not symmetrical. The top bar and contents (scrollable part) are not the same size—content box is smaller. This looks weird. Widget should also come with a light theme like before. My theme for this app is light but the widget is dark.
4690,Leonard Ganetsky,"July 26, 2019",5," This is a great tool. A day doesn't go by that I don't use it. Making lists and sharing with wife, capturing photos of menus, a list of my medications to show medical staff...."
4691,Thomas,"August 21, 2019",5," Great note keeping app that syncs with your Google account with lots of helpful features. I recommend this, especially if you like to have all your Google stuff together."
4692,Richard Hender,"September 8, 2019",4," Excellent for storing shopping lists, jobs lists etc. Would be good to have the ability to lock editing (but allow ticking the check boxes) as it is too easy to accidentally move items in a grouped list."
4693,Akash Rathod,"September 24, 2019",1, Is not better than XIOMI NOTE . Not comfortable as it seen. Where is hidden section in the application. Also why picture (photos) are shown top of the note. It should be between the text. Please update this feature .
4694,Anthony Baladjay,"September 28, 2019",5," Can it be possible that we could have an animated gesture maybe, say like flipping pages on a notebook... For it to be easier to navigate through notes, especially from way before :) thank you!"
4695,Rodrigo F.,"October 2, 2019",3, Search doesn't work properly for japanese text. It will only find an occurence of the word if that's right in the beginning of the line. I think it might be because japanese usually use no space between words. The web version works as expected though...
4696,shahad almutairi,"October 2, 2019",5," Great app, u can write a note or even record a voice note or take a picture to save it in the note ! Also u can open it in your computer using ur Google account !! any thing u add in the computer Automatically added to the phone app and ... even more great features :)"
4697,Michael Shull,"October 21, 2019",3," Overall, a decent list app. The widget is buggy with night mode on my Galaxy S10E, and becomes very hard to read. I also don't like the card view, and wish it used a straightforward list view instead."
4698,Ben Neal,"November 5, 2019",4," Great App, but when Dark Mode is enabled the notes look awful if not in the default color"
4699,divyaa.m Manoharan,"November 30, 2019",5, Great great application. This is like my best friend for my everyday activity. Thank you so much Google.
4700,Ivan Tsenov,"April 12, 2020",4, Needs application locking.
4701,Jkrishnan,"April 22, 2020",2," Please show "" created date and modified date"" of every notes and also provide new background skins instead of colors"
4702,Rajesh Padamsey,"October 12, 2018",5, I was wondering if you'll can add like an auto scroll for the handwriting option. So that you never run out of page to draw/write as new space is made automatically as you near the bottom of the page.
4703,Marilyn Moo,"May 5, 2019",5," This app is awesome, You can talk to it and it records whatever you say in your note! I use this one and fastnote because it it like the only app on the entire playstore that is ad free."
4704,Hugh Hansen,"March 17, 2019",1," Does not run at all since latest update, opening at white screen and freezing there. I normally love the app and use it pretty much every day so it's annoying to have it out of action."
4705,Shun Sing Shue,"December 12, 2018",4," The UI ain't so good, especially for the note list, the note preview is too big, I think. Please add ""last change"" information for every note. Thank you."
4706,Teresa Cheng,"April 28, 2019",4," I use it often to bookmark pages and write notes. However, it occasionally lost all the labels. Once that happened, you have to reinstall the app. Beaide that, it is a great app."
4707,Nada Kahla,"September 22, 2018",1, I liked it so much that I wrote all my random and important notes on it until suddenly many of them disappeared along with their labels and it is completely unrecoverable. It freaking sucks!
4708,Victor Maoya,"September 21, 2019",5," Let me start by saying that I love this app. However, the implementation of dark mode is pathetic especially the inversion of color themes. Please make it as stylish as that of Google Drive where colors remain the same in dark mode."
4709,A Google user,"January 13, 2019",2, It wouldn't be a bad app if it weren't because it doesn't let me see what I'm writing while using the cellphone turned 90°. That's inexcusable for a text based app.

4711,Erwin Prasetyo RFP,"September 12, 2018",3," The only and BIG problem of this app is...when i try to open it from other devices or computer, the sync feature is broken, it creates duplicate notes, please fix this. Thx."
4712,A Google user,"January 13, 2019",4," Excellent for organizing your life, and can do most of what I expect of it. However, reminder options are limited and the interface feels clunky at times."
4713,Oussama Ben-Ammar,"October 25, 2018",3," Although I like the new UI, I think there is necessity for more color, it looks too bland. Also, the search function is not working anymore."
4714,Kunal Kundu,"March 9, 2019",4," Text formatting and password lock option would be highly appreciated. Also, a list view is required for users with a lot of notes apart from the thumbnail views that are available. Introduce dark mode."
4715,A Google user,"July 18, 2019",4," this app was really improved over the years but I wish I could organise my notes in the custom order. Also I would like to have an option see the list of titles, it would be more compact and would allow to see more at once"
4716,Lior Cohen,"October 29, 2018",2, Used to LOVE the app. Last upgrade is awful. The app is now very very slow. Gets stucj otfen while typing. Impossible to work with it. Am running on LG G6. Please fix!!!!!!
4717,Jorel Okpani,"November 1, 2018",4," Excellent app, just what I need , will give it 5 stars if you include Formatting options (Bold, italic, underline, strike through, bullet points , etc. )"
4718,Dave Fookes,"February 12, 2019",5," Great app - very useful, use it a lot to share & sync lists. Also good for quick save of photos & spoken notes. But what can: 'Add more content by expanding the drawing canvas' possibly mean??"
4719,Naman Sinha,"March 13, 2019",5," The best app for keeping and maintaining the notes. The best part of the app is you can use it by having chrome extension. No need to save the entries, it is done automatically."
4720,Aditya Singh,"May 16, 2019",5, It's a very useful app from Google. You can create your own personalised notes and save it for future use. You can even set reminders for your daily or periodic chores. It has been very helpful for me.😊
4721,Alf,"November 16, 2018",3," I have used this app since its release, but now all of a sudden I can't search and therefore I spend a good 10 minutes trying to find the correct information. Why does the search function not work anymore??"
4722,yaka bot,"October 29, 2018",3," Latest update is horrible. Used to recommend this app to everyone I know, but not anymore. Luckily I had a backup of an older version and installed that instead. Sad that you had to change what worked well."
4723,Masih Golbidi,"November 18, 2018",3," I really like the app, but it would be super great if they could introduce transparent widgets. Almost all of the other notes apps that I have are capable of doing this, except for Google Keep."
4724,Mike Kasberg,"October 23, 2018",5," This app is AMAZING! Love the new redesign 💖!  The best sticky note/todo app out there, easy to edit your notes on your phone or computer and everything's synced. Simple & elegant!"
4725,Trong Nguyen,"February 12, 2019",5," The fact that it's in cloud, you can't lose the notes. My cell died and was able to have acces to my notes on my PC. I was able to open it easily on my new cell."
4726,Evelyn Ramiro Freitas,"March 14, 2019",2," Would be 5 stars if we could format texts, if we could have more tools to personalize the notes, including tables, graphics... Really love the app but to be used as Dairy Journal still a lot of things to improve."
4727,Jan Smolaga,"October 11, 2018",1," Unusable as intended. Changes order of notes seemingly at random and doesn't add new notes to bottom of the list, despite that feature being turned on. I know it's free, but this is basic stuff"
4728,Ben Seefeldt,"October 19, 2018",2," Previously one of my most used apps. Removal of the background color and border shadow in the main view makes it much harder to browse notes, and really decreases usability."
4729,Kimberly Fletcher,"November 27, 2018",4," I love the fact that i can access my notes from my cell, tablet and PC. The only improvement that i would like to see is spellcheck. Otherwise, this app has everything i need and more!"
4730,Maneesh Pathik,"April 30, 2019",2," have written note? using devices with styles, there should be option to take hand written notes. not ""insert picture"" option. but actual hand written. with writing recognition."
4731,Norman Robinson,"April 12, 2019",4," Very useful, with a few obvious needs for those who take lots of notes (needs better sorting & default views by tag or category options) however the peace of mind with syncing to your Google account is worth any minor annoyances."
4732,Jason Aigen,"January 15, 2019",3, Good app but allowing control of text size is needed as well as dark backgrounds (ideally custom background and text color). These are pretty basic functions to not have.
4733,David Koggan,"March 26, 2019",1," I love this app. I am posting a 1 star review, though, because it opens to a blank white screen now! Please fix this ASAP — I use it to track and record a lot of important info!"
4734,Akhil Madhav,"March 8, 2019",3," could have add bold italic underline options. want it i am a one note user, i only reason i m using this in my nokia 6.1 cos it opens up fast which the one note doesn't and then is the discomfort which is lack of bold italic underline typing options"
4735,A Google user,"December 6, 2018",5," Hello sir, I've an account with Google keep document.Recently I reinstalled this app but fount there is no option for creating any account.I have many important notes and photoes with my previous account. Now sir please help me to get back my data."
4736,Sascha Marc Stankiewicz,"April 24, 2019",1, Requires Google Play Services. Took about 5 min to install... Inaccaptable for a texteditor with cloudsaves... Unfortunatly i wrote a lot of notes over the years. However Im interested in an alternative.
4737,L M,"January 30, 2019",5," A must have. Easy to use, never forget a thing, always there to add new things. Love it for its simplicity and its great for people like me always on the go and forgetful. Keep up the good work guys."
4738,Nour,"November 9, 2018",4," Wow! the new update is very cool, but i hope you will add folders feature to make our notes more organized. Also, it will be so powerful if you added pdf editor like making it your digital tool for studying not only note taking."
4739,Saloni Sharma,"October 10, 2019",4," Needs more customization options. Doesn't have a night mode, different fonts or formatting, simpler view mode, or a single note widget. The look is annoying with big notes files and no other way to view notes."
4740,Pedro Rolo,"June 9, 2019",4," nice app, but there are two ui Things that imho should change: 1. recording audio notes should be done by press and hold, akin to sending a voice message in messenger; 2. the notes should be reverse sorted by ""last edited""."
4741,Annalurhge,"June 8, 2019",5," Great app! Though I would like to suggest something. Something like a Search In Notes feature so that it wouldn't be a hassle to find the specific texts I need in a note. Again, great app!"
4742,Bianca Jison,"June 5, 2019",1, Worked fine until Dark Mode rolled out and made my widget dark without me ticking that option! no my widget looks terrible on my CLEAN and LIGHT COLORED WALLPAPER!!! No option to change it anywhere that I can see. - Samsung 9
4743,Tadbhav Kumar Singh,"June 6, 2019",5," A must have app for each and every person keep the things noted on the go and it is saved , and linked with google so no chances of data Loss. Also it has some very nice features , Like GRAB IMAGE TEXT is a marvelloius one . loved it , it reduces your work by 99%."
4744,J L,"June 13, 2019",1," Terrible. The list doesn't sync and update properly for people to see. Family has been buying things twice because of weird sync and update issues. Will definitely not recommend this app. Quite embarrassing, since it's Google's own app, yikes."
4745,boom q34,"June 23, 2019",3, i know this app is not really designed for drawing but my problem is when you do try to draw something and then you try to erase something the eraser clears the entire drawing line thats my ony problem with this app other than that great app for taking notes
4746,Jezreel Franklin,"June 28, 2019",4, Wonderful app. But pasting an already numbered list of items into the app from clipboard creates a duplicate numbering. It's quite a hassle having to go through each listed item to delete.
4747,Logan Kuizenga,"August 6, 2019",2, good but i feel it can be improved. should have templates for different themed notes. like a diary/journal entry layout or a grocery list layout. and different ways to show lists and ti have both notes and lists on one page
4748,rexmasonjr76,"July 27, 2019",1, I think this is one of the worst apps I've downloaded. I wouldn't call it ideal at all. Seperating notes is one of the most frustrating things on the planet. It dosen't allow you to put the notes in the order you want. Find another app because this one won't do the trick.
4749,Padro Kosi,"August 2, 2019",3, The app is not secure. No password lock and fingerprint lock. These features need to be added Asap. Everything other thing about the app is xo good though I always which it has other features in EVERNOTE app. With password or fingerprint lock; this app deserves 5 stars.
4750,Halo,"August 7, 2019",4," Useful. However pls add settings to disable swipe action. I permanently archive/delete notes when swiping on the Keep widget. More customisation would be great to have as well. Oh, and UI doesn't have to look so ugly."
4751,Terry Kortness,"August 20, 2019",4," My wife and I use it for shopping weekly. Love being able to share oir shopping lists, load lists, things to remember. At 67 every memory aid like this one is(are) wonderful. Thank you for a wonderful app."

4753,Nikita Karnach,"December 11, 2019",2, Bad synchronisation between devices
4754,A Google user,"March 8, 2019",3," Google Assistant reminders should sync with reminders in notes. Also, should be able to make separate notebooks and also make some notes private. also, password verification wouldn't be a bad perk to have"
4755,Shobai Eksathe,"September 28, 2019",3, Notes creates extra space even though i did not used enter to go to the next line... (Previous Version Had It Too) Although There's some features that should be added like 'bold-italic-underline' but other than that it's really good.
4756,Pam Siloti,"October 8, 2019",5, Love this I can archive important things. Pun and color code things. Transfers from one phone to the next if I switch phones. Only thing I don't like is how it emails.... personal preference.
4757,purpledreamcatcher64,"November 5, 2019",4," Good, but would be great if you could create tables and also to be able to add more than one label."
4758,Arnab Mukherjee,"November 18, 2019",5, smartphones were created so that ppl could have a chance to use Keep!
4759,Will Palmer,"January 2, 2020",1, Please rename this app. It looks so bad as Google Keep notes
4760,Batara Watson Simanjuntak,"February 18, 2020",5, Would be perfect if you add fingerprint lock feature
4761,Jamal business,"December 7, 2018",5," Just wonderful... Bestest of all notes. Suggestion... While notes in checkbox on, should be able to go to next line for same check box.. And offcourse next check box should be made available..."
4762,Anand Krishnan,"October 10, 2018",4," Good App. I feel that it can be tweaked to do more. Also, need to have possibility of password protection for some notes. Need to explore same fully"
4763,Doug Hall,"September 25, 2018",5," It's great for my desktop and phone, and comes in handy for Docs, too. Wish it had more writing styles and document designs for my stylus on chrome os, though."
4764,Meet Shah,"October 5, 2018",4," The app is really nice to keep notes of your important stuff. It should also come with protection layer that it can opened with pattern, pin, password or fingerprint."
4765,Tony M,"November 6, 2018",2," App registers 50% of the reminders. App used to be good. Collaboration on notes is terrible. Tried to share a shopping list and that failed terribly- missing items, poor sync, etc"
4766,Brock Mariano,"March 5, 2019",4, My favorite note taking app but the only downfall is it does not have an option to password protect your notes. If that option is ever added then this is a 5 star app!
4767,SHIVALEE DESHPANDE,"November 15, 2018",5, I love this app! And the best part of it is we don't have to save anything in it. Just write and leave and it will never ever get deleted unless you yourself delete it.
4768,Jason Halliday,"October 28, 2018",5," Much better than One Note or Evernote (in my opinion). I just like the way it is laid out, its quicker for me to get a note down quickly instead of going through endless menu's."
4769,Gajendra Rathore,"January 25, 2019",3," Nice one helped me to remain organized, but some incorporation needed like bold italic colorful text and moreover calendar specially while you take a note too see the day of the date,for what I open calendar so need to exit enter repeatedly."
4770,A Google user,"November 14, 2018",5," A constant companion and used numerous times daily. Solid, reliable and simple and intuitive to use. Can't imagine how I managed with it."
4771,A Google user,"November 8, 2018",1," New design ui killed the wonderful search functionality. Man, it's a Google product, but with flawed search function.. It's very hard to believe. Due to this flaw, this app deserves ZERO stars, only because this mistake is from Google.."
4772,Mallory Albright,"October 14, 2018",5, Works offline ✔. bets for writing notes ✔. Record audio and insert images ✔. I think Google has out done them selves for a 10th time. Bravo! Best note pad ever!
4773,J EAIII,"March 22, 2019",5, I love it.  Simple to use and easy to transition between my phone and PC using a browser like chrome for lengthy note taking or list making.
4774,Z Panda,"April 6, 2019",1, Forget tuis app Doesn't sync anymore. You better use a simple text file in a cloud account instead of this piece of xhit. That way your notes will be up to date and this app won't use up space on your phone
4775,Gino Corradin,"October 10, 2018",4," it should be perfect with sub lists. actually I use for shopping and as Todo; shopping list are synced trough persons that I choosen, each person can add items (there is neither the concept of admin, nor the read only view)."
4776,Lava Trip,"May 2, 2019",5, Microsoft has a competitor and also purchased this app. now I'm worried they'll discontinue this one. I do love it though and I hope they keep this one around or at least if they discontinue it to make it easy to import all of my todos to there alternative.
4777,Rizka R,"May 15, 2019",5," the application is good, but can't paste text from other applications like sms or other. may this can be fixed by the developer. overall i like this 👍"
4778,Liliya Vargas,"March 16, 2019",3," Widgets don't display the full note anymore. neither is it full-size in the list. I'd love to have selective check boxes, as well. But overall, I prefer this app over others."
4779,ammar alsayed,"October 11, 2018",4," More Performance optimization please, when I try to edit a note and write above written text it doesn't write instantly and take long time than expected.. The app always expected that we write at the end of the note :("
4780,aries yordianata,"May 10, 2019",1," Useless. I typed notes in the web version. But when i opened it on apps, nothing appears. The web version still have my notes though. My internet connection is also good. It keeps loading but nothing appears. Whats wrong?"
4781,Matt Kelly,"March 21, 2019",2, Worked well before but now is not opening on my OnePlus 6. Just a blank white screen. I can open existing notes from my widget but not the app from the shortcut or create new from the widget.
4782,Nhew Nhame,"February 17, 2019",5," I own 1 pixel 2 XL and 1 3 XL. For some reason the 3 XL don't sync this app. I tried everything. Delete and reinstall, etc, etc. update: Finally found the solution: Deleted google task from gp3xl and started syncing."
4783,Tiago Trad,"November 20, 2018",1," I love this app, but the search is not working on my OnePlus 6 (I hope it's only on my phone) and it was driving me crazy. I'll rate it 5 once this is fixed"
4784,Harry Knappett,"December 29, 2018",4, Useful for lists. Single level of indent can be used to provide subheadings. You can get a text file from this app but it will require editing. No problem unless you've already written an essay (it's not intended for this).
4785,Jonathan Alves,"September 17, 2018",4," An amazing app! For don't forget any idea or note. In my opinion, could have an organization system based in folders structure and a markdown formatter. Thanks."
4786,Abhinav Joshi,"December 31, 2018",5," Everything is great, can you provide more view options. like a bird eye view, all notes on very small scale. and also an option for meeting notes keeping their individual color same."
4787,Ida Rodgers,"April 9, 2019",2, The app requires too many clicks to open a note such as a shopping list and way too many for a voice-to-text note. This is probably a great app for what it does. It just does not suit my needs.
4788,Marita Svare,"September 22, 2018",3, I have used it mostly as a shopping list and love the option to share it with my husband. But there's no option to add image next to a shopping item that's in the list.
4789,Kkloe Kaishoto,"March 6, 2019",1," It is good, but every time you try to select some numbers it pops up a dialog asking if you want to call it, edit it, god damn that is the most useless feature anyone can have in a editor"

4792,A Google user,"July 15, 2019",4," Great ""free-form"" and flexible app for notes and tasks, but the ""reminder"" alarms are not reliable. Repeating reminders often fail to recycle and disappear while other reminders continue long after the note generating them has been deleted."
4793,Chandragiri Vikki,"June 14, 2019",1," With the recent updates, Collaborator is not working. i'm not able to share the notes with anyone which i'm able to do it in previous versions. please fix this ASAP. @Google, Could you please check on this and provide an update pleasee.."
4794,Susan Cody,"June 8, 2019",4, Really needs sorting capability for lists. The instructions for sorting are cumbersome and waste a lot of time. Still haven't figured how to paste data back from Docs to Keep .
4795,Enzo M. Sanchez,"June 4, 2019",5," I love it, it's very useful for me, because the app have a reminder option, which I use every day. Also, I put my ideas into the notes when I'm sure that I'm gonna forgot them. This app deserves 5 🌟"
4796,Rey basil,"June 11, 2019",5," this app is wonderful. simple, easy to use, and has many feature. will be so much better if you add the hidden note or lock feature. but overall, love it"
4797,Brandon Elliott,"May 27, 2019",3," Cool app, but would prefer that it comes pre-installed on all Android devices since there isn't a default note-taking app nor reminder app like there is on iPhone/iOS (notes & reminders)."
4798,Vanessa Robbert,"June 5, 2019",3," I really like this app, but when I save notes, they sometimes appear at the bottom of the page. I wish there was a way to organize the order of the notes based on how recently they've been edited/saved."
4799,Syed Faizan Mohammed Ali,"June 19, 2019",3," it would be better if i can change font size bcoz its too large and looks bulky and it dont have password protection for notes, if font size can be changed them i can see more notes dialogues in less space also it would be much better than present look"
4800,The Busy Sandhu,"June 26, 2019",3," the only problem is when scribbling notes with a pen. it does not gives you additional area. Please work on that, otherwise its a decent app and gives much more control and no ads."
4801,Reefi Nasser,"June 28, 2019",4, The only thing that this app need is (whenever u open a note u have to choose if it's check boxes or regular note) if we can combine both in single note it would've been awesome.. Thnx for the app it's very very useful
4802,Christopher German,"June 28, 2019",2," As a long-time user of Keep I find it has great features and useability, but the app has used 1.6 GB of background data in three weeks. That's absurd. Deleted."
4803,Ikester & Reno,"July 1, 2019",5," My personal assistant is my smartphone, but one of my most priced app is Google Keep. It's literally my daily planner & archive! Welcome to the paperless digital age! LOVE IT!! Thanks GOOGLE!"
4804,Thomas Malayil,"July 4, 2019",4, this is a great app and does everything i need it to but the only problem that I have with it is that even if you put it in dark load the widget will still stay in bright mode.
4805,Avi Aggarwal,"July 4, 2019",3, It is an amazing application and I use it like every hour to write my checklists and notes. But it could've been better if there is a lock feature for particular notes like other applications out there.
4806,Aashish Ranjan,"July 31, 2019",1," There's no text formatting feature ( like bold, italic, underline, different font types, etc.) available in this app. Also, no option to lock a confidential note is available. So, please update these features to make it more useful."
4807,Winnic Ng,"August 10, 2019",5," I like the powerful search ability, accesible by multiple platforms and the tag features. And most important that its neat and user friendly if there is one more request, it would be the text formatting -- bold, italic, underling..."

4809,Nathan Shearer,"August 16, 2019",1," Allows you to create vector drawings, but only allows very low resolution raster export. There is no way to save your SVG sketches at all! Do *not* save notes expecting you can share or export them!"

4811,Badara Ndiaye,"August 27, 2019",5," Absolutely wonderful. Just a thing, it'll be great to be able to filter the labels that appear on the board. Also to drag and drop a note into another note. Many thanks."
4812,Miloš Zlatanović,"October 20, 2019",3," I was offline, writing lyrics for a song. Finished about 90%. I exited and entered the app multiple times and everything was there. When I got wifi, all my offline stuff was gone. I just got Android 10 btw."

4831,akash Verma,"April 22, 2019",3, searching in notes is just horrible 😣.if a note is large then you have to find the word you're looking for yourself. And the word isn't even highlighted.
4832,Runar Fredagsvik,"January 8, 2019",5," One of the best note taking applications out there. Fast, stable, easy to use, elegant amd powerful. The only thing it's missing is dark mode."
4833,A Google user,"February 8, 2019",5," Quick note taking made simple. From construction projects to grocery shopping. The ability to recognize text from an image is flawless, in my opinion it's the best."
4834,Tilek Abylesov,"September 15, 2018",5," Awesome app, but can't share my notes with other users from this app (there are some issues with it). From browser have no problems with sharing. Completely useful! Like it a lot!"
4835,Victoria Caoile,"November 25, 2018",5, I love it. A notepad / sticky note version for mobile phones with added features. It has the ability to share and send a reminder.
4836,Somjit Nag,"October 30, 2018",5," Love the new thin and light UI. Looks much better than the older, more boxy and bold UI. And this app has always been one of my favorite productivity apps anyway! Keep up the good work keep ! 😃"
4837,Vosatorp,"February 22, 2019",3," 1)I Would like to be able to emphasize the text with different types of font, such as bold or large. 2) I Would like to be able to remove the spell check, that is not to emphasize the text in red."
4838,ANSHI SINGH,"March 22, 2019",4, It is good to use.It would be great if i could search a word and the word will be selected where ever it is on the sheet of keep ! Editing should be given more options.
4839,YamatoXion,"September 15, 2018",3, Good app. The problem I have with it is that it only allows you to write so much text before it cuts off. (Limited word count)
4840,Ace G,"December 10, 2018",1," It was my favorite app until an update in November. Now search doesn't work - or rather, the search results are white-on-white, so it's essentially useless."
4841,Volodymyr Tymtsiv,"January 8, 2019",4," Love this App. Very useful.   But it would be great if I could move some item of list to an another note, not just moving in scope of the note."
4842,Jay Furick,"May 6, 2019",2," Good idea, but very cumbersome to use. I can't figure out how to get notes to list alphabetically. Not very intuitive. Can't import notes from other apps like ColorNote."
4843,A Goo Gle Uuser,"November 17, 2018",1, I have been using the widget (the one that shows pinned notes) but it disappeared last week. Only quick capture widget is available for use. Please help store the other widget that display pinned notes.
4844,Cole L,"July 5, 2019",3, 😩 Everytime I open it and scroll down the notes fly around and cause me to archive them. this especially is a HUGE problem for my parents who don't know how to get them back. turn off the random flying around animation or swipe to archive or preferably both.
4845,Joby Chittilappilly,"October 18, 2018",5," I admit that, Keep app is an excellent app from the google.👌 only request is, kindly have an option of read only mode , which we can read only , not to edit the file."
4846,Oliver Lam,"May 15, 2019",3," I like the simplicity. There is room for improvement. For example, why can't I mark a reminder as 'done' from the notification? This should be a feature."
4847,Shruti Shet,"October 5, 2018",2," In this app, the notes, and tasks or anything which we note down just gets vanished from no where and I'm unhappy for the first time with Google Keep after using this app for so long..."
4848,Mandeep Singh,"March 21, 2019",4," the best note taking and tasking app which includes draw, voice n pic attachment... SUGGESTION: Please also add a calculation note/estimate just like this application named CALCTAPE by Sohcettler Software GmbH this will make KEEP the Perfect Note taking app"
4849,Omkar Mahale,"February 17, 2019",5, A very useful app. Especially for students who have to revise their notes as and when they want to. Also helpful to maintain a schedule and work on it.
4850,Nathan Rzepecki,"October 8, 2018",5, Great app. Use it for so many things. Collab with others. Meeting notes templates. So many uses keep it up. Please don't kill this product
4851,Péter Gervai,"December 13, 2018",4, Works quite well. It's not possible to share read only but copying is an alternative to that. When multiple persons edit the same time weird things happen.
4852,Chris Riofta,"October 26, 2018",1, This new update screwed everything up. It was easier to see and find all my notes before and now it just looks terrible. Go back to the previous UI!

4857,Pypa P,"May 21, 2019",5, Used to be great. Now I get a message stating that my notes are not saved even though I keep saving them. They may or may not be there if I click out. What happened? I'm having trouble with Drive as well. Please fix.
4858,Olinka Green,"November 29, 2018",5," One of my favorite apps. I can use Keep anytime. Anytime I need it. You can set a reminder to come back to the quick idea you had, I love it!"
4859,David Brainard,"January 13, 2019",5," I use this app for sharing information with my clients. very useful for people on the go. sometimes i use this on my pc laptop and immediately syncs on my mobile device. deserves all the stars i gave, to rate this app."
4860,Mark Wadas,"February 5, 2019",5," Best app for organizing notes of all types. Written, drawing, voice, and photos. Time or location-based reminders work very well. Collaboration is great for grocery lists!"

4862,Kurtus Kahle,"January 20, 2019",5," Simple, elegant, syncs beautifully between devices, gives the options you need without bloat. My only improvement would be a night mode (black background option)."
4863,Noora,"May 6, 2019",5," I really like how simple and beautiful are the notes, I hope u have better settings of reminders just like iOS reminders, it keeps popping on the notification bar and on locked screen till u really finish doing what u have to do, so i hope u really improve the reminders."
4864,Jenna Foong,"June 8, 2019",4," enjoy using this as my daily to-do and task tracking list, however, would be great if I can bold/underline the texts and a wider range of color labels."
4865,John Gozon,"June 1, 2019",4," I could give you five stars but something is missing for me. I wish that you can have features that enlarge the font size inside a note so that it is readable for people like me. All in all, it is a good app."
4866,P R,"June 21, 2019",1, A note I frequently use for reference has gone. I didn't delete the note. And google forms say there's no way to recover. Google keep is not reliable at all.
4867,Chris Lim,"July 4, 2019",3," After the recent update, when I set the item as a checkbox, I cannot hold and select a word to copy. I must turn off the checkbox, hold down and copy the word and turn it back again. Please fix it."
4868,Matt Graves,"July 24, 2019",5," 2019 and Android is Insane Awesome! I have used this app since its start and I love how easy it gets to input information. Now I can seamlessly use typed text, TTS is excellent now or images and drawings with links to expand upon my ideas. Excellent Google!"
4869,Michael Hunter,"July 29, 2019",1, This thing just sometimes drops a note.  Losing data is not reasonable for an application like this.  If you search around this seems to be common and the google response is ...
4870,chetan gaikwad,"July 26, 2019",3," I have been using keep for few years now, overall experience is good. I would really appreciate if we could have  the delete action on the quick menu rather than having it on the collapse menu."
4871,shweta singh,"August 2, 2019",5, I love this app bcz whenever i want to express me i use it..whenever i want to recall things i use it..I can express here without any term n condition it's not judgement to me like humans on the other hand it's very useful to it makes things easy.
4872,Martin Dimov,"August 1, 2019",4," I like the app because you can write notes in different colors, with pictures and some features like these. I don't like that you can't make security notes with password or something like that."
4873,Andi,"August 2, 2019",3, It's very helpful and I had a good experience with it. Unfortunately it deleted itself off of my phone and I lost very important voice recordings and notes that I need for a school project.
4874,Amit Phatak,"August 28, 2019",4, Very good task management app for me. One feature suggestion: a note in keep can get modified multiple times. Can we have a small date/time stamp showing last modified value somewhere on the note?
4875,usman shoukat,"September 4, 2019",1, It was working pretty good but now it just keeps on hanging every time I try to taka a note. It is just frustrating me now. Get it fixed Google.
4876,harshit gunani,"September 10, 2019",3, I don't like the way notifications get clubbed together. Also I would prefer if it could also help in forming new habits or in creating routines by motivating the user to stick to it.
4877,Abhishek Agarwal,"October 14, 2019",3, You guys should have an option to add text on an image when its added to a note. You already have an option to draw on it. An option to add title on each image within a note would help.
4878,Lucie Lucianora,"October 15, 2019",4," Numbers of words are limited so you cannot write your next Wattpad fiction with Notes 🤷🏻‍♀️. And 32mo for a note app it isn't very light. Nevertheless, these are the only negative points. Notes is easy to use, fast and hardly ever crashes."
4879,Dalton Holt,"October 24, 2019",5, Love it. Works for simple reminders and lists to keeping track of bills and budgeting money. Great app. And syncs with all your devices. Another wonderful app by Google.

4888,Mark Paras,"April 9, 2020",5, Minimal and simple note-taking app.
4889,Ricky Pak,"November 1, 2018",3," Good but still have lots of shortcomings, e.g. cannot insert images in body of note, cannot turn on RichText, cannot sort by date or color, bugs around setting default times for reminders"
4890,Mansi Shah,"December 31, 2018",3, This is a very useful app. thanks a lot. I just want to ask if u can pl add option for hourly reminders also. and also no disturbance period for reminders when we select hourly.. thank you.
4891,Mg Tim,"March 5, 2019",4, Good to use but I cannot type korean words correctly on the title bar. I have to type them in the notes first and copy and paste it to the title bar.
4892,Tae Kim,"December 21, 2018",5," They fixed the bug! Ever since the update to the UI, all the panes during a search were invisable when my phone was on power saving mode. Now I can see my search panes with no problem."
4893,Chirag Parmar,"March 3, 2019",5," Best application for notes that is available for free, i use it everyday and also the functionality to use it as an application on my desktop via browser is the best thing i have ever seen, Thank you Google <3"
4894,A Google user,"November 20, 2018",4," I believe notes should be able to be grouped together. Instead of having one very long ass note. Otherwise, I like how I can see my notes on all Google devices."
4895,Tricia G,"October 27, 2018",3," Like the functionality, dislike the latest style/look update. White notes on white background? Yuck! Harder to differentiate between notes, even with that border around each of them."
4896,Hugues Ebert Mertilus,"April 6, 2019",5," The app is very useful and I like it a lot. I'd like you to add some features like: Bold, Underline, Italic and bullet as well."
4897,Amirul Mus,"November 18, 2018",5," Amazing app. Can you put a word sort ascending order, A-Z ? Because i often take down notes of words for translation and definition. It would be easier to search thru my notes if it had that function."
4898,Ramesh L,"May 13, 2019",5, Great note taking up with a wonderful reminder option. can you please provide a clean up option for all checked items? Right now it's manual. Also please provide more font choices. Thank you.
4899,Steve Faktor,"January 16, 2019",4," good features, but really needs a compact view mode (like simplenote), easy import options, ability to do file attachments (not just photos), and numbered lists"
4900,Dave Kessel,"February 20, 2019",2, Very basic note app. Can't even alphabetize! Few options to customize. But it does share data with the PC version. Google seems unwilling to put much effort into upgrades.
4901,redd ztone,"March 6, 2019",4, pretty good except that the icon is bugged out for me. has been fkr a while. :p other than that theres really nothing more to say edit: a reinstall did not fix the icon. its wierd...
4902,David Onipe,"May 15, 2019",5, Convenient and simple note pad. I'm impressed with the ability to sync the same app on all my three mobile devices. Now if I edit a note on my tab it gets edited also on my phones. Amazing experience!
4903,Jim Zavist,"October 25, 2018",4," I do not like the change in the appearance that was done today - the new typeface and kerning are harder to read! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
4904,billy pierre,"January 14, 2019",5, This app is a great note keep. Like really amazing but if you guys can just make a ptach to where you can keep you notes secured and for no one to see that would make the app the best app in the market. Keep up the good work guys😁
4905,A Google user,"December 31, 2019",5," It's great for to-do lists, check lists and shopping lists."
4906,Kyla Fajrera,"September 12, 2018",3," i cant use keep for widgets, it says ""failed to read the app data, cannot start the app"" i dont know what's wrong but please fix this! i really love this app but this error is so annoying! i use an oppo phone by the way."
4907,VishaL SondotrA,"July 2, 2019",4," Change the look make it interesting .....and most importantly it takes lot of time synchronisation......improve that....though make it of 20MB no problem...but make it kinda work properly and without like ""App not responding"""

4909,Алексей Свечников,"December 5, 2018",4," 1) Add multiple locations for reminders, please.. (I can buy goods in several stores) 2) Add ability to disable editing except for checkbox (for mark completed and are not afraid to delete anything)"
4910,A Google user,"October 26, 2018",4, Good app. Not sure how I can share part of notes with friends & family. No possibility to highlight certain entries (or at least I didn't find how to). Good overall
4911,Abhinay Nand,"November 19, 2018",3," Good app, but in this i can't adjust the image by myself. When I add an image then it goes to the top of the heading."
4912,Suet Li,"October 18, 2018",4," My most used app everyday! Suggestion: please allow ability to reorganize/reorder ""checked off"" items as it's helpful for those keeping lists that can be re-used again e.g. Groceries list, etc"
4913,BABY GURL,"May 15, 2019",5, It's a very helpful app to have. It does EXACTLY what it says and is super easy to use. I have it on all of my devices (and downloaded it on my husbands as well).
4914,Amit Patel,"March 26, 2019",2," Great as is now however it would be good have a lock function for a note so that content cannot be modified by mistake other tick, untick items, can be very helpful to use as a kind of a fixed shopping/task list."
4915,phyo,"May 22, 2019",4," hey google! just a suggestion. it will be great if you guys could add a keyword search function in each note itself. it will be so much easier to find what you need, if your note is too wordy and all."
4916,A Google user,"October 25, 2018",5," Love the new design but notes should be encrypted. I'm sure this can be done. Really need it to compete with other note taking apps. Mozilla is introducing a note app, which I think is encrypted. Please looking to it."

4919,Kevin Ramsay,"December 13, 2018",5," Note taking apps are the least exciting thing you can think of when it comes to phones, but Keep is so useful, so well put together and has such a varied input selection that it becomes possible the most useful app on your device. Truly useful"
4920,Alex Fouss,"December 23, 2018",3," exactly what I need but it takes minutes to refresh. ""What's taking so long?"" ""oh just refreshing my text notes application on my phone I'll be over there in a couple minutes"""
4921,A Google user,"December 11, 2018",4, I like this. Is ok. But I need one feature in it. The ability to lock notes just like we do in Apple notes app. I love to have that feature here also since I have made Android my main device. Thanks.
4922,Smruti Bodhi,"October 4, 2018",5, It is everything I ever wanted. Managing tasks and writing ideas has become so much easy!! Highly recommend.

4928,jpyjessarg,"October 29, 2018",1, Stupid app. Asks to sync to collaborate but pressing the sync button does nothing. None descript about which sync setting its requesting. The app? The google account? Terrible convoluted and unhelpful app
4929,Rohit Chavan,"June 3, 2019",4, When searching for word(s) it returns with the entire keep note containing the searched word(s). Would be better if it highlighted the search result in the note.
4930,Matthew Guise,"July 5, 2019",2, An OK note app. Recently been getting warnings of high battery usage and noticed it had used 100Mb in background data on data network in the last 5 days with minimal to no actual use of the app.
4931,Pinaaz Bamanbehram,"July 8, 2019",1," Sync not working. Installed app. No notes displayed. Hence, added new note in app. But, web login shows few old notes present. Don't know what to do about the sync between the app and online web version."
4932,Kelsey Bennett,"July 8, 2019",4, Best app I've ever used for keeping my grocery list (wish it was easier to share it externally in list form) and just jotting down a quick note straight from my home screen. Love the new dark mode!
4933,Angela Fuhrmann,"July 29, 2019",4," love this app - my only recommendations for developers would be to allow the sub-list along with expanding and collapsing of sections of lists for groceries at different stores, vacation lists that involve packing for different people, christmas lists,etc for examples"
4934,Nick Turner,"July 19, 2019",3," Great app for notes and checklists, and ability to share is extremely useful. However, there is a battery drain issue and its constantly running in the background."
4935,Ravindra Wagh,"July 29, 2019",4," thank you google. Its very nice app... everything is fine just need some more functions like, BOLD, UNDERSCORE, VARIOUS FONTS- SIZES AND COLOURS. if this will be there it would be the perfect one. thank you."
4936,Anthony Falucho,"August 29, 2019",3, Can't Lock App. I used this app for a very long time for all my passwords. I found a different note app that needs my fingerprint to open app. So once I transfer all data to the new notes app I will uninstall Keep app.
4937,Jeffrey Jeffrey,"September 2, 2019",4," Great up, clean and better interface.. but you Know what will be cooler, getting a recording function on the app for recording thoughts audibly and also a lock function for some notes. Hopefully the next update has at least one of the two!"
4938,Jeff Tackes,"September 15, 2019",3," This app would be perfect if it was possible to format text ... bold ... italic ... underline ... font color, type, and size. Other note taking apps have this capability ... why doesn't Google Keep?"
4939,Natalie Roger,"September 22, 2019",1, Don't help me with my list. It's annoying and frustrating when I'm trying to make a list and Google thinks it knows what's next. You don't. Is that a feature I can turn off or am I stuck with this inefficient version?
4940,Helen Wood,"September 27, 2019",5," Love it, this app is great! Looks good. Very easy to make a quick note. Reminders works well. I seem to be using this instead of my calendar app. So far so good!"
4941,Dipteemayee Jena,"October 5, 2019",4, Please add read only feature. So we can only view and copy the text but can not edit. Because for now keep is editable every time so sometime texts get change and it is not good if the note is about any sensitive data
4942,D R,"October 27, 2019",1, Very Nice! Superb! Great App but with no security to lock app! 😂😂 Hope Google will add some security pin or locking system for keep app. Any one can easily pick your phone and go to keep to get every kept data 😁
4943,Veena Thakur,"October 15, 2019",5," I am using this app from last five six years, never have any security issues or anything else. Very easy to use and trustworthy for your all kinds of privacy ."

4946,Sheryl Basse,"December 3, 2019",5," I use this for notes, reminders or anything else that I need to take down quickly."
4947,Waqar Ahmad Hanifi,"December 19, 2019",5, One of the best note all used by far.... Simple .. organized ..and the bast think its Google you can save and access anywhere
4948,himanshu rai,"March 16, 2020",1, Need more quality
4949,Fox Chong,"March 20, 2020",4," Good app, convenient"
4950,Mister Ryoso,"April 22, 2020",1, Very ugly widget -_- make it look like a digital sticky note instead of having everything you noted on your app be shown to the widget. Please? Thanl you
4951,Core Knee,"April 22, 2020",1, Very ugly widget -_- make it look like a digital sticky note instead of having everything you noted on your app be shown to the widget. Please? Thanl you

4953,Joel Pilarski,"December 26, 2018",4," Overall it's a nice note app. What I would like to see is a way to have some notes (like passwords) secured with password, pin, fingerprint, etc."
4954,Roman Mbwasi,"December 9, 2018",1," New design is terrible and bland. Doesnt sync correctly anymore, the preview thumbnail is correct but when opening the item the content is incorrect and doesnt match the thumbnail."
4955,Jenkins Paul,"September 25, 2018",4, App is great except for drawings can be done in only one page. It will be helpful if Google comes with the scroll option in their next update.
4956,Arthur Ascalon,"November 13, 2018",4," Great hybrid note or list or task taking. Another nice ability is cloud ready. However, you'll need of getting use on how you take the notes, task or list taking."
4957,João Silva,"January 19, 2019",4," The app is very good and it has been growing! I think it would be useful if it has ""sub-labels to better organize notes :)"
4958,Theodore Dan,"February 6, 2019",3," Hmmm, strangely I don't find any option to order alphabetically items in a list. This would be more than useful. All other similar apps have it, so I can say that Keep is missing a basic function. Sad..."
4959,Nicholas Overfelt,"March 24, 2019",2," I expected a more robust app from google, I tried uninstalling and re installing but the app wont open then tries to open in split view, its the only app that causes me any problem."
4960,GuitarChordination,"June 1, 2019",5," Great note app from Google! Only suggestion I have is for a dark theme. Make that happen and I'll give it 5 stars! UPDATE (6/1/19): Love the new dark theme. As promised, just stamped it with 5 stars. Thanks!"
4961,Ahmad Awileh,"February 13, 2019",4," Security is missing for this great app, it will be great if you add password, finger print or two step security option to give more privacy, information inside should be protected."
4962,J V,"January 16, 2019",1," The notes, reminders and lists are so disintegrated it's an embarrassment to Google. I honestly can't remember half the time where I may have put a reminder."
4963,Jeff Monson,"March 24, 2019",4, Excellent. One of the best reminder apps around. Most of them are hard to use and the calendars almost unfathomable. This one is great in all categories.
4964,J Miller,"October 30, 2018",2," Was a great app until they ruined the UI. The font is tiny and hard to read now, and everything is a sterile colorless outline making it look incomplete and lifeless."
4965,Heather Quinn,"February 11, 2019",5," I love this app for its balance between functionality and simplicity. Just complicated enough for my projects, and just simple enough that I don't get exhausted using it. Just right. Thanks, guys."
4966,Kingsley Danso,"February 28, 2019",3, this app is fantastic but it has no option for securing the note. I suggest the developer works on it by upgrading it with the option of protecting the note with password. thanks

4968,Abhay Ts,"March 21, 2019",4, i have been using this app for about two years and my experience so far has been fantastic!.....but sadly i really wish there was one feature included which was to LOCK YOUR IMPORTANT NOTES with a PASSWORD rather than archiving it......
4969,Martin Stepo,"March 30, 2019",4, This is such an amazing app. Probably the most used on the phone. But please allow this to be the default shopping list for Google Assistant. Thanks!
4970,A Google user,"October 31, 2018",5," Often happens = take a picture, doodle it, then it seems it wont save, only shows the original picture. (On PC it shows fine). Frustrating."
4971,Ing Etellerannet,"May 25, 2019",5, Love it and very practical. Would be great for future updates if ticked items would be sorted alphabetically as this would be easier to across through for repetitive lists (e. G. Shopping lists)
4972,Yvonne Harris,"May 7, 2019",4, This is a very simple ap to use. I keep everything in one place now but adding anything can be a little tricky especially when you are on line.
4973,Pavel Petrov,"February 24, 2019",3," useful app, BUT, please add ability to make text bold and other features for text styling, this is very lacking, because of this, this app is not number one."
4974,Rebekah Johnson,"December 21, 2018",3," I like it and I use it all the time but the fact i cant figure out how to turn the suggestion texts off drives me nuts. I know what I'm trying to type, stop trying to guess."
4975,Robert Underwood,"January 7, 2019",2, I like to take handwritten notes...which is nearly impossible with Google Keep because once you get to the bottom of a page you're just kinda stuck there.
4976,Daniel Dovalina,"May 3, 2019",4, It's an excellent app. its great that this app will sync with other devices that I've signed into. The one thing i would like is the option to lock a certain note so others can't view it
4977,RooKoo Rarr,"January 8, 2019",4," hi, excellent product, love the cross-platform. however, since we use notes sometimes for sensitive information, can you please add a PIN or fingerprint authorization as the app starts on smartphones? thanks."
4978,Adrian Antal-Lazăr,"October 29, 2018",4, It's really helpful. I really dislike how they changed the note colours in the latest update. Everything looks so faded and ugly now.
4979,Kacey Meinhold,"May 21, 2019",4," I wish there were more formatting options like layered check lists and such. Otherwise, it's been really sufficient for my needs."
4980,James Vaughan,"January 16, 2019",4," Very handy. I often use it as a post it note programme. Available on all my devices even Windows (with the help,.of an app.from the windows. Store)"
4981,Kristen C.,"April 28, 2019",4, the app is wonderful but it would be better if there was no limit to the amount of words in a note and if a wider variety colours was added.
4982,Amarpreet Nagra,"January 13, 2019",2," I dont know what happened but if i search something by color and then select couple of notes, i got an option earlier to label them at once but now i dont have an option to do anything once selecting them."
4983,Gosha,"May 22, 2019",2," PLEASE, BRING BACK COLORED WIDGET! After the latest update, this dark themed mode just drives me nuts. Please, make an option for people to either choose a colored scheme for the widget or to dark. thanks. I love this app, but to bring attention of the developers - 2 stars."
4984,Tonia Arnall,"October 1, 2018",4," I really like the look and feel of this app.  Archiving lists is a great touch.  I would like a widget for the home screen, but overall, it's great."
4985,A Google user,"October 21, 2018",2, It failed to grab the text from a scan. The first future tense it just said it couldn't do it at all. Then it sort of did it but made quite a mess of it. Not useful.
4986,Hiraya Sevilla,"February 25, 2019",4," It's neat and organized. It's very easy to use. I just think it would've been better if we have some options to use different kinds of fonts, be able to use bullets and insert graphs."
4987,Aldin Juarez,"March 25, 2019",5," easy to use, this has kept me more organized with my entire life. very helpful as of late since i moved and had to keep track of things to buy, fix, and do"
4988,A Google user,"January 28, 2019",5, Fantastic app. Look no further to get your life organised. Nice and simple and completely intuitive to use. Syncs with your Google account so you can edit it anywhere. Toight!
4989,Mohammad Alshebani,"June 15, 2019",5, Easy to use and great design. Can use it for many things. Also you can set a date and time as a reminder of the notes. You can set that reminder to be repetitive whenever you want.
4990,Ray Davis,"April 19, 2019",4, It has been a reasonable note keeping App. A few crashes here and there but I can live with it. It could use some improving but not quite sure where. I enjoy it and will continue using the app.
4991,Christopher Lorenz,"October 26, 2018",2, Ehh it's okay but it gets easy to get lost in all your notes and if you're making a really long and detailed note page there is no way to increase or decrease the size of text or change its color to help with organization
4992,Matt Fitzpatrick,"October 27, 2018",1," Loved using this app until it was ruined by the 'Updated design to Google Material theme'. Poor show, much prefer the original layout and design. Will probably uninstall when I find another app now."
4993,The Original Twelve,"October 4, 2018",3," Love this app and I use it all the time, but the most useful part for me has yet to be added. A reminder to notify me do do something when I LEAVE a location would be nice."
4994,The Tech guy,"June 8, 2019",3," the new version has a bug, and it is annoying which is it making the app more useless, everytime i inputed a notes it will just hang and force stop or i mean it crashes, please fix this bug google, thank you!"
4995,Charanpreet Uppal,"May 31, 2019",4, Exceptional but worried me out kind of next step in our privacy invade collecting data and now giving adds according to our routine. oh just think i have scheduled buy eggs and Google gives me add at that time go to groffers :-!
4996,Bhagya Weerathunga,"June 1, 2019",4, Best app to keep all your notes synced across all your devices. only issue is there is no undo option in case you accidentally deleted something.
4997,Hridoy,"June 27, 2019",4," Simple, fast and effective but have more room for improvement, like more sub-note feature should be added. Reminder for individual sun-note is a must need feature."
4998,Muhammad Naeem,"June 29, 2019",4, It's Very Very Good App. But My Suggestion is that the Password Protection feature must be added added and folder feature is also must be added in this app on urgent basis so users can protect their data Safe!
4999,Nina Trankovа,"July 8, 2019",5, The best Google product for fast and efficient publishing on the go. I use it to take notes and for lists of items on variety of schedules I'm working on.
5000,Paul Ochoa,"August 2, 2019",4," Please add the option to highlight and to customize the font! (Bold, Italics, Underline) PLEEEAZE! It's a good app but please make it perfect by adding these two:) Thanks Google!"
5001,Kunal Zope,"August 22, 2019",4," Great app for keeping lists of all kinds. No ads, no worries for network connection, quick syncing 🤩😍 Fantastic work!! Just one suggestion - Why not introduce a search button inside lists to browse through them?"
5002,Артем Нахимчук,"August 29, 2019",4," Actually the best notes app I ever used. Although, if there will be more ‹text› settings such useful and ordinary as make text ‹left› and ‹mindle›, it certainly be able to get from all users 5 stars, and positive reviews."
5003,Dgv22,"September 3, 2019",2," I hope that there will be an option whereas I can make styles of the letters of my notes like turn it into BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINED etc. Still needs some basic features and improvements that this app doesn't have any."
5004,Chris Krahe,"September 8, 2019",4, Simple UI and great sharing capability. Only problem with checklist is for groceries (ie large list): it's time consuming to reuse checked items since they are in an unpredictable order and typing first few chars doesn't reliably find them.
5005,Brian,"September 26, 2019",3," All I ever get anymore is a message that states ""A refresh may be needed"" and then when I click refresh, the app hangs. I was hoping last update was going to address this, but I still have this problem."
5006,Tanya Bhatia,"October 1, 2019",5," This is an user friendly notepad. Updates the very minute details and it is like a traveller's desire. Be it shopping list or the best masterpiece of a writer, this brilliant app from goggle is the best."
5007,Namrata Kulkarni,"October 13, 2019",1," Hi, My notes don't get synced across my mobile and tab anymore. I updated the app on both the devices but no improvement. Please fix this 😭. I use this app for studying and half of my notes just aren't syncing."
5008,Lexi Berger,"October 11, 2019",1," Doesnt update anymore. I've made sure my setting were up to date, manually pull down to refresh and it refused to refresh. It's been 2 days it hasnt updated yet....not sure what else to possibly do??"
5009,lemon BON,"October 17, 2019",5," I wonder would it be better to allow users to add more sections other than predefined categories:""pinned"" and ""others"", just to be more organized in viewing all notes, in addition to the uasage of labels."
5010,nikita sharma,"October 22, 2019",4, Love this app. I use it for basically EVERYTHING. But Please add text formatting options like bolding and italics .... So that it's easier to identify important points in a paragraph of text
5011,Virendra Zope,"October 26, 2019",3," It's very simple to use but lags most of the power feature compared to Apple Notes like text formatting, table creation, MP3 attachment and many more which are the much require for business users."
5012,Sara Lyn,"November 3, 2019",5, Very useful & functional! An easily organized note taking app.
5013,Yanyan Ybanez,"November 18, 2019",4, I love the google keep but I want that I can have a password on my notes because there are some notes that is confidential.
5014,M Yousuf Ali,"November 28, 2019",5, Google keep is very beautiful. But why the password system did not make.
5015,Adeife Victor,"December 18, 2019",5, I've enjoyed this application since I've been using it... It's about 3 years now.
5016,Hanńah Sam,"February 4, 2020",5, This is the BEST app for keeping notes....winner!
5017,David Weaver,"May 10, 2019",3," I like Keep better than the iOS Notes app because it synchs with all my other Google data and all my devices. But for some bizarre reason, Google refuses to allow a simple sort function. Give us that and I`ll give five stars."
5018,Mark Tangonan,"October 26, 2018",4, This app is so helpful especially for those people who always forget their tasks to do like me. But the new update seems like a childish look. Bring back the old one please.
5019,Eser Akkoç,"March 15, 2019",3, Can't click on done and next time under the notification. Even location triggered it always shows the same notes always even if I had a chance to click done. Sometimes location based notification either late or never show up.
5020,Elena Hardy,"November 9, 2018",5, I like having the check boxes so I can keep track of what else we need from the store. It's also easy to share with my husband if he is stopping somewhere for groceries.
5021,Ganesh Prabhu Arumugasamy,"December 26, 2018",1," I needed to be able to add bullet points, make letters bold italic underline. cannot do any of that. hopefully it will get an update will all those basic features."
5022,James Broqueza,"October 1, 2018",3," It serves its purpose as your run on the mill notepad. However, it could be improved further by adding a security option for notes that contain sensitive informations."
5023,Michael Tsenter,"November 14, 2018",4," Please add options for dark theme, random or default note color, and to be able to add reminders for individual items within a given list. As is I can use it as either a to do list or note app but not both."
5024,jason clark,"December 16, 2018",4, I love this app I'm always telling people they should use it! My only problem with it is the latest update I can't drag a pinned item down below my top 2 pinned notes any more.
5025,Enrico Agnoli,"November 25, 2018",2, the app is simple and clean but has issue synchronizing the notes between multiple users. Some items in a list don't show up and some others gets corrupted...
5026,Naresh Pillella,"March 13, 2019",5, Its Great and the best thing ...... i need not sync it with any device .... it does it automatically and i do not need to get the data from old fone to new fone .... just log in and boom
5027,Dinesh Sharma,"January 23, 2019",5," This is a wonderful app to organize just about anything. Notes, pictures, important documents and much much more but sadly no way password protect it. Google are you listening?"
5028,Aman Shah,"October 30, 2018",4," Nice app & attractive interface! But just wanted Google to have options to BOLD, ITALIC & UNDERLINE the words/sentences. This helps in making up good notes with highlighted bold words."
5029,Ketan Nagare,"April 14, 2019",4," Great way to keep notes. thanx google but have a suggestion, what if you could include a little drawing ability in it? not full fledged but a little."
5030,María Questa-Ortiz,"November 27, 2018",3," It looks very nice and that can help organization. But it does not have list alphabetical sorting, and that's a deal breaker."
5031,A Google user,"January 16, 2019",5," I love this. Much better than other note taking apps. This is the best with no boring ads or other spam. Keep up the good work, Google."
5032,Rubin elijah,"November 7, 2018",4," This app is great & I always advise it to others, but please lease a possibility to view the titles only so it can be used to find what you need in many notes."
5033,Martin Jay,"April 29, 2019",3," I love this app and use it every day. However, as others have reported, it's not syncing across devices for me. I guess this issue began around the same time as the latest update."
5034,Daniel Clayton,"October 29, 2018",1," Do not use this app for anything more important than your shopping list. Had 3 years of important notes that have all disappeared after the app went from ""keep"" to ""google keep"""
5035,Mebo David,"May 29, 2019",5, app is really awesome with somebnice features like making a list and taking notes while in class or anywhere. I'd recommend this.. Edit - can you make it possible to enable it autocomplete songs and music albums?? would be nice....
5036,Abigail Detzler,"May 25, 2019",5," Love it! I can access Keep so many ways. I use this app daily to take quick notes, create my shopping list, and share my notes wit friends and family."
5037,A Google user,"October 27, 2018",3, It's okay. It could be so much better. My most recent complaint is that there isn't a way to change the font size - in the summary or the actual note.
5038,A Google user,"February 20, 2019",4," Very useful, well designed, fast. It just lacks a dark theme and the capability to auto-colorize notes when linked with a label."
5039,Ray Klassen,"July 14, 2019",4," EDIT UPDATE: Thank you for listening to me and for making this great app even better!! I'm still waiting for the option to change the color of the text though. Otherwise, a great step in the right direction!! 👍"
5040,shawn ehm,"March 12, 2019",5, Probably the best note keeping app you can use. Integrated with your google account so you can back up your notes very easily. Very easy to use yet aesthetically pleasing as well.
5041,Hamza YILDIZ,"November 5, 2019",1," When I search any word from my notes and press the note, Google keep is keeps closing itself. Never worked search and open any note anyways"
5042,Annoja Ojha,"April 25, 2019",5, This has helped me so much with my daily reminders and tasks and frequently used shopping list creation. This is a great app.
5043,Kaye Jimenez,"September 14, 2018",3," Needs more pastel colors for the notepad. Its colors are too bright. and options of making the text bold, underlined, or italicized"
5044,Sergey Konovalov,"April 12, 2019",3," Reminders are garbage in Google Keep. They easily don't fire on time, don't fire at all and are very easy to get rid of accidentally. The app is very good for keeping notes, though. Just use something else for reminders."
5045,John Todd,"January 16, 2019",5," It's able to save the data on one device to your Google account, so it is available to you if the original device is damaged/lost/stolen."
5046,Andrew Monterrosa,"March 11, 2019",5," i love this app. the only thing i wish there was an option for is a ""night mode"" I would prefer to hqve the app in black or dark gray. it would be a vute look instead of white."
5047,Mark Pinto,"May 28, 2019",5," The one plus 6 share bug was fixed shortly after posting my original review talking about the bug, glad that Google pays attention to reviews. I'm glad I can use the like normal again. Great note taking app, has app all the basics."
5048,Hahn Loh,"April 20, 2019",2," On wear os , the app seems to pull data from the net rather than the phone , at least that's what it feels like due to the amount of time it takes for the notes to sync."
5049,Aastha Misra,"April 9, 2019",3, It would be better of the app is password protected. sometimes one writes things not for every to see or save some information falling in to wrong hands if the device is lost. Password is essential.
5050,Khalfan Reyhan,"May 24, 2019",2," Good, but i can't organize my notes. The label and color system is not good enough when you have a lot of notes, and you need to searxh for the old ones."
5051,Robert W Rogers,"October 9, 2018",4," Great for notes and reminders. A few tools make it standout from the others - voice recording notes, pictures, etc."
5052,A Google user,"November 6, 2018",1," The app updated itself and randomly deleted an important note I've been using/editing over the past year. Now I'm freaking out. This app SUCKS. Also, the new UI is terrible."
5053,Kaushal Achal,"March 25, 2019",5, Wonderful App ! Keeps you update on any mobile / ipad you login ! You can keep your writings safely and can access them from anywhere ! Makes you Mr Update ! Thanks Google Keep Notes !
5054,Anupam Sangal,"October 25, 2018",5, Excellent app for daily notes. However I wish Google to add two more functions. Browsing of previous note by sliding left and opening a new nor within existing note.
5055,A Google user,"November 11, 2018",5, Too bad. I kept the photos of my gallery here. All deleted. And after placing the pictures there is no download option. Very disturbing and annoying.
5056,Cooper Broman,"June 1, 2019",4," Great app! The only thing I want is the ability to put bullet points and bold words. Please add this, it would make this app perfect."
5057,Lex Tronix,"June 4, 2019",5," Spectacular dark theme!! thank you thank you thank you so much, loving it!!! Hopefully this will be the start of a new trend that will span across all the other public Google apps? ;). It's EPIC!!"
5058,Shark Management Group LLC,"June 12, 2019",5, Very good App! Thank you Google. Another great app from Google. Thank you Google for making excellent apps that go with us everywhere! and for standing behind your apps. You are doing excellent work!
5059,Horatio Hellpop,"July 3, 2019",3," Almost perfect, but I really don't like the newer feature that gives you a suggestion in a small pop up window as you type. Really distracting and I need a way to turn it off!!"
5060,MO N,"November 4, 2019",5," Perfect app,still lack the feature to select all to do any actions like sharing notes to accounts"
5061,Layrd Olliff,"July 12, 2019",3, it worked great for awhile but since the last update whenever i go to correct something in a note it literally bounces to the bottom of the page. if you guys could fix it that would be awesome.
5062,Imtiaz Mahmud,"July 29, 2019",5, This is a great note taking app. Google keep is my favorite notes app. It work seamlessly on web and monike phone. when you write something on the app it also show on web in second. I think this is the best Note taking app.
5063,Rex Rosandich,"August 2, 2019",1," Right off the bat it was glitchy. It seems like you can't use this app without internet, which is a huge set back if you don't have signal but still need to access your notes."
5064,Terri Sanders,"August 6, 2019",5," Found a good app for my needs. Just simple lists of things I need to do, or lists of items I need to buy at stores, etc. All with the option of setting a reminder, if necessary. I like it so far."
5065,Norway Thomas,"August 9, 2019",5," Awesome product. I moved from Evernote to Google Keep, and it fits my purposes. I  like the simplistic and slick user interface.   One feature I miss do would be some simple formatting options for the text (example bold)"
5066,Vignesh G,"August 13, 2019",4," In my opinion, it's better to add a snooze button to the reminders .. and showing the 'Snooze' option in notification alongside 'Done' and 'Later' options would be priceless."
5067,programming talk's,"August 22, 2019",3, Hey google i found trouble when i enable dark theam in your app but this is good for my work as a growing android developer and i have a suggestion for drawing it is not important to put it in the you application from the my prospective and thanks Google.

And anyone read this i want answer about drawing tool why you had install it in your application.
5068,Stephanie Howes,"August 29, 2019",3," I like it but I wish I could sort by Shared as well as Date Created. More sorting options for mobile, I've seen the desktop version and it looks way easier to navigate."
5069,Mark Hammond,"October 7, 2019",5," Update: this feature got added. Yay! Unlike most Android apps these days, you can't expand different reminders into separate notifications like you can with other apps. That means you can't dismiss some and leave others."
5070,Yash Narang,"September 28, 2019",5, Great APP for taking notes. But please add an option to grab onto the screen while Drawing notes. It would help a lot to navigate through the screen.
5071,Bharat Sharma,"September 26, 2019",2, I have been using another app named BZ REMINDER which is better than this. Your app could have been better by providing a POP-UP notification for reminders with notification sound. I am uninstalling it right now however o would use this if said functionality been provided.
5072,naresh modina,"September 30, 2019",4, Very good app. The missing star is for lack of security. It would be extremely helpful if it can be added. So that certain notes can be protected.
5073,Farid HMS,"October 5, 2019",3, Needs to improve on search features. Searching for a word automatically searches the whole list. If it could pinpoint the exact search word this app would be great.
5074,Mahip patel,"October 15, 2019",5," App is great and easy to use, But it needs one more important feature which is lock the app or individual notes. It will give some more privacy to sensitive notes. Thanks."
5075,Ohi Bokth,"October 27, 2019",5," I use it on a daily basis for vocabulary, grocery shopping and to de list but i wish i could use this information to one note, Google sheets, etc. Its a simple great app though."

5082,Amul Star,"May 8, 2019",4, Nifty little app. A much needed suggestion though. Please implement an option for password protection for individual notes/list. Password protected notes will have blurred previews. Thanks.
5083,Mo Mo,"September 13, 2018",5," Bug fix necessary. When I go to my recent apps and click on Google Keep, it swipes itself away and then goes to the home screen. Then I need to reopen the app."
5084,Jeff Bancroft,"May 9, 2019",5, This has been the best app to make personal and business life organized! So easy to share and communicate with others on to-do or other lists!
5085,huhseiwhat,"October 26, 2018",2," hey Google... new theme?? cussin' unpleasant. I want the design I downloaded back. It used to look like actual sticky notes with colors that worked, it was fun. now just using this is a material eyesore. Looking for an alternative now."
5086,Donna Barza-Magbanua,"October 25, 2018",5," I love the new UI and font. I was pleasantly surprised after update when it opened, simple and easy on the eyes. Thank you!"
5087,Helen Buckley,"May 22, 2019",4, I really love this app. It helps me to be more organized. It recently added a day/night feature that is supposed to be able to reverse it and I am unable to reverse it screen still black.
5088,Ebony Rudolph,"October 8, 2018",5, I love the fact that this is connected to my Google account because I can write my notes in my phone and rest the phone if I need to with out my notes or anying that's connected to my Google account getting deleted. It's amazing.
5089,Arka Sarkar,"March 11, 2019",4," app is pretty good, but whenever i want to add images to my notes it always gets added to the top of the note.. We should be able to add image wherever we like..."
5090,Koti Loss,"March 25, 2019",5," This app gives my husband and I the ability to keep up with everything from Groceries, Bills, Medical, and even Birthdays and Christmas Lists for our 6 boys. I love it!"

5093,Erina Tetsuya,"April 13, 2019",4," This app is good but sometimes it became so laggy if there are too many entries. I always use this app but please, do something about this problem. Thank you."
5094,Heagan Henrie,"January 10, 2019",5, Been using this for years now and it's ever let me down. I only have one feature request and that would be to enable sub checkbox (the indented checkboxes) collapsing and expanding.
5095,Jacob Sullivan,"November 10, 2018",1, This app used to run great. Now it freezes and crashes every time I attempt to open it. It doesn't load my saved notes and it's completely useless to me.
5096,Khalil Rjoub,"October 28, 2018",5," I am using it for long time, it is amazing to keep your shopping lists, recipes, reminders and things to do"
5097,Jakob y2k6,"January 13, 2019",1," The app was finished,why add more and more bloat for the sake of it ? It's obvious the ship that is Google has had no direction for a number of years now ."
5098,Maggie Pittman,"September 20, 2018",5," Use it frequently and it's my go to app. Calendar integration would be nice for reminders or to add due dates... annoying that reminders, tasks, and notes are separate, and not equal..."
5099,Neisha Burlingham,"March 11, 2019",1," I LOOOOVED this app but it is lagging ? I deleted my cache, restarted my phone, but when I type it takes forever to catch up. I wish I could use this app again, very sad indeed!"
5100,A Google user,"January 8, 2019",1, the reminder function doesn't work with Google assistant voice commands at all. If you're driving and unable to input information by hand it's completely useless.
5101,A Google user,"February 12, 2019",2, Works great but i only want to see the title in the overview and sort by alphabetic. I dont want to see the note contents all the time.
5102,Odene Madden,"April 17, 2019",1, My google keep is not syncing between my devices. The sync time is up to date but not the info. Even after reinstalling the app the same old info came back. This is a secondary device and I'm unable to see the notes i enter from my primary device
5103,A Google user,"November 9, 2018",5, So far good. Include an option for colouring notes and highlight option. Custamization will make it much better I think. Thank you!
5104,James McLean,"March 17, 2019",3, Latest version is eating my tablet's battery. Has to be force stopped to prevent it. It's using a lot of CPU time when in the background. Had to uninstall it.
5105,Thomas Cox,"November 12, 2018",2, This app used to work great. Somehow Google managed to break it. Crashes constantly now and doesn't display categories for the correct Google account on Pixel 2 XL/Android 9.
5106,BRIAN,"August 3, 2019",5," l like this app I find it very useful having all my stuff ready to hand throughout my network. Easy to use, simple and straightforward."
5107,Jesse Boam,"December 28, 2018",3," The app does what it's supposed to do. I find the notifications by location doesn't work, and there's also no way to password protect your notes. I think that would be an excellent feature to add"
5108,SHREESHAIL GUMGERI,"September 23, 2018",5, It's just awesome. Far far better than Evernote. free unlimited n syncs across all platforms and lightweight and tied to ur Google account. If u know how to use it. No doubt It becomes ur best notes
5109,Suryakanta Rout,"December 19, 2018",5, its a nice app. I was expecting to have heading of each list we are making. So that people can able to categorize the list and can maintain the list effectively.
5110,Patrick Driscoll,"March 24, 2019",1, Won't load for me half the time. That's a big problem when I need to reference any of my lists or notes at a moments notice. Definitely would not reccomend.
5111,kyle alves,"March 5, 2019",5," Love it! Super clean and functional. Would like for a dark theme option, however. It would really help late night note takers (like myself)."
5112,rajeev gupta,"March 18, 2019",4, Great ! Great place to put your reminders But there in one problem i had made some mark with pen on a photo in keep before the update and after update the eraser does not clear those marks please do some thing to it
5113,Michael Martin,"April 28, 2019",5," I like Google's apps, and this is one of my favorites for creating checklists, notes and reminders.  The ability to add photo headers is a nice touch too."
5114,Elias Weber,"March 13, 2019",2, Great app for note keeping and todo lists. Unfortunately there is a bug which isn't fixed for ages which leads to an incredible high background data usage. 3 GB/month is not uncommon.
5115,jessica lessing,"November 27, 2018",4, I like this app and the look of it. But I only have two problems. I want to be able paste external information to my notes aswell as copy specific paragraphs and not the whole note.
5116,Ashutosh prusty,"July 25, 2019",3," Need mark-up support. ""Bold, underline, strike through, text size"" those would be basic i think. May be keep an advanced interface & the current one for basic users."
5117,Anna Medeiros,"October 24, 2018",1," After the upgrade, the layout SUCKS. the notes look like drafts. Everything is so white. I liked the previous layout better."
5118,Azzam PenyuDestructor99,"May 3, 2019",5, very handy. especially when you want to share link/files between different computer. im not into automatic sync thou. i prefer manual since i have more control over what to share between device
5119,Brother Valen,"March 17, 2019",1, 1 star because it won't open at all after the latest update. it just freezes. i uninstalled and reinstalled but still doesn't work.

5124,Shiva Patil,"May 30, 2019",4," the best safe keep app ever had. working totally fine but the only thing that was not good or available is app lock just like in google pay, as we know if we want to keep notes safe we need to protect it so gonna give 5 star after that update."
5125,user5 user5,"June 7, 2019",4," overall wonderful app. i love the feature to notify by location. that feature coukd be changed to be more sensitive. Otherwise you will love your free experience of notes, reminders and much more!"
5126,Niya Beitin,"May 28, 2019",5, Google keep is a great way to stay organized. I spent hours trying to find a good to do list app after waiting so much paper making on each day and when I installed this one I had no regrets!
5127,Callie P,"June 1, 2019",1," I love this app but after the recent update my quick open widget bar is completely stuck in dark mode and it really bothers me. I've set my phone to ""light mode"", reinstalled it and restarted my phone with no improvement. PLEASE help."
5128,Daniel Coto,"June 16, 2019",5, It's an outstanding app. I would definitely like to see a dark version of your awesome widget. See for example the vlc media player widget. It does a simple colour switch.
5129,Stephen McManus,"June 18, 2019",5," I use it all the time since it was launched as a note taking, list making, task sharing tool. it works really well, as an app and as a web client on desktop."
5130,Tatum Davis,"June 24, 2019",5, I love Google Keep. I keep many notes and reminders on it. I appreciate the Dark Mode because I have a hard time focusing on a brighter screen. Overall I love this app. 10/10
5131,Chris Hahn,"July 5, 2019",4, this app is very useful when you're cleaning cabins. inventories already in the hands taking pictures to make sure you have the right items a each cabin I can go on and on and on I recommend the app
5132,Isabel Graciano,"September 18, 2019",3," It doesn't have the minimal functions like highlight something, change the font or bold words and also, i think it would be better with more available colors in the notes"
5133,Bui Minh Thac,"July 6, 2019",5," This is a very useful app and I love this. I can keep my information in it such as reminders, appointment or time-tables."
5134,Ashish Dwivedi,"July 20, 2019",3," Google keep should have an inbuilt password protection setting. It's a rich experience app, the only thing it lacks is a password protection setting. I will go for three and a half."
5135,Jorge Pedbra,"July 18, 2019",5," works great, I use it way too much. and for the same reason I've insisted you to please add password-protected notes. i love this app"
5136,Manju Panthaki,"July 22, 2019",1," the last update has messed up the app. lots of functions like 'delete', 'done' do not work anymore. i deleted and reloaded but still facing issues. unable to create new notes or reminders"
5137,David Vest,"July 29, 2019",1, this app has lost two out of two important lists. Even something as common as a shopping list just vanishes when you need it most. I long for the days of something as simple as notepad.
5138,Justino Silva,"August 13, 2019",5," Really great App! does what it's meant to do, and beyond. Thank you guys for this small piece of art. You are on the wright track, just keep up the good work!"

5142,Kevin v,"November 10, 2019",1, I wish notes could be arranged in the archived section also. And as folders in homescreen for grouping.
5143,Mansha Sharma,"October 4, 2019",4," I would suggest you to set some options to highlight the text written in the notes . I liked the application , it is very attractive to keep important notes in colours."
5144,Joseph Abediny,"October 18, 2019",3, Great app but writing updates that are extremely generic is not acceptable. A proper explanation is required. This shouldn't be what a professional company publishes with each release.
5145,Jerose Dela Puerta,"October 16, 2019",4, 😉 nice app..thank you... I just have one more wish on this app is to have pin code or password if I wanted to be more private the note that I save... That's all... And it's perfect... Thanks..
5146,Spencer Gordon,"October 22, 2019",4," I like Google Keep, but I would love to be able to sort my notes into folders! It would also be great if you could insert multiple alerts per note and if you could add headers ect."

5148,kathy moore,"November 9, 2019",5," This app is a lifesaver. I use it for all my notes, even my grocery list."

5157,A Google user,"November 16, 2018",3," Google note environment is a wonderful package to the eco system,however the widget is so so ugly. Sync takes too long. It's been a more then a year now, no update on the widget?"
5158,Jagdeep Dhillon,"May 14, 2019",2," Simplest and easiest of all note taking app.. but i don't use it as it doesn't sort all notes in chronological order, such a basic thing missing!"
5159,Kate Kon,"May 11, 2019",4," I was surprised to find that the drawing option is suitable for good quality drawings, even better than some drawing apps I've used."
5160,Frank A,"October 29, 2018",3, Use it everyday but it doesn't stop duplicate list items and it won't sort so you can find them. Very annoying.
5161,Colin McKay,"January 16, 2019",5," A handy note taking tool with the ability to collect images, drawings sound and urls. Best of all the notes are fully accessible on the computer."
5162,nikhil shewale,"May 23, 2019",4, it's good !!! but actually they should provide us facility for attaching different images for different Para's in single note .... cause main fault is that image get gathered at top....
5163,12. Hamida Gati Miranti,"January 2, 2019",5," it's very great to have this app in my phone. very useful and i like it so very much. but it'll be perfect if google keep has some different themes and night mode as an option, thanks"
5164,ann,"December 6, 2018",5," The best app I've ever used ♡♡♡ I love it so much bc I use it every moment when I think of something. I also did a program with others on keep(use email), we can connect it easier!!!!"
5165,Tom,"January 18, 2019",1," Need to have folders. Selecting a folder should display list of note titles only, otherwise it's too hard to organize and access specific notes later."
5166,Lauren,"February 11, 2019",3, Being able to search in a specific note would be very helpful. Also the option to collapse notes and only see the titles would be great too.
5167,Chirag Ojha,"March 24, 2019",5, all time favorite I have used several other notes keeping app but there are hardly any that give this much versatility and easy to use. The multi-platform support is awesome. Thanks Google team!

5169,Jenyca DS,"April 26, 2019",5, My go-to app for jotting down quick notes and sudden ideas or just things i wanted to have easy access on. I appreciate that it auto saves whatever i'm working on even when I switch in between apps.
5170,Joshua Van Ellie Dumayac,"December 30, 2018",2, A good app especially from Google but sometimes gives so much hassle it sometimes delete notes when I enable data while the thing's auto backup runs in background. Now it ruins my Day as my drawings are gone.
5171,Keshav Ummat,"December 9, 2018",1," This was a great app before the updates that changed the interface , Google works hard to disrupt itself and it's on the right path of it works like this"

5179,Michael Bednarek,"October 20, 2018",1," The app's home screen needs to be customizable: view notes by label (like Gmail), alphabetical (title), chronological (created, modified)."
5180,G Rdz,"April 26, 2019",5," This is the app I use the most by far... since years ago. Once you start to think in Check List style, it becomes harder every day that you miss something important."

5186,Hanah Pioquid,"March 28, 2019",5, Ilove this app. The app is easy to use. I can even save photos. My old phone broke and I bought a new one. I thouhgt I lost all my notes but they were all retrieved when I downloaded this app again.
5187,Star,"November 17, 2018",2, The new design makes it harder to distinguish between the notes than the old design did. Poor synchronisation between devices.
5188,A Google user,"September 23, 2018",5, I love it! Its easy to keep track of stuff. Mostly cause I loose a lot of pens and pencils I dont need one for this😂😊
5189,lisa Bean,"July 22, 2019",1," Using my pixel 3 and keep crashes every time i open it, it was fine until this phone. it's been going on since January. It's July and it still happens. 😞"
5190,Dennis T,"October 24, 2018",5," Love the clean new design, but I prefer the old font. It would be a good idea to give users the option of choosing from a list of fonts!"
5191,Kevin Wilson,"April 1, 2019",3, Google Keep doesn't provide a convenient way of selecting all notes to operate. You have to select them one by one before your fingers break.
5192,Eddie OSullivan,"January 3, 2019",3," I use this every day on my phone and my tablet, but lately they don't seem to be syncing with each other, which is very frustrating."
5193,Nicholas Tobolski,"December 19, 2018",5," A simple, useful app for everything from jotting down ideas, lists, lyrics, etc. It doesn't really get better than this."
5194,Ibtehaj Ather,"February 7, 2019",5," Amazing app. Previously I tried to switch to Microsoft To-do, but honestly Google Keep is irreplaceable. Love it's simplicity and functionality. Keep it up developers!"
5195,J M,"April 25, 2019",4," Just a quick note {pun intended} to say that this app is one that I use regularly. It has a small learning curve, but once you have master it you can do a lot in this app."
5196,Anshul Soni,"February 21, 2019",4," Nice app, but would love it if it had a lock option in it... I mean, you are writing anything and any other person accessing your phone can read what you write. Not good for me though."
5197,Artyom Ustinov,"November 21, 2018",3," When i draw something with many small details, picture begins to move right, outside the visible area. Please fix this, it's really uncomfortable ! Lg Nexus 5x"
5198,"Blue Lambo, black president","May 30, 2019",1, Bad search functionality really detracts from experience. Would also like a checkbox counter. Knowing how many items are in a list is useful and seems quite quintessential for a note app
5199,Joyce Ann Aquino,"June 29, 2019",5, A wise choice for writers to use. It's easy to jot down ideas and checklists. You can also put labels so it's not hard to find an entry.
5200,Wendy Wagner,"July 4, 2019",5, I love this app. It's great for keeping notes and photos handy. And it let's me work seemlessly between two devices.

5202,Rika Reyes,"July 23, 2019",5," Love this app, it is very simple to use strait to the point and am very grateful for the new dark theme! I just wish they would make a widget to pin a note or list to your home screen."
5203,Bob Carlisle,"July 18, 2019",4," Great app. However the fonts and layout should be able to be re-sized. So tiny, difficult to press check-off."
5204,Harinder Singh,"July 28, 2019",2, everthing is excellent .should have given 5 star but it has only one drawback that there is no date created shows for notes. which is must required for daily activity or work update
5205,sterling gavette,"August 9, 2019",1, you have about 1/10 of a second to start talking before it resets. And it doesnt recognize anything but a human voice speaking english so you cannot record a sound like a dog barking.
5206,All top,"August 26, 2019",4, Overall good. Please design reminder with simple operation and add alarm tone with a exact date and time. Only notification sound is not sufficient because many users keeps silent mode.
5207,Danish Raza,"August 30, 2019",3, Look forward to a great experience. One important thing to do is to move UNDO/REDO buttons to Top area. Since we all end up clicking Undo instead of BACK button! Please do it now! Waiting...
5208,LunaH2O,"August 28, 2019",4," Like a digital notepad to help keep track of ideas without losing that physical notepad. Can also add dates, insert links, pictures etc, make bullet list. Great organizing tool"
5209,Anoop ML,"September 4, 2019",2, When tey this app this has a bugg in it. When we make any changes in the task or change the color of the task the other person cant see the changes and also when i mark the task as completed for the other person will see as open. So can you guys look into that.
5210,Nakashima Kuchiki,"September 10, 2019",4," This app is great, what it needs to be even better is the option to change the text style into bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough"
5211,Deevro,"September 15, 2019",4," Best digital notes i've ever used ! 👍pros:👍 -light -seamless sync between App & web / other devices 👎Cons:👎 -everytime i try to paste something on blank page (tap & hold), it won't show an dialog/option to paste text *I hope it fixed on the next update 🙏"
5212,Serena Pynta,"September 15, 2019",5, Having a synchronized notes that could be accessed everywhere is awesome! I don't have to make notes in two separated devices. Thanks.
5213,Kate the Great,"September 13, 2019",2, It's a good notes app but if you like to put passwords in notes so you can remember them it isn't for you it shows everything that is written on the note before you open it which can be good sometimes and bad others
5214,Sean dra belle,"October 3, 2019",5, I love it!!! I'd love it even more if you add a sound feature for checked tasks and swipe sounds I think would really boost productivity.❤
5215,Yip Tuck Wai,"October 8, 2019",5," The content are updated in real time as someone edited it,UI control is intuitive,but it is lacked of calender to set the event that will be going to happen so that notifications can notify the users."
5216,Ehsan Ur Rehman,"October 9, 2019",5, An all rounder app for day to day tasks. Best synchronized environment. Notes callaboration is exceptionally the best. Very handy and useful. Full of features.
5217,Keltic Ride,"November 8, 2019",1, Doesn't tell you what they're updating. The app is Very buggy. They don't vlisten to bug reports At all.
5218,Abinash kumar,"October 16, 2019",1," It requires a lots of edit.Atleast add some important things like 'add map','pasword/ pin/sensor security','activity type'. If you will devlop these things then all will prefer Keep Safe cause it is made by google."
5219,Christopher Scaife,"October 24, 2019",5," It's Great I keep all my notes and poetry that I'm writing in it. I've used it for the last 5 years very handy. Get Google Keep, It will have all your notes 100% organized."
5220,Ayo Adigun,"October 26, 2019",5, The is the best note taking app I've ever come across. It's very easy and simple to use. Better than Evernote and the others. Google is the best and most valuable company in the world.

5225,DARKANIAN D,"January 23, 2020",1," Worst App for taking Notes. Most of the times, It doesn't even save what I've written which causes me a Lot of loss and Frustration. Its just worthless."
5226,NarutoUzu2,"April 2, 2020",4, Good to save important stuff
5227,Gerald Pakree,"February 24, 2019",5," The latest update , i cannot search anymore just hangs on a white screen. All my notes are almost useless if i cant search through them. resolved after months"
5228,CHANDRA PRAKASH SHARMA,"September 20, 2019",1, It is not deleting the done tasks in a single go. After deleting one task at a time I had to go back and had to remove the app from background of mobile and again had ti delete the already done tasks.
5229,Felix O'Keefe,"May 18, 2019",3, I like this app. It would be even better if check lists could be sorted. Alphabetical sorting for example.
5230,Arám Al-Kurdy,"June 17, 2019",5," As much as I hate saying this, Google apps, in general, are really good. Keep has all the features people usually need in a note app, and a beautiful UI. It has become even better with the night mode."
5231,Emilly Rivas,"April 15, 2019",5," Awesome! The visual is very soft and clean... also the app is fast and easy to use, so helpful!"
5232,Sven Glover,"February 23, 2019",4," Pretty good, would be great with a tally function note type as well. (Like do task x 5 times to read ""Task"" [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ])"
5233,Peter Lawler,"May 6, 2019",2, no integration with Google assistant/home ecosystem. reminders from Google calendar aren't integrated either. good for quick notes but nowhere near as useful as it could or should be.
5234,Arga Gema Ridhalla,"May 17, 2019",4, Please add option to have both checkboxes and normal text in one note. It would be very helpful and make Google Keep a perfect note-taking app for all platforms!

5237,Rashmi Verma,"March 12, 2019",5, I forget things in a blink and saving in calender was too lethargic. It gots notes and especially that checkbox to easily found what is done and what more is left in the groceries list of my mom so that she dont yell at me.
5238,Chris Brown,"April 25, 2019",5, im a maint man of 12 years and when being on the go for fast note taking this app is great. im already on my phone between answering it or making a call. thank you so much!
5239,R R,"May 23, 2019",2," With the new dark more enabled, the colors used for notes are all darker and just horrible (especially the yellow). This has to be a mistake. Please fix."
5240,Ed Correa,"March 25, 2019",4, simple but lacks some features such as pasting text from other apps. Seems like a relatively common and desirable feature but yet it is not present in Google Keep
5241,Tsvetan Ovedenski,"December 16, 2018",1," Working with lists is literally impossible. Pressing backspace on current row deletes last character of previous row, like, how??? Frustrating experience at best."
5242,God Took My Clothes,"January 27, 2019",1," Well, it WAS a good application, but now when I open the app, they have a nag screen asking me to update. I don't WANT the update because I don't like the updated app. Very annoying!"
5243,Kashyap Aluru,"April 3, 2019",4," Great app, very useful. It would be really nice if a passcode or fingerprint access can be added as a feature to the app."
5244,Tristania 'Ainiyah,"October 31, 2019",1," Horrible. I can't sync my notes, and now I can't access them. PLEASE fix this issue."
5245,Manikant Maurya,"January 4, 2019",4, It's a good app for creating notes. But the only thing find annoying is background colour they are just too weird so if there was an option to customise that it would be awesome.
5246,A Bezerker,"November 20, 2018",1, Scrambles the note I have been working on when using on PC and Android at same time (same user). No way to get back what I had. Can no longer use this app

5248,A Google user,"March 5, 2019",5," amazing app for keeping lists and notes. The pastel colours of notes add to the pleasing experience. for me, this is the best note taking app ever!"
5249,John Nguyen,"November 18, 2018",1, The new interface during the latest update makes the app look atrocious. I can't imagine how this is supposed to be better than the previous design other than maybe being less resource hungry.
5250,James Chapchuk,"October 22, 2018",1, This white background is atrocious. This app went from a 5 to a 1. Google is destroying all their apps with these cosmetic changes. They are making me blind. They look like a 6 year old designed them using her favourite crayons.
5251,Mohammed Abdulla Mogral,"October 22, 2018",5, It's a very good note taking app for cloud and cross platform. Now it has evolved into much more useful than before. I love it

5258,Simon Arlott,"October 31, 2018",1, Fails to save items correctly even on one device. Things you add can be there on the summary page and then disappear when you open the note itself. 😠
5259,Ayesha Bucker,"April 13, 2019",4, i ♥️ Google keep. my complaint is can you make the reminder alarm a little longer with the sound. like with other alarms they buzz ring till you get to it. this app reminder alarm is short and not sweet.
5260,Harrison Currey,"October 21, 2018",5," Seemingly simple, sync-able notes! Keep is a great note taking app that expands it's feature set based on what data your using to jot down."
5261,littlebird96,"April 21, 2019",4," My suggestion is to add the ability to use Bold, Italics and Underline on notes. That's what I notice is missing, everything else is good."
5262,Vardhan Shafi,"April 2, 2019",4," Can't add image to notes, it just gets on top. Doesn't make sense. Also, what about bold text and bullets and numbering. It's too simple."
5263,UTSAV VITHANI,"August 7, 2019",5," I request to the team of Google Keep to add an option for secure app with passcode and also give options of EDIT, DISCARD, and SAVE while writing notes or before editing and after editing. I hope you will get on this soon."

5268,Müge Huyugüzel,"June 29, 2019",4, Great application.but i think it must have been included an agenda/diary which you plan your time in a time period. On the assumption that there is a agenda /diary it worthy of 5 star
5269,Mushfiqur Rahman Abir,"July 27, 2019",5, love it. It is very useful for me because of the universality. It is available on web and almost everywhere. But it should have a collaborative feature & sharing feature
5270,Tony Watkins,"July 14, 2019",3, The app is fine but the widget is broken. Pinning the lists no longer shows up on the widget like it used to. If I unpin then pin again it has to be deleted and created from new.
5271,Ariffadilah Ibrahim,"July 28, 2019",4," I like it. Its easy to use. But, I wish I could bold, italic or strike through the text. It would be nicer if I can change the font too."

5273,Gaurav Yadav,"July 16, 2019",3," very simple and tidy app, i love it for that but i can't edit font colour/bold/italic etc..... which leaves it less useful and i have to use other apps for the purpose."
5274,Crazy Girl Rani,"July 28, 2019",4," just a small suggestion, it would be better if you introduce a search option in that particular context, like searching for a particular word in that particular note."
5275,VICTORIA HARTLINE LINDEMAN,"August 1, 2019",5," I love Keep! The app is in English, easy to understand and implement, no ads that I have come across, also, you can sinc all your accounts!"

5278,Satish Kothari,"September 11, 2019",3, I just installed this App. It appears it is not possible to cut or paste text while adding notes. Utility of this otherwise good App will substantially improve if this feature is added.
5279,TheGoldenKnight,"September 14, 2019",5," This apps is just amazing and very useful as well, I only wish it had lines on the lists or at least the option to set lines on or off."
5280,Nightflyer,"September 23, 2019",2," After working well for months, it inexplicably lost a very important note. That is unacceptable to me. Also, it's extremely basic and lacks even rudimentary text-editing features."
5281,Aryaman Trivedi,"September 19, 2019",5, Excellent. I use it everyday. Feature suggestion: Sub-bulleted checklists perhaps? Would be useful for adding more granularity to the details of a task.
5282,David Yong,"September 26, 2019",3, It's good to have most basic notes features and the most important with password protected features. Still have room for improvement.
5283,Akira,"October 5, 2019",4," I'm loving this app, is so great to make notes to do not forget important things, i am student and i wonder how i lived without this app all this time, It would be nice to have option to switch sources."

5301,James Euell,"February 8, 2019",5, Best App on my phone. Great place to keep your notes. You can store almost anything to include pictures and web links. Easy to use and easy to find what you need across all devices.
5302,Asit Patel,"September 21, 2018",5," A nice quick way to make lists, reminders and capture ideas. It helps organize life and the reminders keep your tasks relevant."
5303,Aviral Jain,"October 18, 2018",4, Everything's good but add a feature to secure the notes using password/fingerprint. It's a really important feature.
5304,A Google user,"March 28, 2019",5," Been using this since. Really love it. Just add more colors, especially pastel or even graphic arts as a background."

5314,Artur W,"November 12, 2018",1," New and very ugly UI introduced without warning. Not possible to revert to old UI. I am in Poland, but I see a Dutch info ""zoek in je notities"" is it because some idiot mixed Poland with Holland?!."

5333,Brittany Swiney,"May 29, 2019",1, Very much dislike the dark side on the widget. it's so ugly. I use that widget a lot and i really just want to get rid of it now... and the calendar app. The recent updates to these apps prevent us from reverting to light colors.
5334,Tyler Finch,"June 2, 2019",5, I love this app. all my notes saved and easy to access on any device. If I have a picture to add to a note it's simple to add.
5335,JESUS C,"June 29, 2019",1, voice recording stops recording if you stop for 1 second to look at notes or write something down or even stop to take a breath.
5336,Sally Allington,"July 28, 2019",5," Great app. From shopping list to design ideas/ inspiration. Just not sure about the dictaphone capacity. Above all, very happy."
5337,Omar Malik,"August 10, 2019",3," Some things should be improved. Such as Sorting Notes according to Date Modified. And ability to format text such as bold, italic, underline, etc"
5338,Emmanuel Akpaninyang,"August 4, 2019",5," Google keep is beautiful, helped me recover mostof my notes on my crashed device, id recommend to anyone. its note taking ability is also simple, and straightforward. even more beautiful in its night mode. Quality application."
5339,Rosalio Diera,"August 29, 2019",3," Some type of formatting (bold, italics, underline, numbering, bullet points,highlight) would go a long way for Google keep."
5340,Pratiwi Diyono,"September 4, 2019",1," Just woke up to find all my note's gone. No, I don't deleted or archieved it, it just gone and there's this buffering symbol and after that is a text that said that i didn't have any notes. All my works gone, and some important stuff. Good job, Google keep."
5341,Edana Schmidt,"September 10, 2019",5, My memory is 💩 so this program is invaluable to me on a daily basis and I love it for keeping track of things for me!😻 My days revolve around Keep and Calendar if I want to get anything done .. 😍🤗
5342,Harish Ajabe,"September 16, 2019",4, Hello to keep my todo list. One suggestion - currently i can't label to individual checklist item and filter on that. It would be good if this functionality is available
5343,Clarissa Bermúdez,"September 19, 2019",3," Love the app but lacks formatting features! I don't know how something that basic can be overlooked. Otherwise, the app is awesome."
5344,Scott Remy,"October 21, 2019",5," Great app. I can check it from my Chromebook, Android phone or my tablet and change it on one and it shows up on all of them. Make it easy on me not to add info to each one."
5345,C A,"October 27, 2019",5, Works great. Exactly what I needed and does it well. My existing notes transferred over automatically to my new phone. GREAT!
5346,Shahbaz Butt,"March 27, 2020",4, Please add pdf attachment
5347,Pedro Loveras,"February 11, 2019",5," This app do everything you need from a note app, drawing, sound recording, attachments and the best reminder option available in the market."
5348,Change Yo Life,"December 7, 2018",4," This app is awesome! I use it all the time. If they had an option to create spreadsheet type notes, it would be so much better!"
5349,Moises Romo,"January 30, 2019",1," Good concept, but I don't trust this app after notes have arbitrarily gone missing. Not in the trash nor the archive. Gone."
5350,A Google user,"November 6, 2018",4," Great tool, I'm using it every day! BUT: Please add the functionality of using multiple tags for filtering the notes."
5351,arunava das,"April 6, 2019",5, Best app to keep notes. I have written my last 3 books using Google Keep. But word limit in one file should be extended further as I had to create multiple files for one book.
5352,Muhammd Rizaldi Hafizh,"March 11, 2019",5, Good app. Make better if the note can be floating on the screen. This function can be helpful.
5353,Vihaan Philip,"May 24, 2019",3, My reminders keep going missing! This is a great app but my reminders dissappear constantly and its already getting really annoying. Please fix this issue ASAP!
5354,Agung Setiawan,"October 26, 2018",4," I like the new UI, but I think it needs one important feature to hide notes with password (Just like Xiaomi notes). I hope you'll roll it out to the next update, thanks."
5355,Vishal Moudgil,"March 23, 2019",4," after thr last update when even i try to open this app all i get is a white screen. can't add notes, cant access app at all. have to try several times to close and restart app n then options would appear."
5356,Angeli Rose Caraos-Quijano,"November 12, 2018",2, I used to love this app. Now the search function doesn't work. Please fix it. Will change rating once fixed.
5357,John Reed,"January 13, 2019",2, How do you stop numbers from being underlined and interpreted as a mobile number. This is really annoying and makes simple editing a nightmare. Please add ability to disable this.
5358,Y. K.,"October 19, 2019",4, Needs (undo) and (redo) buttons because it happens a lot with me that I lost too much text because sometimes I select text and accidentally press delete button.
5359,Seth Willis,"March 11, 2019",5, this is by far the best note app I've ever used. I never leave reviews but I feel compelled to express my gratitude and thanks for this awesome simple to use application.

5362,arjang ap,"January 2, 2019",4, i love this application it is useful but it take a lot of time for refreshing in new updates and no one knows what it is for.
5363,Shakil Ahmed,"May 11, 2019",4, As it is used for taking notes I think password protection option is badly needed to protect our notes from others.When we will open the app it will ask for password and that's how our notes will remain private and safe.
5364,MiN1One,"March 31, 2019",4," Everything is fine, but would be better if we had possibility of recording more than 1 sec(notes + recording function - the best as note keeper + as a voice recorder!)"
5365,Andrew Criswell,"February 5, 2019",5, its very good and I love it because of one reason I can archive all my notes in one place and I can pin them to my home screen I've learned some tricks since I've had this app
5366,Den Taylor,"March 7, 2019",4," Great app. Could you enhance the text formatting features (bold, italic, underline,etc)"
5367,A Google user,"December 19, 2018",4," nice and powerful app, but I cannot attach a document to a note, developers have to include this function in app and then it will be best in the category"
5368,BASUDEB BHANJA,"October 25, 2018",2, I always like to use KEEP app but with recently updated versions consume more battery life than the old versions. Please fix this issue. 😒😒😒😒😒
5369,Ⓟ.Ⓐ. Ⓢⓜⓐⓛⓛ,"March 18, 2019",2, While typing on the desktop version the cursor will jump to the middle of a previous paragraph randomly as I'm typing. It's very frustrating.
5370,TJ Schiavo,"April 23, 2019",1," Completely freezes up my Pixel 3 XL every time I try to open it. I use Keep all the time, so it would be a huge inconvenience to try and migrate to a new note taking app. Please fix!"

5374,Christopher Vincent Rigodon,"November 17, 2018",5," Found some bug.. when i press back when the app is open,,, using recent app to re-open the app it says app isnt available.. i dont know if its a bug but it annoys me.. should go to drawer again just to reopen the app.."

5376,Prasoon Goyal,"April 28, 2019",5, Loved the app. It would be awesome if you can add an option to lock particular notes by password to keep data safe.
5377,Saqib Dahri,"March 31, 2019",1," too much Lagg previous version which was built in to mobile, was much better and smooth, It lags while typing while moving to other row, last two updates messed up whole thing downgrading to previous older versions,"

5379,Rein Quinio,"May 22, 2019",4," Hi, can you possibly add some features where we can Bold, Italize, Indent, etc. our notes. I love this app and been using it for years now. If this would be granted I would definitely say that it's the best."
5380,Wonyoung Koh,"April 18, 2019",3," do its job but when it comes to finding old memos, it is very difficult. i wish that they add some sort of sorting out method like folder or something sothat i can easily access to what i need to look back to"

5382,Crystal M,"September 17, 2018",3," I would like this app more if I could add the widget to the homescreen while using a different launcher. This app only let you use the widget on Google's launcher. Also, the widget is ugly and can't personalize Omg this app is so buggy and keeps crashing"
5383,Marlon James,"December 16, 2018",5," Great Apps, very easy to do listing and notes. Much better if you guys could add built in security e.g: pin or fingerprint reader to open this app bcause most of my notes contains privacy stuffs."

5386,Antiseptic Eye,"February 1, 2019",2, it doubles the word when I keep it in a new tab and when I'm taking notes. It is very annoying and I wish you could please fix that so 2 stars
5387,Ibrahim Seidu,"June 5, 2019",4, It is very good and easy to use. I wish it comes built in security measures like PIN or patern because it's serves as a mobile dairy to me and many people.
5388,Elude Gaming,"May 27, 2019",4," I've been using Google keep for many years and it's been useful for me. but the new update, i cant use its new feature ""dark mode"". i wondered why..."
5389,Ben Green,"June 10, 2019",3, The app is usable but misses essential features from the desktop version such as linking task list to Gmail. It's among the many apps that Google doesn't care about reaching feature parity with.
5390,Ali Al-Shaikh,"November 6, 2019",1, I am using Huawei Mate 10 and after updating the app it's getting too slow. Again slow...
5391,Loki C,"June 22, 2019",4," this app has been great, but is it okay to improve the search function? the search bar doesn't seem to work unless the searching key words matches the beginning of the sentence or title..."
5392,Jannatul Ferdous,"June 26, 2019",2, this app was working amazingly...but somedays prior i had to reinstall it in my phone but it's not working from then...i have many valuable datas there.. really need this to be fixed
5393,prakash muthusamy,"July 3, 2019",4, why there is no reminder ringtone. Most of the apps providing option to select their own reminder ringtone.when the notification pops up with our favorite sound it is too good.so please make the necessary changes as soon as possible can't wait
5394,ZaManFoY,"July 8, 2019",4, It is a very good app but minus one star cause i would like to hava private notes and i d like to be able to have notes in my home screen as widget to have quick access in specific note no to a label or pinned notes
5395,vante de lune,"July 24, 2019",3," i wish there's thing to bold, italic & coloring the text that we choose to it.... and also the we add so photo/image we can drop it in top or bottom in the middle of words... smthg like that i need it"

5399,Виктор Илькун,"July 30, 2019",4," Good, but sometimes behaves unstable, I'm afraid of losing notes. I'm finding them in archive (when I didn't do this), and a little bit below, under recent notes."
5400,Rahul Khandelwal,"July 16, 2019",4," The app is great, but would love to see Excel like spreadsheet features on the app. A lot of people write their expenses here, so spreadsheet functions would be really helpful !"

5402,Emily Grimsey,"August 21, 2019",5," Its amazing! You can choose your layout between list, normal or draw. You can change background colour or add riminders its just great dont know where id be withoit it!!"
5403,Bryan Gorenflo,"September 6, 2019",5," Excellent app, used it for years! Makes note taking easy and fun! Best part has to be that it syncs across all your google enabled devices."
5404,Zenster Hernz,"September 10, 2019",4, Google Keep for desktop pc/laptops (sticky note) and widgets (for cp) should be made. For that whole seamless work efficiency experience. Just my two cents. That would be very helpful to the users.
5405,Mark Humphrey,"September 11, 2019",3, Quite a nice app but still needs a lot of work. e.g. the ability to see only notes that dont have tags; the ability to see when notes were created/historization
5406,Jo Cross,"September 12, 2019",3, The delete button needs to accessible straight away when holding in note. The widget should be customisable. Could be a fab app with tweaking. I look forward to it being improved.
5407,Robert Housedorf II,"September 24, 2019",2," Does not sync well with keep on Apple devices. Makes it damn near useless for my family, for shared lists, like groceries. Which is the entire point of having the app."
5408,Jozef Jankovic,"September 27, 2019",1," If there is no quick setting to keep the most recent note up on the list or up on the screen, that means there is a significant level of ineptitude on a side of the creators of this app."
5409,Eric Im,"October 6, 2019",2," Doesn't allow attaching video, rich text formatting to the notes, bullet (numbered) points or adding date/time stamp. Please consider adding these functions."
5410,Cristi Meilin,"October 7, 2019",4," The apps is execeent, but, it is too long of integrated if we edited in website, but it was not changed in my phone! It needs to be increased!"
5411,Mm. Raven,"October 18, 2019",5, This is amazing .... I love this app I was high school when I first started working with it. Google Keep is the app you need if you are busy person or if you have a very active family and you need to share this keep everyone informed
5412,Gab GLM,"October 28, 2019",2, I'd use it if there were anoption in the settings to only view the title of the note and add folders. Otherwise it's too bulky and I can't organize or find my notes.
5413,robert branam,"October 27, 2019",3, Overall the app is fantastic unfortunately I put in a valid email address and it says it's invalid and I cannot share with my wife but she has it installed on her phone and can share with me.
5414,Abhijeet Roy Choudhury,"November 4, 2019",4, Great but please add feature to lock private notes. Enable fingerprint lock for individual notes.

5423,James Dawson,"March 12, 2019",3," I have been using this app for years now. however, i would like to suggest you introduce font styles to enable a user to bolden, italic and underline a words."
5424,Mister Corn DoaZer,"November 28, 2018",5," QoL suggestion : Can you put labels between the pinned and reminder buttons while making a note? It subtracts an extra step to every note I label. Plus, I Love the app I use it everyday, thanks."
5425,Shweta Hepat,"May 6, 2019",4," I wish Google keep introduces lock feature for various different labels or folders. Also, some features as bold, italic , highlighting etc could also be introduced. Otherwise, it's the best app one could ever use."

5427,shubham Aggarwal,"November 16, 2018",2, Can you please add fix for pasting clipboard contents while creating or editing a note. I think this feature was there in the previous versions.
5428,Paul Martin Geronca,"November 3, 2018",1, The previous version was much better in terms of design and usability. The recent Material redesign isn't an improvement.
5429,George Sarfine,"September 20, 2018",2, When looking up a note it will not go to line item. Had to down load anothet app. On one set of note i have 40 entries. But the app i down loaded WILL FIND the entry.
5430,Levon Sahakyan,"January 24, 2019",5, Very handy application. It'll just be better to have an option in settings to choose the start day of the week as in Google calendar.
5431,Ridzuan,"February 8, 2019",4," This note app is clean. However it would be nice if we have the option for bold, italic and underlines. Hope developer will add these feature."
5432,Ingrid Debona,"October 25, 2018",5," I love the app and it finally got rid of the ""exciting"" colors! Now, Google, while you're designing stuff... night mode maybe?"

5446,Naresh Gunda,"November 5, 2018",4, I like this app. Very lite and easy to use. We can add lables to our notes. If we could have password protection it will be a great app.
5447,Arpan Vinayak,"November 16, 2018",5," I like the new UI. I did not use Keep just because of the outdated interface it used to have. It looks really modern now, I use it regularly as my main reminder and scribble app."

5653,Simon G,"November 14, 2018",3," Come on, guys! Fix the Reminder Defaults setting, please? User changes are never retained between visits to the app! This has to be a very simple bug to squash, surely?"

5663,Ajay Bhargav,"June 28, 2019",4, It's a great note taking app. All it lacks is location tagging. It'd be perfect if I could tag location to a note.
5664,Samruddhi Belkhedkar,"September 21, 2018",3, I think there must be different fonts for titles and subtitles. And different theme should be applicable.

5749,Harshdeep Singh,"November 16, 2018",3, It would be nice if there were some text editing features just to take more cleaner and eye-friendly notes.
5750,MMarzh,"May 21, 2019",3," So in the latest version of the app, it includes this dark theme. The problem is it's missing in my device. My phone's running on Android 8.1, BTW."
5751,A Google user,"February 26, 2019",5, A lot of options and a great way to organize things on the go. I made my birthday wish list and sent to friends and family.
5752,Alejandro Yanes,"May 29, 2019",5," Love the dark theme but I don't really like the colors for the notes themes, I prefer the old ones and I think they wont add to much brightness"

5755,Ajay Kamath,"March 21, 2019",5, Fantastic app. I request for an option to have some kind of a reversible edit lock for notes that we choose to make read only.
5756,Finifugal,"December 18, 2018",4, The latest update seems a bit buggy. My cursor jumps around for no reason while I'm typing and the keyboard input is laggy.
5757,A Google user,"September 21, 2018",4, Nice app. Use it for general notes. Only problem is the title. You need to capitalise the 'n' in 'Keep notes'. Just looks odd as a lower case.
5758,No Jones,"November 13, 2018",5, Its absolutely awesome but I just got a new phone (S9) when I try and use the back arrow (undo function) it crashes the app every time.

5762,Milosz Nasadowski,"June 15, 2019",2, Confusing that G has 2 separate services. Google home added my list and help instructed to say 'Show my list' but then G asks for installing Keep which CANT SEE my google assistant list! Some consistency and UX tests would be advised to big G.
5763,Emmanuel Phiri,"July 4, 2019",4, I like the app but I feel like it can improve. my one is issue is the fact that you can't recorder regular audio without it adding text
5764,Thuya Oo,"July 4, 2019",5, It's simple to use and so so good. I can make notes and reminders. No bugs. Pictures can also be easily added.
5765,Bomb Shooter,"July 7, 2019",5," I would give it 4/5 because it's too simplistic, but then again, this is a great advantage for many users. So 5 stars it is:)"

5803,Christopher Huggins,"December 22, 2018",4, Keep gets the job done while being simple and small. The ability to lock individual notes or all notes would be a great feature to add in future updates

5811,Dloc Gnirps,"April 23, 2019",1, needs a specific privacy policy. privacy policy links to full text of Googles privacy policy. they need to tell if specifically notes are read and Incorporated into user profile. for now I'll assume they are
5812,Ronald Butt,"October 14, 2018",2, It is not as easy as Evernote. It doesn't seem to have automatic savings like Evernote and needs to show the notes saved better.
5813,A Google user,"March 3, 2019",1, I am very rarely disappointed with Google apps. However (here we go kids) I am only average as far as technology and with even the simple task of placing files in one folder seems difficult with this app. And access to app instructions seems is to obscure..

5822,Thomas Isebeck,"May 23, 2019",5," Google, I love you. Thank you for the dark theme. This is a company that actually cares about their customers' experience. By the way, material design 2.0 looks completely amazing! Keep up the good work! (no pun intended)"

6338,A Google user,"June 10, 2019",5, It'd be really great to see an option to increase or decrease font size as well as to make words bold.
6339,Sean Tyson,"December 23, 2018",3, Google Assistant voice commands do not work very well with the app.
6340,moti bd,"October 14, 2018",5, I loved it! Easy to use with lots of useful features. unlike some popular note apps like evernote.I always trust google
6341,Giovanni Guzon,"March 26, 2019",5," Best Note App. Hoping you can add security before opening like fingerprint, PIN or face id. But overall it is an amazing app."
6342,George Carter,"May 12, 2019",1," Didn't work for me, I was using a Samsung J7, and Chrome on my laptop with Chrome extensions for Keep and LP gmail keep importer"
6343,Ronaldo Kal,"May 22, 2019",2," I love this app but whatever they did with the widget is just terrible. Either bring back the bright mode or let us adjust the dark mode. that's The point of ""modes""."
6344,Chris Topher,"May 24, 2019",5, Thank you for adding Dark Mode 💗 Can you add a setting to allow us to show more maximum rows/entries in the Keep widget? I have some long lists. Thanks!
6345,Vivek Shah,"November 12, 2018",2, The notification sound or icon just doesn't work. The purpose of having the app gets defeated.
6346,Joko Nugroho,"November 30, 2019",1," Please add handwriting searching, like note in IOS, it's very usefull"
6347,Zo Zo,"October 18, 2018",5," Synchronize notes between devices, clear and colorful notes, support reminders (for calendar too), you can draw a sketch as a note cool"
6348,A Google user,"November 17, 2018",5, It would be amazing if you could make it so that the google assistant can literally make the note for you with just your voice command
6349,Aaron,"March 20, 2019",1, Suddenly stopped working. The app just opens to a blank white screen. I've cleared the app cache and data... no change.
6350,ivamarie,"December 11, 2018",3," I loved this app but now you can't copy and paste stuff into there anymore which defeats the purpose completely to me, please change that again!!"
6351,Manoj Paryani,"October 28, 2018",5, Must have app to keep important notes to yourself and sharing. The recent upgrade with material theme change is refreshing and was long pending.
6352,SUYASH PRATAPWAR,"April 23, 2019",5," app is good but option like font choose, bold,italic,font size and font colour is needed."
6353,Carlos DeMarco,"October 24, 2018",5," I love the new design. I use this app daily and I find it very useful. But I'd like to have the option of switching to the old design, I really liked it too. Thanks."

6355,william janik,"May 19, 2019",1, kept saying refresh is needed. after 4 or 5 I just uninstalled it without ever being able to use it.
6356,Abdullah Muntaqo,"October 29, 2018",5, I don't like new look. It's absolutely better the old one with yellow dominated colour. It's not Keep anymore I think...
6357,Wing Hong Chan,"October 29, 2018",4, No connection to other services. Try adding shopping list and tasks to google Keep to smoothen lists together.
6358,Axel Kromm,"March 12, 2019",4," Awesome notes app but PLEASE add the option to make words in Bold, Italics & Underlined. It would make the app way better"
6359,Mino Taur,"April 9, 2019",4, Interesting. It works best when you taking note with draw/sketch a mind map.
6360,Soham Bajpai,"December 31, 2018",4," productive ,easy and simple but neer more Little improvement by adding more and more easy tools and functions like a sticknote in desktop or homescreen etc"
6361,G Null,"January 16, 2019",5," I love this app, use it all the time. it keeps me organized. So useful, it works across all my devices."
6362,Josh Nanat,"May 2, 2019",4, It's over all okay. Great for keeping personal notes and reminds. My only grip is that there is no way to add italics and bold letters. Hope this gets added in the future
6363,Jessica Spencer,"November 10, 2018",1, Search isn't working even a little. I have so many notes it's kinda useless without it!
6364,Shai Israel,"January 16, 2019",4, best note taking app. I wish Google will add folders and more sorting options to make it even better (thus the 4 stars)
6365,Tom Darais,"June 4, 2019",4, Great notes app. Thanks Google. I wish I could use Google Assistant and my Google Home speaker to create Google Keep Notes.
6366,Kasun Silva,"October 17, 2018",5, Great app. But no location tagging. Please add dark and full light themes and an option to change them automatically base on time likely Google News
6367,william conklin,"March 19, 2019",1, Hilariously broken. Collaborators syncing has been broken for months....have tried other accounts and phones. Otherwise a nice looking app.
6368,A Google user,"January 15, 2019",4," Needs a ""sort by"" button for lists with options of alphabetic or chronological order! Missing this badly!"

6372,Vasu Devan,"December 23, 2018",5," I would like to convey that people around me suggest the sharing option which is available in ""drive"", should be in ""keep"" also"
6373,Max Fiordalisi,"March 21, 2019",5," works great, use it all the time. easy to share lists."
6374,bless caballero,"May 31, 2019",5," A useful tool, easy to use and the dark mode is a lot of help too."
6375,Francis Gagné,"May 26, 2019",2," Got a FORCED dark mode widget. The baby brown poop notes are not my style. Plus the widget and app having different note colors is really confusing. I am not happy being Google guinea pig. I really miss the time when new ""features"" came in as optional, with a setting switch..."
6376,A Google user,"November 24, 2018",3, Would like two features: 1. Ability to have inline text and checklists in the same note 2. Pressure/angle sensitivity with a stylus
