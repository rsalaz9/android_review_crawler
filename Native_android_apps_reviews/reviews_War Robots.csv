Back in 2015-2016, when it just released, it was just plain old robots shooting. Now you've got crazy invincible bots and modules such as ravana, last stand and phase shift, and believe me when i say the chests are rigged. getting the latest meta robots is next to impossible, and by the time you finally got one the game has already moved on. if you don't spend money on games then this game isn't for you."

The workshop used to also give decent equiptment and robots without costing so much. I would not recommend this game to new players. The pay to win aspect has escalated so much that it would be extremely difficult for new players to hold their own in pvp battles without paying money.

Truth be told the last time I was here I talked to my friends and they agreed with me when I said that this game needs to keep AU keep PT keep puzzles but they have to they MUST trash AG for the game to remain fun. You want me a level 30 player who loves this game back? Give rid of AG!

Because it is skill based match-making you fight people who buy weapons and robots which are a lot better than yours meaning you don't really stand a chance. Good weapons just take a lot of time to get otherwise you have to buy things. They just want to earn money. This used to be a good game but it is going the opposite direction."

Another great update with excellent content added. I'm unhappy about the old economy items being grouped-in with the new economy equipment for the next update. I understand the reasoning for it; so everything will be on the same 'level' in regards to upgrading. But... I think the players, like myself, that have been around since the beginning should continue to receive the old economy upgrade costs and times. - Another good update! 6 years and I still love the game"

Had alot of skill alot of fun but grew tired of pixonic's hunger for money. They buff some weapons at will and nerf others. After lvl 20 you wont get a fair match. Don't buy anything, it wont help you the enemy's just become stronger. Just a bit stronger so you will keep trying to upgrade. There isn't enough space here for all i have to say, but you will never be on top"

24,Arjun Krishnan,"April 28, 2020",3," This game is as pay to win as it gets. After 6 years, they still havent fixed up the clunky mechanics, horrible matchmaking, graphic downplays and the god damn lag. They also nerf weapons and robots after you purchase them, which leads you to wonder if there's any point in buying anything."
25,bottled nerf,"April 28, 2020",5," Its definitely pay to win but initially downloaded the game, played it once, then didn't touch it for a year and when I came back to it, it gave over $100 worth of gold for free which was awesome, so I got the bulgasari robot and destroyed everything for a while, being as I was level 3 at the time."

Cost of upgrades has increased to encourage you to spend cash. The actual gameplay is great but they seemed to have forgotten that customizing your bots was half the fun... Google should cap in-game purchases so that companies like this don't see us as cash cows. In short a great game ruined by a greedy developer.

The increased money grubbing just gets really tedious. It has ruined a really enjoyable basic interface. The introduction of super-mega ""Titan"" bots that provide about 50 NEW channels for pixonic to try to get suckers to pay has been the final nail in the coffin. I realize that pixonic needs to generate revenue, but they seem to have forgotten the need to balance revenue WITH playability. They clearly just view it as a moneypump now... Sad."

Also new robots are mostly own by the people that Pixonic sponsor I'm pretty sure of that, and guess what? They are indstructible.

Before you reach level 30 the game is very difficult because you're always up against better players. That have been playing longer. I now have enough cool weapons and I've put enough time into upgrading them to take down Titans with regular robots. It would be harder with the free only. But it's doable. Just focus on one robot at a time and upgrade it to Max. That's the best way I've seen so far.

Surprisingly deep in some ways for a mobile game - but nothing can excuse the rest of this. It embodies everything wrong with play to win and the Ad infused free software eco system. It is by a Russian publisher. Do you trust them with your info? Even if you do, you will not enjoy the completely rigged systems for rewards. I am going to be reporting this game for their dishonest business practices. They show you potential rewards in a way that makes you THINK you'll win something cool - but you NEVER EVER do. It wouldn't be so bad if everything in the game weren't COVERED with ads or pay to win currency. Truly awful business practices ruin what could otherwise be decent software, minus the graphics and robot movement, which are TERRIBLE if you've ever played Mechwarrior or anything else similar. I wanted to like this, but these devs are so dishonest and greedy that this game is not worth more than 1 star."

192,Dylan Morrissey,"April 22, 2020",4, great game But this game is all about paying money on this game to get better please change that.But good game overall and really fun and a good time waster.Good graphics and good control's has good tutorial of how to play.I would recommend this game to you .This game should get ride of the puzzle p...Full Reviewgreat game But this game is all about paying money on this game to get better please change that.But good game overall and really fun and a good time waster.Good graphics and good control's has good tutorial of how to play.I would recommend this game to you .This game should get ride of the puzzle peicies it is very annoying please change that.
193,Feng Zhang,"April 29, 2020",5, This game is really good one of my favorite games but I lost my 2 favorite robots the spectre shocktrain(4) and the spectre vortex(4). I would do almost anything to get them back.
194,Bill Melater,"April 22, 2020",1, Good graphics is the best part of this game. They do not fix issues with the game and always weaken older weapons to try to force you to get new ones. This is a play to win game. Do not expect to get anything without spending. This company is very cheap.
195,Ashlind Timmerman,"April 27, 2020",5, This game is awesome graphics are phenomenal👌and so is everything else in all this is an amazing game with wide variety of weapons. Non playing players still get a majority of everything and I find that really good. Great job with the game 👍👏

Hell, Pixonic even rigs the in-game gambling so payers get better rewards based on how much you've spent (no such thing as random here). And did I mention the commercials? How about slot machine ads based on children movie themes? Willy Wonka slots, yeah, its a thing. Your ethics leaves so much to be desired Pixonic!!!"
197,Ian Frahm,"April 28, 2020",3," The game itself an be awesome... but don't buy into the ""special delivery"" scam. Unless you wanna end up with more power cells than you'll ever need. Only those who can afford big bucks get anywhere, which really sucks. But the concept is great."
198,Dhanush rocks 007,"April 24, 2020",1," Every thing in the game is awesome , I'm seriously in LOVE with the game........ ""BUT PLEASE DECREASE THE PRICES OF THE IN APP PURCHASES"" If you do so I'LL give you a 5 star rating please make sure you do it and if you do it ill purchase a lot from you (ITS AN EXCELLENT GAME GUYS )"
199,justin douglas,"April 22, 2020",2, Absolutely a pay to win game. Costs an arm and a leg to buy competitive bots and the extensive upgrades required to win consistently. You may die of old age before you ever upgrade your bots naturally. Otherwise its a great game lol
200,Eric Brady,"April 28, 2020",5," Best game ever,it helps to pay some money to dominate a little but this game never gets old,no matter how great your hanger is the battling never gets old.I belive you should definitely get this game"
201,James Robb,"April 28, 2020",5, Great game. Been playing for a long time and I love it. Weapons and bots are a little on the expensive side and it kinda sucks that I get matched with people that have mk2 equipment when I'm not even close to that
202,Clint,"April 26, 2020",1," Pixonic makes every new item that they release purposely overpowered.

When enough people buy it so that the game becomes comically unbalanced/unplayable for the majority of players, they nerf the items and repeat the cycle.

203,Head Bob,"April 29, 2020",3," I like this game. Im getting better at it, and Im starting to acquire some nice weapons. It takes a while to get your upgrades unless you want to spend your money on the absurdly overpriced offers."
204,Kenel Brave,"April 28, 2020",5," Very good game,but frequently the game been freezing,stuck mode where you have to restart the device,so they need to work on that issue is continuous"
205,Shuazy,"April 28, 2020",5, Great game with brilliant graphics! Very engaging and very fun. Would highly recommend to players who like to challenge themselves.
206,johan ewald,"April 24, 2020",3, Awesum game but only thing is that i watch like 500 ads to get tickets and other stuff but i never got 100 tickets or when i finally get 100 tickets and play the second level i never get anything good and i spend a few 100 tickets already. Think you spend money to get anything good in this game
207,Santino Clayton,"April 27, 2020",5, They f the game up... I uninstall and install all day 3 to 4 times and still get kicked out in the middle of a battle... every time I get a notification on any other app the game freezes and I have Boost activated that's gold and it cost money that's negligence

209,A Google user,"April 28, 2020",4," Update to earlier review. You can still drop a lot of $ in this game if you want to, but it's significantly less pay to win than it had been in the past."
210,Gabbyyy,"April 23, 2020",5," For other players that hate how this game functions, its normal. Its just the players who are desparately to be on the top, by using so much money. Btw this game is great i like how the game works and family friendly.(i think hehe)."
211,John Potts,"April 26, 2020",4," Pay to win, but a lot of fun with no purchases. Exciting 6v6 battles with a wide range of tactics and strategies. Even better if you get in a cool clan that likes squad battles. Long term playability as the developers keep adding new weapons and bots. A new level once in a while would be nice."
212,Micheal Sevilla,"April 22, 2020",4," Really easy game to play. Pretty fun, and a game I could play for hours. One problem though: it takes just a bit too long to load. Everything has too load, it doesn't take too long, but if your a patient guy (unlike me) it's a really fun game to play"
213,H V,"April 22, 2020",1, The game play is great but the events give pay out very little. The game is extremely pay to play. Which is fine developers have to make money. But the price's are extremely too high.
214,FINEX THEONEWHOMADETHENAME,"April 23, 2020",5, Why is the task for 10 platinum harder to get than the 15. Also the most amazing voice you can think of. (Always remember to be your self never let any one take that from you all).just keep doing what you do)

217,Mark Bittner,"April 22, 2020",1," This game's been around for a while and it's sad that they do not have advanced controller options,so that a player can move around their controller UI sticks on their phone to fit their hands or to fit bigger phones."
218,Paul Rhodes,"April 28, 2020",5," Great game! No need pay for play. You can advance in power and rank on own and still enjoy . Great game play and graphics. Well maintained, updated and great tech support."
219,Vertical Cape,"April 29, 2020",3," Its prett good but I've been there since it came out and it, put simply, not as good as it used to be, and half the robots and guns are obtained by puzzle pieces."
220,Sean Stanley,"April 28, 2020",4, My experience of War robots is very fun but it shouldn't say kil in the battles I don't like that and instead of having to pay money I'd like it if you could pay gold or silver for things that you really like and would like to use in the game
221,Preeti khare,"April 28, 2020",5," I love this game.However I have stuck on lvl 25 and I desperately want to lvl up to lvl 30.This I because no matter how hard I try, I still cannot pass even a single lvl.I play everyday for 2-3 hrs but still from eight days,I am stuck on th 25th lvl."
222,Chad Finlayson,"April 28, 2020",5," Just a solid game. Lots of fun. It takes time to grow and costs money but what doesn't these days. Frequent updates with new robots and weapons, but NO new levels."
223,Adam Desport,"April 23, 2020",4," This is a very fun game! You dont need to pay unless you want good robots or weapons instantly, but requires allot of grinding. It took me months to get a good robot."
224,Hari Krishna H,"April 28, 2020",4, Game is good and addictive but the problem is the controls are difficult to aim. And the new robots components are very difficult to manufacture it takes a lot of time to buy a robot.
225,Jered Sheppard,"April 28, 2020",4," Awesome game, #1 of all my apps. Just wish pixonic would stop updating. It takes soooo much storage. To be top dawg you pretty much have buy stuff with a credit card."

238,Jason Husband,"April 26, 2020",1, Been playing for a couple yrs now. Unless your maxed out on weapons your gonna get paired up with em. Its pay to win. This game pairs you up with maxed out players on different platforms. Then they video it.

253,Patrick Rouse,"April 22, 2020",4," My number one pick for mobile games, always new content. The pay to win aspect however skews my opinion of the Developers. If you don't have the cash, just be patient, Titans take time to build, but are worth the reward."

271,David Buschor,"April 28, 2020",2, A good game but quickly becomes unfair and losses appeal. Being able to fly and being invisible is not fun to play with. There is no way to beat that. It should be one or the other so you can have a chance to fight back.
272,Iron Javelin,"April 29, 2020",3, Game is good but gets more pay to win unless you have too much time on your hands and a lot of balancing issues if you keep up with youtubers

284,Rhett DeBuys,"April 23, 2020",5, Been playing since the beginning of the year....play just about every day. You can still play without paying....its just if you want to upgrade faster.

290,BiG BoI,"April 22, 2020",4, I like this game a lot but the only reason why I did 4 stars than 5 its because there are many dumb pay to win players and makes it frustrating for players that dident pay because the players who payed will have a bigger advantage on winning a game than a none payer.
291,Mario Bartoletti,"April 23, 2020",1," Its all pay to win. No matter how well you play, there are 10 others with weapons and gadgets you can't reach without dropping a bank. It's a fun game. Just too money hungry."

The controls are easy to get the hang of, the interface is great, the graphics are great, and it allows for wonderful strategy. About one game in three is very fun. The other two will be totally unbalanced with one team running away with it. I think some people really enjoy winning where they are very over powered, but personally I would rather lose a close match than win an ass kicking. You can literally drop thousands on upgrades, and those upgrades can make someone easily do many times more damage than people who spent less. With time you can slowly improve your performance, but a free player is never going to stand toe to toe with someone who drops a few hundred dollars on the game and win. No amount of strategy or skill will defeat people who can do over two hundred thousand damage a second. It is still enjoyable to play, but by far and away the most blatant pay to win game I have ever seen. You just have to accept the unbalanced matches and move on until you get a good one."

If you have any skill you will eventually hit a league where people have either played the game far longer than you, or spent far more money than you.

I regret spending money on this game as at this point I'm getting shat on by people who spend a house worth on this game.

They have cross platform gameplay which made finding a match with similarly ranked players much faster yet it obviously is still rigged to play you against an overpowered squad 1st battle of each gaming session (not just 1st of day). Also rigged is to have the team populated with 2 or 3 members of a lower rank and 2 higher if its possible to go higher. So many master 1 to 3s are unfairly pitted against champions.. I love this game but now it's a chore to play. :/

The bots you can get do ruin some of the game play when matched with people who have paided for the robots put up for being bought. But it is definitely a good feeling when you get the boys by hard work. The mechanics and play style is very unique for a 3rd person robot shooter. Would recommend to my friends :D
575,Jonathan Buck,"April 19, 2020",5," Great graphics, great gameplay, and alot of cool Robots to choose from! If you are a fan of multiplayer arena games, this is deffinately for you! The only problem is that they shove the special offers into your face. But hey, the developers need money like other people!"
576,Chris Tyndall,"April 20, 2020",1," The game is great if you spend $7000 (thousand) to play, otherwise you're waiting 3 years for your stuff to upgrade.

Fun killer. Not to mention the discounted cost of mechs in the level up offers can be around $50 and those aren't even the top tier mechs."

I also used quite a lot of $ to get good items. But the latest update when you guys added the Titan actually kind of ruined the game. It just looks like you guys are trying to scrap up the money of the users. Also people who used a lot of money to get robots became useless since the Titans are way too powerful. Also people who are not yet level 30 can't do anything.

I always get to play with opponents using aou chun robots and they destroy my whole hanger within seconds. There is no skill required t

They say you can get them by just playing but that's BS. They give 100 components out of 10k to random robots you dont care about nor want. And the price for some of those robots are like $100+ gtfo. Plus the weapons are another $100+ each weapon. Then you need millions and millions of silver to level them up. It would take someone years of nonstop playing to get good robots.

1047,Tatiana Chaney,"April 22, 2020",4, I like everything except all of the ads to get the prizes ( waaaaaaaaaayyyyy too many ) and you need to be able to by different robots with more than just the gold
1048,Andrei Pedroche,"April 23, 2020",2, The game really is not that bad the graphics are good but I wish the robots are faster cause it takes so long to get to the enemy but I you have long range your fine just the speed is my only problem

1057,mark yanc,"February 10, 2020",4, A really enjoyable playing experience. But unless you're paying to play expect to spend many months trying to level up. And you will beaten by paying players on a regular basis.
1058,Kris kornek,"February 12, 2020",5, I'm bumping up my review rating because of the efforts being made to rebalance robots and weapons. Also they increased ways to earn silver and gold making a little easier to level up. The game play itself is very addicting and have passed by the hours playing it.
1059,Dex Tor,"April 22, 2020",1, Game pricing options are thievery... should be cheaper. New overpowered quad lasers on Titans have ruined the game / the end of each battle. Get mommy to buy you the big lasers and poof game over. Pay to win.
1060,Aleksandra Vukmanovic,"March 6, 2020",4, This game is really fun but why do you need puzzle pieces to get better robots?its really annoying.and to get this au (like gold) to get the best weapons.if you wanna be the best first you have to play for 2 years.then be happy with your robots.come on i wish the game had an g-o-o-d update.

1062,"ILya ,Eli Vartanov","April 8, 2020",2," It has potential but it is a big cash grab, any upgrade takes way too long, and the amount of players seems low so you mostly play with A.Is vs A.Is. no fun there."

1079,Andrew Wyre,"April 22, 2020",5," Just a warning it's a big game, pixonic did a great job with designing the game it's very accurate and it's a challenging game. There is purchasing and if you dont spend money you will have to work harder for the good stuff. But it's a good game."
1080,Bryant Skipper,"March 13, 2020",1," I would give this game a -10 if I could. game matches are never matched properly, always up against players that are way overpowered and can one shot you. Cost way too much to upgrade weapons or robots......gotcha chest only give junk like power cells."

1083,Adam Austin,"April 21, 2020",1, Imbalanced pay to win wallet warrior game. Also it's mechs with powerz and cartoon animation. After 3 years of play I've reached max out before it becomes pay to win. Uninstalled today.
1084,Dribz 3B,"February 10, 2020",4, Better balance but most battles are usually one by one person in the team. Still hard to find a team where everyone does their part. Either you dominate or you die quickly usually.

1086,Dakota Rivera,"February 14, 2020",3, I used to love this game and it's still okay. It sucks when I logged it after not playing for several months I lost almost all the robots I collected now I basically have nothing I don't even have the GI Patton robot anymore.😔🤦‍♂️
1087,YT GD100,"February 14, 2020",1, It works when I played it like an hour and then the game won't load for me afterwards. It's also a pay to win game kinda sucks for us player who had no money to spend on and keep losing by those players who got awesome robots(PTW). 🙄🙄🙄
1088,Ed 8,"February 23, 2020",3, The game is generous and gives freebies most of the time for free. The downside is most of them are Ag which is only useful in early game and cannot be use on anything other than upgrading weapons and robots that will take a day to finish.

1092,Noah Bricker,"March 17, 2020",2, I used to like this game but the titans have made the game not as much fun as it used to be. And I can't play the game as smooth as I used to because of the titans so that also why I don't like the titans update. But that's it beside that the game is good ish. 🙂
1093,XI_Firefly .,"March 26, 2020",1, The wait times for getting into games has been 10 minutes +. That is unacceptable in any pvp game. Especially when the matches are only 5 minutes. Save your time play something else.
1094,Tyler Rommel,"March 28, 2020",4, The game is good and all it's just that you need to make it where you can friend people without Facebook cause people might not have an account or there not allowed to have one that would be the best game ever like call of duty mobile.
1095,Tejas Shah,"April 22, 2020",1," I pushed the ""watch ad"" button to speed up upgrade by 4 hours. But it used most of my 5000 Gold and upgraded the whole level. Fix the bug. Give me my 5000 gold back.. pilot ID IXQN05"

1121,Ryan Earl,"March 14, 2020",5," Good game but I think you should add something where you can exchange gold for silver but also silver for gold. Could use a lot more weapons that you can buy with silver, not gold or puzzle pieces. Same with robots"

1149,Kenny Kenster,"March 7, 2020",1," Pure pay to win! In order to farm on a gun it takes longer than a month unless your willing to pay a few $100 just for one gun. This game is not worth time, trying to farm for weapones."
1150,Edwin Solis,"March 6, 2020",5, I don't know what all these people talking about. the games does have it unusual perks but overall super fun and great graphics. I've been playing for a while now and it's my fav. game. lots of players waste money on upgrades but don't know how to play. anyways hope it helps

1159,Biagio Boncimino,"March 13, 2020",5, I like the game and how it plays. The robots are all cool and the game is fun. There are some pay to win stuff but it is not game breaking at all and it's balanced which most games can't do. I wpuld recomend this great mech game to anyone.
1160,Only one,"March 19, 2020",2, All the time I spent on this was waste. It does not even load. And without loading how could I play this game. Sometimes it loads in the morning time but after 8 A.M. it never loads. I am very disappointed with this game.
1161,Jah Thomas,"March 27, 2020",5, Fun game. Good luck joining a squad to learn more and grow. But most are only interested about money paying accounts and will not add u. But the game play is over all fun and results from growth
1162,Evan,"April 17, 2020",1, If you have small children some of the ads are completely inappropriate. If you report the ads for content the same ads will still show up regardless.
1163,Lil Bāy,"April 25, 2020",5, Amazimg quality and very cool robots to costumize plus a battle feld with many robots to battle against. I recommed it if you have played something like gta 5. Well if it is your tipe ofcourse. :)
1164,Marvin Robinson,"April 23, 2020",5, The game is loads of fun and good for people who like big guns and explosions
1165,Ahmed Yaqoob,"April 29, 2020",5, This components production is 60 it may be 100 This game is awesome and I like it too much
1166,doesn't upload,"March 24, 2020",4, Brilliant game but only 4 stars because the prices of good weapons and the amount of saving up makes it a pay to win unless you have dedication to earn things. But be warned it takes ages to save up.
1167,ryan dough,"February 17, 2020",5, When it takes 4 robots to 5 different robots just to defeat 1 bot just know you're the best than the rest.... I know you know my name Capt. Killzone so have your people leave matches and I still beat the team with plus 7 and up with a lose.... Lol 😂
1168,gamers creed,"April 22, 2020",3, It is one of my favorite games on my phone and I like that you can customize your robot with a paint job but I dont like that it is a pay to win.
1169,Joshua Curnel,"March 5, 2020",5, It's one of the best games I've ever played PVP is awesome awesome the graphics are awesome it makes it fun and challenging not knowing what you going to who or what you're going to be up against it's a game that takes strategy thinking and planning
1170,Souvik Naskar,"April 28, 2020",5, This game is very enjouful and virtual game.best time pass game for online.
1171,Alexander Billy,"March 14, 2020",2, Extremely unbalance matchmaking. Updates so people can play together from diffrent platform only make it worst. Ever since the update my win rate drop from 50% to 30%. Always rank up even if you dont have good robot and weapon is a bad idea.
1172,Matthew Brackin,"March 2, 2020",4, Everything I had when it first came out was still there. It's a little laggy but i blame my phone and internet. Reason i gave 4 stars is cuz i dont know how to get pieces for better and bigger machines.
1173,Daniel Gris,"March 18, 2020",1," It was a good game a few year ago but now it's all about money one more pay to win game, it has new stuff but you have to pay for everything or play all you life."
1174,Аспарух Стоянов,"April 5, 2020",1, A major bug fest. Constant rebalancing of equipment by the developers. Horrible matchmaking. A pay to win to the end.
1175,Dexter Emil,"April 12, 2020",1, Everytime showing connecting these days . Very frustrating on playing time when connecting. My power used on connecting but its not used in the game.
1176,Sanju Bhavesh,"April 9, 2020",5," It's a very good game in which there are a large variety of robots, rewards, modes and many others things."

It is too expensive to buy items with more than 300 Egyptian pounds up to 1400 pounds and more. We need a fortune to purchase in the game. You need to raise the popularity of the game in Africa and Middle East.. Take care that 1 dollar equals 15.5 Egyptian pounds. When you reduce the price of purchase clearly you will increase number of players that pay for play in Egypt and Middle East.
1181,Eli Wil,"March 2, 2020",5, This is the best game ever I really hope it becomes the greatest also could you add more robots and more tactical guns also people in the robots and you can like get out and like attack other robots while you're shooting them as a person or when you're in your robot.
1182,Michelle Morrison,"April 2, 2020",5, I have played war robots before and I loved it but I tried it again and it's amazing I think that you should try it out and I want war robots to allow merging accounts because i have so many.
1183,Robert Measmer,"April 22, 2020",5, Real nice. Dont mind spending a few bucks here and there. But be nice to also win some of the nicer bots and weapons instead of being forced to buy them.
1184,Viking Tomato,"April 23, 2020",3, It was fun and it still is fun but if your just starting out it's not going to fun because everyone is a tryhard and has such a high level robot and high level guns
1185,joey johnson,"April 23, 2020",4, Great game love almost everything bout it cept possibly speed the game up a bit

1188,A Google user,"March 24, 2020",1," Dropped my recommendation from 5-Star to 1-Star. Today the game got COVID-19! Red players are superman and blue is fodder. NO THANKS. Brain dead on arrival. Recommend look elsewhere. Was (& key here was) a great game, no longer."
1189,Pro Peeper Squad,"April 1, 2020",3," Hello pixonic i know this game is good but please can you balance the server because i saw a AO Jun with 2 Avengers MK2 in GOLD LEAGUE. Its so unfair and the rewards too so many players always get powercells,sivers,cheap golds and components so please fix it!"
1190,egg of shadow,"February 11, 2020",1, I can't get in any normal matches from the low piority queue. even an hour of waiting doesn't work. What about making a time limit for being in the low piority queue so it's not alomst impossible to get out? hopefully pixonic does something about the low piority queue so the game is even playable.
1191,Corryna Suryadianti,"April 29, 2020",5, this is the good game ever and i very love dragons robots . and this game has a good graphics

1195,Johanna Barnes,"April 23, 2020",4, Was loving it but everything is too durn high and it take to long to get good weapons and constantly have to upgrade.. usely ends in having to delete something else.....😥
1196,Amer Aljabr,"February 12, 2020",1, I used to enjoy playing this game. Until I got really upset with amount of micro transaction this game had. Don't think paying $100 means much here. It's rediculs
1197,Angel Duran,"April 4, 2020",1," Obviously it is just made for take all your money, you have to spend hundreds of pounds to get something and all the time It matchmaking sucks I'm in gold, how is it possible played versus legends? With more than 2000 points of different? You are swindlers."
1198,Uma Singh,"March 6, 2020",3," It's very strategic and fun, but one of the facts of this game is that it has become purely a pay to win-type of game. The robots are very expensive and need a HUGE amount of time to earn and buy."
1199,Bimal Kr Paul,"April 24, 2020",5, Very good experience I have by playing war robots I love the Titan Ao ming.

1209,Kai Yamagishi,"February 12, 2020",5," So, I have been playing with this for about 4 hours straight. If you actually play this amount of time and straight then you will probably get to at least level 9. Just like I did."
1210,Sherrill Wesoloski,"April 22, 2020",4, Its a great all around game but it is a pay to win and the pay to win is like 1 robot for 50$ so if you can fix it i might give it the 5 star rating

1228,Jkuavis,"March 4, 2020",4, I always have loved this game but the reason i give 4 instead of five is because its mainly pay to win and I have played for three years and most of the good robots cost jigsaw pieces and there so expensive.
1229,vic dunston,"March 5, 2020",1, I am putting this to a 1 star from a 5 star. The game lags as soon as titans start to drop! I dont think this game has much longer. I'm sad I ever spent money on this app......
1230,johnny hernandez,"March 5, 2020",3, My favorite game that ive enjoyed for 3 years however its unfortunate that its become so pay to win with the greedy tactics of pixonic and the introduction of anti skill content such as last stand along with the constant nerfing of hard earned items to promote new stuff ugh 😤
1231,Fenix Network,"February 19, 2020",4," It's pretty great. There was a few ""why is that guys tank so strong"" moments but for the most part i enjoyed being competitive with a free tank and upgrading it. Edit : These HUGE TANKS need a nerf or something hahaha."

1403,Ralph Jantzen,"March 9, 2020",3, love the game. Dropped from 5 to 3 because if u spend a bunch of time or money on bots or weapons and level them they will either nerf or make them obsolete.
1404,A Google user,"March 6, 2020",5, Good but you guys said that updates would come once every 3 months but instead you give in 1 month which is a little frustrating cause if lots of updates come so quickly then other robots slowly become worth less

Software architecture is also bad: lags, bugs, teleports, horrible match making. They say your win rate should be 50%, if it is higher they will give you weak team mates. Lots of cheaters, since game rules are running on client side. It is not a cheat since robot didn't move. Which in turn means you can modify apk and get longer shields and a such."

This game is bery fun in the beginning but as you spend more time in the game you will find that go be a good player you have spend a lot of money on it. The only way to win is by buying new stuff. And since there is always new overpowered weapons and robots being introduced to the game you're always needing something new because your old stuff isn't useful anymore. This makes it impossible for free to play players. However the game play is otherwise enjoyable. Hence 2 stars

Even with all the effort that I've put in, what I was once able to achieve on my own is no longer possible. If you are not prepared to pay money and keep on paying money, then don't bother, there are better time-sinks that are more rewarding. Robot/Weapon upgrades require substantial amounts of silver which can be won from various battle types if you do well, assuming the match-up is remotely fair. *Update* The matchmaking system has gotten worse. I've been as far as champion league, and are consistently being matched against players whose hangar's of robots far exceed the capabilities of mine and thats just based on a weapon/robot level. Nevermind modules and pilots. If the matchmaking system took the ""league"" that you were in out of the equation and focused more even on weapon/robot levels, then it would once again be a more fair and balanced match where Skill could be a determining factor. Right now, anyone with META or the robots I'll list below, it's just a one-sided bloodbath ending in frustration. The last several robots such as the leech and phantom are completely overpowered and not available to the casual player without significant effort in the workshop or getting extremely lucky in some giveaway or special event chest. Even then it still takes an inordinate amount of silver to upgrade both weapons and robots. To even get the amount of silver necessary, the main source is to do ""well"" in whichever battle types you choose to play in, which as previously stated, for the casual player, is not possible."

Its is nothing than a money grabbing (feels like) scam. Devs refuse to release more maps, fix bugs, improve gameplay, improve aiming, improve graphics, but always find the time to release new Bots and overcharged wepons just to make them useless the next month?

Love the game, love the battles and most additions however economy and costing is getting seriously crazy. Resources r now ver limited. Everything gets nerfed including what u spend cash on. Its become more p2w. Christmas event has been to spend $50 USD to receive tiny extra bonus gold. There r player boycotts that r justified. The game is brilliant but its not a game for free players and paid players leave once they realize everything they buy will become useless within 2 - 4 months. Sad.... Be very careful when playing as this game is addictive and soul destroying due to the poor behavior of the game developer"

Also most battles have become uneven. Forcing one to feel the need to spend cash to have an instant edge. Other then that great all around war game.

But recently it became commercialized, meaning you can play this game for free, but with all the expensive upgrades and unbalanced matches you will need a minimum of 100$ per month in order to have a so-called balanced game. Its a shame such an amazing game with awesome graphics and multiple choices to be broken down into a pay-per-play. C.O.D. HERE I COME!"

2877,Daniel Mo,"January 22, 2020",4," Great game but it almost forced you to buy things to get better. Graphics are good and controls are getting better.

I am writing this one star review due to the changes in the last update. Many issues are covered by other reviews, however I want to cover something specific. I am a Spider(4 Leg Robot) specialist and with the release of update 5.7 the spider robot walking/climbing Dynamics have been altered. Now they act as if they weigh 1 million lbs, cannot climb anymore, and the legs still get stuck on terrain and other robots. One star until these issues are improved."

2943,Luis Howe,"January 13, 2020",2, I used to have this game back in mid 2018 when it was good. They added all these updates and changed it's great experience to a horrible pay to win game. 2 stars only because of the great times I had playing it.

2946,Gabriel Rivas,"January 21, 2020",1," It makes you update every other week. This is ridiculous. I've never prayed a game where it makes you update so much. Of course they give no notice. So when you're somewhere and want to pay, you can't. You have to be on wifi to update. This game is totally not worth constantly updating."

2960,Stuart Murphy,"January 30, 2020",2, I want to like it but until they do something to balance the missiles it's just boring. You don't fight you either hide from missiles or have to launch missiles and you cant hide from the missiles they rarely miss. So you spawn you get missile striked and die rinse and repeat

2973,Steven Williams,"December 6, 2019",1, If you play this game you are gonna get frustrated with the pay to win. The servers are extremely laggy and they will say it is your hardware but I am very up to date and still laggy. Guess I will just play something else

2981,Aiden Nonya,"January 31, 2020",4," Oof. Not bad on the matchmaking, if you could make weapon/robot aquiring easier it would be better. Other than that it a great game. edit: matchmaking has gotten slightly better, but I don't wanna pay 100 bucks for a good bot!"
2982,Kevin Hoegen,"January 1, 2020",2," All about the $$ for this game. Fun with good graphics, but they keep rebalancing weapons etc to keep you needing new and improved upgrades to remain competitive. Every decent upgrade comes at a high expense in time or $$."

2986,Kevin Sawatzky,"December 5, 2019",4," The battles are intense, and often quite challenging but advancement is difficult because of the miniscule amounts given as a reward. Hard win, 1st place? Here is three gold. Meanwhile to buy anything is running you 5000... Good game, but possibly greedy developers."
2987,Alex Josa,"January 12, 2020",5," It is a very fun game, it has very good graphics and I know people say it is pay to win, but you could also grind, which takes forever, but if you are a very patient person, it is fine.

3025,Guilherme Menezes,"December 3, 2019",1," Tried to connect account to facebook and the game will no longer start up now, and I cannot submit a ticket because I cannot get in game.

3028,Christopher Lim,"December 24, 2019",2," I'm level 20, and recently it takes over 3 minutes to load and glitches (e.g. only loads weapons, colors are looking like a broken tv in cartoons, things like controls flashing) Fun game from the time I've played. Chris's son."

3032,Pratheepan Thevadasan,"January 20, 2020",1," You got to find a way to update the game and still let me play. The current update 500mb, and best to be on wifi. I won't get to an access point for another couple of days, which means I won't be playing the game for a couple of games... All for an update."
3033,Anonymous Force,"January 20, 2020",4," I mean, I like it. But yes, it is true. The game is so pay to win and unfair. The beginning levels are fun, but then when you reach the later stages it's kinda pay to win NGL"
3034,Bradley Wynne,"January 29, 2020",4," This game is soooo fun. I'm loving it but I'm still yet to lose as free to play player. ;).

Also tip: Upgrade your bot to at least 5 when acquiring it, then you work on new weapons with robots like raijin or ao Jun you get thunders they are a good set up so upgrade the default weapons temporary while you're in low league. See you on the battlefield commanders!"
3042,Tina Tharp,"December 14, 2019",5, It's an amazing game it's very addicting but there are some defaults no I love this game to death on gave me wrong but the backlash to the freezing it locks up and you're dead before it comes back. It's kind of not cool but still giving you five stars cuz it's a damn good game
3043,charlie supreme,"February 12, 2020",5, One of my 2 favorite games! I have 8 bots and 5 pilots and great stats! Domination mode is the best as the squad must capture more beacons and survive the clock!
3044,Andy Chouteau,"December 17, 2019",2, It's a great game until day 2 when you either pay or start losing personally I just uninstalled I'm all for dropping money on good games but this forces way too soon help options worthless. really disappointed I've been looking for a good mech game for years

3059,Zhivko Zhelev,"January 23, 2020",5," Game looks good , run good and is not only shooting ... Like it. I recomend to developers to make possible upgrade on weopon and robot in same time ...

3069,curtis boone,"January 20, 2020",1, The gaming committee should monitor this game. We spend money on points to unlock stuff then they change it to other type of points wiping out the money we spent. Other words watch out on spending money because they will take it without giving you anything for it
3070,Magnum 224,"December 11, 2019",2, Ever since the halloween update it has done nothing but crash and freeze in the middle of play sometimes you dont even get that far does it while you're arranging your hanger. Used to enjoy playing this... Not so much anymore

3072,shadow 117,"January 13, 2020",2, Match making is terribly unbalanced and needs to be fixed! Lot of crazy strong people in lower leagues and even crazier strong people in some what higher leagues. There needs to be a match making re work for sure.

3092,Zack Holder,"December 10, 2019",1, Dont download waste of time. Once you complete practice mode and start playing actual people. Your robots are useless. Pointless to play and wait for you robots to be contender's in the game.

3100,chell crouch,"January 8, 2020",4, its a good game but i feel like the chests are really rigged and it takes way too long to advance through and level up unless you almost have to cheat the system in a way and it is mostly dependant on luck but overall it is a great game
3101,Muhammad Shafay,"March 26, 2020",5, Your game takes a lot of time to load and it lags fix this problem and by the way make a option in game in which you can trade with other players

3104,George Kasprzak,"January 15, 2020",5," This is, and has been, one of my favorite go-to online mobile games. The mechanics and graphics still compare to those of the games today, and new content keeps getting released after at least 4 YEARS of gameplay!"
3105,Brendan Shaun,"January 25, 2020",4, Good game things are achievable just takes a long time. Game play it's hard to stare the robot the controls are late responding and sometimes can't shoot you have to stop then press the shoot button for it to fire other than that it's a good game.
3106,Roland Rios,"February 11, 2020",5, It's good but the updates are really slow and. Plus I subscribe to your channel but just plz. Make. The updates faster I want to play already plz
3107,Izaac Jacobsen,"February 4, 2020",2, I'm sorry but i can't even load the game. I just got it to. It would have been better if you had put in a loading bar in the start up screen. I'm sorry but I am uninstalling your game.

3119,Skyrim Reaper,"December 10, 2019",5," This is the best mech game I've ever played,great graphics tons of mechs,skins,and weapons, also events and updates,also there's a glitch were it's says the enemy team won even though they have one beacon if this is fixed it could go on console or pc in the future."
3120,Reginald Watson,"December 5, 2019",1, Buying anything is to expensive and the developers are constantly changing the values of everything. Maps haven't changed in years though. Lots of hackers in this game also!
3121,Phantom Collection,"February 10, 2020",1, This game stole my money and then told me there's nothing that they can do about it and I can't even play this glitchy game now whatever you do don't spend any money on this game ... This app is broken.
3122,CluckCluck Farms,"December 4, 2019",4," A very fun game, some times there are balance issues when changes are made or new robots are added but they are usually very quick to do an update and rebalance. Very addictive, can be free and can be as expensive as you like."
3123,Ryan Black,"January 21, 2020",2, You will lose to those folks that poney up big $ more often than not. Combine that with the gimp you get when rolling for loot boxes which is suppose to be random but its not. This game is great if you drop $100s.
3124,Brody Shell,"December 5, 2019",4," Amazing and addictive game. Please add the ability to adjust game graphics. This game roasts my LG G7 (SD845), but doesnt get hot on my sons Moto G5 Plus(SD625) because of the lower graphics setting."
3125,realbill,"January 16, 2020",1," Game won't even load. Keeps saying connection error. It's not on my end. Got to play two rounds yesterday, fun while it lasted. Deleting because it refuses to connect."
3126,Dameion Shore,"January 7, 2020",1," Titans ruined it for me. It's a shame when the opposing team deploys 4+ at the same time. Seriously what is the point of having more than one at the same time, it's basically an instant win. There is no point playing anything else other than a Titan."
3127,D Martin,"January 19, 2020",4," Mostly good for a fps, but still has some glitches concerning the mechs movement around structures. I'll get hung up on buildings occasionally which is definitely annoying. Mostly good though."
3128,the Runz,"January 21, 2020",4, I love the game. Ihave spent alot of time in it and till this last update no issues. For some odd reason I can not connect through mobile data only wifi. Not to big an issue but as I do play alot away from home this may be a problem then
3129,The Soul Taker,"January 20, 2020",5, I love this game it's just that most of weapons and robots cost gold so I feel like they should make gold easier to get and in the workshop it takes forever to get a new weapon or robot make it a little more easier
3130,Caleb Tureaud,"January 28, 2020",5," I love the game but the only reason that I dont like it to the max is that most of the cool robots cost about 10,000 puzzle things and I cant get that much. So do you think that you could change that to Silver??? Thank you :p"
3131,Avinash Tiwari,"January 25, 2020",4," Nice game, but developers are getting to greedy, the equipment prices are doubled and lottery system is designed in a way that you never get anything usefull whatever times you try. On some days the game refuses to start."
3132,Benny 4276,"January 30, 2020",3, I like this game but at 1500 and lower a lot of people don't know how to play like in domination a lot of people don't go for beacon they go for kill instead which makes me hate domination and beacon rush and I keep losing so I don't play these game modes at all but other then that great game
3133,tunisan seman,"February 2, 2020",3, Best War robot game ever and if possible can you remove the robots that required pieces to get it It took times and money to get it such a waste of time
3134,Aldo Hernandezveraa,"March 7, 2020",5, i like the game it's fine it's not laggy it's really fun
3135,Tyler Monroe,"March 11, 2020",3, Very cool for the kids and me.we always play agenst eachother and they always win.😭
3136,Laurenz Muhita,"March 15, 2020",5, War robots this game is hard but I love it so much . War robots has many robots that have a special skill
3137,Mark Dunlop,"March 5, 2020",4, Good game. Bloody expensive though.
3138,Pit Molling,"April 2, 2020",1, Pay to win is getting absolutely ridiculous.
3139,sam Tom,"April 22, 2020",2, No option to set graphics or controls

3141,Joseph Joe,"April 22, 2020",5, I like the game but u have to fix the lagg
3142,Fred Stetter,"February 10, 2020",5, The game is fun to play. Yes if you spend money it get better faster. I have never spent money and still enjoy the game.

3144,Katie Maley,"February 8, 2020",5, I Love WAR ROBOTS because when you get new robots you can have a new weapon and you deal more damage than before!!!
3145,Ravenous Drako,"December 3, 2019",5, Good game but I had an account from 2016 which had a Carnage and Fujin but it was gone when I came back. But still a really cool game. I'm grinding again once more but this time I will make sure I won't lose my progress.
3146,Jim Malek,"December 6, 2019",4," Really good game, but I dont like that I lost my keys for events just because I didnt use them before the events ended. I think I should be reimbursed for them. 2000 keys is a lot to lose."

He would start a game, then if he didn't like the map he would back out ( I didn't know there was a penalty for this). With no warning message or communication from Pixonic they put my 5yr account in a non essential queue. This means u can't find any matches for upto 1hr, this is your punishment. If you get this game, dont screw up! Also, there customer service SUCKS!"
3148,ANASTASIS KANAKOGLOU,"January 5, 2020",5," Great game. Easy, fast, tactical but only problem is that it's hard to get to a clan....for some reason 😛 Awesome experience for a mobile game! P.s. if you're a Mech Warrior fan, you should definitely play!!!!"
3149,Gregory Murphy,"January 20, 2020",5," Don't like the position of the health renew button, always pressing by accident, rewards are too small or take to long to add up to do upgrades Everything else about the game especially the graphics is great"
3150,jurassicteeth 049,"January 18, 2020",4, It is a great game but maybe if I could actually open the game after playing once it could be better. Edit: I finally got to load I and I waited for about 5 minutes. Not bad but change if you can
3151,A Google user,"January 31, 2020",4, Its a good game but... The problem is after closing the game and starting it again it wont go past the starting screen and i hear the music but it's not loading fix it please and i will give five stars.
3152,Minecraft Chen,"February 13, 2020",5, Fun game. On my top 10 favorite games list
3153,Robert Cammack,"February 9, 2020",5, Nice game to play. Will find several different levels as well as options to pay for just play.
3154,Hetal Patel,"April 25, 2020",5, So cool you don't need too much electricity to play
3155,Bobby Owens,"April 25, 2020",5, I realy like this game I think every one should play it over all the others I have played i is by fare the best.
3156,George M,"January 22, 2020",3," game is well designed and interface is great, but it needs balancing for higher leagues. Lockdown fix needs to be added to all weapons and LD ammo (extend duration for ammo) also extend immunity. MAJOR fix is needed for AoJun, lower builtin damage reduce flight speed."
3157,thomas spooner,"March 18, 2020",5, It's a good game I gest think it cood be a bit bedder on movement. All tho thare is only so much you can do on mobile.
3158,A Google user,"January 29, 2020",5, I love it I wish we can get one free good robot:New review: This game is so good and the spider robot I got that has a shield is amazing and I still wish for a super good fast strong good damage robot but my spider robot is not that fast :January 29.
3159,Neinball 98411,"February 26, 2020",3, Played it before lost the account started a new one enjoy it. Very pay to win wouldnt reccomend for those financially challenged.
3160,Silvester S,"December 10, 2019",1, P2W. Matchmaking is terrible. Some bots are overpowered and they cost higher which only a P2W player can afford. Used to be my fav. Spent some money on bots all of which are obsolete now.
3161,xhemi shehu,"April 21, 2020",5, The game is awesome but it needs better graphics and it's fun upgrading weapons an robots☺☺☺☺
3162,J Crack,"January 21, 2020",2," If you enjoyed the Mechwarrior series of old, then War Robots is the modern equivalent. Edit: Latest 2020 update appears to be stuck in a loop 'connection error, refresh"" - rating dropped accordingly"
3163,Ivan Sanchez,"December 3, 2019",2, I like the game. I just dont like it's almost a must to spend money if u want to have good things. Building robots takes too long. I been building a weapon and it takes about 4 months.
3164,theo alie,"December 7, 2019",4, It's a good game but to be within a fighting chance you do need to spend money on the game. Putting more bonus buys on for under £10 will make it a bit more comfortable to spend imo.

3166,Shubham Sharad,"January 9, 2020",1," The game could use a significant upgrade I have a 4 GB RAM and 4g mobile phone I HAVE TRIED 3 DIFFERENT NETWORK it's still not stating. It says to me ""check my internet connection ,can not get in hanger"" please fix this."
3167,16thnote YT,"January 17, 2020",5," Everythings great, i saw a bunch of sponsorships and ads for this game and i reinstalled it. I remember this being my favourite game in 3rd grade. The only problem is the kill system."
3168,dont hate,"January 20, 2020",4, It has good quality and it has great controls but it is more of a pay to win game. Black market always give silver and and pieces are a bit pointless. Could improve but has great gameplay
3169,David Maloret,"February 3, 2020",1, Would be a good game if it wasn't pay to win and players were matched evenly. As it is this game isn't good.
3170,Ewan Watts,"February 5, 2020",4, I love the style and design on the robots but in my opinion it would do with less jigsaw puzzle robots
3171,Killer Billy,"February 9, 2020",1, Too much advertising. I have the game and I still get ads on YouTube.
3172,Luke & Michael Kwon,"December 12, 2019",2, its okay but when you spend all your hard work getting the keys for the chest it never gives you the 100 keys. Its not to good. I dont recommend it myself. And it costs so much to get a good robot. I dont know what there trying to do but getting it is your choice meh
3173,Kaloian Mitrev,"December 17, 2019",1," I wonder when the devs will stop using employees to give 5 stars and perfect reviews?? The game is abandoned no new content guys, glitches & bugs, the p2w is ridiculous, prices are extortion, fights are rigged against you to push you to pay.. My advice is to look away"
3174,Mr.Rich0210,"December 30, 2019",4, Super cool game love it uses very little data its great game for travelling is a little glichy but otherwise still one of the best and with all the updates that it gets it deservs alot more attension that gets love!!!
3175,David Phillips,"December 17, 2019",1," Cheaters are ruining this game, running around with infinite invulnerable!!! Throwing the balance right out the window, not making the game fun with all the cheaters running around, going to uninstall and never return. Really angry about the cheaters."
3176,Dark Gamer,"January 20, 2020",4, This game is really great but all the great weapons are for gold forcing you to buy them witb money. I recommend that you ahould balance the pricing out and some weapons for silver. Its a great game anyway.
3177,DirtyNerd86 Silva,"January 24, 2020",5, The new updates over the years added so much to this game. The pace is perfect. Games that make you get good are my favorite. Been playing pretty much since it launched. Good job you guys
3178,Joel Martin,"February 1, 2020",3, Super grindy pay to win game. Only gets 3 stars because it's reasonably well made.
3179,Alexander Witkowski,"February 10, 2020",4, The game is great the only problem is that it's hard to level up and get gold!
3180,A Google user,"December 5, 2019",3," The game's decent, nice graphics, gameplay is fun but the problem is it's too p2w like you can hardly get any premium bot or weapons you gotta keep grinding until you get one of those"
3181,wahyu setiawan,"December 26, 2019",1," The update made it more less fun to play, to many new bot out in short time. you cant keep up, unles spend isane amount of money. the lag is insane. ihave an ok conection and device, still the lag is happening"
3182,YBK YoungBlacKing,"December 14, 2019",5," Thank you war robots for upgrading the graphics, game play, and making the point awarding system to include beacons when rewarding points. There's absolutely nothing to complain about, I tip my hat to the team, great job"
3183,Dan the Man,"January 20, 2020",1," Save your time and don't play, defenitly don't spend even a dollar on this game. The devos don't listen to the players, and they never make new maps. The only updates are things to spend money on, game play is weak too."
3184,Heather F,"February 18, 2020",5, This is an awesome game it has so many things that can be a huge accomplishment for you and its fun to see other robots you have not got.
3185,Michael Aleci,"December 3, 2019",5," This is the best game of this type don't waste your time looking. It's come a long way different game modes, pilot and robots with unique abilities make it interesting and challenging on different levels."
3186,Tom Burridge,"December 5, 2019",2, good game but matchmaking needs to be done on the basis of how much money you have spent. impossible to play against others who have just dropped a grand on it

3192,Leon Nightingale,"December 10, 2019",5, I used to play about a year ago I'm currently downloading the game again and will amend my review according to gaming experience with the new fixes and update. I loved the old version so fingers crossed. Yep still love this game I know I'm in the unknown league but I'm god like lol
3193,Steven Lewis,"January 12, 2020",2," Good game but match making is awful, im always on a team vs a team we stand no chance of beating. They have titans we dont they are highly upgraded we r not. I want fair match making even teams with no unfair advantage."
3194,Noble Durden,"January 22, 2020",1, Awesome game but it takes a while to get good robots. It would be cool if you could lower the price of 75dollars for a few things!!!!!
3195,ED,"March 21, 2020",1," Awful pay to win. You either give Pixonic thousands of dollars to stay afloat with the competition or you waste your life grinding resources. Worse than a gold digger girlfriend. So disappointed, it used to fun."

3199,J Cowboy,"January 2, 2020",5, I like robots cuz you get to fight other robot and it's on a war game and organs of my favorite and I I suggest people to play this game and have a fun time playing against other people and you can also play with your friends

3201,William Yowell,"January 22, 2020",2," War robots is my favorite game.....but will have to stop soon. Constant crashes make it near unplayable. Since the last ""update"" I cannot make it through a single game without getting kicked out."
3202,its zephyr,"January 16, 2020",5, This game is great but it would be more great to ad some things to the maps. Like. Place you make a plan with your team or Idk what ever little change in the maps will make it great.

3204,James Velasquez,"January 20, 2020",3," Pretty pay 2 win and if you dont pay you wont win. If you do it's like playing against npcs until you get ranked with some one that pays more to win. Fun concept, horrible implementation."
3205,Riser RMB,"January 26, 2020",1, Worst game don't play this game it's totally pay to play ! And servers are super laggy. Even though I have a very good network connection but always says reconnecting during an ongoing match !
3206,deathtouchedstudios Doom,"January 20, 2020",2, The game is decent but the pay wall is changed every few months and if you dont constantly pay then you will have a hard time keepong up with the meta....pixonic is a pretty greedy company and they bleed peoples wallets dry
3207,A Google user,"January 20, 2020",2, Weapons are pricey bots are pricey everything is very expensive but it would be 5 star if it was cross platform with all the older bots with increased speed and armor points. In the end it's still fun

3209,Mr. Cool Dude,"December 5, 2019",5," great game! plays pretty darn smoothly with my less than perfect wifi connection, and the developers do a very good job creating an even battlefield, such as between people who choose to pay and don't."
3210,Raashid Mujihad,"December 11, 2019",5, You should be able to give commands( like go that way )(help)(i need back up)(follow me)in you should also be able to see your pilot rank in battle that would help you teamates wanting to follow you are they will just see your strong
3211,James Frisch Jr,"January 28, 2020",5, I really love this game but one thing that I think should change is leveling up. It takes an insane amount of time to level up when your at level 23 and up.
3212,Joseph Meza,"December 5, 2019",5, It's hard to grow but when you do grow it's the best game ever trust you will love all modes but when you get high enough you will have a really good mode it's called skirmish you get to be very expensive bots and there so fun to play you can even try out the knew robots that just came out have FUN!
3213,RadicaL RazCal,"January 3, 2020",4," Its a very great game But We need more ways to gain ""Au"" Credits like A Campaign Would be Fun and challenging , and also a way to test run New Robots That youre about to buy made way too many Bad decisions 😅"

3216,Aidan Goodrich,"January 11, 2020",4," Unlike other mobile games, it isn't pay to win. The guide to always winning is 1. Buy gl patron. 2. Swap molots for t punishers 3. Upgrade a bit. You will win every round as long as you use this"

3233,Mason Schroeder,"January 31, 2020",2, The keys changed colors. Was blue now it's red. Had 500 saved up and lost all of it. That and you wanna charge 50 to unlock a robot. Come on. It's fun. But needs work
3234,Steve Hale,"January 24, 2020",3, Matchups are not even. I'm always matched with way higher level players and I just get brushed aside. Needs an overhaul of how they match people together to make it fair.
3235,Jack Maverick,"December 28, 2019",5," This is the HIGHLIGHT of my day, thank you, Pixonic, for War Robots, i LOVE it! You can find out how amazing the game is by trying it out yourself!"
3236,Nicholas Berryhill,"March 7, 2020",5, it updates alot but otherwise it is a really great game
3237,Jaime balderrama,"January 23, 2020",4, Great game and even better graphics. There are a few options for battle that will keep you engaged. My biggest complaint is how expensive everything is.
3238,nightmare Freddy gaming,"December 26, 2019",5, I have played the first update of the game and things have changed a LOT and its more awsome I dont no why ore how it could get better then the the first update I really dont no how I love this game to the people that are reading this if you dont have the game you should get it NOW if not you are mi...Full ReviewI have played the first update of the game and things have changed a LOT and its more awsome I dont no why ore how it could get better then the the first update I really dont no how I love this game to the people that are reading this if you dont have the game you should get it NOW if not you are missing out and if you dont like It i under stand it's fine this is a good game you should get it
3239,Caleb Dickson,"December 3, 2019",1," Just disappointing.. if i could give it zero stars i would.

Dont download this game."
3240,littlebull frogman,"December 6, 2019",5," For the new Titan? $100.00 US. Want to cut your teeth on that? Also, time and money become, money::: + :::time, multiplied!!!!!! Was a fun game, game.... Now you need a side credit to get credit. Beware..... Never again for me."
3241,hunter25x,"December 12, 2019",5, If your looking for a game you dont need to invest much in and still have fun it's this one. but if you wanna be the best cough up that $$$
3242,James Waldrip,"January 17, 2020",4, Edit: I took away a star. The game is starting to remind me of World of Warcraft. And Titans are dumb. Excellent game even IF you don't spend money. Ads are optional!
3243,Michael Alford,"December 22, 2019",1, Ruined the game with rockets. Takes no skill or aiming. You just shoot the wall or floor and theres no defending them. Light robots are obsolete. Good job ruining a great game.
3244,Andrew Wright,"January 20, 2020",4," Quite a funky game. Cool gameplay. Don't have to be a pay to play player, but you might find yourself outclassed at times."
3245,reaperr,"January 31, 2020",1, It used to be really fun and good game but now everything cost gold and puzzles and those take so long to get. Hugest pay to win. Went from one my most played games to my most hated
3246,Bryce Vanveen,"February 3, 2020",3, Games great! It takes you a long time to get where you wanna be but when you get there it's very worth it.
3247,MrOwkoob66,"February 8, 2020",2," Fun game, but locks up constantly,mainly in Battle I uninstalled it."
3248,Kalyani Karri,"February 10, 2020",5, It is very very very interesting game you playing with 4x4 other players with trill and amazing graphics in low mb lot of Roberts to use and fight
3249,Nimitzclass A,"February 10, 2020",1, unless uou are a veteran player or a pay to win player this game is not worth your time. Absolute pay to win nothing more.
3250,trancemerlin,"March 2, 2020",3, I paid 89 p for a robot and did not receive it now appears has frozen
3251,Jesse Lamb,"December 17, 2019",5, This is a game that my three-year-old can play and me a pushing 30 year old can enjoy after 10 or 15 games with a shity bot you can get a couple of pretty badass oneskeep this one in call of duty on your phone man for sure maybe some prime peaks
3252,Nate Thaniels,"April 11, 2020",1, It takes forever to load this game.
3253,Kyle MJB,"January 13, 2020",5, Great game! I like how you don't HAVE to pay real money to really progress your builds.... Although it's clear on the Battlefield when someone else has ponied up $50+
3254,BOSS艾BABY,"April 23, 2020",4, Some lag issues
3255,Candy Jahja,"January 22, 2020",5, This is a very nice game. Nice graphics😀. Good Controls. Very Detail and fun to play. Only it needs many storage to play.
3256,Ricky Loper,"February 11, 2020",1," AFTER JUST USING 2 BOTS IN EVERY BATTLE , GAME STOPS, AND SENDS ME BACK TO APP PAGE!!! GREAT GAME, YOU JUST CANT PLAY IT!!!!"
3257,carlos pez,"April 3, 2020",1, pay2win game! the game is ruined by a greedy company 💰
3258,snow panda,"December 3, 2019",5, every update surprises me.it gets better and better but I only got one problem with this game they don't help the free to play people get better they are mostly on the side of the people who waist hundreds of dollars for something something that is really worth buying
3259,Andrew Vogel,"February 10, 2020",3," The servers lag has been unreal lately, to the point where im avoiding playong the game until they get it fixed"
3260,S. Doumas,"January 20, 2020",3," Some of the recent updates have helped, while others are making it a ""Pay to Play"" game in order to stay competitive. The Pixonic server still needs work to address connection issues, which routinely affect game play."
3261,Rolo 6262,"January 23, 2020",3, If you enjoy being matched up against players well above you in skill and equipment then this game is for you. Your matches will be short and frustrating.
3262,Sheen Wilson Sison,"December 31, 2019",5," 100%Free to Play, if you have alot of patience, just watch ads and you get everything. Love it. you guys should try it."
3263,Alfred Yip,"January 8, 2020",2," It seems to be a pretty interesting game but with all the money players in it, it isn't so fun after all. You can never beat those who pump money.."
3264,Eric Linden,"January 6, 2020",1," I keep watching the videos to get extra loot and then don't get the loot when the video ends. The game is just kinda bare bones, too."
3265,zombo playz,"January 25, 2020",5," Thank you for fixing the the lag and the freeze. But still kinda pay to win. But I will keep playing and enjoying your game, thank you."
3266,Daniel Howell,"January 22, 2020",5, This is a really good game the enemy's and that it's good!!!. Also you guys should add like a new map robot that looks like a spider!
3267,Karen Badger,"January 23, 2020",5, This game is a great game to play. War Robots is my favorite game to play. I also like it because of the funny names they give the robots. Play now. I mean download the game right now. DO IT!!! You won' regret it.
3268,Mohammad Almotah,"February 13, 2020",4, i think this is fun you got robots and you fight with online people
3269,bryce taylor,"March 5, 2020",4, Great game just a little glitchy
3270,Austin Gallagher,"March 5, 2020",5, Fun game but a long grind.
3271,Maria Gemma Hilado,"March 5, 2020",3, Some of the matchmaking is unfair
3272,Wake Up America,"December 6, 2019",5," Good game, improvements can be made on pricing. Graphics have improved over the years. Wide selection of options in game. Game does lag from time to time."
3273,Becky Reed,"December 3, 2019",5," It is a great game I've never played a game like this before, I love the design of it and the way it is played. The only things I dont like about it is that it takes up alot of space, and it needs constant updates. Over all I think that this is a five star game and that you should try it."
3274,Miguel Loera,"December 7, 2019",1, They don't give out much silver like they used to for each battle. They barely give any silver for battle now. Getting a good amount of silver per battle was the only fun thing about this game. The game developers are getting stinjier and stinjier.
3275,Dylan Williams,"December 7, 2019",5, A great all a round multilayer game. I have been playing War Robots for a long time and it still isn't boring like most other mobile games. This game is loads of fun and you will definitely enjoy playing it.
3276,Ten wos Tha,"December 19, 2019",2," In the end, unfortunately those who spend most are rewarded with ultimate bots that's why commen player like me could just fall for traps n be a loser again n again. I had it enough n pixonic get well soon:)"
3277,ook ibl,"April 3, 2020",1, The worst shity game experience ever I advice you guys not to install this ge people die for money and only money
3278,Jun Dela Cruz,"April 23, 2020",5, awesome.....great effects and load out
3279,Greg Marchant,"February 5, 2020",1," Absolute trash, cant load the game for 2 seconds before it crashes, head office must be run by a bunch of monkeys."
3280,Ahmad Zhafran,"February 8, 2020",5," Great gameplay, but poor raffle.. Not playing with money? Then you will lose against big spenders"
3281,Fatima Goncalves,"April 28, 2020",5, Well this game is extremely fantastic well done pixonic good game
3282,A Google user,"December 13, 2019",4, Great game but the upgrade times are ridiculous. I can tolerate the abundance of adds but the wait times are stupid. Too much focus on sucking money out of you
3283,Babi Bird,"January 23, 2020",5, Ok other then the constant game crashing this game is pay to play if you don't you still pay by losing . You still win if you learn to play at a better level.save silver and buy the best weapons.love it
3284,Billy Hall,"March 5, 2020",5," It's a great game , if you like action this game is for you."
3285,Justin D,"February 12, 2020",4, Great except for the 5 or 6 pop ups you have to clear before getting to the game
3286,JORGE ARELLANO,"December 4, 2019",3, Great game would give it 3.5 stars. Some of the robots and weapons are out of reach for the normal players that can't spend a fortune.
3287,Syazkie XIII,"January 4, 2020",1," Game always crash!!! Trust me!!!! In the middle of battle..... Reconnecting? Can you accept this dear players?.... Also that this is money game....u pay u win..... I don't understand how it get ""Editor Choices""?"
3288,Kathrine Hensley,"February 3, 2020",5, The game is constantly updated and you can get really good weapons along as you play
3289,José Luis Narvaez,"December 7, 2019",3, I drop ☆ to tree just because the fact you guys think money grows in trees. You should add a bank were we can switch silver for gold..and divide wepons and robots upgrade by adding a additional research space...like Robots upgrade only and wepons upgrade only..waste to much time for one upgrade.
3290,Allison Alegria,"December 10, 2019",2, Everything is awsome but just the weapons are way way to pricey they are alot more pricey than there were in the other updates yes i would buy my suplies but if you do in battle the game just lags way to much and it will be just to much reconecting.
3291,NOBLERedpanda,"January 14, 2020",5, It is a really fun game that has a lot of destruction and cool weapons. If you are thinking of getting this game you should! It is very fun and intertaing.
3292,Chef Rowan,"January 22, 2020",3," Not bad. But it's a very P2W scenario. Unfortunately, the more real money you have to spend, the easier your battles will be."
3293,Seven Dice,"January 24, 2020",5, Love this game. You should install a way to communicate with teammates . Like on the app war battleships. That way we can coordinate as a team
3294,Elba Calderón,"February 7, 2020",5, Very good just need more game modes and more weapons for robots.
3295,scp dreamurr family,"March 12, 2020",5, Wow i like this game all robost finishung them all off and unloking robots wiht abilits
3296,Nat Turner,"January 22, 2020",1, This game used to be fun. I stopped playing it for a couple of months and when I came back all the time I put into making my robots top notch was all a was of time.🖕
3297,artin javanroodi,"January 8, 2020",3, It was one of the best Games 2 years ago but then everything changed. Now there are 2 ways to proceed as winner first spend money second spend half of your life to get strong enough.
3298,Edgar NX Ramirez,"April 29, 2020",5, nice game...so addicted...good for adult and kids now i cant re install this game
3299,fazxturkey,"January 20, 2020",5," Very fun to play, with okay graphics and cool robots. I love his game and I have it installed on all of my devices. Would really recommend this game to anyone."
3300,jay walker,"February 10, 2020",1," Very addicting, the leech ruins game experience. The lag is making everyone in my clan not want 2 play anymore."
3301,PYPlays 4,"February 11, 2020",4," pretty sweet, but my computer sucks and is super slow so I die constantly when the game lags."
3302,Dhwtbk Wi K,"January 20, 2020",4, in my opinion this game is very fun and addictive but if you don't have money your willing to spend then you have to rely on battle rewards but overall a good game
3303,A Google user,"January 26, 2020",5," Hands down the best game that I've played in a long time.. Very kool game play,, the PvP makes it very addictive.. I had an issue where I spent most all of my gold on silver,,they reimbursed me 100%"
3304,Jasphere Abuan,"March 16, 2020",5," It is a fun game and all, butt if you use money to get better it's just soooooooooo unfair. You see the pun"
3305,Ananth Sai,"January 20, 2020",2, robot and weapon upgrades are costly and long upgrade time and lag is too much while playing. Making a robot so powerful(Ares) at the starting and make it useless after few months. GAME IS VERY LAGGY
3306,Mr Yeet,"December 29, 2019",5," This is such a good game and your not getting smothered with ads, though there are some really good people but it provides more of a challenge"
3307,JRR R/C,"December 22, 2019",1," Disgustingly pay to win. After you finish your few starting battles, you get thrown into matches with robots waaaay more powerful than yours. It's ridiculous."
3308,Phanee Phanee,"December 25, 2019",1," Make sure you have enough money in your bank account or top notch patience level to play this game, not worth for time and money, wonder how they have good rating, might be some kind stuff"
3309,Kai Sargent,"January 5, 2020",5, The game is pay to win if you don't know how to use a robot like if you're a brawler it's pay to win but if you're like me and a tactical play you can do just fine.
3310,Shawn Espinoza,"January 10, 2020",5," What would be cool is if you add an exchange. People can buy, sell and trade robots, weapons and pilots. They can be sold for gold or silver. They can be traded for whatever the traders agree on e.g. a weapon and gold or silver ar just trade as is. It would be great!"
3311,Earl Bauda,"January 15, 2020",4," The game is nice, but we hope we have the option to edit the UI when we are on battle. Like change the control position."
3312,Kevin Clark,"January 21, 2020",1, I spend money on this game but recently after this update I randomly get kicked off the game in the middle of a battle while spending out on boosters come on now guys!?!!!!
3313,Andy L,"January 23, 2020",4," I love playing this game, but since the last update, it crashes during the first game ever time. I hope they fix this problem very soon."
3314,THRONEz Official,"April 29, 2020",1, canot loading this game.. stuck when im install.. zzzz
3315,chris smith,"February 5, 2020",5," Easy controls, game play feels good, gives a bit of nostalgia to players familiar with the mechwarrior franchise on pc"
3316,Cara Stephens,"February 9, 2020",5, It's the best game on mobile android and all of that there's a lot of robots to buy pvp battles and u can play with freinds.
3317,infiniteraze 42%,"February 10, 2020",5," Exceptional gameplay. To new players, get the Invader bot. It's overpowered."
3318,shark 5crr,"December 15, 2019",1, What the hell is wrong with this game 😡 this game is horrible and in the trailer it says that you can choose your own robot but they cost a lot like Gareith cost 1.1m that is crazy and getting the titans on level 30 is more stupid like what seriously this game is horrible and it glitches out someti...Full ReviewWhat the hell is wrong with this game 😡 this game is horrible and in the trailer it says that you can choose your own robot but they cost a lot like Gareith cost 1.1m that is crazy and getting the titans on level 30 is more stupid like what seriously this game is horrible and it glitches out sometimes. 👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
3319,Manjula Samarakoon,"January 12, 2020",5, The game is superb. I enjoy playing this game. The only thing I would change is increasing the gold rewards after the match. Otherwise it is great.
3320,Peter Scott-Samuel,"January 20, 2020",3, It's a fun game but it's fairly difficult to get gold and platinum( 2 of the maun currencies )/making it harder at higher levels unless you pay.
3321,Calab Igo,"January 15, 2020",5, This game is so bad it makes you thing if robot's take over the world that's what's going to happen. Na just joking this game is the best you can have a real experience of what it would be like if you were in a real robot. 😊😊
3322,Elizerac Zureck,"January 28, 2020",5," Pixonic you need to buff machineguns(molots and punishers) the game right now almost all of the meta bots have dmg resistance with a pilot skill having a health regen machineguns deals very low dmg just like manni explain in his video.

3323,Gaming Ninja,"March 27, 2020",1, Requires very good internet to even load
3324,Cross 4566,"March 28, 2020",5, Amazing love the pvp and need more mods but other than tht keep it up
3325,Dante's Lego World,"April 27, 2020",4, what I don't like about it is that you can't play online with friends
3326,Chris Flak,"March 5, 2020",5, my favorite mobile game of all time! been playing for 5 years!
3327,A Google user,"December 6, 2019",5, Been playing for two years now and game is great. New tablet with 3 gb of RAM no more lag! Updates are awesome. Don't know where the titans are going but battles are the same until titans get upgraded. Thanks Pixonic.

3330,Chris Neufeld,"December 12, 2019",4," Awesome gameplay and graphics. Level up system is well balanced, but takes a long time. Only real downside to me is the pay to win, but that's pretty typical"
3331,Bernalyn Woolley,"January 3, 2020",5," This is a amazing game,it has good controls and is fun to play there's nothing wrong except there should be better graphics but overall it's good"
3332,Charles Paisley,"January 21, 2020",3," Lots of fun, but rules keep changing. Don't love that. Too easy to pay to win too.. that is not fun."
3333,Gamerz Club,"February 3, 2020",5, Updates keep the game going and striving to get better weapons and robots totally worth it.
3334,Ben Cameron,"December 3, 2019",5," Great game! But you require money to really progress quickly in the game, otherwise, love it."
3335,mahomed taahir khan,"January 18, 2020",5, Hey so is there any maintenance happening at the moment 15th January to the 17th January 2020. I havent been able to start the app. The hangar doesn't show it just shows the war robots wallpaper. Please help I have loki components that I need lol many thanks in advance.
3336,Exploring with Cameron,"February 2, 2020",5, I love war robots I've been playing for a long time and since there was an update I thought I'd just make a new acc and play from the start 🧡🧡
3337,Jack Renfroe,"January 29, 2020",4, Every thing is awesome but sometimes I can't play a match it will load into a match for 3 minutes and will never load up. Rather than that it's awesome
3338,Nizam Uddin,"April 29, 2020",4, If only its pvp and can play with frens it would be more fun
3339,XdEnigma64,"February 9, 2020",4, Really fun with cool robots but needs to be different way to add friends other than Facebook.

Not only it did unbalance the game dynamics but it made it boring too - like playing two different games at the same time - . Furthermore it seems like greed has taken over of you ... it seems that you forced yourselves to believe that this was a good idea in hopes of added revenue via the new currency . You CANNOT unbalance a game where players pay huge sums of money in such a way .... maybe the titans has potential but the execution seems hastened.
3345,WOLFX,"December 5, 2019",5, Has lots of robots and the biggest arsenal for all kinds of robots.Controls are good and graphics are incredible. It also runs smoothly so i give this game 5 stars (wish i could give more than that)
3346,Adon S,"February 10, 2020",5, Its good and it is like if the bots where real they would do the same as the ones one the game
3347,Earl Sundblad,"December 6, 2019",5," Great game in my downtime. Slight issues with paywalls and feels at times like a pay to win, but that being said it is much less than other ""free to play"" games."
3348,KINGLY BURNING,"December 6, 2019",3, Lol I'm like cos it awesome and have good new robot lol but I not like p2w system because lot of money so yeah there is no half like out of six I give it a meh so yehh so yeh install but be warned you will be spending money so yeh you have Ben worn so yeh be warned you have Ben worned
3349,Brent Ziegler,"December 10, 2019",4, Love playing the game but sucks playing against people who pay because I get absolutely destroyed. I am not paying between $9.99 and $99.99 just to have strong robots.
3350,Nick Rex,"December 10, 2019",1," Something wrong with the game.bugs,bugs,bugs!the game is dead slowly!my phone has 4gb ram snapdragon 835.it was a most beautiful game,but now it Don,t work correctly."

3352,Jason Price,"January 20, 2020",4, It's a great game. Only flaw is how you gotta spend money to get more stuff or wait a month to a good robot.
3353,Section 16,"March 5, 2020",1, Too expensive and weapons are nerfed constantly
3354,Azza Jrays,"December 4, 2019",4," Awesome gaming platform, ..User friendly controls and setting selections. One Down side! ...The tech factory bots ARE FAR EXPENSIVE!, ITS FAR TOO TIME CONSUMING TO ACTUALLY ATTAIN THE TOKENS TO AQUIER THEM, ALL IN ALL GREAT GAME , KEEP IT UP PIXONIC CREW"

3366,Allen Carter,"December 12, 2019",1," The Game is great but won't play right! Freezes, shuts down during gameplay, the last draw was charging me au for gameplay, I lost all my au."
3367,Keith Hedenberg,"December 30, 2019",1, Gotta spend BIG BUCKS if you want to compete. Won't run on my tablet since updates. Takes too much memory. The game lags or gets stuck. No fun anymore.

3371,Jun Boncales,"December 28, 2019",1," Im trying to recover and asking for help regarding my lost account using my facebook account via help options in the game.

3372,William La Pee,"December 30, 2019",5," The combat experience is something to behold. They offer good offers, only if you watch an ad. All in all, a really good game."

3374,Safwaan De Jongh,"January 8, 2020",3, Great game.... But buying gold and things are tooooo pricey....even the best weapons itself needs gold.... Sorry but bring down the prices and then yall will make more money and please put in a communication line in the game... That will be perfect...
3375,Paul Brooks,"January 14, 2020",4," Pretty well balanced fights. Need an option to reconfigure button layouts. Prices are extreme and the entire upgrade price/time system needs a rehaul. Paint jobs cost a ridiculous amount, more than they should for a skin. Please stop being so greedy."
3376,Dajonnee Burch,"January 20, 2020",5, the game that pretty good but once you don't have good robots and it takes a very long time to get the gold it's really hard to beat the other robots
3377,Melody Swift,"April 25, 2020",4," Good, but always needs an update. And that's annoying"
3378,James Martin,"February 9, 2020",4," If you don't mind spending a little bit of money on an otherwise free game, it's a pretty fun game!"

3382,Adam Pipkin,"January 4, 2020",5, Been playing for years. Hard to get high end bots but not impossible. A month per high end bot. You'll never get fully maxed playing free but oh well.
3383,D'Lok's Garage,"December 25, 2019",1," I used to 5 star this game, but after yall added the titans, it ruined the game. A game i spent money on cause i enjoyed it so much, is now all over with. Was way better before titans."

3386,Brian Thomson,"January 3, 2020",5, great game to play in a team. Learn from others and upgrade your machines ready for battle. Work together to achieve rewards and become victorious.
3387,MemeLord 705,"January 20, 2020",5," It a vary fun game to play and pass time and is vary action packed. (Little rant: if any veterans of the game sees this I got one question, do you remember walking war robots was the original name? Nostalgia!)"
3388,Alam Ali,"January 20, 2020",5," Love the first shooter stuff but need to make upgrades bit easier to gain to keep you in it, plus upgrades, are expensive. Game itself is Good"
3389,A Google user,"December 5, 2019",5, great game! i wish there was a way to report other players. I would like if everytime i spent 1000 keys of any colour it was TRUELY RANDOM instead of giving me 1000 gold. Everytime is getting fn old!!!!!!
3390,Tim Sappington,"January 6, 2020",5, I am revising my review ... Although i seemed to have been banned i can still get in to play . There are ways my friends . Anyway War Robots is the funnest game available and I highly recomend War Robots to anyone who loves shooter games . Un4Bidn !!!
3391,Iruna Maestro,"December 31, 2019",5, This game is absolutely Awesome. Its so much fun to play! Though I hope you come out witu an update to fix the rebooting bug after every battle.
3392,Matt Wilson,"January 22, 2020",5," Pretty fun, especially if you enjoyed the Mechwarrior series. It's possible for a f2p player to do well if you save up for some heavy mechs, then switch out your light ones later."
3393,Tony Smith,"January 21, 2020",5, Expect to spend some cash if you want to do well as you progress through the leagues. But the gameplay is fun and super addictive.
3394,electric fox,"January 22, 2020",5," Great - these are my only words. A pay to win game, but also fun even if you don't pay and lose."
3395,meryll chavez,"January 28, 2020",5, This game is legit dope. Easy to access settings and controls. High rewards for watching ads (optional) and a great pastime.
3396,Ramanda Jahansyahtono,"February 7, 2020",5, Dear pixonic can you remove the name and eye indicator while a robot goes to stealth mode? Because it is more fun to gank when the stralth robot goes real invisible.
3397,Akanni Olabode,"February 8, 2020",1," After spending 1500Au on clan creation, the clan doesn't show when searched for... It's very painful.. pls help me look into this"
3398,C Warner,"December 6, 2019",4, This game is great...but went downhill when they gave everyone the chance to fly and lose target lock...now I just wait to die.
3399,KuroGiri _,"December 17, 2019",1, Hi devs . my game is curently stuck at the loading screen . it keeps loading without entering the game . i have tried reinstalling the game and rebooting my phone but it didnt do anything . what should i do ?????
3400,james lewis,"December 24, 2019",5, Very simple learning curve you have the options to buy stuff online but but unlike other games it's not forced on you!!!!!!
3401,Saif-s GAMING,"January 8, 2020",1," I can't choose beacon rush,teamdeathmatch,free for all and quick match.When I click the to battle button in the lobby it automatically starts domination and the seconds count. Please reply to this one"
3402,InfiniteXDrummer,"January 1, 2020",5," Love this game, doesnt get better than this. Two improvements: Reload Button for magazine weapons, cross platform compatibly. Thanks!"
3403,styrofoamzz,"January 20, 2020",5, The game overall is good it was better in the 2nd year I've Been playing for 5 years now but the game is good I guess don't spend money if you have time this game is for you
3404,Fruit Bat,"January 21, 2020",1, I can't recover my old acclunt here:( i had multiple magnum guns there and a trebuchet and the large robot fury its connected to my facebook account why can't i recover it:( I have played this game on tw year 2017 and when i cam back i can't recover it
3405,Corey Derenda,"January 20, 2020",4," Solid game, have been playing for years. A few quirks to it as you could expect, but overall worth playing"
3406,WhiteRose Xx,"January 25, 2020",5," Its an amazing game to play if your bored! My experience is amazing so far ( not saying it might change) Thats it so far though, no dislikes."
3407,Hunter Wilson,"January 28, 2020",3," Amazing Game but it could use graphic updates. Also the controls are OK, could give the players more settings. Like shadows ON/OFF."
3408,Andrei Gonzales,"February 8, 2020",5, I have this game on my tablet so I aready had some experience but it is really fun I wish I just had more stuff and robots
3409,Ventico,"December 4, 2019",1, With the new currency 'platinum' players are forced to buy even more platinum with real money. It's very hard to win enough platinum to even win a new weapon for a titan. The developers show everyone with update 5.6 how greedy they can be. It's ridiculous.
3410,Gum E Be,"December 13, 2019",4," Good game, I do hope you can make an offline mode though. Controls are sorta screwy and I don't like having to buy things, but that's just me."
3411,Cliff Martinet,"December 30, 2019",2, The game is actually decent but in the end it's just another pay to win game that eventually you have to pony up large sums of cash to compete.
3412,Joey Egan,"March 16, 2020",4, I like all the bots and the movement but some are slow and it's addicted
3413,Jayne Byrne,"March 5, 2020",5, This game is briliant egspecialy the new lv 30 robot :)
3414,Chris Reedy,"April 28, 2020",4, It's fun but laggs a bit

3416,Annemarie Coetzee,"December 3, 2019",5," Best game ever I love this game and its so addicting its fun to play and test out new robots. If you like the game to and end up trying it out then go chek out manni gaming on you tube he teaches you new triks and tips, sub to Adrian chong too. Awesome game keep it up."
3417,Raven Rock67,"January 26, 2020",1, Six games in a row. Six crashes in a row. Since update app crashes constantly. I can no longer play this game.
3418,Brody Olson,"December 7, 2019",5, The game is violent fun huge and there is so many robots and they have so many guns and they're really cool and the map is really big really really big.
3419,Tuan Henderson,"January 11, 2020",5," Unlike other games where you wait to play, you only wait for upgrades. You can continue playing while you wait."
3420,Jaco Venter,"January 20, 2020",4, This game is AWESOME!!! The only drawback is that you need to spend real money or wait a REALLY LOOOOONG time to get the bigger and better robots
3421,Alex Urfer,"January 22, 2020",3, It quite fun but after the first 3 matches I got thrown Into matches with what's seems to be high level players cause sometime I just don't do much damage if none at all but still fun
3422,Momin Zeeshan,"December 4, 2019",5," Really amazing game the graphics are very good but I don't like one thing that there are stupid puzzles, their really hard to get!! I really mean it."
3423,Shane Matye,"December 10, 2019",5, Best game I've played in a while! *Easy to pick up and learn everything *perfect control system *easy to upgrade
3424,Cam TheGamingKing,"December 15, 2019",5, Great but no game is perfect. VERY ADDICTIVE. I am very good at tactic games and io games and this fits that category. With my Leo robot I wreck face. Highly recommend it.
3425,jansen paradero,"March 27, 2020",2, Good game but It's a PAY TO WIN battle.
3426,Neven Royer,"December 30, 2019",5," Cool fight to get new robots,guns, and more. A great game to take time away and to have fun."
3427,Krit Rajgarhia,"December 25, 2019",4," Good game but please do work in section of friends , to call our friends easily to play . But ispite of it ,it is a good 6v6 game to play."
3428,Payday6996,"December 31, 2019",5," I love the game it takes a while to level up and get where you want to but theres plenty of weapons a cool robots, the better ones are pricy"
3429,Amarnath Dharshan,"December 29, 2019",5," What is the rate of fire of any machine guns type. According to in gameplay info molot is medium rate of fire and punisher is high rate of fire. U have briefly showed the damage and range only, show the rate of fire to decide."
3430,Mason Moose,"January 10, 2020",5, It was very smooth on Android or iPhone or a tablet it also reminds me of the classical PC game section 8 but I definitely recommend this game.
3431,Bimsara Dharana,"January 19, 2020",1, Worst game I ever seen in play store. If you want to win in the game you must pay to developers. And takes too much time for upgrades.
3432,GTR Jersey,"January 20, 2020",5," Awesome Game play full of strategy and team work, Pixonic always working on making the game play fair and more interesting for a more fun experience with new updates every time to improve the game great job!!!"

3434,Rodel Dela Camara,"February 10, 2020",5, Its good but needs improvement The graphic really need to be fixed Cuz its bad but the gameplay is good
3435,Fati boy9,"March 1, 2020",3, Kinda a lot pay to win but it's a good game I enjoy it
3436,Michael Guajardo,"December 29, 2019",1," This game has become plain garbage, slow-moving and glitching robots. And a bunch of other high-priced junk. Old version was way better"
3437,Jim Davis,"December 25, 2019",5, amazing f2p is awesome it's a great game top ten next to call of duty and pubg it's worth trying very entertaining it has a lot of missions you'll never be board and it also let's you watch videos to make in game currency one of the best f2p games in my opinion
3438,slayer master 77,"January 5, 2020",5, This game is amazing I am a pro and I just played for 3 hours I've only lost once but it has some glitches my only lose is from a glitch that made me fall under the map but in other cases it's great definitely recommend it 😃👍👍😁🎉
3439,Ju Mendoza,"January 20, 2020",1, Pay to win game. Matchup with other robots are not fair. You will be fighting higher level players with no chance to make you spend more $$$.
3440,Neurolucky,"December 3, 2019",2, After playing it for longer and even spending money on the game I can say more confidently that this game is a bit more of a pay to win game and creates a pay to win environment
3441,Tobin Bourne,"February 12, 2020",5, Cool I thought a time killed but a keeper. Still a keeper but gets complicated.
3442,Necifora Whipple,"December 4, 2019",5, I like the game because you get to buy and test cool robots and robot guns and of the Titan robots they are really cool cause it's bigger than the other robots.
3443,Jeff Morczek,"December 9, 2019",5, Pretty fun game. There are both ups and downs to it like every game. Spend a little money and you can do good.
3444,RICO LUCIANO,"January 22, 2020",5, Great game for not having money but competition with money players is the best like it when they spend money on game and in a few months you get it for free lol but great game I enjoy it
3445,Rodrigo Morice,"January 3, 2020",4," Would give it 5 if the maps weren't in favor of one team from the start. That 5th beacon needs to be centered more, so that 1 team doesn't have an advantage by being closer"
3446,Shawn Conrey,"December 30, 2019",1, Fix your game to work properly on all decives. Live in USA and never finds a match to join. Either you level old players in the dust or your game is broken
3447,Jonathan Reyes,"January 22, 2020",5," Great visual, but no team balance. You are only allowed one item at a time for upgrades."
3448,Sammer Zakkour,"December 5, 2019",1," The worst game ever in terms of exploiting players to pay money, Gacha system, only who pays has fun, who doesn't gets angry! Yes gets angry while it is supposed to be a game for having fun. Yhe most greedy company in the world. Worst experience ever, never try this game"

3452,Ken Mick,"December 26, 2019",5," I remeber playing this game back then, it was so cool to shoot weapons and even better yet,shoot weapons while inside of a robot. I really love this game 5 star!!!"
3453,Victor Mendez,"January 20, 2020",5," Aside from the pop up sales windows that annoyingly pop up, this game is very fun. I wish there was less pay-to-play advantages tho."
3454,Scott Tunstall,"January 20, 2020",5, It is so fun and you get to rank up and get new robot's and you grind for credit like me so thanks for all the joy you have brought to the game.🥰🌋
3455,Cameron Newman,"January 20, 2020",5," Love this game honestly no matter OP some of the paid players are, I still enjoy the concept and strategy the bots play in the game and how its evolved... I never though it would transform like this.."
3456,Bradley Lomas,"January 22, 2020",5, Excellent game. Brilliant art work. Stable platform for international community. Upgrades are a little costly but a good download

3466,A Google user,"December 7, 2019",5," the match making and strategy is retarded. All players do is sit back and artillery to get 5vs1 at the end of the match. best way to play is free 4 all, kill and leave game"
3467,Hospitaller 66,"December 17, 2019",1, They keep updating game stealing your money with changes. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. And when you do play your in with higher level players so you dont stand a chance

3480,shiloh potter,"January 1, 2020",5, I like war robots it is a fun game that you can play in your spare time or if you play all the time then it works for both types of games and I think it has a fair rewerds system
3481,Aiden Presseisen,"January 13, 2020",4, It is a game that I like but I gave this 4 stars because the enemies and my teammates are higher ranks if you fixed your matchmaking system I would rate it 5 stars
3482,Markus Maxwell,"January 31, 2020",1, Gameplay above level 20 is garbage because matchmaking is terrible. This encourages players to tank games. Google Editors choice? Hahaha. Not for this.

Third: If not added already; daily rewards. Every day, for a week. You can get items, the more days you log in, the better the rewards. On the 7th day, the reward can be a robot or a weapon. And once the first week is done, another week appears with better rewards than the last week. And possible to skip a day with gold."

It will be very hard to do anything. Because in lower leagues I suffered alot with my 2nd which I made like few months after my first. I didnt have much progress in it. And bots like Ares totally dominate especially in ffa. But still I like this game. But it would be good if you can transfer your peogress in different devices which I would really like.

At lower levels, its evenly balanced and skill is required. The problem becomes when you advance, the upper levels become a pay to compete things. Never mind pay to win.

After a while you start to wonder why you're getting creamed by players in leagues far more advanced than you and wonder why you're even matched against them.

The game's very fun because it's very Tactical. one robot has an aerial rocket that can attack you from the air so even if you're hiding behind cover it won't do you any good.

One is that it is very unclear what the goal is and what your supposed to do. Another thing is that the black market never give you anything worthwhile.

5392,A Google user,"April 24, 2020",5," I like the changes. I know a lot of people moan about pay for play, and it can be a wind up sometimes, but I think too many people want instant success and aren't prepared to work for it. I still like chocolate cake"

5395,Pranjal Pandey,"March 23, 2020",1, The game has become purely pay to win as bots and weapon are very expensive and if you do not spend money you will not enjoy the game and easily loose to players who pay as they will have latest and most powerful robot with good abilities that in many instances you will loose the fight definitely

It was simple, you had a good selection of a bunch of robots, all super unique, all having their strengths and weaknesses. Games were usually fair, and it was FUN. Now there are too many robots to choose, not one of them is unique anymore. Whatever ability you have can be countered, rendering it useless. The new currencies are ridiculous. Wish I had more space. There are just too many problems now"

5407,Nicholas Wagner,"April 28, 2020",5, It's a good strategy game but when they nerfed the energy shotguns its gotten to the point for pay to win . All around it's a very great game I would encourage others to try it out.

It's just whenever I buy a robot and I spend gold I end up not getting money from the next round. Other than that this game is noice.

I have been playing this game for around a year now and I have a decent hanger now but it took alot to get here . I do believe you should buy certain items when they go on sell . I often see robots go less than 5 bucks. I got my kumiho for 1.99 amd my strider for 4.99 but even if you don't pay for anything u can still get really great bot. UPDATE . There are to many updates. Makes it difficult to keep up

These paid mechs are also significantly more powerful than mechs that are actually acheivable for free, same with equipment. There are groups that play on level ground, like six-pack discord.

Was close to full mk2 everything I had but they now take half your silver off you. They like to run the speil everything can be earned. If your happy to play over years yes. I payed money and still no. They decided to release titans that no-one wanted. You will see the destruction of the game as they try to milk the dry cow. everything this company does is to make big money.They don't want pocket change. Uninstalled.

It has the easiest controls and awesome graphics. I love playing War Robots. The only thing I don't like is the fact that if you don't spend real cash you will never go past level 30 because without spending cash you can never get a fifth slot in your hanger. You will never be able to upgrade enough to be equal with the players who do spend cash or get better robots & weapons. War Robots is the best one compared to all the others.

5780,Eric Dupuis,"January 26, 2020",1, I used to play this game a couple phones ago until the pay to win got to be too much for me. I tried to download it pn my new phone and it wont download. It wont even start on wifi. Without wifi it gets to around 50% (after 10 or 12 hours) then it stops downloading without giving a reason why.
5781,Hawk Jones,"February 3, 2020",1, Be honest people this game doesn't even the third one star it clearly has forgot in Fairplay it clearly had forgot and provide good connections could have forgotten debating cheaters from winning. Say bye-bye to the real robots of War a joke and a waste of time

5798,Dhruba,"December 6, 2019",1, Graphics is really nice. Gameplay is also nice. But 99% pay to win. You have strategy but you opponent have money. You can't do too much effect on results. I have played this game for 2 years. I don't have money so I had to uninstall this game.

5807,Mustafa Bahar,"November 26, 2019",1, The most one sided game ever to be honest. If you're F2P don't even bother to play this game seriously. Moral of the stories if you're P2W always win. If i can give this game no rating will be a good start. So development you are not worth 1 star at all.

5842,Jenny Calhoon,"December 30, 2019",4, i like this app becuase its 3D and i just love the noises. but what kind of stinks is that most of the robots you have to buy with gold and its hard to get gold unless you are 1st place in fee for all or you watch a video. and if you don't have good connection it freezes on you.

The graphics are sub par and the control method is probably a little too simple. There is little to no customization in this game as well. All around this is not a very good game.

The new bots u can get totally free and thw classic bots now cost a ton of gold when they cant even really compete with the meta. But i do love the gameplay and i miss the old music from the walking war robot days.
5907,Josh Biggington,"March 3, 2020",1, Good game but lacks in prize amounts if you win a battle...and when you do finally get to save up enough keys to open a chest it gives out the same stupid prize over and over which makes it bad

5929,Paul Ciampo,"December 3, 2019",4," Fun game. As most games are, it is pay to win. However you do have ways to obtain high level items, but expect to struggle if you arent paying in. The gameplay is solid and the weapon system is intelligent. The game allows for many play styles."

5969,Cloudy_Spider YT,"December 2, 2019",5, This game is great. People say its pay to win but it's not. U can get the same stuff and skill withough money as the people who spend money. People who say its pay to win are just not putting in the work. They are just lazy and exspect evrything to come to them in life.
5970,Moe Laganiere,"March 11, 2020",1, Game is glitching. Robbed me twice of my silver crate. Game froze had to force stop and go back and never got the prizes. Player name MoeGyver still does it . It's now 2020. 2 years later and the game still cheats you.

5973,Natanael Tanumihardja,"November 24, 2019",1," Stupid game. You got kicked to low priority due to bad signal issues, then you must play games with long queues 1 hr +. This is stupid and i'm quiting it. Weapons and robot are becoming more and more ridiculous and the game becomes more play to win rather than based on skills."
5974,etanius welius,"November 7, 2019",2, Looks very modern and cool but it is not as good as it was. I used to play in early 2018 and it was good but they updated it like every week wasting 300mb of space now 700mb and takes a long time to load into games. It is pay to win

5980,エンドミクキ,"December 19, 2019",2, After not playing this game for a year. The game has gotten worse. The dash bots were fine but the bots and weapons after that ruined the game for me.

5983,Siddhant Rava,"February 15, 2020",3, It's a pay to win game and also it's so hard to get gold. Earlier it's was easy but now after the update it's very hard.
5984,Gabriel Barraza,"November 27, 2019",5, I love playing this game but lockdown needs to be upgraded. Lockdown should completely lock down the entire body. (no mobility at all!). What's the point in locking something down if they can still turn and shoot you.
5985,Lisa Bermejo,"March 12, 2020",1, Try and develop your access instead. Where I've paid for some weapons and I can no longer access it. You have to develop cross over access from iOS to android. Cant start all over again

To me it looks like a bunch of money hungry app developers got together and played mech assault and stole there game and put it on a phone. Please then they pull you in by giving you the 100 points to open a box to give you a mediocre mech or weapon and build you up so you can pay to win. No match making. No point to play for free cuz it will be a waste of time and money just for a game that over charges you for the least amount of stuff. I'm just so over this

6016,Tyler Crawford,"February 5, 2020",5, This game is great but the only thing I think it should have is a party that allows you to have up to 18 players so there is 9 on each team
6017,Elias Sido,"February 25, 2020",3, It's a great game but it takes forever to load and the in game ads are way too long at around 30 seconds. So I uninstalled it.
6018,Atharva Thorve,"November 23, 2019",1, The game is extremely biased towards players who are ready to pay. It doesn't match you with players of your own level so the levels fights are usually very difficult to win. Not recommended if you are not ready to pay actual money in this game.

6081,Shakuntla Jain,"January 15, 2020",1, the game is very good but I think you should work on some things that is when we win we should get at least 30 au at the first position and the price of the robots and weapons should be a little bit cheap like 500 au and the slots should be also cheap

In the past you could build up a line up of Robots and weapons within a few months and play at the top tier for free. But now it would take around 3 years to achieve that without paying any real money. The developers are constantly trying to steer players into forking out real cash. Every so often they will throw you a bone and then take it away. They take care of their paying customers by allowing them to use their best content to match up against you and achieve top scores and rewards. Non payers are used as cannon fodder. The game is based on 'rock, paper, be a vounterscissors philosophy. So there will always be a counter to new content.

It's very pay to win and it can cost thousands of dollars to upgrade a single bot with all it's weapons to its max potential if you are impatient and want to compete at the top level. Also, Pixonic keeps releasing new bots that overpower the older bots so the upgrade treadmill never ends.  Yes you can upgrade for 'free' but it will take you many many hours of playing and it will take a long time - possibly years to upgrade just your base hanger.  However, you can still have a lot of fun without spending any money (or spending just a bit of money). Don't worry about upgrading your bots. Just upgrade as an when you are able to. You will find that the power kick you get from upgrading your weapons or bots is very brief. Soon you match up with opponents much stronger than you again so don't worry if you are in Gold, Expert, or Masters as long as you feel you are having fun.  The best part of the game is Skirmish mode. Skirmish mode appears as an option periodically and you get bots selected by Pixonic and everyone has the same bots. This is my favorite part of the game."

But its not worth it if you're smart. They have a workshop where you build components for new robots. It takes days to build new components. But recently all the components I had built over the past MONTH vanished and got replaced with silver (an easy to acquire in-game currency) rather than with gold or other same-value components. So I messaged support and they took several days to reply. And they only confirmed that yes the components were replaced with lower value currency and then they closed the conversation. It was like shutting a door in my face. To summarize, they can take away your in-game possesions whenever they want and they are making this game a pay-to-win game. So although it is a fun game, and i recommend it for that, i cannot recommend it to the wary, intelligent buyer and have uninstalled it from my phone. If I wanted to pay to win, I'd get candy crush instead."

And not just pay a little. Some weapons/robots cost $300+ each. When I started playing it was much more balanced: Pay players could of course get ahead by using money, but it was entirely possible to put in the grind and time and eventually reach the same point. Now there is no chance. New weapons and bots are continuously being released, each more over powered than the last. Robots players just paid hundreds (yes that's hundreds of dollars for one robot) for a few months ago are now not much more than cannon fodder. If I were a new player and not willing to shell out hundreds on a phone game there's no way I'd stick around. I'm guessing they must be giving new players an incentive to rate 5 stars. There's no way this game should have such a high rating anymore. Do yourself a favor before getting too invested. Look at their Facebook page to get a true gauge on what players really think of the game. Edit: This game has become complete trash unless you're going to spend money. It's too bad, because at one time it really was fantastic."

Weapons and robots need a total of 10,000 pieces to create in batches of 100, 200, 400. In addition to in game currency needed to create it, the packs would take 15, 25, or 35 minutes to craft respectively for the lowest times, and the highest times took 1.5 days to 3.5 days in total. Now, the 15 minute time has moved up to 1.5 days! The 1.5 days has increased to 3 days, and and the 3.5 days has increased to almost a week, just for 400/10,000 pieces. The whole point of this update was to create a system that let you build what you wanted and not need to worry about winning the lottery just to get the weapon or robot you wanted, and even though the new system had flaws, increasing the time by such a dramatic amount is contradictory to why they released it in the first place. The system is already unfavorable towards new players, but this has dramatically exacerbated the issue. Once it gets fixed, I would be happy to put the review up to 4-5 stars as it's still a fun game. But I find it pretty unreasonable to wait for a total of (10,000 pieces /400 pieces=25 total packs needed, 25 packs x 6 days = 150 days) just for one robot! Keep in mind that you can only have a maximum of 6 things building at one time, with only 3 able to be used by lower level players."

I could not be touching the fire buttons at all but if I touch an area near it I fire all my weapons uncontrollably. Map design is my pet peeve, certain sides of the map feel advantageous than the other on certain game modes. One side of the map can dominate the other side no matter what, and when you are on the other side, you are pushed into a corner and forced to hide and be picked off one by one. Gameplay is okay, the leveling system could be redone. I don't want this game to feel like a money grab forcing you to buy/spend gold if you want to be at the top (which it's starting to feel like now that I'm lvl 18). I'd rather prefer a balanced system, so that wether you're impatient or want to grind to the tOP, its achievable rather than having it way too unobtainable. Aiming feels solid... when the other person isn't on a higher or lower floor than you. I wish that you could adjust the camera to point up or down as well, but you are always forced to comply with the games auto aim, which may or may not work depending on the fight. Matchmaking (or mechanics) could be reworked to. I swear, the people you are up against can go in guns blazing yelling ""charge!"", take a few people down, and die in a glorious blaze, but if you try to do the same, you are already running away before you even have a chance to pop around the corner. I even tried leveling my mech and weapons to match up to those people who always seem to have a leg up, but it feels like the game doesn't like that, and puts me up against people that will always be better than me. Movement feels clunky, too slow paced. Could be revamped with new movement controls. Hell, new maps could be catered to it. I wouldn't mind some rooftop action or something similar (try not to fall off folks). I would like to talk about other things, like animation, graphics; I'm surprised the game has rag doll physics;; but in all honesty, playability and replay value are more of a concern to me. Especially for a game that feels like I'll have an awesome experience but doesn't deliver as soon as I jump in Tl;dr ::: the game is enjoyable when it feels like an even fight. Not knowing who might take you down, planning your moves, and watching as their canopy explodes as their pilot ejects, feels satisfying. I would prefer if their mech blows up into oblivion. But when you have to deal with a leveling system that feels way to slow and unencouraging if you grind and enjoy the experience, a map layout that caters to one side of the map, a matchmaking (or mechanic system) that just leaves you with loss after loss;; you end up turning off your phone, wondering whether or not if you'll ever go back to play it again."

Now all weapons are available without that, yet still pose a nice grind to get them. My only problem is that if you mess up your robots, you keep fighting powerful people.

No need to back up to another accou t because it's fun at every level. But now this time around I'm finding things becoming ever more frustrating. It seems like weekly the upgrade times are lengthened. The cost of weapons seemingly increases overnight. Now the keys for chests are increasingly more difficult to obtain. It just seems as though there are far too many options that are being used to acquire items. I say simplify things as they used to be and leave it alone. Stop changing things that make it increasingly difficult to ""catch up"" to more veteran players."

Recently however it is very much weighted towards the pay to play model. Think squads of overpowered flying bots that you can't lock onto or even get near when they are on the ground. Also, just when you think you have got nicely powered up then some newer, better weapons come along and you are back to square one. For a time killing app it is ok, but if you really want to progress you're going to have to stump up some serious moolah."

If you have any desire to win then it's going to cost you some major 💰 out of your pockets. Or plan on this game becoming a full-time job. It takes weeks for certain items. This is not an over exaggeration people. This has to be the worst grinding game I've ever played. Once you spend all that time and silver in your workshop to finally get a weapon. You would expect to now be able to purchase that weapon, NOPE! You now need 10,000 MORE COMPONENTS again. I can't imagine paying 34.99 for a single robot and some gold. Those prices are just ridiculous and disrespectful."

Yes, this game takes effort, but is worth much more than the effort you give. If you are just a beginner and are trying to buy an Ares or a Mercury, sorry but its not that easy to just reach the top. However, it would be better if it was easier to earn silver, because then we would actually have more options. We have to wait for a long time to buy something, and if you do not know the game good enough or havent been playing it for long, you might actually be wasting your time. As this is a game which is not only about having the best things but doing the correct modifications, and as ""good"" modifications can be only known through experience, it is hard to try things out when it takes this much of time. But do also consider that your gamestyle and tactics are what makes you win at the end of he day. Thank you for making such a wonderful game, Pixonic, and I hope you improve even further by looking at the players' comments."

My main problem with the game is the total lag occurs during matches. Maybe it's just my phone, but frame rate drops make it almost unplayable. Another issue I have is that has become more ""pay to win"" as it were. Really good stuff requires either tediously using puzzle pieces or just outright buying bundles for upwards of $30 or occasionally more. And because of this, it's almost impossible to do well in a match. Even using gold (yeah that game app trope of a rare resource), it's nearly impossible to keep weapons and mechs leveled up with who you have to face. It's a really neat idea for a game, but things really need to be balanced."

It has the design and concept to be something great, as you level up, you get different bots with abilities, different weapons and sizes for different playstyles. But they're all hidden behind a massive grind wall. I've put maybe 20-30 hours into my account and the only weapons I can use are gatling guns and rocket launchers, I bought a bot called Vityaz with a heavy weapons slot, but I didn't find out that it was a shotgun until after I bought it, the description of what the gun did was very vague. And because the bot is so slow, anything that can outmaneuver it slightly has the upperhand. The combat is kind of slow in the start, everyone has the same 1 or 2 bots, which is to be expected. However, there are a few different kinds of ""currency"" to spend, one of which that I think is ridiculous is 'components'. You have to get 10,000 of them to actually get the bot or weapon. And it's only the good weapons and bits of course, you do have a factory of sorts that can produce them for you... At 100 components a cycle. They also cost Silver to purchase a cycle, and the lowest cycle for a bit named ""Doc"" is 2.5 hours iirc. You could spend real money to buy components. But the conversion rate is so steep. For a light bot like mender it costs 62.99 to buy all of the components to make it. I don't have to remind the Devs that this is a mobile game right? This game isn't for me, but if you have a lot of time to kill, and don't mind the grind for an eventually better Bot or weapon that you have to further poor money and time into upgrading just to match everyone elses level, this is the game for you."

Beautiful graphics capture the chaos of battle unlike any other game I've seen, but a lack of cross platform play means I can't share it with my friends on iOS. There is an incredibly wide variety of robots and weapons, but progress on unlocking them is so slow or so expensive that advancing in the game is stagnant. I'm not opposed to dropping a few bucks here or there on a great game like this, but asking $100 for a single robot or $75 for a single weapon is downright absurd and turns new players away the moment they see it. Unlocking things for free means playing extensively and still waiting 5 weeks for the components to complete, and that's if you're far enough to have leveled up your workshop to handle larger orders. I'm not opposed to throwing money into a game I enjoy, especially one like this. However, when I have to take out a small loan just to shave some time off the production clock I'll leave my wallet in my back pocket."

If you check the game's facebook page, you can read about what has been done to players. At one point this game offered a moderate amount of entertainment for the time invested it playing. However, over the last 6 months the rewards one would receive for their effort have been removed, and many of the issues players have are worse than ever. Here are some of the issues. The cash price for many of the in-game purchases get up to $99.99 for just 1 robot. On top of that, if it is a robot or weapon you buy, it will literally require months of real time to ""upgrade"" the level of your purchase to a point where it is effective in combat, or you will need to spend as much or more to ""speed up"" its upgrade. Rewards are now few and far between, and the effort required to obtain them have raise exponentially, and after the latest update you get even less for your effort. The system used to determine random prizes for the games of chance in the game give very small prizes. The only way a player will receive a higher tier prize will be to spend real money and play a couple hundred times. Connection with the game is also an issue. Even if you are connected to thru WiFi with an exceptional signal strength; you will have connection issues. For me the game has lost its appeal. Too much effort with extremely little reward."

When your team's top 3 damage dealers do more damage than the top damage dealer on the other team, something is wrong. When your top damage dealer does 900k damage and the other team's top damage dealer does 250k, there's a huge imbalance that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the time it takes to craft and upgrade is insane: 2 days to upgrade a weapon from level 6 to level 7 (and level 12 is the max) The prices to buy weapons and robots that are ""on sale"" are outrageous: $60 for a weapon when a robot needs anywhere from 2 to 4!? Judging from the leaderboards, there are definitely whales who have paid literally 10s of thousands dollars on this game, but most players aren't going to. It's a fun game, but certainly not that fun."

The game itself is good, but the matchmaking system is pure garbage. Battles become very unbalanced later on in the game. It seems like developers designed matchmaking for buyers to have their ego boost or something. I actually considered buying too, but I like fun battles not 2 minutes massacres. If teams in battles would be even, or at least close to same power then this would be a fun game for everyone. This way it gradually becomes boring. Another problem is that you can upgrade one weapon or robot only and once that's done only then you can upgrade something else. This is a huge blow. Anyway, it was fun, but I don't like unfair games, so all the best. My journey in War Robots ends after 4 days.

When most of the individual items (one complete robot, one complete weapon) are an in game currency equivalent to 100 dollars, it's beyond absurd. And about the in game currencies, this game has 4 (that I can remember). Gold, silver, parts, and keys. All of which can be bought for real money. Like I said, absurd. Also, it's a minor gripe, but this game doesnt even have the one feature that would set it apart: controller support."

And best of all unlike most mobile games, any ads you see would have to be you forcing them. So you don't need to pay to remove them.

I hopped on late so I was already under powered to play effectively. Recently I had built up better robots to suit my playing style and even liked the new workshop update. But it seems like the new updates are just making it harder and harder for new, or newish, players to really enjoy this game. The workshop times have just shot thru the roof to where I'm really not interested in playing anymore because of how long things take now. I have put money in this game and its the main reason I just don't quit completely. But these new updates you've guys introduced within the last month have not always been in your players best interest, especially the new ones. I don't even know if it appeals to the older players either. Please fix this game it has such great potential, I love playing it and playing with friends that I've started a clan with."

And even though I had issues with lagging and how it was obviously rigged so that you only won silver when exchanging keys, it quickly became my favorite game.

Also I regularly have a issue with my movement control getting locked and causes my bots to keep walking in the same direction,and even after losing a bot the problem carries over to the next bot,which as you would be right in thinking, you don't last long on the battlefield without any directional control, I'm playing on a tablet wether this has any relationship to the problem,interested to know if this is a common problem?

With that being said pixonic is ripping players off with ridiculous updates encouraging us to spend more money. The only real way to get gold in the game is to buy it. Getting silver either requires lots of your time or a paid subscription that cuts that time in half. Upgrading your robots and weapons takes a ridiculous amount of time and they're only increasing upgrade time and costs as time goes on. The makers of this game are very greedy and are ruining this free game by basically making it pay to win. I've noticed this more and more as I progressed and I've had enough.

Unfortunately it's working and they are just trying to milk the players of ever cent they have until the game dies and the dev. Team leaves with an early retirement. They only care about ""Data"" basically how much income they are getting. Not the players. They keep up a good illusion that they do. The game is not a realistic mech game like one would think, rather a game where there are buffs, debuffs, paid boosters, ect. You get spamed with ""Offers"" showing bots that cost $50 to up to $300. Then you get into a game and get over powered by someone else they made a system suck all the money out of you to be able to have fun. Don't fall for this game. There are way better mech games in development."

6228,Jonathan Fleming,"January 7, 2020",4," I enjoy the game on a regular basis. I love how the robot and weapon customization gives me something to work toward in the game. However, I do believe that this game focuses a little bit too much on a ""pay to win"" play style."
6229,Josh Belemjian,"January 9, 2020",2, It isn't a horrible game but the gameplay itself is very slow. It takes a long time to upgrade to robots and the matches themselves take a long time to win. Again I say it's not horrible but the game needs to be improved.

I've been waiting for that since they released the awesome death match and the equally horrible king of the hill. I was loving the new workshop. It was like they finally were making a game that respected its players! I was so happy with the new game that I actually finally paid for premium. And just like that the greed of pixonic reared its head yet again. They're releasing another update that is going to make this game again unbalanced for the players. 5 days for 400 workshop components? For old robots and weapons at that? Sorry but that's ridiculous. I feel like I wasted my money on premium as I will likely uninstall this game yet again. You guys really need to stop putting your greed before your players. You had actually finally made a great game worth paying for!

Everything else needs a lot of time to create (up to 2-3 days for 1%, resulting in about a month in time to create any new bot or weapons).

The latest update changed the workshop creation process for one of the mechs from 1 hour 5 minutes for 1% to 2 days plus for 1%. I uninstalled the game the following day. In my opinion, when the game tries to waste your time, you should move on to playing something else. That's why I gave it one star. Otherwise, this game is probably 3-4 stars."

6264,Miguel Flores,"November 19, 2019",5, very good game the only problem is that that you must buy a lot of gold to get good weapons it would be nice if they fixed that but otherwise this is game is awsome has good gameplay and is very fun and the robots look very good you will suck at the but it gets easier.

As I was finally able to actually work toward some of these ridiculous new weapons and robots. When this stupid component system came out it pissed off a lot of people. They recently allowed you to create up to 400 components at a decent rate with a fair price and wait time by using the workshop. Now they've tweaked the workshop so that you wait 3 days and pay the same amount of silver for only 100 components. Not even to mention they raised the upgrade time on weapons and robots to a ridiculous rate. I am finished with this game. I have uninstalled and will never pick up this greedy Russian trash again. All proceeds for this game go to the Kremlin and keeping Trump in office.

The controls are extremly simple and the graphics are great. I only have three problems with this game. One is that the time for upgrades is way too long. If you could make it so that you can upgrade 3 to 4 things at a time, that would be great. Two, I really don't think that it's fair to buy weapons/robots with actual money. It really makes the whole game pointless for those who actually put hard work and dedication into the game. Third, the wait time for pieces needed to make weapons/robots is far too long. It's took me at least a month to get the magnum gun which is a ridiculous amount of time to get the parts for ANY robot/weapon."

That is not something a 13 year old like me can afford. Watching 30 sec ads is enough for me. New workshop i have to wait like 3 days for a zeus. You can start by not being able to buy robots with cash. Make 1000 pieces 10 dollars or more. That way less people would want to buy it. If someone does, hey, you get that profit, but at least not everyone would be having like orkans in every robot. But its still a okish game to play.

However, the developers are (very quickly) taking every freebie away, making paying very high prices the only viable way to improve your robots. Their newest robots are £93.99 each. To improve a robot from level 7 to 8 takes 11m silver (equates to £19.49) and takes 5 days. From 9 to 10 is 36m! So the great gameplay is undone because you are constantly outgunned by the people willing to spend fortunes. But the WORST thing is the arrogance of the developers - they make regular changes to the game which are detrimental to non/modest-paying players and then completely ignore the feedback. I wouldn't recommend this game at all. You may like it initially, but It's downhill from there."

6320,Francisco Pedro,"February 11, 2020",4, This is a awsome game the problem is that it is not cross platform what i mean about it is that ios and android can't play together so i give it a 4 star
6321,Arneal Laloo,"November 4, 2019",2," War robots was a great game long time ago, but now its very unfair, there are other players that are in champion league fighting you while you're in sliver league, the game is very unbalanced."
6322,JUNIOR. ANIMATES,"January 18, 2020",5," this is a well put together 6v6 game,with simple controls and great action.it definetly is one of the if not is the best robot action game with great experience all the way.(even tho it doesnt coperate on the laptop i use)#warrobots."
6323,Adrian Heath,"January 27, 2020",1, Used to be amazing. Pay to play. The lag is dreadful. And there's no chance for people who earn Thier weapons and robots to play against the pay to play players. It's fixed bs. Officially uninstalled.

6325,Brandon Evers,"November 22, 2019",1," Hilariously quick. Installed, jumped into the action and it tutorialized my experience with M&K controls... Not only was there no bluetooth accessories applied, there's no in-game option to switch to mobile controls. Unplayable."

6329,Greenmenace Gaming and Sports,"January 25, 2020",2, When the update came out and changed the currency to get the shield robot it got rid of min and didnt give m anything for the physical shield and energy shield robots. So I would like to have my robots back or have a refund in one of the currency's that or in the game
6330,Grant Green,"January 25, 2020",3," The gameplay in genral is great but the pay to play is terrible. Unless you pay a 100 dollars or more, you are never gonna get good at the game and if you don't pay it takes months to get a good bot."

It can get a way too pricy for my tastes with the whole in game purchasing (pay to win) system because everything is $4.99 and up (everything worth buying is $29.99 and up). My only real request and complaint is I wish there was a controller mapping option in the settings so it'd be easier to use gamepads either Bluetooth or like the one I have for my Moto Z2 Force phone. Beyond that the game is fun solid and has decent graphics for a mobile game, it's one of the few mech games I've played that wasn't a complete disappointment."

The people who paid money had a small advantage, but still competitive, so it was fun. The past year, it has gotten really bad. New better robots every 2-3 weeks. Playing against new max robots, our team get dominated. They made upgrading robots more expensive and longer time frame. I been playing 2 years and I still havent gotten a max level robot or a max level weapon yet."

Not to mention boosters that actually affect your gameplay, like health boosters and weapon cooldown boosters, which you can randomly receive from lootboxes or by paying with the premium currency. The upgrade system would be another downside, but I'm not entirely sure if there's a ranking system in place to make sure new players don't get stomped on by older players with upgraded weapons and mechs; assuming that there is no such system, that would just be terrible game design."

After the last update, gear I bought was stripped of the upgrades and where converted to pay to play gear. Matches against someone that has spent $$$$ on gear is one sided and over quickly even against a great player. If you don't buy gear then change your game play to back support or duck and hide. That gets old fast. To get gear without paying takes 3-5 months. A single level up can take 4 days or more"

Rounds are quick at 10 minutes, 3rd person view 3d shooter with quick thinking and strategy, knowing your robot's and weapon abilities, knowing what the enemy robot in front of you can do. Being aware of your surroundings and knowing if you're in a disadvantage and should retreat or press on the attack All while being a free game. The other side of the coin of the game being free is that almost everything cost time and silver (free money that you get by playing battles), getting slots for additional robots, upgrading robot's speed and health, upgrading or buying weapons all cost silver. You can of course speed everything up by using real money but it is not necessary. The only tip I would give is too consider buying a 30 or 10 days vip which is cheap and gives you more silver per battle (%50) if you know you're going to play a lot since I found that I get more silver with vip to be able to do lots of stuff i wasn't able to do before. Before buying vip I had to play lots of games and really plan what to do with the silver, buying vip really took the pressure off of that and for the single time I bought it after years of playing the game I think it's a good spending of money."

I quit the game (around when Raven came out) due to feeling frustrated over how Pay to Win the game was becoming and being matched up consistently with people having much better gear and mechs than I did. I came back to it being slightly more balanced which is great. But by God the game has become completely pay to win now. Doing 465000+ damage only yielded 178000+ silver (On a Win mind you) when it used to be at least double that. The rewards are not worth the effort. The game needs severe QoL rework if it wants to last in the future. From the very basic, optimization to the economy system. Whilst it saddens me to see the game go down this route, I severely hope that the 'game' improves as a game overall that can be enjoyable and rewarding enough to continue playing and not be a cancer within the game development industry like what EA, 2k or Take-2 have become (I know two are publishers, but you understand my point). Final words are: Do not comeback or play this game if you wish to not spend days to even months to fully upgrade a weapon/mech or get a new good mech. Unless you're willing to cough up some money."
