It worked great for about a week before it kept crashing within a few actions! It wouldn't even save my work. It seems to be a big problem others have mentioned often. It needs fixing and fixing soon or else im not the only who might be leaving. Edit: 4/16/20 will no longer be using the app. It crashes too often and has progressed to corrupting my files completely, unusable. Im using an android device."

It has excellent ability to customize your brushes to an excellent point. Although I have the full version now, previously I could not load the community for extra brushes and textures. The selection tool can be confusing at first but as with all programs you'll have to get used to it. I do really recommend buying the full version, it's worth it, and this is a wonderful program for Android!"

Usually it's very reliable & even if I forget to save a project my progress wouldn't disappear when revisiting the app later on. Now saved projects are becoming corrupted. I was working on one and I saved several times at different points, but the app crashed and I lost over 20 minutes of progress — progress that I had saved seconds before the crash. Loved the app, but needs improvements."

It was totally worth it. Plus you dont have to buy the whole thing to draw. You can just draw without layers and fancy stuff. You do get a free trial to try the whole version. If you're looking for a free drawing app that is amazing this one is it. You can still draw on it without buying the whole app.

I know for a good app it has to make money but locking layers? That's low, ibis paint X is a great and actually free app, it has ads you can use to unlock special brushes, I really dont want to delete this app because some of my best pieces are on here."

If this app actually worked, I would never let go of my tablet. Everything is customizable and detailed and beautiful... However, the app often crashes when I merge layers or hit the undo button. Spare yourself the heartache. Tons of people have reported the same issue online... I should have listened to them."

I look forward to future work."

12,Annabella Kue,"April 9, 2020",3, This app is great. I love all the tools it has access to. Its's also got a fair price after the trial for all the features it offers. I would have given it a high rating but the app randomly crashes on me. While I don't lose my work it gets frustrating when it keeps happening over and over again.

One of the biggest issues is the various bugs. Layers will become invisible, it may delete random layers,sometimes crashes. Another thing is when it comes to art that involes text its really hard seeing as theres theres no text tool. But over all a great app and would recomend if your looking for a cheaper way to get into digital illustrating!"

And there isn't the thing where you draw something and it's on both side of the paper so you have to do one eye at a time for example. So it the eyes look wacky and not straight and the line also look wacky. If I were you I wouldn't get this game.

21,Amanda H.,"April 24, 2020",3," Fantastic UI and tools, but just days after paying for it, I can barely use it. It crashes constantly. Would be a 5 star app if I could actually use it. (1 star now) Update: Clearing the cache regularly helps the crashing issue, but it is still a hassle."

But this app started crashing regularly. I send an email to the support and didn't even get a response. So much wasted potential"
24,Michelle Mohammed-Lutchman,"April 26, 2020",4," The app is great so far, and is one of the better art apps on this platform, but it needs more stability, and more so, a better UI for landscape mode.

They should just say that! I now have half-finished drawings that I can't finish unless I buy everything!! Also it's glitchy as heck! The app frequently crashes and closes at random intervals so you need to save your work every 15 mins if you don't want to lose what you've been doing. Now my version won't import ANY images. It was fine a week ago, now I can't import anything. I even tried importing an image I'd already used as a new project to test but the app just closes itself! BELIEVE THE REVIEWS THAT HIGHLIGHT THE FLAWS. THIS IS A VERY BROKEN APP AND YOU WILL LOSE WORK! It has potential but not before they fix a LOT of the issues. Time to try something else! Also, the help forums don't seem to be moderated and you just get insulted and sworn at when asking for basic help information (possibly by their staff?). Very unprofessional and very off-putting. They have a lot of work to do before I would consider paying them a penny."

That's ridiculous for a drawing app and really affects the usability. It doesn't track the note 10 stylus until you touch the display so its hard to be precise even with the guides.

Better remember to save your work every 5 minutes if you want to keep it - and then still pray that it's actually going to be there when you come back.

When creating a straight line, selecting a new colour will sometimes turn the line that colour, choosing erase will erase the line etc- clicking outside of the line will enable you to keep going without affecting the line, but it always creates a mark on the canvas, which then takes 3 double-taps to finally erase."

Yes, it occasionally but rarely crashes and comes back up with previous layers showing (which usually just need to be deleted). But worth it for the control and capabilities.

As someone addicted to Krita on PC, this comes as a close analog on Android. With a Note 10+ and some time, I can manage complex 10-20 layer paintings on 600 ppi papers like A4. I usually go through a hundred layers or so and merge, but the interface could allow it flat. Layer blending is great! But inking with curve guides? It would be nice to save guides to make edits to lines later, or clone a stroke elsewhere. Everything can work if you're creative, though."

62,Erin Nehez,"April 12, 2020",4, I like that you can adjust the smoothness of the brushes. There are also a lot of brushes to choose from. My only problem is that you got to pay for layers and other stuff. But overall it is a good drawing app

79,Cristopher Dominguez Diaz,"March 13, 2020",4," I just feel disappointed that the first thing that you have to do right after the tutorial is to purchase the all the tools and accessories that you gonna need to draw.

84,Diego De la Vega,"February 8, 2020",5," Love the app and all the possibilities it offers you to give life to your own ideas. It has been a whole new experience, at the beginning I was kind of concern about the feeling of the G-pen on the screen but it is just perfect."

I have owned both types of tablets and I easily chose android because of this app. Absolutely perfect. One note though: I assume due to the sheer complexity of it (this app has more tools and techniques than any other) it locks up periodically. It's inconvenient but I have never lost any work because of it. I just restart the app and my work is right where I left it. Bravo to the creators. You have given me a gift!

Like the ability to customize what tool shortcuts are pinned to the screen, that's great! There's very little lag and everything feels really smooth and I love all the gestures.

That paired with the support for different definitions makes this program a powerful asset for any creative workflow, and the 7€ I payed for the full version (that they let you try out for a week) is nowhere near the license price for Adobe Photoshop. CONS: Keep in mind this is not a copy of Photoshop, there are some features exclusive to Adobe's counterpart. But unless you are into advanced manipulation of an existing image, this app is all you need.

Also, the addition of texture and other effects has been a welcome surprise. But why oh why have you reduced the precision of 'liquify'? Now, no matter how small you choose it's size, it still ends up moving a huge area around. If you could revert it back to its old glorious setting and accuracy, I'd have no qualms in giving your app 5 stars."

You just have to be willing to meddle with all the settings and create your own brushes if you're not satisfied with the brush set it comes with, but once you do- 👌👌👌 As someone who had used procreate and apple pen on iPad pro, this is easily comparable, and is much better priced (almost half the price of procreate.) If you really want a good, comprehensive drawing app for your android device but you can't buy procreate, get this. I've used many android drawing apps, from medibang to Adobe photoshop to Autodesk sketchbook, and I would say this is the best one for a painterly style, sketching, doodling, painting, etc (for drawing manga this will do well, but medibang is better.) The controls are also very convenient (double finger tap to undo, etc.) Tdlr: GREAT DRAWING APP, BE WILLING TO CUSTOMIZE BRUSHES AND PLAY WITH SETTINGS TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT.

There is also no way save other than keeping to ""overwrite"" the current project you are working on, if you want to keep saving to make sure your work isn't lost during one of those crashes. This could easily replace my use of CSP by a lot IF they fixed the issues sooner than later. It would also be great if you could download other brushes, objects etc. like CSP offers for free which are made my CSP and other users.

It's a better mini photoshop (in regards to drawing) than the actual mini photoshop. But it's very buggy. If I use the transform tool, 50% of the time if I try to use the undo tool afterwards, it erases half the drawing at replaces the part I transformed into a grey blob. Now the transform tool barely works at all. It just makes what you transform disappear while you try to resize it. Also has an annoying habit of adding weird layers when you close it and open it later. This happens less often, but its frustrating to open a drawing thinking the app destroyed it, only to find it added two or so nonsense layers by itself. I hope you all fix these bugs, especially since it looks like there will never be a procreate for android."

The bad downside is one, the smudge tool doesn't smudge but just replicate a calculated brush stroke/spot as it doesn't blur the strokes. Oversmudging does not result in a smudgy, aka smooth, gradient blurring, of the art but a mess of circles of varying values. Adding on to that is that the app is having trouble calculating values when smudging as oversmudging also yields very uneven pixels of varying contrast and values. Not making an accurate irl smudging. And the BIGGEST downside is that it has trouble coping with overtime use and large/complicated projects as bugs begin to occur. Black patches, pixel shifting, selection area dislocation, layer shifting/replicating/deletion occurs, especially during undo/redo. If you wish to close the app, be sure to save before that and properly closing the project by opening/creating a project. If not, resuming the autosaved/autoopened project may result in bugs such as layer deletion, replication, and layer orientation shifts."

The interface layout is genius and very space-efficient on small phone screens. Some of the deeper menu options are a little unintuitive to navigate, but efficient once you get the hang of it. I really like the one-touch access to your eraser and pen-tools - this is great when using a passive stylus on a mobile phone. The app has all the features you need to draw - it has robust selection and transformation tools and it seems to handle relatively large canvases (6000x5000) with no issues. The brush tools offer a ton of customization - on par with PhotoShop, and they just seem to keep adding more. There is very little missing - it's the complete package and at the price, nothing else even comes close.  BUT! The one major issue I've had with this app is stability! Patches come out often, but each one seems to bring new, severe bugs. Crashes and work-loss are pretty common so SAVE AND BACKUP OFTEN! Still recommend over any other Android drawing app."

I used the 7 days of trial and was convinced to buy all its options at its end. I'm now using it exclusively for drawing, and even editing photos.   Its functionalities are amazing for smartphone app, and so intuitive! I'm using it on the two-year-old tablet (Yoga Book Android) that is my drawing device (thanks to its great built-in drawing pad). I also like how it can be personalized with ease. The UI is very good, unobtrusive and can develop into a luxury of details when needed.  My only concern is it sometimes crash in the middle of drawing something. That's annoying but thankfully I've never lost more than the line I was drawing when the problem occurred. It's more the disruption of having to restart the app that is a problem. Sketchbook never crashed on me... but it also had much less tools to offer.   All in all, I'm going to continue working with Infinite Painter because the functionalities it offers are was worth a few troubles.  Still, I wish they could fix those crashes and hopefully the devs will in the next updates."

The only thing that needs improvement is it crashes and doesnt load all of the colors."

Unfortunately, this app crashes way too often for a paid program (you have to pay for most features after 7 days).

Very frustrating at times. App updates are constant though so I know they're working on it. Updated stars from 2 to 3. Suggested features to add: - patterns or materials library - pen stabilizer like ibis paintx - no crashing, no missing layers - clipped layers are buggy - choose DPI for canvas - text option (so obvious but it's not there. Instead they have another app with a text button but this one don't have)"
857,Savannah Mercado,"March 21, 2020",4, Great app. Would have rated 5 if my app could stop crashing constantly.

865,Kristina Cattrell,"May 23, 2019",2, I can't find an undo button anywhere. That should be as visible and available as the pencil. This is where creativity sparks and mistakes are made and minds change. I don't want to erase and redraw everything over. I just want to undo my last 1 or 5 strokes.
866,Brianna Stevenson,"May 22, 2019",3," This app is really great, but I will have to stop using it because it has corrupted several of my works, which is a huge letdown because of how long I spend on them. If this gets fixed, great, but I don't think I'm ever getting those paintings back."

868,Kimothy in a Jar,"August 23, 2019",1," Cant use layers or transform anything after the seven day free trial ends. And there is nothing to indicate that those are the features the trial is for. Basically, this app becomes entirely useless after the first seven days. Dont waste your time."
869,*klin's studio*,"December 24, 2019",2, Its not that bad..... only thing bothering me is the stabilizer is so weak. A stabilizer is like auto correct you're shape and line and the brushes arent so bad ill stick to ibis pain more
870,tacrazzyinterwb tciw,"April 5, 2019",3," overall this is a good drawing app although I wouldn't use it for detailed work that would require multiple layers as it doesn't have a layer adder and it's overly compacted unlike ibspaint, yes it can be used to make better looking work but truly I'd go with ibspaint as it's more simplistic"

Very easy to use and alot of brushes available. Nothing is perfect so for the cons. Saving and exporting menus need to be streamlined a bit. Bugs need to he fixed only able to undo 2 times when working on very small pixel canvas <72x72px. Also when resizing small canvas it user requires to resize 2 times because first time it always adds 1px after resize. Great app overall!"
872,Zak,"March 10, 2019",4," its a really good app, but it bugs. after two days using it it started getting slower. it autocorrects most of my lines (often ruining them) which i dont think it did. also the fast colour drop shortcut has been replaced with a drawing shortcut which i dont get. fix these issues and it's 5 stars"
873,Maggie,"September 14, 2018",4, I love this app it's super easy to use and its ALMOST perfect. I mostly used two brushes and the layer setting to draw but once my free trial ran out I couldn't use the layers anymore. I understand that you need to make money but could you at least make the layer setting free??

You can't undo conveniently while you have the liquify tool active.

883,Smile to Life,"April 3, 2019",5," This app has everything you can think of about art! There is too many to even write. This is great for professionals. I am new at art app. This means that I had a difficult time figure out the functions of the app. However, I did try all the figures and had fun drawing."
884,Jason Harris,"February 28, 2019",5, By far the Best paint/drawing app. I've ever used. I'm definitely going to purchase the entire app. The one week free deal is what made me want to buy the full edition app. I highly recommend this app if you are into drawing and painting on your phone or tablet.
885,Alexx,"June 18, 2019",4," I love it! The only problem is that it needs a different blending tool. I wasn't really a big fan off the one that's there. All it seemes to do is just smudge it around. If a new one is added, then I'll for sure give it 5 stars."
886,Daytona McClenahan,"March 31, 2019",3," it's a very good app for drawing, but once you try to export the image or save it to your device the quality of the image drops so low its not even worth it. if this would be fixed it would be an almost perfect app."

892,Cryeon,"January 10, 2019",3," i like how it looks, many brushes. Although it's not complete, I still ise other apps like autodesk because there are brushes there that this app hasnt. My only problem is I can see so many pixels on every line. which I thinky drawing may looks low quality"

898,Night Fish,"March 8, 2019",5," it's an easy to use app, especially if your a traditional artist wanting to get into digital art, but not willing to fork out hundreds. the 8 dollars that it takes to get the full version is worth it. so if you want practical this pretty good."

947,Michael Stippich,"March 7, 2019",3," Love the app, just kills the battery on my pixelbook. But otherwise I have really enjoyed using this and starting to get a better understanding of how it all works."
948,Chandra Perkins,"December 13, 2018",5, I really like the many features. There's a wide range of painting styles to play with. Being a beginner its great because there's lots of options for experiment. I can see how this app can work for more advanced projects too once I get there
949,Mae Pardo,"October 8, 2018",4," The app is great and the free tools work well. Although some features are only available after purchasing, they are well worth it if you want to get into more professional digital art. It's a great stepping stone."
950,Elijah Tiedemann,"February 16, 2019",4," Good. However, there appears to be a bug with the recent updates. Pixel size doesn't properly reflect the resize circle thing. If I put a brush at 300 pixels it seems to only paint 150 or 200 pixels."
951,drew felner,"May 17, 2019",4, drawing app better than Sketchbook has all the features works great with stylus support and you can lock the painting to the stylus and move things with your fingers loads of brushes etc I got paid version the only problem is saving your work I lost a picture I was working on a little confusing abou...Full Reviewdrawing app better than Sketchbook has all the features works great with stylus support and you can lock the painting to the stylus and move things with your fingers loads of brushes etc I got paid version the only problem is saving your work I lost a picture I was working on a little confusing about the saving nice if it was simpler
952,turtlesnore,"June 13, 2019",4," its a pretty good app for the tablet compared to the other android apps. the only really annoying thing is that you cant really undo functions, e.g., as im drawing, my hand would tap on random stuff i dont know but i cant undo it with the reverse arrow so my project is just stuck 😅"
953,julianto triwijaya,"July 4, 2019",5," you may want to fix the lag/crashing issue, this happens ehen the art you made are bigger than your phone's screen size, when it crash you lose your progress on some layer/some layer become blank and you have to start over."
954,Nick Tipton,"October 8, 2019",3," Even on the i7 16gb ram Pixelbook, I'm having stuttering performance since the last release. Record functionality is all but useless, with no way to modify timing, manage the saved videos, or do any after the fact editing. Please update this file management system to be a bit more usable."
955,Azalea,"July 11, 2019",5, Literally the best drawing app for mobile. I bought the full app after using it for a day. It's amazing with the note 9 as it has a setting to turn off non - stylus touches. The community brushes are great too.
956,David Ortega,"July 18, 2019",4, its a great app for on the go when you got nothing to do. its great for anyone who is interested of doing digital art on the phone or tablet! did run into a little bit of bugs but its a good app!
957,Joannah Migriño,"August 13, 2019",3," it keeps on crashing, it also slows down the device. I hope you improve this part. Also the brush keeps changing on their own. When I use a bucket tool it doesnt color the selected area well."
958,Dan North,"January 20, 2020",2," Is a great app, but recently I try to draw something nothing is displayed please fix."
959,Nyleve Nyghtngale,"October 13, 2019",1," This is not good. It gives you 7 days of unlimited access, and then just becomes a train wreck. If you're looking for something free and easy to use, do not pick this! After the trial it pretty much just started crashing and I was unable to save my work. One star."
960,EJL BLOB,"October 16, 2019",5, Love this app! Has all the tools and brushes you could ask for on mobile. It's also very easy to use and keeps the interface out of the way. I'd say it's the best drawing app on android! Definitely would recommend!
961,Cinder Bug,"October 20, 2019",4," I really like that you can favorite brushes and add refference photos, however I don't like that the brushes are pixelated. Maybe its just the Manga Inker brush but its still annoying and I wish I could get a smooth look instead of pixelated. Over all, pixelated brush aside its a great app to use!"
962,Zoe Winton,"November 2, 2019",5," I love this app. It cost A LOT of money to buy all of these paints, and markers, and pencils, and everything you need to paint a single painting, on this app, it's all free and if you want it in REAL life all you have to do is print it out. This app is the best"
963,BrazyAF,"November 7, 2019",2, You guys can be left behind from what the free drawing apps did. No layer for free user is bad. Layer make me feel comfortable when drawing
964,Philip Fong,"November 18, 2019",3," I need smudge tool or a brush without color to blend, without this feature, I cannot achieve professional result."
965,RoX,"April 20, 2020",2, Why we need to purchase such tools which we get on other painter apps.
966,Lauren Ann Moreno,"April 7, 2019",5," I've been trying to look for a good drawing app and when this popped up, I was so happy I found it! Its an easy enough app to use for drawing, and the brushes are fantastic!"
967,Je T'aime,"May 22, 2019",3," I really thought it would be free COMPLETELY, i guess i didnt read something to tell me i had to pay for almost everything. I Can't Even use/make other layers to actually draw. I would've giving at least 4 but I'm disapointed now TwT"
968,Dane Wilson,"April 19, 2019",2," The functions of the app are great. Problem is, after a few days, it became impossible to edit individual layers. In fact, I can't even open the layers menu. Instead, it produces a pop-up that says my trial has ended."
969,siri the mage,"April 14, 2019",2," well, i actually like this app but there is a problem. i downloaded this before and i just wanted to draw a character so i installed this again. it was working well but then it started glitching and i have no idea what happened"
970,Kaieus Plume,"October 14, 2018",3," I absolutely love this app, I have the paid version but for a while now I haven't been able to import pictures from my camera, it makes the canvas go black and becomes unworkable unfortunately, otherwise this would be a 5☆"
971,Andrei Dumitrache,"October 1, 2018",1, The app deleted my 20h project when I wanted to create a new one. It also randomly crashed about 6 times one of which resulted in a deleted layer. Excellent and fun app but due to being unreliable i cant recommend.
972,Josh Martin,"December 19, 2018",4," my favorite art program, my only real critism is that it does not link the saved products to a cloud even tho i have provieded a linked email, if there is i cant seem to find it even when trying to google the information and i just get the run around."
973,Troll Network,"June 6, 2019",5, its amazing qnf i love it and its amazing you litsen to music on other app and draw on it wall litsening to music at the same time and post it on eny posting app and share with your friend and cant wait in till the new up date so it can be more artic and more amaze so yeah coooooooooooool love itttt...Full Reviewits amazing qnf i love it and its amazing you litsen to music on other app and draw on it wall litsening to music at the same time and post it on eny posting app and share with your friend and cant wait in till the new up date so it can be more artic and more amaze so yeah coooooooooooool love ittttttttttttttftf!!!!!!and have quetion its about time for the new up date so what its going to be canttttt waittttttgfgt so amazzzzzing text it to every one now can i injoy my time tis verey get tired.
974,gabey gamer 909,"June 4, 2019",5, Pretty good game although lags a tiny bit but I'm fine with it love the paint and expecially the spray paint also the control over the pen is amazing and my favourite part is that you can use almost every type of drawing utensil in the world. Awesome game keep it up love your work
975,Boba_ XoX,"July 9, 2019",1," First, it was great! Till we have to pay for almost everything now. I'm disappointed. Of course, they need to find a way to find money. I wouldn't recommend this app unless you can draw without a bucket tool and layers."
976,Savannah Kalasinski,"July 23, 2019",5," This application allows you to combine today's technology and your love for art. I love the fact that you can do anything from a simple doodle to a true painting. This app is the best for everyone, including myself! 👍💯"
977,Shadow of Stars,"January 10, 2020",1, Too laggy and freezes too much. Uninstalled after just 5 days. Don't plan on installing it again.
978,Vernadette F,"March 29, 2020",5, You could uploage image and put a layer
979,Yana Swift,"February 14, 2019",4," it'll be cool if there will be predictive strokes and the undo button wont be below. my palm always accidentally taps it and it's somehow annoying. oh, and an option to place the layers bar on the left side and to edit the quick access"
980,Robert Foster,"March 19, 2019",5," I found it to be very good for scanning my original, old school artwork and digitally enhancing it with this app. At the moment, I am very happy with this app."
981,Qui Que,"April 11, 2019",4, Excellent app. somewhat comparable to corel painter on pc. The ui is simple and easy to use. It could be streamlined a bit more but its a very powerful app that allows for alot of customization.
982,tony,"July 1, 2019",2," Flakey software, great features but prone to crash. A problem with using the navigator will cause the program to crash (only tested on samsung tab s4) this is a persistent bug that will happen every time."
983,Jonah Jeffery,"January 3, 2020",5, Best drawing app I've used yet!
984,Rohit Malla,"March 8, 2020",5, Sooo cool and easy to use
985,adam hurford,"November 10, 2018",5," My go to application for all my digital art. The only other thing I'd love to make it perfect is typography and fonts, but that's a whole other art form. Thank you for this incredible application."
986,A Google user,"November 19, 2018",5," Amazing for art and stuff, and I love seeing other people's art. The only thing I would improve is that it would be nice to comment on people's art, but I see why not too."
987,Jose Carrasquero,"April 2, 2019",3," Would give 5 stars again, and I may just not know how to do it, but even when signed in I can't see or import my old pictures I had saved when signed in on another device. I hope it's a feature but if not, it should be added."
988,D. L.,"November 10, 2018",1, Brush sizes are changing on different parts of the screen and are not consistent at all. Tested other drawing apps and they worked just fine in comparison with pressure sensitivity and brush sizes.
989,Peter Selkin,"June 1, 2019",5," I've used a few painting apps, but I keep coming back to this one. Easy to use, a good assortment of realistic brushes, and enough editing tools to do what I need."
990,Bradley Williams,"June 5, 2019",2," I initially loved this app. However, after the last 2 paintings I saved were completely erased when I went back to work on them. I can't give it a high rating unless this very unnerving bug is fixed."
991,Fitria Yuwono,"August 24, 2019",2," So far so good, but somehow all my downloaded brushes that has custom shapes as the head were cut. I wonder why that is. Edit: And per the latest update, even some of the default brushes didn't show up and/or cut. Seriously?"
992,Dori Pabón,"June 13, 2019",5, I really love this app. I let go of art a couple of years ago (I lost my whole portfolio and it made me just let go of art completely) and this app made me come back to what I love doing
993,shawna,"June 20, 2019",5, Definitely One of the best drawing apps on the market! I love all of the different tools that are available too be as creative as you want to be! Definitely worth downloading! 🤩👍🏼
994,trixie,"October 3, 2019",4," The app is great, it is amaxing the brushes are dope! But it's a little stupid that after some time you have to pay to use layers and some other gadgets in the app.. 4star, but would love to have that fixed😉💖"
995,Justin Martinez,"October 17, 2019",4, it's been very responsive with my device Galaxy s10+. the options are so expansive I was surprised on how well it works overall. very happy with the app would recommend for anyone looking to draw on a tablet/phone.
996,Hunter Finley,"February 3, 2020",5," I've had this app for years now, I fell in love with it the second I started using it! Try it out, I'm sure you'll love it too!"
997,Derpy Plateosaurus,"April 24, 2020",5," Brilliant, it's like photoshop on mobile"
998,Ahmed Mahmoud Salah,"April 26, 2020",5, The best Application for drawing and painting ❤ AMAZING
999,Tonin Neri,"May 1, 2019",4," Good app, but for large images the in android it suffers, pixels blur when zoomed. I think some functions should be copied from procreate or sketchbook, like the one to change brush sizes. Best guidelines for drawing on the market. Good brushes too."
1000,Col,"January 21, 2019",2," Slow but that wasn't my main problem, when I started painting it decided to start using random shapes for no reason and trying to use the color blender marker ended up erasing my paint layers and crashing the app. I'll just stick to real world painting"
1001,Danilo Lalovic,"January 23, 2019",5," very similar to pc photoshop, has great brushes and good customization (even pressure curves). it has built in perspective grids and has a finger-touch color picker, which were the selling points for me"
1002,Nat Muglia,"January 22, 2019",4," Would rate 5 because it's wonderful having all the good tools; but rated 4 because it's crashed many times and needs a better steady brush, like the one in the artflow app perhaps; that is all. This app comes in handy a lot, a decent tool."
1003,Shaq. Just Shaq.,"March 18, 2019",5," This app has been pretty good to me. While I can't call it the best or most intuitive, it serves my needs and has been steadily helping me improve my art."
1004,james hamato,"February 3, 2019",3," i really like this app but i use lenovo yoga book and this app within minutes of use heat it up fast ,causes crashes,lost work so i rarly use it but wish i could for longer periods. i like the updates to the app and hope it gets fixed or something"
1005,Ubachukwu,"September 7, 2019",2," It takes an eternity to save a project at first in this version. Also sometimes when its done, it doesn't save properly and layers disappear when the project is opened again . Please fix this. Thanks."
1006,Haroun S.,"November 27, 2019",2, The app stopped working... it's an amazing app but has lots of bugs and crashes...
1007,F fan show shit,"July 23, 2019",4," Well designed, easy to use, many functions and features, better than most on the market. Only 4 stars because it can lag at times but overall amazing quality app"
1008,PongLizard,"September 24, 2019",3, I'll change my review when the app stops crashing every 3 minutes. I used to never have this issue. But it's been a continuing issue for the last few months. I've sent in error reports and I've not seen any further improvements.
1009,mr conservative,"January 12, 2020",1, You have to pay $5.99 for it to be a decent app
1010,Jacqueline Larson,"January 22, 2019",5," Beyond even what a wacom tablet gave me, this app is great for digital artists that want their art to be as simple as drawing on a sheet of paper...with layers and effects added."
1011,Jacqueline Rilloraza,"May 11, 2019",5," great drawing app!! one of the few apps that take advantage of Samsung's spen tilt functionality. Brushes feel super resposive, and has great brush settings too. i completely switched over from using medibang"
1012,Happy Escobar,"March 28, 2019",5," Very good app with lots of useful tools. Had to get a new program when my laptop broke and this one was the best out of all i tried. i used to use paint tool sai , and this app is better than that 40$ program."
1013,Meta Xylene,"March 14, 2019",4," Love it very much, the brushes are super realistic, and there's a lot of ways to explore. My only problem is that it heats up my phone very quick."
1014,A Google user,"February 7, 2019",5," Great app, I got the full version, and it's definetly worth it, it has tutorials, a myriad of different brush options and tools to help your art, and you can import photos as a reference, making it easy to digitalize art."
1015,MrBadFox,"July 9, 2019",2," I like the selections of brushes and tools I have, but the bad part about this is that I have to manually change every single brushes' stylus settings of pressure each time I try to use another brush."
1016,AORIX aorix,"July 17, 2019",5," Incredible app,everything is here just as I like it,just imagine it and transfer it to this app,I love it.I don't mind buying it,first app I bought and haven't had any regrets about it."
1017,neethu nath,"September 1, 2019",5," This is one of the best painting app I have used. Great features. Thank you to everyone in the team for maintaining with no bugs. I love this app. I recommend everyone I know, to use this app."

1019,Geoff Brom,"October 6, 2019",3," Great for doodling of all kinds with powerful tool, there is a problem though, Crashing. When it crashes it will also delete the layer that crashed it when you re open the app. REMEMBER TO SAVE A LOT"

1024,Humam Habbab,"April 8, 2019",4, Best drawing and design app for android but unfortunately it's full of bugs I hope they will fix all those bugs so we can enjoy with it. Please developers keep going and make more cool things for us ^_^
1025,Q. Edwards,"April 12, 2019",5, Great drawing app. If you're looking for Procreate for Android this is about as good as it gets. It's even better on a SPen enabled device. Just a joy to draw in.
1026,Carlis Moore,"April 28, 2019",5," Best illustration app I can find for use with the S-pen without a ton of mistakes due to my hand bumping the touchscreen. If sounds silly, but being able to restrict touch from drawing but keep GUI functionality is easily the best feature."
1027,Miranda Hermon,"February 3, 2019",4," I really love this app. It is easy to use and has many cool brushes. But sometimes after i draw something, i click overwrite and it doesnt save. Please fix this."
1028,Andi Wilson,"July 13, 2019",1," It wouldn't let me draw when I created a new picture. I pressed everything and nothing was wrong, it just wouldn't let me write. Sad really, because the app looked great."
1029,Hoverfly The Hivewing,"August 11, 2019",1," Terrible. Everything was pixelated, and I couldn't fix it. I tried switching brushes, opacity, hue, softness, size, but nothing worked. And when I used red, it looked like blood. Awful. I am never getting this app again."
1030,kem 2020,"September 7, 2019",3," It's a good beginner experience, because how easy it is to use, and easy for anyone to grasp it's functionality,but there is one issue with it , not easy to configure"
1031,Linda G,"September 23, 2019",3, It used to be great. But now most of the brushes don't work. It keeps removing my art work for what I have saved and what I have shared. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it and nothing helps. I wish they would get it together.
1032,Z Azzam,"October 6, 2019",3," The brushes were great, but you needed to buy a version that unlocked layers, perspective guides, and much more. I wish they added layers to the free version, though. Overall an okay app."
1033,Wello PillowOwO,"February 24, 2019",3," I DUNNO WHY BUT IT CRASHES ON ME, AND MY LAYERS JUST DISAPPEAR AFTER HOURS OF COLORING!!!!! I love this app but this seriously needs to be fixed. it crashes way too much and I'd like to still use the app but it keeps killing my motivation too."
1034,Sean Dutton,"May 9, 2019",1," Utter garbage. Everything was going great, despite constant suggestions to save my work. But the app decided to erase all my layers while saving, leaving just white layers. It all comes down to errors in saving work."
1035,Henry Rhey Madrona,"December 17, 2018",5, I love how it worked very smooth on my galaxy note 3. So I bought the pack that contains most of the features and started making a comic. I am thankful i found this app.
1036,A Google user,"March 20, 2019",5, It is one of the best drawing apps I have ever got for example if you are sketching something in pencil it literaly look like you are acually sketching in pencil on paper. Really Good !!! You should definatly get it.
1037,- SamScribbles -,"May 5, 2019",3, I loved this while using the free trial and then I saw the cost. I was blown away. for a mobile app drawing app that's way too much.
1038,Robert Smith,"June 19, 2019",5, one of the best apps here. I am using it for more then 3 years. sure sometimes it crashes if you have more than 20 layers but that Is understandable.
1039,banana berry animations,"July 24, 2019",1," THIS IS THE WORST PAINT APP EVER. I can't turn off the circle tool, the program is so bad by its self. it keeps crashing and I can't finish ONE project no matter how hard I try. if you want to download this app, DONT DO IT. I know none of you are gonna listen, but don't say I didn't warn ya"
1040,Savannah King Norton,"August 22, 2019",5," This is, hands down, the best drawing and painting app in the Play store. It's fully featured, it's easy to use, and best of all the interface stays out of your way while you work."
1041,Chloe Beck,"March 11, 2020",5, It's a great app and great fun!!!!
1042,Larry Miller Jr,"March 23, 2020",5, Amazing App. I love it so much.

1045,JP Carpet,"January 15, 2019",5, I love it! I think it really helps me to exceed my digital drawing limit! My only concern is I don't have any money to pay for most of the tools and brushes but if I did I would.
1046,Nicolle Ana Staykov,"April 22, 2019",3," love the UI and brushes, love the results, however dropping 2 stars because THE RESOLUTION IS ATROCIOUS. once i try to export, the quality drops to horrible. please add an option for at least 180dpi, and ill consider buying it."
1047,LaLiLuLeLoX,"October 18, 2018",4, Optimize app on mobile phones a bit better. Views for brushes can get lost sometimes and having to flip phone to see em gets in the way of drawing. But great app. Thanks a much
1048,Sketch Master,"February 23, 2019",5, I've been looking for a drawing app for a while and this app is awesome!! I've made such amazing art with it and it's so easy to use! I definetly recomend.

1050,Jocelyn T,"July 11, 2019",2," Before it was working perfectly and I loved it but earlier I tried making a separate layer and I pressed the layer option but it said, ""Your trial has ended"" and it's getting really annoying and i cant draw on it anymore."
1051,Angst Angstrum,"October 8, 2019",5, Incredible opportunity. This app is comparable in many ways to Photoshop. I have been using it for quite a while and they keep making it better. I can't give it a thorough review because I don't even know all the amazing things that can be done using this app.
1052,Paramveer Chana,"October 26, 2019",5, Amazing application if someone love to work on layers sketching and it offers really good variety of brushes absolutely amazing would be great if no time boundary to use it free . But as the app is so good people will definitely buy it to . Great efforts keep enhancing it
1053,T e a T I m eツ,"November 11, 2019",1, Totally sucks. I try to push a brush or paint it doesn't work. Fix your apps. And maybe people's would like them more. (Your trash!)
1054,Kamryn Crawford,"March 23, 2020",1, I would always lose the option to change the color after I a Only used one would not recommend
1055,A Google user,"February 16, 2019",5, Fully Featured. Simple Interface. Professional Design. This app is made to get the job done and to get it done well.
1056,amritpal singh,"April 18, 2020",4," please remove autoshape feature, it's very annoying."
1057,Tres Tigers,"May 3, 2019",1," The app is great and all, but after the most recent updates, I can't import images and color them. It makes it pretty hard to take pictures of art on paper and color it digitally."
1058,smoll person,"December 19, 2018",4, Honestly I'm ok with the app but the fact that you cannot use layers when your doing DIGITAL ART it makes it so annoying witch is why I pester to use ibis paint so if it was updated so that you can use layers I would like this app a lot more but I do recommend the app
1059,sham ali,"February 17, 2019",5, great app once you get used to it and the fact that I'm spoilt for choices on what to use to draw is perfect. only negative thing would be the app makes my galaxy note 9 over heat pretty quickly but other that what a great app to have
1060,Jenny Naylor,"July 19, 2019",4," ok. so, yes there is a recording mode. but when i go to use it it doesnt work, or if it does work the footage gets corrupt as soon as i stop recording--"
1061,A Google user,"December 30, 2018",4," When ot says infinate painter they're not lying! You can zoom in so far to the point where it glitches so that you can't zoom back out, but other then that it's one of the best drawing apps I've seen!"
1062,bob masters,"June 29, 2019",1, After the 7 day trial you have access to practically none of the features and this app becomes useless. I understand you need to make money but there are other apps that do the same thing as this for free.
1063,Pixali,"July 18, 2019",5," actually really nice app. holds up against most desktop packages, at least for my admittedly casual use. wish the default palette had a few more colours or tabs like in CSP but it's fine otherwise."
1064,Nyx Moore,"July 26, 2019",5," I love it! I tried other apps for art and they are either to slow and delay what your drawing or dont give many brush option, I think this is the best one out their so far."
1065,Anwer Huawei,"September 5, 2019",3," I notice extremely important thing, that some painters, such Legacy: Haze when you undo the paint, you may notice that it still exist even though you undo it, this is such bad patch to exist. please repair it coz you don't want ppl to rate it down!"

1069,Allyson Flint,"April 19, 2020",2, Very laggy. Erasers are super weird. I would definetly not install.
1070,Mila Grewe,"January 18, 2019",3, my only issue is that when I go to import images all it shows is a black layer where the pictures suppost to be. But other then that its still a good app for drawing.
1071,Naomi Phillips,"January 5, 2019",5," I love Infinite Painter and use it exclusively now. The tools, brushes, layers, import functions, just everything, are all awesomely spectacular, and the most recent update solidifies my love further."
1072,Justin Turner,"December 31, 2018",5, excellent app for all kinds of artistic design. I find it useful in multiple areas of my professional and nonprofessional work.
1073,Khoco,"December 29, 2018",3," This app is really good when it works. It's my default app to doodle on, but is an absolute PAIN when you try to do anything with the layers and the app crashes."
1074,Julisa King,"July 1, 2019",5, I like it so much like I can color and it like everything it means so much to me cuz I like to like this is the best I ever can coloring like the other one know I don't like the other one but different names everything to me like it's so fun like I didn't try out yet but yes I already know it's goin...Full ReviewI like it so much like I can color and it like everything it means so much to me cuz I like to like this is the best I ever can coloring like the other one know I don't like the other one but different names everything to me like it's so fun like I didn't try out yet but yes I already know it's going to be really really plan cuz my sister her phone and like I think she likes it do you like it yes she likes it she likes it so much Buddy Guy's
1075,Artfully Amanda,"May 19, 2019",4," My art career has been enhanced via this app. There are SO MANY tools and applications for use! The only downside are the semi-frequent glitches, which can REALLY interrupt the creative flow."
1076,Thor DWolf,"May 20, 2019",5, after purchasing the add-ons its become my main drawing/painting app. if it had infinite page size it would be perfect but I still think it's a damn fine paint app.
1077,jason robinson,"January 25, 2019",4, Well rounded app. The dynamics of each stroke using different media are very smooth. That means a lot to me.....nice. Thank you.
1078,2683 uio,"January 25, 2019",5," Love it > The select tool is a bit confusing, would like an easy to access ""help"" option > A way to select color by using color codes would be a great help as well"
1079,A Google user,"January 26, 2019",5, its a cool app and mor people should play and draw with thid and it makes your drawings look better then they could ever possibly be and all of the BRUSHES and color possibilitys and it is just very fun to use.
1080,A Google user,"September 28, 2018",5," I love to paint, but there is always a mess to clean up afterwards; this app allows me to paint with all the tools I need without making a mess. I love this app.Victor m"

1084,Jayvee Enriquez,"March 29, 2020",1, I can't handle t much buttons!
1085,Grace Lps 833,"April 23, 2020",2, It does not work all that well for me. Their are not that many brushes that would be good for how i use the app. And this seems like a knockoff of procreate. Does not meet my expextation.
1086,NvE2,"May 19, 2019",5, Excellent app for drawing. No ads and there are like 5 in app purchases that you would be 100% fine without. The in app purchases are not pushed on you and are more about supporting the devs.
1087,Cody Matheson,"October 31, 2018",5, Truly an incredible app BUT you really have to have time to sit down and dig into it. Otherwise you will never truly know what you are missing.
1088,Dragonext,"May 21, 2019",5, The truth is the application is very good. It is very useful for drawing and has many tools that other drawing apps do not recommend.
1089,Amit A,"June 18, 2019",5," The best drawing app on Android so far! The brush tool section is a bit chunky though. Needs work to make it more convenient and user friendly. Also, palm rejection is really needed!!"
1090,Jade,"June 18, 2019",5, fantastic. best digital art app ive ever used. pro users or newbies can start off using this.. pity that i cant buy this app (student) .still i had an amazing experience using the free trial :)

1093,Fi FAI,"January 9, 2020",2, App is very slow and laggy. Brushes have slow reaction time.
1094,Vijay K,"December 6, 2018",5, Great painting app with a lot of features. Needs to be more stable as just exporting basically crashes. Adding layers at time crashes.
1095,Clewl Tetsui,"March 20, 2019",5," This app is very good, I especially like the brush customization as it's very versatile and useful, and the app as a whole is very good at what it's meant to do."
1096,the adly,"December 16, 2018",2, Overall is good. I love the tools and has lot of brush option But one thing that ruins everything. The apps lag and keep crashing!!!~ grr... I am using samsung note 8.
1097,claire renale,"January 31, 2019",5, amazing app - has photoshop like options while also having ever brush/pen/charcoal/etc you might want and ones you didnt know you wanted all for free.. best app for quick graphic designing and sketchbooking by far
1098,Cerra Girl,"December 8, 2018",2," Crashes on every PSD export!  It's too bad I need to be able to export to PSD cause it crashes every time.  This is an awesome app and I hope the developer will make it more stable soon, so I can buy it!  ;)"
1099,Christoffer Hedlund,"September 14, 2019",4," Works pretty well and is currently my favorite drawing/painting app while on the go. Good brush customization, blending, smart use of gestures (that all art apps should have..) and a wide set of features overall."
1100,Stewie Williamson,"May 10, 2019",5," This feels like a genunine app for my new tablet, the flow it is amazing, there is no lag at all, no ads to go through to unlock different brushes :)"
1101,Paul Solis,"June 30, 2019",4, Note 9: sometimes freezes and unresponsive at times. helpful tutorials and brushes are pretty awesome. fun to learn how to draw. fairly priced
1102,Ariel Miranda,"July 11, 2019",3," I am recently using this app, my expectatives on it were so high but at this time i found some of hard bugs that make this app awfull like crash ,problems with brushes...etc maybe developers will fix this soon (am hopefully on it) thats it."

1104,kxyrx panda,"October 17, 2019",4, Some of the tools are great. I already purchased to unlock all the tools after trial. But sadly most of the brushes didnt work. I hope you can fix it.
1105,Jaidyn 26,"November 17, 2019",1, This app was a waste of my time. Also you can even paint or draw because the app is so glitched and I have full bars...

1109,A G,"October 7, 2018",5, Awesome app! The interface is great and the paint/blending/brush manipulation features are vast enough so your painting becomes as you expect it and more! Definitly purchased
1110,Patrick Benasutti,"February 26, 2019",5," Great App, worth the money. more capabilities than I've seen anywhere else. Note 9 essential."
1111,Bo Thomas,"April 7, 2019",4, it's not that hard to use and it's a great way for people to find out what they can you do it's just I find it hard getting to you home page and getting to different art projects
1112,GeneralTrueFocus,"April 15, 2019",5, Extensive feature set. brushes and blending are superb. I have many many hours on iPad procreate and amazed at the quality of the brushes. The editing tools are top notch.
1113,Seth Long,"March 18, 2019",5, Like a mini-Krita and good for on the go. Paid version is worth it if you want one drawing app that does everything you need in a simple form
1114,Todd Meadows,"June 14, 2019",5, I make toy photoshoots and i think this is a good tool for me because I use it to make it look like there is flying out of a toy cars wheels and also rain dropping and snow sometimes I make the headlights glow with it it's a really good tool
1115,Lendsey Tolson,"July 29, 2019",5, easy to use and understand. lots of different style brushes. ive used a few other drawing apps and this one is my favorite.
1116,Valerie Escueta,"July 16, 2019",4," It is so much like procreate! And procreate costs a lot of money, and when I have free time I always take the the time to relax and draw on this wonderful app!"
1117,Sagi Smolarski,"July 28, 2019",5, awesome drawing program. especially orf you have a stylus. in particular i love that it is not only pressure sensitive but angle sensitive as well. really feels natural.
1118,SIDHARTH S,"August 6, 2019",1," Autodesk Sketch book, way better than this...and its free. This one, long story short, can't even draw a straight line without a purchase. disappointed"
1119,Patrice Brandt,"August 15, 2019",1, it costs money for everything! It even costs money for layers! if you want a drawing app dont get this one unless you want to spend like $5 just to get brushes.
1120,Randy Baraceros,"October 24, 2019",5, I like it a lot. I just wish the fill tool can fill the entire shape. A lot of the time it still leaves a small outline that's not filled.
1121,wolfy's World,"October 25, 2019",1, This app is bad just plain bad. You have to pay to get layers it just sucks I thought it was good at first until I noticed you had to pay to get stuff that should be free I was just plain mad.
1122,Roblox Gamer,"January 24, 2020",3, It is really laggy for me

1128,amiimys,"September 5, 2019",5," I found something wrong after updated new version today. When I did an undo, it still left some scratch behind which make me have to use the eraser instead. So, I feel inconvenient. Please kindly fix it. 😊"

1131,Dana McPhee,"November 20, 2018",1," I paid for this app, Infinite Paint, and Infinite Design, early on; this is how the developer rewards his early supporters - by screwing them ??? We have to buy the same app again?? RIP OFF !!!"
1132,Anna Swordsparrow,"May 12, 2019",4," I think it is a great app for artistic people, altho maybe if there was a blend sort of thing, then that would make life easier"
1133,Gabriel-Rose Gerichter,"March 15, 2019",1," I used this for about a year, and then suddenly I open it today and I can't even make a new layer without paying? Why not just make a new paid app then?"
1134,Oguz S,"March 4, 2019",4," Really good app. There should be an option (when selecting perspectives) to snap the brush to the lines, so it would be possible to draw isometrically."
1135,We are unknown,"May 22, 2019",4, one of the best deawing app but not perfect update this and make this app perfect for drawing lovers because of some features like ibis paint x or sketchbook but i like more to use infinite painter i like this apps ui and feactures and small icons so plz updates some features are missing in this app
1136,A Google user,"February 2, 2019",1," I tried to get fortnite from the epic gmes store, and I installed it in windows, because there was no option for chromebook. When I opened my file, it took me to this, so I tried it, and it wont even let me paint :( THIS GAME IS SO STUPID! I would rte it no stars at all if I could."
1137,Cinnamoons,"April 13, 2019",2," Quite unfair, we have to pay to have almost everything. I wanted to use layers but i have to pay for that? Well, yes. But im not wasting it on something that could be for free."

1143,Janessa Torres,"January 14, 2020",1, I don't like this game because it won't let me blend my colors I was trying to make a sun set and it wouldn't blend😤😤😤

1145,Anne Marie Naumann,"November 9, 2018",5, I am absolutely in love with this app- it encouraged me to draw more since its edition tools are really helpful to correct mistakes and clean out projects. 10/10 would recommend

1153,Care Bear,"December 7, 2018",1, This app came installed on my Pixelbook from the factory. I didn't ask for it and I have never used it. Zero stars for forceware. Next time try asking me if I'd like to install your software rather than paying Google to jam it down my throat.
1154,A Google user,"November 10, 2018",1," After applying the Stereo filter, new update just freezes the app. Constantly quits on my Chromebook. Not great. Avoid for now."
1155,Dennis Lynch,"April 12, 2019",5, amazing. runs smoother than photoshop and has so many unique tools that make it just as fun to doodle as it is to make a large project
1156,Fritz Hopper,"January 5, 2019",4," Dear developers, please make the essential package purchase available in other payment methods. Here in China, the Google pay is unavailable so I am not able to finish the purchase and can only use the basic features which is really annoying."

1202,damark Plg,"August 11, 2019",1, This is NOT a free app! This is SHAREWARE. The developer gives you a 7-day TRIAL and then you have to PAY to use it in the future. Uninstalled.
1203,Ruzzia Kaye Festejo,"September 10, 2019",5, Has simple interface but with tons of options in just one click. Neat and smooth. Worth every penny.

Even though its canvas sizes leave much wanting when compared to other drawing apps and even though your app has a severe integration issue at least with pixel phones and tends to unexpectedly shut down often, I still consistently use it. Mainly because I love the ease of use, the variety of tools you offer and because I can make do with little grievances if the positives outweigh the cons. However, recently the ""liquify"" option in your tool kit has undergone some strange update because now it's not at all precise like before. No matter the size you select, it distorts the image in an utterly despicable manner! I am hoping it was not a conscious decision to reboot it's function on your part because then it wouldn't make sense. So could you please look into it? And would you please revert it back to it's original glorious self? It's my go-to tool for most designs and I hate what it has become. Thank you!"

It freezes and crashes a LOT and I use another app to make poses to export and import into the art and draw but during work it crashes hard and I crashed around 17 times until I deemed it finished.. I use a Sony Xperia and the pic size is less than the middle towards performance and I still crashed unforgivingly. Relatively: The best thing is the constant auto save so the crash does not make you lose all progress though I keep getting forced to Layer top whenever I duplicate one layer that is lower from top.

much easier to use in my opinion. However, the app does crash when I 
attempt to load up one of my drawings so I can trace over it. I'm unsure if 
it's because the phot results is too high or mabye my phones memory can't 
handle it. So far that is the only problem I had encountered and it's a 
minor one. Love this app, a great buy, highly recommend"

I hope the developers see this because I would like to discuss more about the app.Thank you."
3453,A Google user,"June 15, 2018",5," One of the best painting apps, but sadly you need money for some features.. 
Anyways, this gives me a great experience! There are enough paint brushes 
to make the best possible result, I'm happy with that."

I'm really bummed and waiting and hoping the issue gets fixed soon, or at least to hear an answer as to what the problem might be. **As you can see, I did hear back, so if you run into a problem, drop them a line.**"

Sorry :/ thanks for reading AT LEAST MAKE LAYERS FREE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE THEN I WOULD LOVE YOUR APP I CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT LAYERS SO I'M UNINSTALLING! IF YOU ADD THEM, I WILL GLADLY INSTALL AGAIN! You are amazing in the brushes and all, but now, because layers aren't free, you are the worst rated app on my list. First cones medibang, then autodesk sketchbook, then a bunch of other horrible apps, then you. Just because layers aren't free. I can't do ANYTHING in your app and I am not paying $5.00 for an ""essentials"" pack that has 4 things in it. Even worse, you can't even buy the other packs U TIL you buy essentials because it won't let you. Do not install, waste of time. Just don't bother. And people who are reading this, don't brush past my comment for this app. Only 7 days of free things, and even when you uninstall and reinstall, the thing still comes up saying, ""your trial has ended.""

I was adding some details to one already finished painting, but suddenly it 
crashed and turns out the painting wasn't there anymore. I couldn't believe 
the work of days just dissapeared without any way of gettingit back. One 
might think that after buying the whole add-ons pack one would get some 
kind of insurance in case of this happening. I wish there was a way to 
recover my drawing. I'm using Galaxy Note 3, I have plenty of ram to run 
the app (around 2 gb free) so I don't think it is my device's fault. It is 
the first time it happens, and I hope the last."

pixel book for most tasks). There are so many features that I'm delighted 
by and I will change my 4 star review to a 5 when the developer adds the 
ability to place guides according to pixel measumrents (like, snap a

For those who use an S-pen like me (or the Wacom pen), drawing feels absolutely natural with this program. There's a record option that's pretty neat for those who like streaming their drawings, the undo and redo options go back reasonably far, and the add-on brushes are affordable.  THAT SAID, this app crashes with alarming frequency-- more than any other app I've used, regardless of how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled it. Worst of all, it seems to crash more often when I'm saving a picture and thusly destroys all my work. It'll also occasionally freeze and there's about a 50/50 shot of everything you've made just straight up disappearing.  I love using this app, but I'd like it more without the bugs. This is my go-to app when I open my tablet to start to draw, but about a third of the time I've switched over to another app to finish--usually by drawing over a screenshot of my frozen screen as this program fails to close."

those markers a bit overlap the connection area 2) please change the order 
of buttons in layer options, coz when one taps on the layer the next tap on 
the same area ereases the layer (erase layer button placed exactly there) 
which is highly annoying, better to place hide/lock button on there 3)

program. Something about the way these tools are arranged, i.e. which 
options are and aren't hidden when you work on your art project -- what is 
omitted becomes just as important as what is present. It's wonderful and 
intuitive design, designed for us, us the weirdoes with flighty, 
hufflepuffy work ethics, who might otherwise become trapped within our own 
mental tangents, and never finish the precious things we have set out to 
make and share with the world. When artistic pursuits become muddled in 
complications, inertia can drag down our initial passion -- the Spark -- in 
our work and then the common tragedy of uncommunicated ideas occur, and a 
thing which might have otherwise bettered the world OR inspired someone is 
never seen, not even by the artist who tries to birth it. I guess what I'm 
trying to say is THANK YOU to the hardworking programmers who developed 
this. Your work and passion hasn't gone unnoticed, and now, thanks to it, 
if all goes well, neither will ours."

well. The options for said tool are nice in theory, but they do not work. I 
imported line art from png format. Was able to designate source layer, 
which I liked. However, bucket fill is blotchy and glitchy. I ended up 
having to turn my lines layer to multiply mode, and for some reason, that 
cleared up some spots. Compared to two other apps I am coloring the same 
picture with, this one is the most time consuming, despite this app having 
the most impressive selection of tools, and a beautiful, intuitive layout.

Performance while drawing is great. Occasionally lags/crashes, especially when adding a new layer, but it's not bad enough to knock a star off. Having flexibility is better than strict limits (on dimensions or number of layers) in an effort to increase performance. The saving dialog when attempting to open a project confused me at first, but all-around this is the best available art app."

4021,Ilija Grgić,"March 7, 2018",2, Constant crashes when creating new layers or openjng the recording feature is a non-stop cause of frustration. A real shame... It really has a lot of potential...

It is packed with a lot of great features, has a really good UI, and is extremely snappy. Hands down, the best Photoshop-like app available on Android. In fact, this app has more of the features and power that the desktop version of Photoshop has than Adobe's own Android version of Photoshop. Using this app on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and the experience is phenomenal. To this point I have used it primarily to do some pro level image compositing and this app delivers. Honestly, skip the gimmicky Adobe apps and just get this one, you won't be disappointed. One feature I would love to have, layer masks. If layer masks were available, easy 5 stars for this gem.

I rely on this ap heavily for drawing for my job and I'm getting ready to find something else if there aren't resolutions put in place real soon. Every new layer prompts crashes, oh, you want to cut or paste? Crash. Want to import something? Crash. Well and truly at wits end with your program and there is zero support.   Update 12.2.18 - you haave taken an already plummeting app and rendered some tools (the lazy tool) to be useless, and the brushes have all turned to absolute bollocks in one single update. You're failing your customers and not resolving crash issues. It shouldn't matter how many layers or what size I choose, if it's available on the app, it says to me that you acknowledge it is azn acceptable size and layer combo and I can use it.... but I can't,  and it's not."

The interface is well done, no big problems for me. Honestly, my biggest problem with it is that sometimes when I slide the color it will become an eye dropper, and other times it darkens and lightens the color I'm using.   2, Save and Load functions. Overall I have few problems here. My biggest problem is that when I try to load a save it tends to crash. Saving works fine though. 3, Glitches and Bugs. Quite a few problems here. It crashes frequently, and when I start it up, it automatically goes to my last drawing, which is very annoying. Also, when I use a fill, gradient, wand, or really any other tool (I have all the paid upgrades), it randomly crashes most of the time. And also, when I have anything open in the background (like YouTube red or soundcloud) painter randomly closes them down.   4, Tools. The pencil, ink, paint, etc are all well done, imitating the real things well. Size variation is also very nice.  As for the paid tools, I'm very impressed with the wand tool. It does it's job very well. And the filters are also pretty impressive  Overall a good app, and I believe the paid upgrades are worth it. The bugs and glitches would be nice to fix though.  Edit: Okay so now one of the tools just stopped working properly. The Alexis tool just became the exact same as the Jeanette tool. What the heck."
4110,A Google user,"February 11, 2018",5, The app is amazing to use and it is cool to use different types of brushes and lots of other things I've done recommend the app to some of friends who are really good drawers and said they like the app!

I love it, however it crashes constantly but not as frequently as previous updates.

My problems with this app, though, are how often it crashes, and how my drawings dissapear no mattr how many times I save it, with no trace. Most times when I try to look through my layers/click into my layers, the app freezes and crashes. It makes it very difficult for me to finish my pieces, and  it's also very bothersome.

App often freezes when managing or adding layers, will randomly change my brush from one in the custom library to a default brush, often when i am using the undo tool, again lags and gets slow sometimes necessitating a closure of the app before continuing with a project, all brushes seem to have problems, too thick or thin or too soft and faint but there is no middle ground, and to get the best results seems to require a large canvas size which again makes the resolution chug, now if 3gb of RAM is not enough then I don't know what else to say, you can only get 4gb tablets with Android as far as I am aware so what gives? I loved this at first and now I hate it and am contemplating pawning my device off for an Ipad because this is the only app that doesn't have atrocious palm rejection or ads that you don't even have the option of disabling with a premium version for purchase.  Because of this I am wondering if I was better off sticking with paper."

All in all though I've been happy with the app and the hope that future fixes and improvements are coming.

A few things I'd like to see added are: 1 stroke correction. With how small a phone screen is lines are often wobbly.

It makes for a wonderful, distraction-free experience. It's nice that despite the simple interface, there are a lot of powerful features just one or two clicks away. The one thing that makes the app 4 stars instead of 5 is the project management screen. It's clunky and often takes me several attempts to move projects around. If the responsiveness on this screen could be improved, this would easily become a 5 star app. Good job to the developers!"

Overall, you have a really great concept on design and ease of use for the user, it's the best on the store.  My issue is that there seems to be stability problems. The undo button sometimes leaves artifacts that have to be erased manually, there's stalling and hanging, and still some crashing bugs involved with the paintbucket tool. I never feel really secure in the time I get between saving my work to the point that I want to save every couple of strokes or so.  I really want to absolutely love this app. It's so awesome and nice to work in, but it's just not stable. If I had any say in it, I would have to ask that the team goes on a bug-squishing crusade for the next few updates before any new design changes are made.

As you can see from the gallery, the artwork produced within Infinite Painter has a more professional quality to it than some other painting apps out there (i.e.- much less of the fuzzy, airbrushed work seen from PENUP, at least from serious artists). The community itself acts as a great place to post your work, with the only drawback being you can't seem to comment on others' work.  The brush AND tool selection is great, and the extra ability to make or import your own brushes is like icing on the cake! Brushes are also fully customizable, with easy to use slider settings. My favorite tools are the selection masks and the curvilinear perspective guides... both are incredibly effective when used in conjunction with the layers.  Lastly, the UI... just WOW! So simple and easy to use- it easily beats apps like ARTFLOW and PENUP due to its ability to host a large bulk of its tools behind just one layer of click-through... all while keeping the menu clean, and mostly hidden when not in use."

I just recently started using a tablet for art, and have been experimenting with a few different art apps, including Adobe Sketch and Autodesk Sketchbook. This one has been my favorite so far.

They responded to my complaint quickly, and are working to try to recover my files. I will raise it back to 5 stars if they can actually fix the issue but, even if they can't, their customer service deserves some credit.  I gladly bought this app, and I have been using it for a while as my primary drawing app with no problem. Until today, when it spontaneously deleted three days of work on a piece I was working on. My file is still there, but all of the layers were deleted -- over 40 layers of work gone, out of the blue. I feel physically ill. If you can't trust your app to, at the bare MINIMUM, keep your artwork safe, then it's useless, no matter how many features it has or how nice the brushes are. How can I use this app with any confidence when there is no telling when it will delete all of your work? I wish I could demand my money back."

I've stuck with it for quite a while, working around all the glitches and problems that it presented. It is a great app for doing digital paintings, good enough that I bought it. However, multiple times I have come back to a piece I was part way through, only to find that it would crash as soon as I tried to access my work. The most recent  problem to occur was this; I saved an artwork, that I had spent a good 4 hours on, and when I returned to the app to continue my work it had gone blank! The layer with the main part of my drawing had gone black. I find this somehow absurd, almost laughable. I would have thought accurately saving an artwork would be the most basic thing to expect of an app like this! I am truly disappointed, this really would be a great app, if only it actually had the most basic of functions and actually saved the artwork created on it!"

I loaded up the app to continue working on a project that I was quite fond of, and it was gone. The canvas was there, with all of the layers, but every single one was blank. I tried backspacing and powering off  my tablet, but it is still gone. Now I have no evidence of this large drawing I was working on.  I was also annoyed to find that this is the only way I could contact the developers of this app, unless I'm missing something. I wish to be contacted about this, to see if anything can be done."

Unfortunately I had to change my rating from 4 to a 1 only because of the artistically fatal bugs present. I simply can't trust this app anymore to do serious artwork as it has outright deleted several projects out of nowhere. There's one in particular where when I go to open a project only for it to load a blank page and I can't get any of my artwork back. So now begins the hunt for something much more stable. It's a shame too because this really is the best Android art app in my opinion if not for the bugs that render it unusable :(

I'm on a Note 3 phone (tho running Android 7.1.1 because I'm a nerd) and it's the first truly usable sketching/painting app I've come across. It's a legit PC replacement especially if you map your buttons well. Volume controls for undo/redo, double tap for canvas flip, finger for erasing, stylus for brush/blend, etc. Two fingers for zoom/pan/rotate. If you use a dark theme with a dark paper color and light brushes, this will save you heaps in battery life on OLED displays like my phone. I use a huge battery anyways so that's not a personal concern. Also, you get perspective guides, filters, color adjustments AND a liquify tool which is super useful for fine tuning raw sketches (like in Photoshop). Dockable color palette with presets makes color picking a breeze as well. If you're a pro artist or simply a good artist looking for maximum efficiency for serious art, this is it guys."

But it seems to be buggy on my Chromebook Plus. Frequent crashes are one thing, but lately it's been doing something worse: I'd import some line art to try painting and every time I touch the screen with the stylus, my image disappears, never to return unless I touch the screen with my finger. This issue renders the app useless; hopefully an update will fix it. I'll hold out hope because I really think this has the potential to be the best raster art app on Android."

This started happening the day after I paid for I.P. And started heavier layer usage?  Started with app terminating?  You must fix this! Also when I export to a png file, a smudge or stray mark appears on the image that's not visible in Painter. Don't know what that is.  A layer that's been cleared or deleted but shows up up during export? I need to consider a refund. Trying to narrow in on the problem.  When exporting to jpg, there is NO smudge.  So not a total loss.  Ive isolated the problem to a single layer that is a duplicate of the original imported png. Also:  In trying to erase the invisible mark, the smudge became darker.  But painting with the correct color, covered the smudge.  However I can't see what Im doing. Please fix! Solution: I removed the transparency of the problem layer by merging down to a white layer.  No more problem.  There appears to be a bug with the png export thinking transparency means black/gray. This is a separate problem from a layer becoming corrupt with blocky garbage."

The latest updates have fixed a lot of bugs and the app keeps getting more useful features, it is well worth paying to unlock everything, it has gone from being my main drawing app on Android to pretty much my main drawing app over all platforms.

4613,Filip Eriksson,"September 6, 2017",3," First it was a clear 5. You got everything you needed and wanted and it was perfect. But now, to even use the simplest tool, you need too pay. I was so happy when I found this app and loved it to bits, but now I'm just mad that I can't afford the tools that were free before."
4614,Rahul Gandharva,"September 7, 2017",5," Brilliant app, has layers, custom paint brushes, and all sorts of use full tools including fill. The only problem I have is that the app is paid, but because the app is so good, it doesn't matter."

Working with this is frustrating because it will occasionally just stop working for seemingly no reason. Mainly it will mess with the layers and make it so you cant view some of them. You could save a project that seems to be in perfect working order only to see the next time you try to work on it that some random bits of the project have been deleted (usually in square bits with sharp edges). If it weren't for that one thing that renders this app borderline unusable, this would easily get 5 stars."

I have used v. 6.0.57 every day for several days since the update and the app has not crashed once. Seems they have it solved. So now I can say what I've been wanting to say about this app: It's flat-out the best drawing app for Android. I've tried MediBang, ArtFlow, Adobe Sketch, and AutoDesk Sketch. This app has them all beat. Medibang and Adobe seem clunky by comparison and although AutoDesk is close, Infinite Painter has a much more intuitive interface. It's a joy to use and the drawing feel is excellent."

The blending doesn't work efficiently anymore, the layout is painful on the eyes, and I can no longer complete old projects as I no longer have my brushes. I love this app but it's become difficult and disappointing. Bring back the previous version, it worked so much better, and it was efficiant and pleasing.  Edit; I thought it would get better, but it got worse. The app crashes, glitches, deletes artwork, layers, and undos art without being commanded to. Strokes vanish when the pen leaves the screen, or just don't register at all, especially Alexis. The blending still is ridiculous and doesn't work, and I still can't complete old projects. I'm using Medibang now because this one just doesn't work efficiently. Maybe I'll look at it again after an update, but for now it's entirely useless."

I especially like the water colour effects. One slight criticism, or rather a suggestion, is that there should be a hide layer button right on the corner of each layer square so that you can turn on and off individual layers without having to go into a sub menu, as it ruins my flow as I work.

I wish there was a tool were you could make speedpaints but overall it's amazing  The  app works smoothly and it actually has a blend tool unlike other art apps I've used! It has such a variety of tools to use and get it's super easy to use! If you have confusion? Don't worry it has a classroom with tutorials on how to use and navigate tools and layers And you don't need a computer to use it! You can use it on your phone or tablet Wich means I could draw easily on the go! I really love that I found this!

Also, as is a common complaint online, the canvas is not INFINITE 😖. Why don't you start with a limited canvas and, as required, automatically  increase the canvas while drawing 🤔"

The information is well organized with pics of the step by step process. This app also offers more advanced brushes & tools @ a reasonable price (other apps are rediculously priced).

One, there aren't any great inking tools on this. You have to make your own. Not too bad a problem.  Two, the software is quite buggy, losing progress, transformations not working properly on ocassion in multiple ways, and straight up crashes.  Final verdict, if the app were more stable it would be an ideal art application, but it just isn't there right now. Sadly, it's the best thing going in terms of features - this is the closest to the desktop version of Autodesk Sketchbook out there, my preferred software, and it just isn't up to par right now. With some bugfixing, though, it could be ideal."
5035,Francisco Padilla,"May 28, 2017",3," The features and usability is great, however; it had caused a lot of my work to be erased. It has bugs that cause it to crash from time to time. This can be very frustrating."

5037,Gamerkitty321,"May 18, 2017",3, It's a good drawing app and I've enjoyed it so much so far! But..it deleted all of my drawings and it highly upsets me..I worked so hard on all of them and nothing is there. Please fix this..
5038,Jonathon Grzesiek,"January 22, 2017",5, I love that you can skew/distort pictures/layers. Filters are great. Everything is so convenient and easy to use. Great program. Definitely the best mobile drawing app I have used.

I'm an artist and I use it to compose my paintings when using several different photographs, saving a lot of time over sketching. Or you can also put a head on a body and BLEND THE EDGES, for example for cute Facebook postings. It can be used to create digital paintings from scratch, or to trace an image. It takes a little time to learn the more complicated stuff, but way easier than photoshop and has easy access tutorials."
5040,Mart P,"April 30, 2017",5," Almost perfect but very glitchy with adding layers now. Not altogether sure, which file formats are unacceptable. I have to use multiple apps now to do what this one did before. It really needs a snap grid, it's very difficult to judge straightness on layouts."
5041,Phillip Studiman,"October 9, 2016",3,"Work flow not great As title says, i  like this app and all but a lot of the work flow is kinda crap.

5115,Mitchell Kofluk,"April 6, 2017",4, The only problem I have is that the free version only allows a certain sized frame for exports. This makes all of my pictures compress in size causing blurriness.

However, praise for this is lessened by how unstable using the app is. As an example, one main issue is how one undo can completely revert it back to a previous state... that I  already undid from (in other words, that state shouldn't even exist, yet some how, undoing redid this old state, which was previously undid). This seems capable of happening regardless of how long I've been drawing in a project. Aside from the undo bugs, selection can be a little wonky. Sometimes when selecting regions to transform them, the content selected turns invisible, making it hard to transform them. And sometimes when using the lasso tool, it'll select everything in the layer, instead of just the region I selected. And my last stability concern is the saving.  There were multiple times where, after I saved, exited, and reloaded a project, sections of the canvas would appear overlapped with a state of the section that I undid from, or transformation edits would be rolled back, ruining the image further. I can't even properly describe some of ways my projects were deformed upon exiting and reloading it. This only affected the last layer I was editing.. to my knowledge. Oh, and layer names reset randomly."

You have, on the face of it, got everything of everything that I need and much more. You now just have to match the stability of the Autodesk programme. (hence the 4 stars). The colour selection could be better also in line with the copic library that autodesk offers. The app also crashed on me several times (galaxy note pro 12.2).

I also like that you can export your work without the background so that it has a transparent background (this feature in particular is why I prefer this app over other drawing apps; transparency is important to me). The only reason why I don't like this app is that it keeps stopping and closing randomly. It does automatically save, but sometimes some of what I drew is lost and I have to draw it over. Also, one of my drawings in particular I could never access again because every time I clicked on it, the app would force close. I eventually just deleted the drawing because I couldn't edit or export it. The way that I combat this is by exporting my drawings regularly to my tablet's gallery so that I can still access them in the unfortunate circumstance that the app won't let me open the drawing again. I really hope this issue will be resolved because otherwise the app is great."

Fortunately, there are nicely made tutorials built in, and I highly recommend taking a look at these.

To those considering buying it I'd like to point out that for $8 you'll be getting your money's worth if you are willing to learn or are familiar already with high end art apps, so don't hesitate to buy the bundle if you want to do serious art. I bought all the art apps on Play Store, and this is at the top of the list as one of two of the best I use most.

First, its brushes, both those you create and many of those it comes with, suffer from uncontrollable color effects, like turning on Color Dynamics in Photoshop, and which you cannot stop no matter what controls you turn off and on in brush settings. Only a few of the preset brushes don't suffer from these color effects.  Second, whenever you lasso a part of an image and transform it, it causes this ripple-like effect to occur to the rest of the image, which can quickly damage line work. Its transform tools are what's supposed to really put this over other art apps, yet it's not any help if it damages the artwork as you're transforming it.   Unless you get this app for very light sketching on your phone I'd steer clear of it as it's generally more hassle than it's worth."

I'll admit, at first I read the reviews and went for the old free version for its save feature, and were I to want a free paint program, that's what I'd do again. but when prompted, I got suckered into the ""free upgrade"", which felt pushy and slimy and removed layers, making it a premium feature. But I ended up persisting rather than going back and prefering the new interface so much that I decided to pay to support the developer of this product that was clearly above the rest available.

6518,Jacob H.,"April 12, 2016",3,Paint brushes are not so realistic The paint brush patterns and color blending are not so realistic as Corel Painter or Autodesk Sketchbook. If I zoom in I can see some repetitive cloning in the stroke of the brush pattern. The color blending also doesn't seem like it has as much dimention and natural variation to it.
6519,D'Jalmar Perry,"April 3, 2016",4,"Great but has a major drawback For doing line art and smooth drawing only this app and artrage have truly alleviated this issue.  However, this app has a real problem with opening saved projects...they PIXELATE!"
6520,Damien Scott,"March 25, 2016",4,Absolutely the best I love this app. It's has every thing a professional drawing program should have and more. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact you can't merge layers.

I just deleted and reinstalled the app just so that it would reset, but even that didn't work. I paid to unlock all the features, too. Disappointed.

So far this is the best app for digital painting on a conventional tablet. I've tried them ALL. Few issues; Force closes... this needs to stop. Sudden color wash on project... Not sure what causes this, but it completely washes out your image with a seemingly random color... requires an app restart to fix. A sudden splash of color when making a brush stroke... Again not sure what causes this, but a sharp spike of color will shoot out the side of your brush, can erase. Additionally, would be nice for some higher resolution options. Overall... Great tool selection, great brush customization, seemingly endless layers at full resolution. A must BUY app. Cant wait to see more support/updates as the app is developed over time. ** Dropped a star due to continuous memory leaks. Will loose layers randomly and saved projects will become corrupt. Was hoping by now there would be a fix, however I was mistaken. In due time, Artflow will surpass this app with a simple addition of more tools.**"

But this app infinite painter didn't let me down. I use it on my galaxy pro 12 and I'm satisfied with its performance. There are many amazing tools like the perspective guide and multiple symmetry tool that can't be found on the other apps like sketchbook pro. The brushes are customizable, there are many artistic ones like water color and paint that dissolve and make for brilliant effects. The canvas resolution can be set according to the needs of the user. The work area is also customizable which is a great bonus. There certainly are more features in comparison to similar apps (I tried almost all of them) so I can suggest this app if you are a designer or an artist. The only downside is that sketchbook pro is a bit faster in performance. The brush stroke are has a small lag in comparison to sketchbook. So if the developer would optimize this it might become the ultimate sketch app that rules it all!"

Infinite Painter is by far the most fully featured art app on android and comes closest to windows pc art software. Fully customisable brush tools and many transformation tools.

Working with multiple layers also works well. The software design is excellent and has been thoroughly thought through. I'm amazed that they've managed to get so many features into an android app. Great work guys and I look forward to future updates and improvements but please don't fix what ain't broke!

I have to delete that layer before it goes away and all the work I had on it. Plus there seems to be some lines that show up on my screen when I'm working with it. I thought it was my tablet but after using a few other programmes they went away. It only happens with this app.
6723,Solora Solis,"February 15, 2016",5,"Better than Sketchbook This app is amazing, it's so much more versatile then any other art app I've tried so far. If you're looking for one to try, try this one. It gets updated routinely as well, which is rare for a lot of art apps."
6724,Ahmad Alsaadi,"February 24, 2016",4," NEW COMMENT! There are number of improvements since last update thanks developers, but still app opening saved projects with white squares and I have to correct this every time I open these projects! Hope you'll fix this too please"

(Congratulations, this is a major change in direction, strategy and support for your apps, a huge improvement.) Already the king of vector applications for mobile, with this upgrade? redevelopment? new app?, Mr Brakefield is now light years ahead of the pack and sets new standards as to what one would now expect to find in a drawing/painting/vector/graphics application.   Is it still frustrating to use? Yes, it still crashes and makes me want to bite myself. It's still a heart breaker when, after spending hours on a project, all my efforts are for naught as it freezes up and my device goes down in flames.  It pays to save early and often to avoid the worst of the aggravation. This is, afterall, the land of android, innovative and full of new ideas and ways to do things so we must expect some bumps in the road.   When learning how to use Mr Brakefield's early applications I found them clunky and almost painful to use. Now there is the beginning of ease and elegance in their use. Thank you, Mr Brake field, well done."

But, it has some obvious errors, like you can put your finger down and draw for a minute or two straight and it'll freak out and crash.

But there are serious performance issues with this version, to the point where you have to wait for several heartbeats before seeing the stroke that you just added to the screen.     I doodled with it for 30 minutes on my phone, before it crashed and burned and died without a trace.  I tried it on my tablet, but that only lasted 10 minutes before it decided that I'd surpassed my trial period and shut itself down.  The final straw, however, came on my phone, when my data usage alarm went off.  And when I looked at the detail page, I found that Infinite Painter was the culprit.  That's when it came off."

However, I've had some issues recently with it crashing, and as a result have lost entire layers because the app freezes mid drawing. When the app freezes and I have no chance to save I lose all the work I did. Granted, it's only happened on a severe scale twice, but twice is rather devastating. My advice to anyone is to save frequently, it's less inconvenient than losing all of your work. I don't know if an autosave feature exists or is possible at all, but maybe the problem is not the app, I don't know. That being said, I still believe that this app is worth having,it has a lot of fantastic features and is incredibly innovative and useful."
