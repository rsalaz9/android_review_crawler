You must pick a track to add to a playlist and choose the option to add it to a new playlist. There if you add a directory to a playlist you see its name only. You will see its contents selecting the directory and doing something, but I'm not quite sure what it is. There is no way to select multiple tracks to add all at once to a playlist."

Whenever I use Bluetooth headphones to listen, the first second of each song is ""cut."" When trying to listen to music, this can be really, really annoying. I'm not sure which update introduced this issue, but it's awful. I tried switching to a different media player, and the audio was fine, so it's an issue solely with VLC. It sucks that I have to use some other app until this is fixed."

But the latest version seems to have lots of bugs. Black screen on start up if it does start just a white blank screen. Uninstalling and reinstalling will fix the problems for a while but then the same problems return. Will have to look for a more reliable player. Which is a shame as this is the first time I have had problems with VLC. Recent reviews would indicate that other users are also having problems.

Whenever I scroll down and get to those songs below all the English songs I have, the app refreshes the list within a second or two and there are no more songs in the library according to it. Refreshing it has no effect. I have to wipe it out from the memory and reopen the app to see all the songs again. And once again if I scroll down there the story repeats. Please find a fix for this. This never happened before getting songs in Russian."
4,Vivek Patel,"April 22, 2020",5," This app is as good as it's desktop counterpart. It supports hundreds of file formats and will play anything you their at it.

For example, I couldn't play .wma files on Google play music, but VLC solved ask these problems. However there's one bug: flac files sometimes appear to have no length. This doesn't affect playback, but it means you can't skip ahead."

But now since I updated this app, when I'm watching my movies with my bluetooth speakers it wants to cut the audio out for a few seconds and then comes back on. And it does it about every minute through the movie. Talk about a mood killer! Please fix this problem, cause it really sucks having to watch a movie without my bluetooth speakers."
6,Euclid Megara,"April 25, 2020",4," Great, simple music app. I don't like other apps because they all try to get you to stream, this one doesn't push stuff you don't want.

I just wish that playlists were more quickly accessable when browsing your music collection: you have to leave audio and select playlists to see them, would be better if they were available via the menu at the top of the audio screen were genera, artist, album, etc. are located."
7,Katherine Bonay,"April 25, 2020",1," I've only used it for audio, but the program shuts down as soon as it is paused for too long, or when another app is opened.

And the file (if opened via an external program) is not stored in the VLC play history, yet if I reopen it externally in VLC, half the time it starts from where it cut off. only positives are that it's nice to be able to jump to a certain time stamp, set up a sleep timer, and adjust the playback speed, but the rest is bad enough that I will be uninstalling this app."

What I miss and really need to make this a 5 star experience is to be able to change the position of subtitles, like in the PC version. For devices like mine with 18:9 or other cinematic screen ratios, if watching a made for TV screen program, I want to take advantage of the full screen, so I zoom in a little to fill my whole screen and the subs are getting cuted out when I do that."
10,Shinoj Kumar,"April 23, 2020",1," When the screen locks, the app being kept on pause, the app crashes when the screen is unlocked. I have to restart the app again to play the video.

I have to restart the app again to play the video. Sometimes the video plays from where it crashes and sometimes it starts from the beginning. Please fix this. Other than this the app is very comfortable for me. One more request. Please include Movie in equaliser with movie effects coz the app is mostly used by users to watch movies, not to listen to MP3s."
11,Robert van der Laan - Clement,"April 24, 2020",1," Love the regular PC version, and this app has potential, but it's just so buggy and broken 👎 Just some issues: when clicking on an audio track, it doesn't just play and when done, continues to the next, but instead it opens a tab at the bottom with only that 1 track on repeat..When watching a video...Full ReviewLove the regular PC version, and this app has potential, but it's just so buggy and broken 👎 Just some issues: when clicking on an audio track, it doesn't just play and when done, continues to the next, but instead it opens a tab at the bottom with only that 1 track on repeat..When watching a video, you can't add it to a playlist (instead it will add ALL videos from your library to that playlist 😵😠). After searching a title of a video, you get the WRONG 1 when clicking on any found video.. 😡"

There's NOTHING even close to it. And it's FREE! I've given it one star in hopes this gets attention. A few updates ago, for some reason, it's started saving a pic locally (NOT ON MY SD CARD WHERE THE APP IS) for every single mp3 file. 10 songs in an album? Ten pictures saved. It's an issue. Due to the amount of music I have on my phone the ""data"" size locally is close to 2 gigs!!! Can this be fixed?"
13,Saeed Simmons,"April 27, 2020",2," I don't know what's going on, but this has been my apps for many many years. Even on my laptop. Sense this new update, it doesn't even cast.. It recycles on the main page, by it self. An it doesn't go into portrait mode.. this is weird an crazy. Not like VLC.."

I have downloaded many anime such as Naruto Shippuden, One Piece and many more. This was the perfect app to watch all of them. I also listen to music I downloaded on VLC for Android rather than listening it on google play music and it was very great! But I think this app would be more awesome if you add a lyrics download for music just like the subtitles download for video. Other than that it was an AWESOME APP! Highly Recommended!"

Phone display keeps turning off preventing easy movie control and dropping the cast. Need a default option to keep screen on while casting. No subtitles during casting either. Would love to see these little issues fixed soon. Keep up the good work.

19,David Elfleet,"April 28, 2020",4," Generally it does appear to be a good all round media player. However I have to drop a star since with last update the subtitles for videos played in landscape mode are not formated to the scale of the displayed video and as such unusable. Brilliant for use with dlna, pity about subtitles."

23,Paul Molitor,"April 27, 2020",1," will not play URLs if you don't give it storage permission! Does nobody test this? I doesn't need access for anything I want to do with it, yet refuses to work without. now also seems to apply tricks to run in the background, seeing notifications pop up and disappear all the time."
24,Favour Emman,"April 23, 2020",1," I have been using this app since 2015 and it has always been good, no crash whatsoever until last week! I'm unable to download subtitles. It just keeps saying 'error occured'. And my friends have the same issue, some already deleted the app. You guys should plesse look into it"
25,Subhadeep Pal,"April 28, 2020",3," In contrast to the pc version of this app, it sucks. There are many better video players on the play store. It is too simple, I can't see the codec used by the video or the resolution when the video is playing. I only use it because it has no ads and supports a wide variety of formats."
26,chintan gandhi,"April 27, 2020",1," No feature to select a particular language to always play first in case of a video with multiple audio. I have been waiting for this feature for so long. Kindly add this feature as I no longer use MX player which already has this feature inbuilt. Nokia 6.1, Android 10."
27,Kyler Greywacz,"April 20, 2020",4," There's some problems with the A-B Playback, with the button not changing when you disable it after using it, Another thing that kind of annoys me is when I do the repeat song option, it only stays on that song when trying to advance my current list of songs. Other than that, love the app"
28,Alex Molina,"April 20, 2020",3," This has been my ""go-to"" app for years for media files. However, it's UI has become somewhat cranky lately. Sometimes the Play All button doesn't show up. In the 3.2.11 release on my Samsung, if I move app from internal memory to SD Card the UI disappears entirely until I move it back."

31,Jonathan Ramirez,"April 29, 2020",1," Persistent loading notification even when the app isn't in use. Force closing removes it temporarily and then it reappears on its own. Haven't used the app to watch a video in quite a while, no reason for this notification to appear."
32,Iama Strawman,"April 20, 2020",3, Always great when it works. Keeps giving me a problem with not being able to find the right path to pull what I have already downloaded. Could be better if they could give tutorial on how and where to find path u can manually enter so it can find them.
33,Akintunde Omobolaji,"April 23, 2020",3," It's not quite the former app before the update. Now I am unable to download subtitles, it stopped working since like 5 updates ago...

36,Felicity Foo,"April 22, 2020",4," Aside from an old-school layout, it works well and has the highest format-compatibility on android. A major issue, however, is casting as the subtitles are non-existent."
37,CosyHamster,"April 21, 2020",5, I held it off for a while because I thought it would be your modern day audio/video player. I was 100% wrong! It had all the settings I needed and served it's purpose easily. Recommended for new tech people and tech savy people!
38,Nightcore Millenium,"April 27, 2020",1," Why does it always play fast even i didn't turn on the ""save playback speed"" anytime i play videos? I only tune the playback speed once but when i play the same video it didn't play as default speed please fix this its annoying to turn the speed manually. Same happened to my phone and tablet"
39,Kween jade,"April 20, 2020",5, Love this app. When others don't worth this one does. It supports several file types and is available on several devices. Love how detailed the developers get when listing the new update features. This app is totally worth it!
40,amit jaiswal,"April 22, 2020",5," Perfect, mind blowing, amzing experience but just solve 2 issues please.. 1. Manual search of subtitle should automatically paste name of movie in search bar.. as mx player does.. offcourse no one is going to type the movie name 2. When forwarding videos only then it lags a bit.."
41,Don Greer,"April 24, 2020",2, I find not being able to organize the order of the songs in the playlists very frustrating. The order you add them is the order they will stay in. Many of my playlists need a certain order. This makes the playlist feature pretty much useless.
42,Lennox Nkunkuma,"April 22, 2020",2," As i am speaking it refuses to show content when I open it on my samsung A260f, it just shows a blank screen. I cannot exit clicking back twice, i must close it tab wise or with home button. Now I can't finish nanatsu no tazai: kamigami no gekirin😏."

45,Tobias Poulsen,"April 23, 2020",1," Suddenly, without using the app, it pops up daily with a ""loading"" notification. This notification persists until I force stop the app. Then it's back within 24 hours. I haven't even been using the app for months."
46,JS W,"April 22, 2020",3," Remarkably slow FTP access. Weirdly slow. I use VLC on Android to play videos from a Nas via FTP, and VLC takes multiple seconds to list directories but for other laptops on wifi it's instant. What's up with that?"

58,Bridget Gonzalez,"April 21, 2020",4, Good plays the videos but the only thing is you can't save the video to your camera roll wish it did so I could upload the videos to my social media. I can only play them on my phone using this app now
59,James Lucas,"April 21, 2020",2," Mmm. it scanned my device when I had not given permission. 1 star but extra star cause it is great. I like the interface, and that I can cast. Could be good to filter for video only in a given folder."
60,j a,"April 27, 2020",4, I really like this app because it smoothly with all my media accounts. Thank you for a bug free program. Why can't the big tech companies make one?.
61,Adrian Mckee,"April 29, 2020",5," Great player, if this was a paid app I would definitely $$$. The only small criticism is the buttons are small a bigger play/pause button would be awsome."

On Android subtitles are not visible during casting to Chromecast. They are visible when watched on smartphone/tablet, though. I found a workaround to start the video on mobile device, with subtitles on (they're visible on mobile screen), then cast the whole device's screen from the system menu/notifications, not from VLC. VLC figures out that it is being cast so it stops playing video on mobile device as it plays on Chromecast. Subtitles now show in cast to Chromecast. However, this is a strange mix of cast whole screen and cast video from VLC (VLC is aware of the ongoing cast), the screen has to stay on (no locking) although nothing is playing on it, just big VLC streaming logo. But the subtitles are now visible. It'd be great to get a fix for this. Works great from an SMB share, too."

Which is an understatement and a mere review can't really capture the magnitude of my gratefulnes to the developers for having this program, and free aswell!! VLC is free (Availability) VLC supports different platforms (Cross platform) VLC doesn't need extra downloads to support any files you throw at it. It's actually fun to try and open random files with VLC, even something like .mkv (Matroska video format) which I know PS3 struggled back in the day and some other programs need codecs for and also phones need extra programs for, that often are either shady or no where up to speed. VLC is and will always be my choice for a video AND audio player (audio for PC at least). Most video players on Android just can't keep up!"

First I should say I am using VLC on my Sony Android TV. Before the latest update it was easy to add in a saved subtitle file (SRT) using the TV remote. You could navigate to the file and press OK and it would be added to the movie. After the update, using the remote, you can navigate to the subtitle file, but you can't move the cursor to highlight the file and select it. The only way you can do this is by using a mouse (a real pain). Further, before when you selected the file you got a pop-up saying the subtitle had been added, now no indication. Sure hope someone reads this and fixes it with the next release as it is really spoiling an otherwise great app."

It just somehow feel cleaner. Some things need work. One such thing is video list. Default behavior is to group videos by name. On more then one video group tapping it open the group and we can see information from there. It group videos in a list of one video if there is no other video with same six first letters. Now I can't find a way to show information for that one video.

1482,Robert Mott,"December 18, 2019",1, The latest update is a complete train wreck. I use it on my TV and for some reason in my networked directories it won't load any video that starts with a letter after G. The alphabet doesn't exist beyond G now.
1483,Dan Thompson,"January 4, 2020",4," I love the app most of the time, but it decides to parse music for no reason and while it's doing that you can't really do anything with it! 3 times in a week most recently! Aside from that though, it is very versatile and easy to use."
1484,Martyn Andrean,"December 22, 2019",2, It always cuts off the end of tracks abruptly. The casting feature has no way to adjust the volume which is far too loud by default. Otherwise it could be a good app.
1485,Mark Briggs,"December 19, 2019",1, This was a very good app until the recent upgrade. Sadly it no longer plays when sharing from YouTube. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but still no joy. I'm on Android 9 and totally up to date. 5 stars when it worked.
1486,Marc S,"January 8, 2020",4, The one thing missing from this app is the ability to sort files by modified date. I really think that this would make the app perfect. The rationale is a lot of times and you have new files you want them at the top because that's what you want to WATCH.
1487,Seth Kirk,"January 12, 2020",1," When casting you will either skip to the end or restart if you try to rewind. It's a bad experience. Even after pausing, going to the bathroom, then playing it restarts. Such a great computer app for a bad mobile app."
1488,Mutinta Handabile,"January 23, 2020",2," I can't fast forward the episodes I'm watching, which makes it hard for me to skip some parts I don't want to watch. Thought it was my settings on my phone but I checked and everything is alright. Other than that it's a fairly good app."
1489,Chunky Kun,"January 28, 2020",4," Thumbnails don't always update correctly, library doesn't always appear (requires data to be cleared), subtitles don't always appear. Love the UI, but the actual video player needs a lot of fixing."
1490,Joshua Lago,"February 18, 2020",2, Pitch is all over the place during playback. I use this app to check song mixes and it's become unusable when pitch is wildly inconsistent.
1491,Michael Theron,"February 16, 2020",4," Player experience is good however when the app in minimised and opened it will start the video from the start, screen sometimes freezes but overall experience is better than other players iv found"
1492,Kasim Kiyani,"February 19, 2020",2," Image freeze when fast forwarding video, skipping scene etc. Only way around it is playing mkv from restart. The only good video player without ads, and it stops on my chrome device"
1493,Brendan Lagani,"March 13, 2020",4," I love using vlc to play music audios but just after the last update, I can't seem to play music via Bluetooth using the app."
1494,SUSMITA ACHARJEE,"March 25, 2020",5, Helps to play any video or movie file
1495,Langelihle Ngqulunga,"March 31, 2020",5," It's an amazing media player! Here's a fun idea, make VLC support 360 video with all the interaction intact, that would be more amazing!"
1496,jayender suthar,"April 6, 2020",3, i cant stream video on vlc its crashing
1497,Aditya Sharma,"April 9, 2020",5, Best video player whether in pc or mobile... Vlc is the best
1498,trump j,"April 25, 2020",5, Lock screen Fastest forwerd and back smoth display
1499,Raditya Arga Putra,"January 17, 2020",4," there is a bug on the new version. When the button bar is hidden for a few minutes, it will dissapear. pressing the screen won't make it pop up anymore. This problem doesn't occur if i enable double tap to seek."
1500,Ken Cha,"December 4, 2019",1," Love the app but the latest ""update"" screwed up everything for me. In video my files are all grouped up in list when I wanted it grid form and I didn't want to use unsorted videos cause that just makes it harder to find what I want to find."
1501,A Google user,"December 5, 2019",5," VLC is the best video player by far! Thank you 5* EDIT: bug in new version, %% signs show everywhere when selecting ""Group videos by Folder"" in directory names. EDIT #2: I fixed it. I did this by going to Settings>Media Library Folders> and unckecking all video folders and then rechecking them :)"
1502,Ritesh Bokil,"December 8, 2019",1, M4a files are detected with a lower length. 3 minute songs are shown to be 30 seconds long with a progress bar as long too. The complete song plays but going to a particular part in the track is not possible.
1503,Nikhil Jain,"December 13, 2019",1," I am using REALME 3 pro. Since last update, this app hangs 99% of the time. Don't know what the developers are thinking. They need to sort out the issues ASAP."
1504,luca //,"January 3, 2020",2," It doesn't work that well... 😅 For example, many of the times I click on a file using the file manager, VLC does not start play anything at all, also after having chosen to open the file with VLC."
1505,Thaylen Sabre,"December 24, 2019",1," After the latest update, VLC won't again my device and add any new media I have added to my phone. This app was always so great and worked flawlessly, now it almost useless. Playlists are deleted constantly. Please put things back to working order."
1506,Shekhar Dhangar,"January 26, 2020",2, Earlier this app was at the best version. But somehow after the update the casting icon disappeared. I don't know how but I tried uninstalling and then again installing the app. Then too the casting icon is not there. Now I am unable to cast my content to my smart tv
1507,Logan Barnett,"February 19, 2020",5, Awesome media player. Resumes audio even if the phone is off and the app is closed.
1508,Mim Mim,"March 2, 2020",5, Highest quality video player ever in internet. But common options ( like playback speed) aren't show in screen.
1509,Ben Brewdog,"March 9, 2020",4," I give it a 4 still needs work in areas, but the biggest thing I happy it plays example 100 out 100 files unlike all other players only play 50 out 100."
1510,K. Thomas,"March 6, 2020",1, Never stops running in backup. Cant shut off. Too bad. Used to be my fav but now theres better that offer to close when exiting app
1511,omole emmanuel,"March 23, 2020",3, Can't download the subtitles
1512,Vikash Srivastava,"March 25, 2020",1, Cast feature not working
1513,Mohammed Hussein,"April 4, 2020",5, Perfect for playing all my media files.
1514,Jason Cunningham,"April 26, 2020",4, Easy app to use to watch and enjoy movies
1515,MiZtEr Yozo,"April 27, 2020",1," No ”Next and Back Button"", always back to start when you pause sa video."
1516,sexyrockchick94,"January 31, 2020",2, this app has always been my favourite vlc for the phone as I love it for the pc has always been fine last update has made it a bit more usable doesnt forget my music as often however it has lost all my playlists 😓
1517,Jack Jones,"January 11, 2020",2," Why the heck would the developers place previous, pause and next buttons right next to each other and leave so much space on either side. Many times I've skipped to the next song when all I wanted to do is pause/ play."
1518,fsxelw,"December 10, 2019",1," Gets stuck in Android Auto when playing a playlist which contains video as audio songs (actually it's not even a video just m4a container) which is really annoying and potentially dangerous when playing a playlist during driving, bc it doesn't respond. It also randomly deleted my playlists"
1519,Parikshit Soni,"December 4, 2019",4," The best easy to use media player, almost supports every video format (reason I prefer this player over others). Giving 1 less star just to demand a new feature to insert subtitles directly from searching online (this feature is available in rival player)."
1520,Rachel Coburn,"December 6, 2019",1," What was once a reliable app is now garbage. The titles are now scrolling, making the titles illegible. No option to change it back. Great example of ego driven ""improvements"" that just succeed in breaking otherwise useable software."
1521,Emily123,"December 31, 2019",1," I've used VLC for PC for about a decade with barely any issues, but for the android.. constant! There are some very annoying bugs happening with this particular app, one of them messing with my playlists and forgetting them entirely...FIX PLEASE! THANK YOU!!"
1522,Corey Pattison,"January 7, 2020",5," Five stars isn't enough! A galaxy of stars would be more accurate. I've been using this player for many many years. Perhaps since it's infancy. It's amazing how intuitive it is. Screen cast, chrome cast you name it! Thank you."
1523,Shivam Singh,"March 8, 2020",1," After android 10 update app is not working, it crashing and gets stuck on parsing media, remote playback is crashing, update it for android 10"
1524,M. R.,"January 23, 2020",1, Does not allow the sizing of the screen when in screen mirroring mode. It is annoying when the video size is larger in the TV and it's cropped so you can't see a rather large part of the actual screen
1525,Nagendiran M,"February 1, 2020",5, Video resize options available on bottom in previous versions that's very helpful and easy to use. Now that changed in options is slightly hard to use.
1526,mbeeta Richard Edgar.,"February 4, 2020",5," Its a good app ....i like it. The only issue with it, it yu cant begin the video from where you stopped. Incase you pause, yu hv to begin afresh."
1527,Xper User,"February 15, 2020",4, Why don't m4a files play anymore? They use to until a while back. I could play an mp4 and the audio from the m4a with the same name would play automatically. That doesn't happen anymore.
1528,Ozosh Maharjan,"February 12, 2020",1, It used to group my similar named videos. But not anymore. I loved the old version. New one sucks. Old UI is also far better
1529,santosh kumar,"March 8, 2020",4, Excellent app. It would be great if it supports subtitles on casting. It doesn't support subtitles on casting through Chromecast. Please update it Thanks
1530,Selina A-L,"March 17, 2020",2, It wouldnt let me play any link and even if it did it would only be for a few minutes before kicking me out of it and saying that it cant play what im trying to play.
1531,Omotilewa Olaifa,"April 4, 2020",3, It's not downloading subtitles.
1532,dave cee,"December 10, 2019",2, The update sucks. Using vlc has become a nightmare. The backlight doesn't go off after a video and the resume playback option doesn't work anymore. I've got to go through lists of videos just to find what I was watching previously and continue
1533,nix arias,"December 17, 2019",1," I don't know what happen to vlc these past few updates the subtitles aren't showing, i've always did the tutorials on how to activate the subs but it doesn't shown on all of my videos i have downloaded. Please fix this the substitles in android."
1534,Jonah Edobor,"January 11, 2020",1," I was enjoying this app up until this recent new update. Since the update, everything has been useless. My video don't resume from where i left off, the auto resume button doesn't respond anymore and my watched video mark no longer exist. Pls fix all these or you're going to lose users.ffs"
1535,Kenan Mercadal,"January 16, 2020",2, The label/title of the files in vlc are moving horizontally which is sooooo friggin unnecessary. Doesn't make any sense doing that cause it just makes it harder to locate a file for you have to wait for the words to stop moving like seriously what is that for. Annoying af.
1536,Bhaskar Jalan,"February 6, 2020",5," Everything one needs to watch films, video clips and even audio clips of video files. Definitely THE complete media player!"
1537,Doe Adokpah,"February 24, 2020",1, The repeat function does not work. It keeps playing one song despite the repeat all function is on!
1538,Steve Napkins,"February 23, 2020",1, Why is it when I pause this stupid app I will never resume when I hit play? That's a big problem you idiots need to fix. Everytime I pause I have to go to files and reload from there it's dumb and I no longer use it
1539,Joanne Campbell,"February 26, 2020",5," I've been using VLC for about 15 to 20 years. It is a ""must have"" app. It's my first choice for viewing videos."
1540,Carmen Hancock,"April 13, 2020",5, Been using vlc for at least 15 years and only an idiot would complain about it. Literally plays everything
1541,Felix Ng,"March 7, 2020",2," Only sort by name? Isn't sort by date the most used? And why is the overlay for brightness and volume change so big, it's as bad as the old iOS..."
1542,Narendra Prince,"March 28, 2020",5, I can't add the subtitle file please 🙏 help me
1543,Tech Raver,"March 11, 2020",5, Turns out my favourite video player app. I only wish the UI will get better like on MX Player. And Controls are little uncomfortable to handle.
1544,Sama Nik,"March 24, 2020",5, I waslooking for an app that can play the video that i want and after 6 app i download this app and this is the only one wich is working
1545,Polycarp Chinedu,"March 31, 2020",5, Very good and reliable.
1546,Lamar Qhar,"April 16, 2020",3, Fails to load subtitles 😣
1547,Pulkit Punea,"April 21, 2020",5, Add feature for audio subtitle
1548,christiana kunme,"April 29, 2020",5, I've loved this app for long. Recently it does not play some video formats except I use another app
1549,Glenn thisfieldisblank,"November 22, 2019",2, I'm really disappointed I've always loved VLC it's been my go-to for playing any kind of video and now I install this version and it's not playing anything except as a audio file... Update. Reinstalled because it was crashing. Now it won't play anything at all.
1550,Karl Churchill,"November 28, 2019",3," I do like VLC but as an audio player it has an annoying bug that causes it to speed up and slow down during music playback. Not by much and maybe some people will never notice it, but it's quite conspicuous to me."
1551,Fred L. Tate,"January 27, 2020",4," Hate the new update display. Before update had side by side thumbnails to scroll down through, now has one long row of thumbnails I have to scroll all the way down to find music I want. Much slower. Restore former display and I give you five stars again."
1552,Gold Ewata,"December 10, 2019",3, This updated version is not cool at all. A lot of things i used to do have stopped working. My videos do not playback- one of the most annoying things that can ever happen
1553,Chinu Z,"December 10, 2019",2," It's a good media player but the latest updates has messed up the experience. I just can't get the subtitles to download, they appear on the search, but they fail to download."
1554,M. Wiguna Saputra,"January 1, 2020",3, There's no marker / sign on video that i have watched. I should know how long duration that i have watched of each movie on video lists. Sometimes video can't continue from last minute that i have watched. I can't remember every movie that i have not finished. I need a clue / marker / sign.
1555,Canjac Canjar,"December 18, 2019",2, This app officially sucks since the latest updates! Destroyed all my playlists created w/earlier versions of this software. Displays file directory listing only with thumbnails. Will not group files w/similar content in file directory list. What the hell happened in this upgraded version?
1556,Susana Lopez,"December 29, 2019",2, Tried this app on my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and I didn't care for it too much. The volume is low plus it wouldn't let me pick what to have in my folders. It's all or nothing!! So I'm sorry but going to have to uninstall.
1557,Snowcone Guy,"January 3, 2020",2," There is no option to disable fast-forwarding and rewinding with gestures. This leads to the user often skipping through the video, even if the only intention was to change the volume or brightness."
1558,Likith Raj,"January 11, 2020",1, Vlc is really good video player but the main fault they remove few important things in an update in the new update they have removed the sort out by date option & i seriously couldn't differentiate between new video & the old one...Try to make it work better then other video players not to make it w...Full ReviewVlc is really good video player but the main fault they remove few important things in an update in the new update they have removed the sort out by date option & i seriously couldn't differentiate between new video & the old one...Try to make it work better then other video players not to make it worse #vlcforandroid
1559,Gin Gamesh,"December 27, 2019",4," I wish you do more improvements for the audio section, like customizable tags, jumping to next tracks without having a playlist, and the most important thing please don't reduce the resolution of the music cover on lock screen. Good luck 👍"
1560,Doug M,"January 8, 2020",4," Great app for playing video files on Android. Although, the latest update seems to have glitched the subtitle search/display features. ""Resuming"" a video file seems to be hit or miss is about my only complaint."
1561,Razvan Nicolae,"February 2, 2020",5," It is best video player accros all platforms. Stable, a lot of options easy to use ...including casting from anywhere.... device, network, web...."
1562,Jaz Gilles,"March 3, 2020",1, The list by Name (desc) is poorly done. It truncates some titles and not others which may be shorter. It also does not show any punctuation.
1563,Chad Jones,"January 28, 2020",5," Of all the countless media players I've used , either on phones or computers, VLC is by far the best. Never had any issues or complaints about it. Make your playlist, turn it on and close the screen an go about your business."
1564,Stephen Fynn,"February 6, 2020",2, It uses the same image thumbnail for multiple videos. This makes it difficult to differentiate between two videos.
1565,Bikram Dey,"February 18, 2020",5," Superb app, loved it too much, but new update has an issue that I cant find videos in the search section"
1566,punam chand lodha,"February 24, 2020",2, This is good but in this time this not show some videos and performance is very bad. It take a longer time to open
1567,Sandeep Vekariya,"March 5, 2020",1, The latest update is causing the app to crash often and video always starts from the beginning while switching between apps
1568,Dinesh Gupta,"March 11, 2020",5, google cast not properly work
1569,Thiago Diniz,"March 26, 2020",2, Subtitles download not working
1570,Bhargav Kondeti,"April 22, 2020",5, For videos &movies playing good
1571,Cartoon AndAnime2020,"February 1, 2020",1, All of a sudden music and song videos that I try to share from YouTube won't work but non music videos will share and stream just fine please fix this problem.
1572,Katherine Blackwater,"December 8, 2019",3, It used to be 5 stars. -1 because after the last update I can't continue listening to where I stopped (the app reverts to the main folder). -1 because it doesn't minimise anymore. It's otherwise perfect for my use.
1573,Sifǔ Anthony Tarasca,"December 9, 2019",1, The most recent update is horrible. I am unable to load music even though it shows that I transfered it to the music file. It just does not show up on the app. Very bad update.
1574,Disappointment,"December 5, 2019",1, The interface is so hard to work with. It's a dice roll to see if I can successfully queue another song or start playing it and delete the play queue I've set up. The most recent update also wiped all of my playlists
1575,rogers bonett,"December 5, 2019",3," In this November update, the eq isn't powerful. I don't like it. I used to use this app precisely because of the great and powerful equalizer. Now the Bass that come out from VLC is simply bad and not deep."
1576,Oleksandr Nigmatulin,"December 17, 2019",3, I use it on miBox Android TV. The latest version doesn't show all the files in the directory. It shows only first 65 files and folders. Please fix this
1577,Paul Thomas,"December 27, 2019",2, Devs still meddling and screwing everything up. Completely messed the aspect ratio. Display is incorrect on phone and tablet and resize doesn't help. Chromecast is okay so issue is just with app rendering. Unable to use. 2 stars off. If it ain't broken don't fix it FFS.
1578,Oluwafemi Muyideen Olaiya,"December 28, 2019",5," Very nice apps for playing video but this last update is filled with bugs. Minimize, pause or the light of your screen went off then you will need to start playing all over from your phone file manager. The vlc apps will be closed. Fixed this bugs"
1579,Abe Alexander,"December 26, 2019",2, It cannot find my media files. I configured VLC to scan all directories. I don't even have an SD card installed. All folders in vlc library folders list say no files. Not true! I have many playable files in those directories.
1580,Mister Twisty,"December 23, 2019",1," Constant crashes on the latest update. Had absolutely no problems before. Crashes on app switches, on locking my phone screen, on switching songs, etc. If it ain't broke, dont fix it guys"
1581,denmark eight,"January 25, 2020",1," What happened to VLC.? Before, it was one of the best media players out there. Now, it won't even scan my media folder properly, and new videos copied on my storage won't show on the videos list. That's sad."
1582,Femi Awojobi,"February 3, 2020",5, It's about the pop up player. It made me fall in love with the app and am still. Great job to VLC team.
1583,Homa Dimkpa,"February 7, 2020",4, Good app but since the last update it's having glitches. Minimize app and you have to start video from afresh. That is stressful
1584,Obadiah King Israel,"February 7, 2020",5," Perfect, has the best loop, replay. Touch screen, volume control, touch screen go back, go forward. Will test other features then repost."
1585,Yasin Syn,"February 8, 2020",5, The best and the most satisfied video / audio player on both PC and Android plus with extra loud volume and equalizer
1586,Kevin M.,"February 14, 2020",5," Perfect for watching videos, open source, and all the features I could ever need. I love this app. Thanks"
1587,Mike Davis,"February 20, 2020",5, VLC is my favorite media player by far. The options and controls make it so much more versatile than any other I've ever used.
1588,Jason Carver,"February 29, 2020",4, Detailed interface and easy menus. Built-in equalization and device integration.
1589,Mohamed Amezian,"March 19, 2020",5, Very good media player.
1590,Muazum Aziz,"March 22, 2020",4, Best way to play videos or audios 😍

1593,Christina Duncan,"February 4, 2020",4, Great player. The picture in picture feature locks up and will not close.
1594,Justin Morton,"February 6, 2020",1, Edit - Pixel 4XL running latest. Android 10. VLC no longer saving your spot in a video. Resets back to the beginning. 1 star until it's fixed.
1595,Mike,"December 11, 2019",3," It's a really good app but something broke when i updated it. Now it doesn't show the right thumbnails for the videos. Instead, all the video thumbnails are a jpg that is not in any video"
1596,Cujo,"January 4, 2020",5," Easy to use and the only music player that has a non terrible UI. In addition it will play songs without tags, so I can finally get my full library on my phone instead of only the first thousand."
1597,Joe Smith,"January 1, 2020",1, Version 3.2.6 slows the movie playing. The tapping for 10 seconds fast seeking shows an annoying ugly shape which covers one fifth of the movie screen making it's hard to watch the movie. I do not recommend upgrading to version 3.2.6.
1598,Chris Rich,"January 7, 2020",2, Always clones while casting after recent update. This significantly reduces usefulness as I am unable to view video content on my TV in full screen and continue to use other apps on my device.
1599,Shubham Chakraborty,"February 7, 2020",5, Love this app. Just a thing that i want in this app in future updates... Add a NEW tag on videos that are added recently in the storage
1600,Saloni Jain,"February 6, 2020",5, Please develop a feature in which the functions tab of pause play stays visible on video screen. Its very annoying to double tap on screen to see the functions.
1601,Mahadi Matsawily,"February 8, 2020",4, My VLC can not play over other apps as overlay. Previously this feature was available. Please help

1604,Oleg Dychenko,"February 23, 2020",5, Perfect and very simple to use. Almost feels like it's comfier than even the PC version.
1605,Brad Dean,"March 10, 2020",5, Best media player on PC and mobile devices for years upon years. 5/5. Must have
1606,Benedict Fortune,"March 22, 2020",5, It's a brilliant app that lets you watch movies that so many good settings and is very it's very effective like you can even download subtitles

1610,Robert Laffoon,"April 25, 2020",5, Works great on my Android fone!
1611,Earl Baversjo,"February 17, 2020",4, I make significant use of subtitles and I think the app needs a rethink for wider view choices for picking videos or subtitles. Inscrutable is not a good app design option!
1612,Ryan Mitchell,"December 4, 2019",1," Why does playback speed still not work past 1.10x speed without time-streching audio enabled in advanced settings? This bug has been present since the release of this app, the old VLC beta app that is no longer available didn't have this problem."

Before writing this review, I was asked to answer whether the app's description fits the actual app. And it completely does! It really is the best option out there if you want a music and video-player that is easy to handle, as well as performant and offers very high compatibility. I tested the streaming and local network features and they worked flawlessly. About the setting I liked that it is possible to switch themes on the fly without restarting the app. In other apps that is necessary but here the process of choosing and comparing themes is much more user-friendly. What I would like to be added though is an option to set the size of the grid when you set your library view to grid mode. The ability to set tags and covers would be a nice addition too. I really like this app and the fact that it's COMPLETLY FREE"

Random glitches like videos playing as audio with the first-frame thumbnail as the video feed. Constantly losing its place in longer playlists.

Excellent player but it's missing a ""go to next track in folder"" button. When shooting dozens of videos you just wanna go through quickly.

Frustrating and inconsistent quirks: When it is paused, and then you click to resume, this app might work correctly and continue playing. Or this app might stay open, but close that particular mp3 file so you've lost your place. Or this app might totally shut down, so you've again lost your place. If this happens, then when you reopen the file, maybe it will start where you had left off, and maybe it won't. Losing your place isn't a big deal if it's a music file, but if it's an audiobook or podcast, then you'll have to do some seeking. These annoying quirks happen from the lock screen, and when using completely open. Doesn't seem to be a pattern. Randomly works, and randomly fails. Please fix!!! It's so close to being nearly perfect! This is really a really good media player. I started using it on the desktop computer because it was a small file size that played almost any file type you asked it to play. I use it almost exclusively for MP3 files. The thing I love about the app is that you can increase the playing speed in small or large steps (and it adjusts the frequency, of course, so your audiobook doesn't sound like chipmunks.) This is a powerful feature! I wish you could fast-forward the file and not accidentally bump it up to play the next file (like every car stereo, sharing the FF and the NEXT button, so one little slip of your finger and you will lose your place)."

But lately, the quality of VLC has dropped. While playing videos if you move the seek bar, it freezes the video and won't play at all.

Also, in swiping backwards vlc pauses for one swipe, then unpause for next swipe, then pauses for next swipe, then unpause for next and so on.

Most importantly, I can't switch to landscape mode from portrait without triggering PiP , and when I enlarge the PiP view, either the video goes back to the beginning, or the app crashes multiple times. Also, I would like customizations for what can be used in the lock mode, and what cannot. It would also be great if we could give a command to automatically stop playing after the current song ends, while still listening to it (I don't wanna go to the Playlist and then delete stuff and all that). Also, two other things that would be appreciated would be ability to custom-group media, and support for Google assistant. Do this and you have 5 stars from me. But fix the rotation bug first!"

3603,not sure,"November 4, 2019",4, Really wish you would include a folder option as not all tracks are properly tagged and with a few 100gb of music it sucks to have half a cd in the unknown/various artists folders. I'd be willing to rate 5 stars once a folder option is included.

Period. First off. You can use it to open the app when pressing the vlc logo but playback buttons non functional. Also it doesn't save your place or even what item you are playing in the widget. So you have to go back to the app find what you were playing and manually select it every time. It saves place on individual tracks but you need to press play on the album and skip forward to the track you want every time otherwise it will play one track and stop. This is very simple stuff that needs to be fixed ASAP. Not recommended. Unfortunate because VLC has been my go to for years on the computer.

At max volume in a quiet room I sometimes still can't understand what characters are saying. The 200% volume setting does nothing on my tablet. Volume booster apps stopped working with vlc. Other apps are loud and clear.   Another very annoying bit is the app gives priority to a file's Title tag, not the file name itself, and to change a Title tag on an mkv file requires spending a couple minutes per video stripping the tag on the computer. It's doable, but a very irritating hassle.   I've switched over to mx player and neither of these things are issues. Mx player is really very great for me so far."

The m3u files are all added to the ""Playlists"" page, but if I try to view a playlist it just shows as empty.

(There should be a seperate section where we can access play lists. An option like save current play list may please be added.  2.

For Audio: No way create playlist from playlist tab, you have to click the three dots on the audio file and select ""add to playlist"". This is the ONLY way to create a playlist. No way to edit playlists. Once you've finally figured out this app's goofy way of creating an audio playlist, there's no way to edit it. Your only (useful) option in the playlist tab is the ability to delete an already existing playlist. For Video: There's absolutely NO WAY to create a playlist AT ALL! You can click the three dots on the video file and select ""play as audio"", and for some reason that adds it to a playlist, but you can't add multiple video files to a playlist using this method. So if you want to create different playlists for your videos, use Power Media instead. For some reason, the morons behind developing the VLC mobile app thought it would be a bright idea to exclude the ability to create video playlists from the mobile app. Don't bother with this app."

I like that it allows me to sort music files by artist, genre, etc., as well as add them to a playlist. The UI is very easy to navigate and it does what I need it to do. My one issue is that only about half my music files are showing up in the Audio screen. When I navigate to the Directory, I can find and play the files that aren't otherwise visible, but they are all stored in the same folder on an SD card, so I'm not sure why some of them don't appear in the Audio screen. It doesn't appear to be a format issue either as nearly all the music files on my card are .mp3s.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it takes 2 or 3 long scans, and sometimes it's so stubborn that I have to delete all app data and settings, reconfigure, and only then does it find my new files. Autoscan never works. No matter what scanning is always slow."

Something as simple as navigating up a directory is impossible, or if it is possible, then I've yet to learn how. Another problematic aspect is playlists - I can play all files in a folder no problem, but the problems arise when I want to play files from 2 or more folders or even just add more files to my current playlist. It has the same playback issues as the PC version - if you want to loop a video, on most videos, expect VLC to skip the first seconds when replaying as well as a delay between the video ending and the video restarting (though this seems to be less noticable in ""play as audio"" mode). And for some reason, VLC insists that it will play back where I left off, it will even do this sometimes when looping a video, i.e., video ends, VLC jumps to the middle instead of the start. And, strangely, the option to turn this feature off is missing. Very annoying. It has many big and small quirks like this that just make the whole experience frustrating."

However one programmer's shallow, unimaginative, lazy thinking can (and very often does) ruin a formerly excellent piece of software. This version's utter obliviousness to the user's need for the software to _hold the user's place_ (in an 11-hour file or 40-item playlist, e.g.) for more than a few minutes' pause, is enough for me to abandon this technically far superior phone for one whose vlc version does not 'feature' such forgetfulness."

4749,Isuru Sampath,"April 17, 2019",2," Used to be the best player around, but with the recent updates, it just fails to play fullscreen, due to some error in the way they have implemented fragments. If you have an older version, keep it untill the issue is fixed!"
4750,Mike Perrett,"October 18, 2018",3," Like the interface but 2 problems 1. It keeps forgetting the contents of my playlists, and they take an age to create, so it's very frustrating. 2. It doesn't seem to be possible to reorder a playlist."
4751,Bob KItt,"April 17, 2019",5," audio delay was the big standout feature for me. it is missing after update. we could match words to the people speaking, but not now. maybe we could have that back. great app!"
4752,Yash Bhatia,"March 21, 2019",5," Absolutely perfect. The app has so many features, and I challenge you to find a format it can't play! And you get all of this for absolutely free, with no ads or IAPs! Thanks devs!"
4753,Paul Kolgatin,"April 26, 2019",3," After the update: Interface usability downgraded, decoding acceleration lags, does not remember the last position of playback and audio stream/subtitles chosen, screenfit bugs.

4754,Goldmines Zee,"April 21, 2019",2, I just have updated the app but when i search for my playlist i get a notification as ' vlc has stopped' i need a solution immediately. There is another problem as when i transfer some audio files in my phone the vlc don't show them untill i reinstall the app. I need solution fir both problems .
4755,Carson Murray,"January 18, 2019",4," Awesome for listening to transferred old cd and tape recorder music! 4 stars because it doesnt support reading aiff metadata, so songs don't populate by album or artist, even if the files contain that information. Otherwise this is hands down the best app. no ads"
4756,Patrick Roberts,"April 28, 2019",4, Good but... If you delete a file on your device VLC still keeps file in the App and does not let you remove from library even though the file no longer exists. Aside from this odd issue it is perfect. I had to clear the cache and so on for it to go away.

4762,Ehren Loudermilk,"September 1, 2019",3," It's open source and can play anything. But it doesn't do any of that particularly well. Of the 3 media players on my phone, it is by far the least reliable and most buggy. It absolutely refuses to use subtitle files correctly or even at all sometimes."
4763,Lukas Serbin,"September 20, 2019",2," I am glad it can play mkv files as that's the only reason I needed video player app. However after a 20-minute episode, my phone temperature was the same as when it's charging with supercharger. Definitely not normal."
4764,Farrow 1,"September 24, 2019",2, Hate the fact i can't turn it off. When bluetooth connects it just plays and its not accessable to stop it. So annoying. Every time. This should be a toggle option. I had to uninstall even though i love all the rest of it.
4765,Wipe Out Israel,"October 17, 2019",2, Doesn't play files from the beginning. Confirmation to resume from last position doesn't work either. VERY annoying - constantly have to stop what I'm doing and restart the song. Hopefully this can be fixed in future updates

4808,Prime Menethril,"August 25, 2019",1," Doesn't turn off. Ever. After you've selected a song, it runs in the background even if you kill the app. Not certain if it does the same with video, don't much care.

Also there is no Equalizer and missing is Black Theme. I think if you fix these issues everyone will uninstall MX player and start using VLC player.
4854,Matt Rinker,"September 5, 2019",3, Does a lot of awesome things that most media players don't do. The only thing is that there's this bug that doesn't save your progress on a video/song so it restarts when you go back into it after closing the app. Would be nice to see this fixed in an update.
4855,sergio,"September 22, 2019",4," How about a ""Recently Added"" section! 
How about when tap on ""A-B Repeat"" a slider bar drops/opens to set start/end instead of using the song's playing slider as the ""A-B Repeat"" screen closes having to open it again to complete the process."

4875,Shashwat Vatsa,"November 18, 2018",3," The app keeps on crashing. Once minimised, the file needs to be opened from the location itself as the app crashes and not often but every time. The app needs regular updates which are very rare."

4883,Brendan Sousa,"April 17, 2019",1, The last update has really messed things up. Songs in my library don't show up. Refreshing the app doesn't help. Restarting the phone and app doesn't help either. I've deleted and reinstalled the app twice and the problem still persists.

4891,Adrian Hope,"June 26, 2019",2, it still will not update its filelist unless you uninstall and reinstall the app. have they just left this bug in to get a fake download filecount to make it look as though more people are using it instead of just redownloading it every time it becomes unresponsive?
4892,Renaldy M,"June 26, 2019",3," Please let us enable/disable the playback.

I do not recommend this app unless you enjoy creating and recreating playlists. EDIT: The old version listed songs by artist when I went into GENRE.

4918,Col R,"November 7, 2018",3, Was great but every so often refresh stops working and won't find your files or remove old ones. Seems to be no other way but to uninstall and reinstall meaning you have to change all your settings all over again. Frustrating.

4960,A Google user,"January 27, 2019",4," Downloaded because OSS+advertised as EDITOR. Doesn't edit a lot/cut/join only ""equalise""(no idea)?? Need compact(est) editor..*LOVE* FOSS modern Angelic Superheroes not a small thing I owe my loyalty. This does play but lacks a bit wish it was all :'( <3"
4961,Eddie Barnes,"March 24, 2019",1," I don't know what you've done, but my VLC refuses to load my LAN HDD's. I'm using a Galaxy S9. Whenever i go onto the network browser it just sits there saying loading. Before this i would reccomend this app to everybody. But now it's useless in my opinion."
4962,Jeet Karia,"January 10, 2019",4, Great app and works really well it all formats however one major flaw I see is that it doesn't have a stop button. I have to press the back button each time to exit a video which seems kind of silly? Maybe you could look at implementing that?
4963,PREM KUMAR P,"May 7, 2019",5," definitely a best video player. But if we able to drag and change the position of subtitles could be better while so many people like me prefer fit screen option . when we go for fitscreen, half of the subtitle is getting hidden. pls fix this soon."
4964,Louis Liew,"April 17, 2019",4," Only complain I have is after a recent update, t refresh feature does not actively check for new videos being added to my phone anymore. It used to be very auto but now I have to press refresh a few times to get my new videos to show up"
4965,Harsh Shrivastava,"November 18, 2018",4," Best multimedia app but they should add lyrics option on the music player, and when we close the app the now playing playlist closes, we have to reopen and reselect the song to play. While its UI can be improved. But over all its awesome."
4966,Chinmayee Rout,"November 24, 2018",3, It is nice for playing videos coz I upgraded to this version as it supports almost all formats of videos. But it does not play audio files at once and sometimes never plays.I did not find any solution for it.
4967,Nihanth Manyam,"April 27, 2019",3," I was very good for watching all videos, grouping is great. ihave been using this for quite a while now but donno what's wrong with it now. after the update it closes suddenly and frequently and its irritating"
4968,A Google user,"January 27, 2019",2," Nice interference,has good quality of video playing,but low stars because it has some bug's, manytimes while am playing the video on landscape mode the video is not playing,only the audio and subtitles were running out,please fix the bug soon"
4969,Allan Brereton,"April 11, 2019",1," Crashed five out of five times, moments into starting a song, since the last update. I also turned off the automatic library check, and it does it upon opening regardless. Please get to fixing."
4970,A Google user,"September 24, 2018",2, Positive first: It's nice that you can exclude some folders from library. Negative: Music keeps speeding up and slowing down ever so slightly which gives pitch slides too. The same mp3s play correctly in other players.
4971,Privyet Suka,"March 29, 2019",1, there's no way to change artist and album info so all of the songs are lumped together under one artist. I also moved a bunch of song files from one phone folder to another now I have duplicate songs that won't play and won't allow me to delete. these 2 issues make this app unusable
4972,Jason Cole,"October 11, 2018",3," You can't choose the way your files are listed, beyond alpha/rev alpha. That's really annoying. There's other UI nitpicks I have as well, not sure why this is an editors choice. The PC version is really good...step it up dudes...smart phones are way more relevant now."
4973,Steven Ebuka Onyejekwe,"August 23, 2019",2," It was an amazing user experience for me but you could make it better by adding lyrics for musics and also add subtitle website when downloading as I can't find them. Also, when i play a song it stops, i have to keep clicking and clicking continously before it starts"
4974,Not In Use,"December 22, 2018",4," good media player. can't play tvheadend streams by just typing in the ip and port which is a little disappointing. all it will say is ""192.168.0.119:9981 is not streamable"" or some other generic read error. but good for other use."
4975,PARAG GHORPADE,"May 26, 2019",1," The update mentions multitasking shutdown fixed! They did a terrible job! whenever I open any media file from file manager using VLC, and switch tasks it abruptly shuts down! On top of all they plainly Lie about the update! Useless team .really disappointed!! phone: redmi note 5 pro!"
4976,Deepan Raj,"October 26, 2018",4, Needs a toggle to switch from resume playback to start from beginning.. it resumes even when history is off and confirm resume is the only way to start from beginning.. which I find annoying... I don't want VLC to remember where I left after I exit the app
4977,Wlqui Qui,"April 3, 2019",4, Best free player around. But the new release have a problem that when playing video. If user turn off screen that pause the video. When on again the video use to continue playing but now it just hangs there. Need to restart app to continue
4978,Roy Tan,"April 9, 2019",4," If we could go back to the last played song with the option to start at last played position, each time we close and reopen the app, then it would be 5 stars. Hope to see this feature in future updates. Thanks!"
4979,yash kumar,"October 8, 2018",4, Amazing.... this is better than other apps because it can run all the videos which cannot run in other video players... But it is too slow and so many features are absent...kindly improve so that I can give five star
4980,make it simple,"April 15, 2019",3," Last update was good, after the recent update I am not able to open the app from recent used app, if I minimise the application and then try to open it again it shows black screen, please fix the problem, it is happening every time since the recent update."
4981,Ghieth 93,"April 12, 2019",3," there's something wrong with the ""back button"" process. When entering a folder that contains videos and then trying to back to the main videos page, there's a glitch !"
4982,Titin Sahoo,"January 13, 2019",1," Just a bug I have been experiencing recently, VLC is not detecting new media files. Say I downloaded a new song, but it does not show up automatically in the Audio section, so it is a little bumming."
4983,Leen Martinez,"April 17, 2019",1," after the update i could no longer play seamlessly my HD videos on from a NAS connected via network/wifi on my samsung s10+. even videos which played seamlessly before the update, all video files wont play as it keeps buffering every few seconds. hope this will be address asap."
4984,Eldon River,"December 3, 2018",2," Love the app, best I've tried, runs very smoothly. The only problem I have is that whenever i go to swipe up the touchscreen buttons on my samsung s8 I delete things off my playlist, utterly confusing when im listening to audiobooks."
4985,cj matthews,"May 10, 2019",5, I've downloaded almost every media player and had nothing but disappointment until I downloaded this one. I can say after 1 month of using it I've had not one issue of any kind. Great player.
4986,Dheeraj jaiswal,"September 29, 2018",4, App is very good but the latest version is working well in my device moto z play 8.0 The issue is when I want to rotate my device to landscape mode while playing video it converted into PIP mode. I'm not able to see video in full screen mode. Please resolve the issue
4987,sujan k,"January 18, 2019",5," last version is fine but this latest version removed one feature that is forwarding and backwarding video can be done by just sliding on the screen now we can't do in this latest version that is very dispointing,very inconvenient forwarding video on the bar is very inconvenient"
4988,Brandan Blevins,"April 17, 2019",1," Doesn't support SMB 2/3, which means it can't access my file share. SMB 1 is riddled with security flaws, so I'm not turning it back on. Not much use for this app until it supports secure protocols."
4989,anonymous angel,"April 19, 2019",1," The application automatically plays the video that is next in the queue while the current video is still playing and therefore, the current video never gets to the end. I hope they fix this."
4990,Shadywhtboy22,"October 14, 2018",4," Second to none for videos, but if you add an album with various artists it will not keep them together in the album tab. Also seems to have problems reading some video formats on an SD card."
4991,Avy Sark,"November 13, 2018",3," I've had few problems so far but now, upon clicking tracks, it won't play the ones selected but others which are far up or down the list. Tried uninstalling and refreshing, it won't work properly."
4992,Anna-Maria Siwka,"May 14, 2019",1, it used to great. now it is rubbish. won't refresh. a lot of unnecessary features. and now i have found out it asks to record audio. spyware. uninstalling.
4993,Phone Acct,"April 25, 2019",1," Clunky, awful menu that has gotten far worse with time and my grandma can figure out where my media files are on my phone faster than this thing. Still, it's VLC, so its free and it plays everything at least."
4994,A Google user,"February 16, 2019",5, Thats the thing you say its jusy plays this app is for boosting your volume always tead before you you write your nonsense for everyone to see .....😒 The app is nice but you have to be careful with the equalizers coz you speaker may get damaged if you did the equalizers high
4995,Artyom R,"November 4, 2018",3," It stops playing music when I turn off the screen, then I gotta press the ""play"" button on my bluetooth headphones and it will play for a bit longer just to stop again"
4996,A Google user,"May 7, 2019",1," What happened? This app was brilliant. Nice simple and easy to use. Now it's clunky, loses my place and won't parse new media without being reinstalled. Trying to use this for work purposes and you have spoiled that for 22 children with useless updates that have ruined the app."
4997,Robert Massena,"December 8, 2018",2," Would give this app 5 out of 5 if not for one issue. Every video that is uploaded into it, there is 2 of it. Double every single video. If I delete one, they both disappear. Besides that, love this app very much."
4998,A Google user,"April 10, 2019",1," I knew VLC as the go-to player on a pc, but on my phone it has many bugs. The latest is that the ""playlist"" option no longer appears. I create playlist, but cant use it."
4999,Junior M,"October 1, 2018",4," Only issue I have with this is App is the disappearing playlists.Its not a big issue ,but it's annoying that I have to keep recreating my playlists.It is unmatched when it comes to playing music and videos.Playlist need work though."
5000,Saswata Chakraborty,"December 15, 2018",3," App is pretty amazing. But I hate the fact that if I want to turn the brightness up in between a video, the app increases the entire device brightness instead of the app only which means after leaving the app, I need to again go yo Display settings and adjust the device brightness."
5001,Dip Mitra,"November 20, 2018",4, overall the it's great but one thing that's very annoying and ruining the usability of the app that if pip is on from the app settings the video will go to pip mode when turned into landscape mode and it won't go full screen on landscape mode it will just go in pip mode. please fix this issue.
5002,Rudy Rudisill,"June 2, 2019",5," Best of the Best for ALL platforms!! I have used VLC for 10years on Android, Windows and Linux, not once have i had any issue. Thats saying alot because i use my devices as my TV and watch Videos and listen to music everyday. Thanks VLC"
5003,The Creator Hub,"June 8, 2019",1, Tried again newly updated version but still media library doesn't load properly. Sort by file name not working and worst part is it is showing weird files like idx.m3u8. I love this player but file arrangement is very very bad. switching back to MX player.
5004,Catalin,"June 1, 2019",1, 'How to use' overlay appears every time you open.the app. On a tv is annoying because you have to pause and play again (probably on a touch device goes away by touching am empty area) still its damn annoying every time.
5005,T Burt,"June 10, 2019",2," It doesn't play ""every"" media file type. I can't play DRM protected music files (unless I am doing it wrong) that I put on my Android phone from iTunes. The computer version is still better."
5006,Barhma Casting House,"June 21, 2019",3," A Really Great Player specialy for Pc. But for App Please can u upgrade 10 sec tap to Forward or Backward, & A screen shot option. & for music Player more Resquesting Volume increase & to make playlist option as of Pc option. Would be Greatlly Thankfull. ~×~Happy Music Day~×~"
5007,Steve Holty,"June 23, 2019",1," VLC for Android has gone downhill. (still love it for PC). Lately, on my phone, the app suddenly quits. It also does not resume where it left off. Now I use Podcast Addict, which does everything and then some."
5008,Phawinpon Chotwanvirat,"July 30, 2019",4," Everything works fine but annoying bug for Bluetooth device. During I'm playing videos in playlist with Bluetooth headphones aptX connected, the VLC will disconnect Bluetooth headphones everytime after moving to next video. I can play the same videos in Google photos without this problem."
5009,Robbie Turner,"July 31, 2019",1, After casting a few movies and having it lock up and having to restart the movie over and over again .... it was time to move on. I downloaded MX Player and it is much more stable and has many other excellent features that vlc just doesnt have.
5010,Orochi,"August 20, 2019",4, The only problem vlc has - auto finding new media file just been downloaded on the storage. sometimes it doesn't catch the new file/files on the gallery even if refreshed manually. that is the reason i'm giving it 4*. on the other sides it's the best media player on android market.
5011,Eric,"September 9, 2019",4, All the crashes on Android 10 have been resolved. Looks like app is stable again. The Android TV app is still glitchy when i scroll around in the menus but it is usable (the beta constantly asked for login info when using SMB shares) but the regular version just has the GUI glitches
5012,Tabaré Naya-Lima,"November 23, 2019",5, Best video and audio app out there. Supports basically all formats!
5013,Samuel Theuri,"November 26, 2019",5, Nice. Great UI. Easy to get subtitles. Quality controls

5030,Alexa Crandall,"March 10, 2019",4, Really good video player! -it can play without video/screen on -can make playlists -can play in background -The only problem is that it'll become silent for a few seconds in the beginning of a video when it's in a playlist..
5031,Kp Harish,"April 5, 2019",4," The app is very good except one thing, all the videos are cluttered in one long page. The directories also show all file types which are not audio or video. So its very hard to find a video."
5032,Grace Miller,"May 13, 2019",1," was the best app for my audio files. started ""parsing media"" all the time a couple of months ago, and today, it completely lost all of my files. sad. now I have to find a new media player😟"
5033,A Google user,"November 11, 2018",5," Mind blowing app, without any irritating ads. Just videos grouping on folder wise should also be there (as in MX player). Rest all is prefect. Audio only playback, no ads, rewind fast forward etc are mind blowing. Thanks VLC."
5034,Gordon Dragons,"December 4, 2018",1, Tried to watch some episodes of my favourite TV show and I only got audio. Tried finding a solution online and got absolutely nowhere. Tried a different app and it worked straight away. Always thought VLC was the best and have been using it on PC for years. Disappointing!
5035,Kurt Doerfel,"March 15, 2019",1, [UPDATED TO 1 STAR BECAUSE PITCH STILL CHANGES THROIGHOUT TRACK] It's good for the most part. There is one bug where audio files pitch changes at the start of a track which actually gets pretty annoying. Please fix.
5036,A Google user,"October 30, 2018",5," Using vlc since 2005 (pc). She devs should to look into though, when changing video speed to 1.1 or 1.2x, and casting to CC, audio gets choppy. May just be me, or a CC limitation, (HTC M8, droid6.0, vlc 3.0.13, CC 2, wifi AC1200, 1080p MKV x265)."
5037,adam purvis,"May 6, 2019",1, the app functions great that is until I get a phone call and the screen will not return the video after it ended and I have to exit out and select the video only to have to find my place again.
5038,little rookiie,"April 14, 2019",2," I'm using a Pixel XL device and my buttons are on the screen , and with the last update when I watch videos in landscape and pause it the button bar comes up and it squeezes the image into a compreesed one , which did not happen in previous versions .. please fix this"

5040,Paul Neem,"June 2, 2019",4," The Android version's not bad. Unfortunately, one can't access metadata (such as comments and tags). Unlike VLC for WinOS, this version doesn't support ReplayGain. That's a pity."
5041,Sirish Nair,"December 15, 2018",2," The Cast feature causes the Mobile to reboot. If are using the cast feature of the VLC app, and you try to close the cat opeartion, it forces the mobile reboot automatically. It is a showstopper defect. Kindly fix this defect on priority."

5043,halla1rw,"January 21, 2019",3," it's great because it actually plays non-mp3 files, which countless players on here don't do. However, it's been continuously ""Parsing"" (looking for files on the device) so much that my favorites list keeps disappearing."
5044,dariush karamati,"September 20, 2018",5," Loved it. No ads. All i need. Just please add following: 1: Control music and video without unlocking display or maybe voice commands for next, previous and so on 2: Displaying video and music in folders, only media folders"

5046,Jaimin Joshi,"December 22, 2018",1, after receiving call it's not working. I tried twice to open but VLC isn't running. I have another way open VLC then select media but every time doing this is pathetic. video don't start from where i left watching. every time it's starting from beginning.
5047,Duane Kuntz,"October 9, 2018",5, Great app. Use it almost exclusively for home viewing of movies and listening to music. I love how you can define loop length and loop video and music!
5048,Señor XREY,"October 21, 2018",3," I've use the desktop version for years to avoid the spying that WMP subjects us to. Love it! However, the mobile version often can't be stopped, requiring one to power cycle their HTC M9 device to make it STFU. Not good."
5049,A Google user,"September 28, 2018",4, Just recently downloaded this app and i really like it. I can finally watch movies without them freezing and buffering every two minutes. I tried quite before this one and they all sucked. So far this one has worked really good for me. I suggest downloading it
5050,Michael Burdett,"October 15, 2018",2, This used to work fine and I have used VLC on my PC for years. For some reason on Android this cannot play ANYTHING without skipping and making weird noises to the point where you can't listen to anything.
5051,David Breach,"May 10, 2019",2, I'm not sure what happened but since the last update I think the app thinks its on a tablet and not a phone. The menus and lists of videos run off the screen. I can't even see the buttons to press. It is now simply impossible to use.
5052,Melanie Jenkins,"February 20, 2019",1," takes forever to load your music. If you flip away from the app, it ""loses"" the main screen of what you were listening to so you have to start again."
5053,Saurabh Singh,"January 28, 2019",3," While playing in audio mode and lock the home screeen of phone, audio gets stop automatically. And if user wants to continue listening, he/she must keep phone unlocked. I hope this will be fixed soon. Thanks"
5054,Dániel Hargitay,"April 9, 2019",2," Great video player, but still haven't solved the issue of not being able to delete files on SDcard. Still has to use another app for that and VLC tends to not recognizing file changes, which always results a full data clean and resetting prefferences."
5055,Kiruba Shankar,"February 19, 2019",5," The best Video Player. Period Hated MX Player for their ads and video streaming service, was looking for an alternative and found VLC Player. No ads,no extras. Just a pure Video Player experience. Thank you."
5056,Livan Garcia,"November 25, 2018",3," Nowhere near the PC version... Freezes sometimes and I have to reboot the phone (pulling battery out) because it freezes everything, so buttons don't respond. Screen looks as if someone cracked it up."
5057,Steve Clelland,"September 16, 2018",2," Really dislike this app. It often reparses my music files which takes a long time. Frequently misreads files so I will get multiple instances of the same album. I don't understand why it gets ""Editors Choice"". Someone's getting bribed somehow"
5058,Ilong Ofiligan,"December 18, 2018",5, The best player I ever had. The great thing is that it can get access to all of my network files at home and can be connected with my Chromecast Audio. Playing all of my music is easy.
5059,A Google user,"June 25, 2019",4," I love this app for watching movies, web series and listening to songs (mp3). favourite part is I can download subtitles for everything in the app itself 😘 one thing I didn't like is I don't have a automatic MP3 player everytime i have to choose for songs pls update the mp3 player"
5060,Nitesh Srivastava,"December 30, 2018",3," Good App but needs improvement. Subtitle does not work using google chromecast. Also when disconnect the app from casting to TV, video does not work though we can hear audio. We have to resstart the app after disconnection from casting."
5061,Mitchell Carney,"March 28, 2019",4, It works great but why does it not retain your position in a song when you pause it? after a few seconds it backs out completely! This is highly frustrating!
5062,John L,"February 7, 2019",4," Been using vlc for years on my pc. Recently added to Android Auto, then you took that away due to Google getting their panties in a wad. No problem: install an older version and never update it. Been going strong in my truck for a year now."
5063,Richard Eiken,"April 1, 2019",5," One of the best media players, I have used on my pc for over 10 years. was glad to find it for android 2 years ago and recommend it always, due to wide range of videos it can play"

5065,Paul Rodsted,"April 19, 2019",2, Htc 10 Not happy.... Since last google update vlc is playing up.... It is saying it has no media files on start up and sits loading for a minute or 2 every time.... Also takes upto a minute to load/start a video each time too.... Very annoying.... Please fix.... Thanks
5066,Mayu,"September 29, 2018",4," There have been problems in regards to playlists: managing one will crash the app and pressing ""delete"" doesn't delete it at all (even with refreshing or rebooting the phone). Other than that, it is a great media player."
5067,Schwarz Wache,"April 21, 2019",5," A very nice and effective media player, very good for OS's with no main media player like the android one, Always up to expectations, didnt have anything major to complain about, and the team is always working to fix bugs, thanks for the excellant app"

5071,Anthony Okeke,"May 30, 2019",4, i think this app will be perfect if you guys can add a default playlist where all the recently added songs will be stored automatically. lots of people prefer to listen to their recently added songs more than the older one so it would be perfect to have this feature.

5185,Rizal Hanafi,"May 2, 2019",4," thanks for making the sorting preferences permanent :). i have a new suggestion. make that we could batch delete videos because we currently can't, when selecting multiple videos there aren't such options. thanks in advance."
5186,Alvin Juralbal,"December 21, 2018",5," This app is awesome! very convenient to use. one thing though, sometimes it doesn't play the subtitles automatically but sometimes it DOES. but still, this app is great!!!"
5187,Nur Ainina Saffa,"May 4, 2019",1, not working right after update. screen went blank after paused for several minutes. i have to close the app and started it again. also i have to find the video again where i left to paused.
5188,Paik Wah Chow,"September 12, 2018",3," This app got one serious bug. If we turn off screen while playing or pause the video, the apps crash and cannot on anymore. I need to restart the phone then only can use the apps again. My phone is using Android 8"
5189,Andrew Turnbull,"April 14, 2019",4," This app is GREAT. I use it on my chromebook. The only problem happens when I watch higher quality MKV videos. The picture has trouble loading on normal playback speed. The last update has helped this, but not fixed it."
5190,Jmuo M.L,"June 27, 2019",5," It's an amazing app with great video player features and my personal favorite video player on android but should really expand on the sort settings e.g add in ""Date"" instead of just sorting things by Name. Best place to watch videos though."
5191,Bad Sector,"May 20, 2019",4, The app works but after a while it will stop finding new videos. I've tried all the options to refresh and all that. The only way to fix the problem is to uninstall and reinstall and it finds everything again ok.
5192,Lorenzo Larco,"February 21, 2019",2," used it for a long time when i had my laptop. now that i have my phone i can say that this app is quit buggy and needs to be uninstalled and put backbin order to work well. try looking up mxplayer, same concept but doesnt bug."
5193,Josef H.,"January 20, 2019",1," No option to view my videos in folders makes this player unusable for me. Why would anyone want to have all of their videos in one long, long list instead of having them nicely grouped, that's beyond me. MX Player wins all the way."
5194,Purav Dharamshi,"April 10, 2019",1," I have a Motorola Moto Z2 force. The app has seek problems and whenever i rotate the screen, the video restarts and lags. Please fix it. And also when i switch between apps it freezes and just shows a black screen"

5198,Yokuma Siphosethu Mahlangeni,"June 21, 2019",3," Everything is working fine, but the picture in picture mode is no where in my new phone: J4 core, unlike my other phone, which had the picture in picture mode in the Manu. Please fix it or direct me to the picture in picture mode and I'll change my rating."
5199,Julien Rivault,"July 4, 2019",2," A very good app when you watch on your mobile. But when I cast on my tv with google ChromeCast, it works very badly... Very often it stops after 15-20 min, very hard to navigate. And a big problem with the subtitle. they aren't cast!"
5200,Matthew Tateossian,"September 1, 2019",5," Great interface, plays all my Apple music files without issue. Very happy with this app. As a classical music fan, I wish that a Composers view were available. I also can't figure out how to create custom playlists."
5201,Name21,"August 30, 2019",4," It's the only music player that allows customizing the speed of songs since I love speeding them up and other players doesnt have that feature. But please allow us to edit the playlists, its hard to remove the songs from a playlist"
5202,Eric Tselovanskyi,"September 8, 2019",2," It can play everything, but you can't minimize it when playing a video or it will crash, and when you try to switch back to the app it says ""app isn't available""... well... 5 stars aren't available too..."
5203,Sherlok holmes,"November 10, 2019",3," I am a little dissapointed since i have updated the app as now the subtitles do not get download automatically by the ""download subtitles"" option😏😏😞"

5220,SOURAV GAYEN,"December 2, 2018",5, It is the best video and audio player with high picture and sound quality. All are well. I used all others app for video but it is best.
5221,Pavan Goyal,"October 31, 2018",4, The app is brilliant except that it shows the videos which are deleted and even after refreshing the videos dont go from list. When we try to play them the app says file not found. This should be resolved.
5222,Jeff Burton,"April 8, 2019",5," So far after a year, VLC handles everything I throw at it. Plays every format just like the desktop version of VLC, making it just what you need to play whatever video format you want or need to play."

5232,Dave Pickering,"May 19, 2019",1, 21:9 and better ratios missing. Was the best media player but I am sick of watching movies in vertical stretchavision. The only way to fix this is recode my movies on a PC and reimport.
5233,A Google user,"March 26, 2019",1," VLC doesn't see the SD card in my tablet. It wants me type in a path. In 2019. Clean Music Player sees my SD card automatically. The Videolan website is a nightmare to use on a tablet, so no help there."
5234,Pranav Sreekanth,"April 19, 2019",1, the way the videos are split up into groups according to their names and not folder name sucks. i wanted to switch to this because of the ads in mx player and the online streaming setup in it but cant coz vlc is just a complex collection of my videos.

5238,Vivek Gawande,"May 13, 2019",4, Great experience! Much much better than mx player after it turned to an adware. One recommendation: Allow a share feature to easily share videos. Also it would be great if the video list updated on its own instead of manually refreshing
5239,Dagoberto Gracey,"April 8, 2019",2," Been using VLC both on PC and tablet for a while now. I will unistall after this update's increased privilege request. Why a video player would need access to my location and microphone? Will be moving on, thanks."
5240,Melissa Mason,"April 10, 2019",2, I loved this app until the recent update. Music stops playing every couple of minutes when I'm browsing the web. The previous version did not do this.
5241,Rory Gilfillan,"November 12, 2018",3, The playlist doesn't update. I copy new files and delete old files. Despite pushing refresh many times the old files are still there and the new files don't appear.

5249,John Aaron,"April 22, 2019",1," The new updates have left this app useless. There are so many bugs, and loss of functions that I was forced to delete the app and install the apk from 2018. Seriously, beta test your updates, or better yet stop making changes."
5250,Dil Vil,"May 9, 2019",1," May be you should stop updating this app. This use to be the best video player but every update you are adding is making this app the worst. Auto scan not working, unable to detect newly added files and videos are not running - keep on loading."
5251,Me Me,"October 21, 2018",3," Thought this would have a frame grab feature like the PC version does, but this doesn't. Dragging the slider bar freezes the video and does not track frames like the built in Photos on my Pixel 2. Promptly uninstalled."
5252,David T,"June 4, 2019",3, I've been using VLC player for a long time and pretty much like it. Until I found out that it doesn't support FLV files. Now I had to change to XPlayer and it's a shame that VLC can't keep up with the times.
5253,Ab Naz kenya,"June 18, 2019",1," i can't imagine it's been a month since i uninstalled vlc...it used to be great for years, my daily app but now, lags so much, sometimes refuse to play any song until you restart it...boring."

5260,arun b,"September 8, 2019",4, The app is superb. Just like the desktop version it will play whatever codec you throw at it. The two annoying things I found are 1. The video seeking experience isn't as smooth as in mx player 2. The subtitles stop working when you cast it to the TV.
5261,jarred iballs,"September 3, 2019",1," Horrible, unintuitive, not user friendly. Seems like they don't want you to use it or they have zero idea what people want. Can't easily delete history. Old things get stuck and can't be forgotten. Like VLF for windows. Hate VLF for Android."
5262,Mahmoud Abu Qtuish,"September 13, 2019",4, It works well as I have not experienced any glitches. However when I watch anime I always have to change the audio as the default is the Japanese audio. They should add a feature were you chose the default audio and subtitle.

5265,Alexandre Balea,"October 1, 2019",4," This app has real potential, it's plenty of features such as PiP support. Only gripe is the fact that on my device, when tapping to reveal the controls, the home, menu and back buttons show on top, preventing me from accessing the controls."

5282,Vicki Trimble,"December 26, 2018",3, Could be better. Often doesn't have cast option when open app and have to restart phone. Pausing sometimes makes file start from the beginning again. File can crash if you try to skip forward.

Still does it just not as bad 5/31/19 maybe add in a option to lock the scroll down on album view so it no constantly showing the songs list.
5299,Amadeus Mateus,"May 15, 2019",2, it's a far cry from the PC version. no loop play or playlist. can't remove file title at start. makes this app useless for me. I had my hopes up but no. just a basic video player.

5301,AmDy Xippe,"February 22, 2019",4," vlc really needs to add shortcut for rotate button(fixed one).. there're many short videos with wrong orientation. some portrait, some landscape. sensors don't help all the time. thanks for free software.."

5305,Siddharth Saxena,"January 4, 2019",3," Overall it is a good app. Recently I'm noticing a problem where vlc is unable to stream content at more than 50 fps. Frames get clunky and sometimes the video altogether stops, although the audio still keeps on working. Otherwise an excellent app."

5308,Hatim Dhilla,"March 10, 2019",4," No doubt! One of the best player, but how do I stop it from showing all the non media files? I can see my docs and images in the folders too. Only music and videos should be only visible. Any suggestions?"
5309,A Google user,"March 25, 2019",1, Stopped updating this after it demanded microphone access. No idea why it would need this since it does not record anything. Have VLC gone in to the espionage business? I do not know. Old version is still great.

5313,robin potter,"July 24, 2019",2," current version does not use full screen for audio playback in horizontal orientation. very annoying. it would also be improved if audio could use swipe gesture for seeking as video does. also, resume audio does not always work"
5314,hao chen,"June 28, 2019",4, Best audio player on Android. Not very good at resume. Playback speed will be reset after vlc restart. Cannot recover last exit point. Musicolet works better regarding to this. Merit: Extensive format support. Change playback speed. High stability.

5321,Mark Anthony,"October 5, 2019",5," vlc has been the ultimate player! Doesn't matter what file-types , VLC covers more range than most people have or even use. It's such a sturdy player and can easily access and change the variables to your liking. It's the ultimate player hands down!!"

5347,PrivateVoid1,"April 2, 2019",1, No gapless playback? Seriously? This is something I've had since winamp on xp and in 2019 the developers behind vlc still can't figure out how to implement gapless playback? Pathetic.
5348,St13boom,"April 16, 2019",5, The best. Simply the best. There is no media file (not damaged) to date that VLC can't play. Beats other mainstream players for videos with EAC3 audio files. Totally free and ad-free. Thank you VLC.

5361,John Brown,"May 17, 2019",4," I have problems with the app, but it is amazing how people can trash talk the most free app on the play store. Every other app is paid for or has ads. VLC is 100% free!!! I dont know whaf benefits they get from giving us free app."

5363,Aussie Stevo,"May 25, 2019",2, videos recorded in portrait on phones cant be rotated in Android TV version. Why leave out such an important function? Most home videos are recorded on phones and many people dont think to film in landscape.

5389,V T,"October 8, 2019",4," Great app overall especially the multi format playback. The only reason for 4 stars is for me it drops the place where the audio was manually paused and starts from the beginning of the file. For lengthy files, it is quite annoying."

5433,Mr Xperia,"April 14, 2019",1, Latest update has many bugs. Can we have the old one back please? Why do developers constantly break things that were working fine? Instead of breaking video playback on reopening the app why not make the android app as good as the iOS version?
5434,Lakshmanan Srinivasan,"November 17, 2018",5," Overall it's very good..is it possible to make the navigation bar in full screen to lock mode ,because every 10 seconds it's going to hide mode ,it's good for seek a movies with seek button always display."

5454,Von Ivanson,"August 14, 2019",5," This app is incredible especially when a movie you want to watch (an anime for example) doesn't have a subtitle, all you gotta do is download the subtitle file and it will automatically be added to the movie."
5455,Chris Chong,"September 9, 2019",3, Good app to watch video files but it seems to be a resource hog. Running it on my Nokia 7 plus works OK until I minimise the app. Phone struggles to display home screen and do anything for a couple of minutes. VLC is the only app in app tray

5459,Dean Gibson,"October 28, 2019",4," Needs a LOT of work integrating with Chromecast. Eg, only displays the first 3 devices. I have 5, & will be adding more. Also, the timeout on the phone screen is pitifully short when casting."

5547,A Google user,"February 27, 2019",5," best app hope the videos can get segregated depending on type like music,movie,songs,social network like that so it would be easier to access the mp4 files rather than search the total list to find the video."

5549,Robert Sibell,"October 4, 2018",1," Player does not remember where it left off when resuming app, while playing MP3s from SD card. It also stop streaming to Chromecast randomly due to it disconnecting my wifi connection randomly."
5550,Scott O'Shea,"January 3, 2019",2, Chromecast is average. if it doesn't drop out then the quality is shakey at best. i loved this program for years but the continuing issues with Chromecast drives me insane. Fix it asap!
5551,BuffPandaGamer,"May 7, 2019",5," This is an awesome app, however, I have a concern. When I speed up the playback speed of a video to about 1.60 (my way of self - amusement) the app makes the video sound go all stuttery and distorted."
5552,Paul Mcguigan,"April 27, 2019",1, After pie update home screen widget will lose the cover art. I have to skip to the next song and then back or open the app and reselect desired track. VLC also loses track of all media and displays no media files found.
5553,Bala Shunmugam,"November 3, 2018",4," I m having issues, whenever I change the orientation of the phone the videos I m watching are starting over from beginning. It's really annoying, please fix it."
5554,Ethan,"April 30, 2019",3," good interface. the newest update seems buggy, the shuffle button dissapears when u click it and sometimes it just doesnt work. also you can only sort by name."
5555,A Google user,"December 12, 2018",4, Although its minor flaws (like custom equalizer reset to default values every now and then) it is still a nice player. You can play virtually every file format.
5556,Stewart Duffield,"May 17, 2019",5," was the best by far. since update, equaliser not there, and just plays with a heavy base. emailed developer, no reply!!. just found the equaliser. why move it?"
5557,Gus Flannagan,"April 2, 2019",2," It struggles with flac files. Whilst Google Play has no problems, VLC produces little dropouts in the audio, always in the same place in the file. Shame."
5558,Mews,"April 1, 2019",3, Plays video on my phone ok but casting is very hit and miss. Sometimes it works flawlessly but as often as not I'll have to reset or it will hang.
5559,A Google user,"November 14, 2018",5," 10 Star Rating! Never had an issue with VLC. Best all around media app I have ever used for my phone, tablet, laptop, and PC. Keep up the stellar work VLC. ( 👍✋🤘👊😎✌)"
5560,Miracle Ochei,"March 16, 2019",5, I love this app. It plays all formats. However I'd love you to work on the subtitles. It sometimes downloads the wrong subtitle.
5561,UG Uche,"May 29, 2019",3," I am unable to download subtitles automatically, the next update should please focus on improving subtitles and it's download, for example MX Player has really good subtitles repository. Overall it's a good app, I'll recommend it."
5562,Kay Bee,"June 2, 2019",2," It's great to play music, still sounds ok at over 100% volume, but it sounds terrible playing the videos. Btw, I'm using samsung j2 prime, if that's needed."
5563,Ashish Kumar,"June 29, 2019",5, Sometimes it doesn't show files names instead of it shows the website names and video names are correctly shows in information. Please add an option like Show video file name forcefully. Add an option scan Videos only but not Audio.

5566,Paulino Sobremisana Jr.,"July 28, 2019",3, A recurring problem I have is the play button will not reliably stay toggled. Most of the time it turns itself off. I tried the settings but found nothing that works. Very annoying.
5567,Executive Data7,"August 3, 2019",3," its a pretty decent media player, definitely a go to but i have one complaint and its that Subtiles don't show up when I'm casting to my TV, it shows just fine when I'm not casting, if this issue could be resolved I'd appreciate it"
5568,Nova,"August 22, 2019",4," Super Great app. So simple yet does everything for you. There is one thing annoying tho, the controls on subtitle and audio delay. Pls add a manual number input, not just add and subtract. But overall, Amazing app."
5569,Jonathan Cain,"September 5, 2019",5," Love the app. It's better than the one for windows. I have a recommendation though, the only thing the app lacks is the option to change the artwork of soundtracks."
5570,Katarina Andjelkovic,"October 5, 2019",4," Has a bug with subtitles - only has the option to add them manually, and while filling out the title and season, it closes before you can enter the episode number. Other than that, excellent app"
5571,yuvraj uddanti,"November 1, 2019",1, Can't even Chromecast properly. Always stops casting when the phone is turned off. Sometimes the Chromecast button doesn't even show up. Sometimes the video on the TV disconnects and I can't get it to connect again. Too buggy to be used properly.
5572,Bill,"December 5, 2019",2, This version doesnt seem to have a built in equalizer. Very disappointed
5573,Tristan,"December 10, 2019",1, Deleted all my playlists after it updated. Not happy

5585,A Google user,"October 14, 2018",5, It's excellent but it should have folder view for movie searching easily. It's difficult to search movies in list mode up to bottom.. Picture quality need to be improved and be sharp little bit..otherwise it's great app
5586,Mike Vaughan,"December 26, 2018",5," THE BEST EVER have tried 5 others claiming to be but they don't come anywhere remotely close, VLC is the best by far for dealing with all formats. Highly reccommended."
5587,MrDartSaS,"February 7, 2019",5," Hello, something went wrong, I used to play internal folder by tap on folder and choose ""play'. Now this function does not work. I have got name of folder in playlist but it does not play anything. Guys do something. please"
5588,Corry R,"February 2, 2019",5, No doubt in my mind that this is the best media player ever. Video and audio. All file types. No glitches. Smooth as silk. Excellent playback controls.
5589,Kishore G_ 18BTRSE012,"May 19, 2019",4," This app is cool. But the things which i noticed to be changed is : 1. Please include an delete option in player 2. please refix the refresh system in player, because it is showing the deleted content also after deleting it."
5590,TnS Barker,"February 27, 2019",5," Played the format/video that i needed it to play. Plus, I deduct a star or two for ads. No ads plus it plays the video I wanted played while other programs with higher ratings and ads did not: Win!"
5591,Agell Darussalam,"October 15, 2018",5," Been using vlc on pc and android for long years, and still love it. I think it would be a lot of help if there's a frame to frame click button.. Nice work"
5592,A Google user,"October 27, 2018",5," I love the app.. Sometimes when you need to concentrate on your video,,,you can just lock it to avoid mistakes (clicking a button intentionally)"
5593,Dj Mlu Nkosi,"December 23, 2018",1," never had issues with the app till recently. it's keeps crushing,sometimes it takes up to 15 attempts to play one song. I really love the app but lately its just 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
5594,Marek Werner,"February 8, 2019",4," I am missing here only one feature screen rotation not hidden in app settings but as a ons screen button. everything else is very good. so,one more star is waiting for the on screen button :p"
5595,Peabo Mkhize,"May 18, 2019",3, Good but no being able share my VLC videos on WhatsApp status or with other contacts makes this app for storage only and that's dull this day and age. Also we can't edit and crop videos. Please fix that.
5596,Pingger Shikkoken,"April 10, 2019",2," once great, but each update seems to.make matters worse. with latest update the play/pause-Button in the notification went missing. I heavily use that thing now I'm using a different player"

5598,samarth vs,"November 9, 2018",3, Videos do not get removed if not available in phone. Says failed to delete but list grows big. When casting brightness is very low and can't increase making even a full HD movie a theatre print

5603,Vlad Gavrilov,"January 23, 2019",4," After I open a video from explorer second time, the app just opens and closes immediately. Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Please fix this. I know this app is the best as I used it with previous phone without issues."
5604,sundar prasad,"February 14, 2019",1," Dark theme is just useless for amoled. Coz it's not really black, it is gray tint. Also when I pass and play after 2 mins or so its starting from first. Then why do I have a pause button. you could just give stop button"
5605,Simon Manuel,"April 29, 2019",3, Almost perfect! All this needs is the ability to set aspect ratio like the desktop version & it will be the best player in the market!
5606,A Google user,"November 5, 2018",3," Forwarding is very poor nd slow whenever we need to forward a scene it forwards in second, this issue should need to be solved it should be forward along with movement of finger."
5607,Paul Benedict Jabines,"April 12, 2019",5," So Ive been downloading many video players including this but none of them plays video that stretch to notch. However, with the latest update, vlc already offers the stretch to notch. You don't know how happy I am with the latest update. Compels me to write a review for the very first time."
5608,ANOOP LL,"April 15, 2019",2, after the update the apo is no longer working as expected. While watching videos if you switch to some other app and come back to VLC it won't respond. Restart needed to work it again. Please do some proper QA before releasing the update
5609,John Wikoff,"April 21, 2019",1, Im trying to scroll through my list of videos on my SD card and it keeps jumping back to the beginning of the list. I can't get much past the E's before it jumps back. MADDENING!!!

5611,Amy Blumenthal,"June 22, 2019",5," I was using Google Music Player until I discovered it couldn't handle WMA files without my jumping through hoops.  VLC handles WMA out of the box.  And it keeps my folder structure, which Google doesn't do.  Thank you, Videolabs!"

5614,GA Comics,"July 12, 2019",1, This player doesn't have an option to skip to a particular part of the song... Are you kidding me? What a joke. Even my bundled player i can only access through storage can do that.
5615,Shawn Roske,"August 3, 2019",2, Can't stop and restart audio. There's actually only a pause button. The app fights you when you try to restart a single song. Very disappointed for such a mature application.
5616,Tech Tonic,"August 9, 2019",2," Brilliant as a stand alone player but dreadful for casting. If you pause playback while casting, you may not be able to resume or it will simply fail after a minute or two."
5617,ARABIA,"August 13, 2019",3," Although I like it overall, it's horrible at showing which video is highlighted to be played next on many of my android devices. There needs to be a clearer indicator of which video is highlighted to be played next."
5618,Spyder810,"August 24, 2019",1," Doesn't properly close. Pause audio, close app, click play on headphones and it starts vlc audio again instead of the running audio player. So clearly VLC is running in the background and not really closing...force quit doesn't even stop it."
5619,Thomas Nguyen,"September 17, 2019",5, Perfect. I like the mode of background playing. Sometimes just want to hear the sound from the video clip instead of watching it. Other apps seldom offer this setting. Thanks.
5620,iZaIx Space,"October 29, 2019",3," My only issue with this player is the audio pitch bent that happens every time an audio file starts playing, and there's no way to prevent it."
5621,Jack Gallant,"November 11, 2019",5, Was great until the latest update. Now the shortcut keeps disappearing and to open the app I have to come into the play store

5651,Vinny P Wilson,"April 11, 2019",4, One of the best video player. The album art in the Audio are so blurry and it looks so weird and not clear at all.
5652,AJAY AHUJA,"May 20, 2019",1, it has a very big issue while casting videos...Video stops every 3-4 minutes...complety destroys the mood to watch videos...somtimes it connect to chromecast and some times not...please solve this problem at earliest
5653,Max Max,"April 12, 2019",4, It seems pretty great but the main problem i have is i need to customize my music file names on the go and cant.. I had to download a file manager. Itd be nice if everything was in one place.
5654,Uri Perets,"May 25, 2019",2," Why media player requires access to device microphone? It should play video not record it. Previous version was much better, this one was removed."

5664,Kaptive Media,"October 26, 2018",2, It been changed the actual layout is now horrible no actual way to put files in order or search them properly the old lay out was brilliant and also the files parsing everyone it connects to a new WiFi is ridiculous and not needed

5681,Robert Nobinsky,"July 27, 2019",4, The univerisal player. Clean. Functional. Open source. Not the best UX. Not the most feature rich. App should NOT force RUN AT STARTUP. App should include a hard EXIT option.
5682,Justin Neofotistos,"July 2, 2019",5," This app is great. Unlike most music players this one remembers where you left off when using Bluetooth in the car, no more DJ mixes starting from the beginning anymore."

5689,A. Non,"August 14, 2019",3," I use VLC on my Windows and Linux computers but the app just doesn't have the flexibility of the computer programs and has trouble with a couple formats I use. Switched to MX Player, though still very fond of VLC."
5690,osama ahmed,"August 14, 2019",4, Good app....it would be alot better if it also had the option of providing the songs through their respective folders...like my downloads in downloads of vidmate. Otherwise you have to go to it through the directory which is inconvenient

5695,Tone Hwang,"October 4, 2019",4, I hope there'll be an option of custom sort or alphabetically sort files in playlist... And that it won't make duplicates if one file is added twice... Or if we could delete the duplicate without deleting the file off the list completely. :)
5696,Nathan Watkins,"October 18, 2019",1, Latest upgrade made ease of access more complicated.. 👎👎. Editor has no concern for left handed people.. in video adjustments are now aligned to the right. They were just fine in the center
5697,Amit Paul,"October 22, 2019",1, 2 disgusting points: 1. Imposes an extra warm tone on any videos. As a result the actual video colours are lost. No option to manually control it. 2. Video looses sharpness significantly! A 1080p video looks like 720p.
5698,Michael A. Hybl,"October 31, 2019",5," VLC is one of the most configurable apps for videos and music I've ever used. Currently there seems to be a bug in the volume booster, but I'm confident it will be addressed in the next patch."
