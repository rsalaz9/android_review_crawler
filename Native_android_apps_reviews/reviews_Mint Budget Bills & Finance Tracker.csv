It allows me to easily track my monthly income, spending, and bill payments. You can choose a category and subcategories to set up a budget tailored to your lifestyle. The only change I would find useful is to be able to add subcategories of my choice. It does have tags so I can note expenses that actually pertain to me. It tracks my credit score which is pretty accurate. I definitely recommend!"

Connecting all your account, bank, credit, retirement, investment is extremely easy and intuitive. Get access to your credit report and monitoring is a great feature as well. I use this app personally to keep a big picture of my finances, but the detailed book keeping I do on my own. I would like to see more customization options to categorize, but overall a very solid FREE app."

I used to dread logging into all different financial places (like banks, credit cards, etc) & this is a one stop app that allows you to see it all. You can't pay bills from it but it alerts you when a bill that you've set up comes in & notifies you when a deposit is made. It saved me by alerting me of a maintenence fee. Love & recommend!"

I am somewhat nervous about putting all of my financial information in one place and online in general, but so far after over 5 years I have had no issues. I had many credit cards to pay off. Mint made it easy to track balances, due dates, minimum payments, and interest rates of all cards. You can set a goal for paying credit card debt off and see a monthly payment plan, how much to pay on each card."

I love how you can customize each transaction type as well as your monthly budgets. The app does have a small delay in updating the accounts sometimes, but it is not egregious.

It shows how much debt to income you have, any alerts, how much is in each account and pending transactions. However it doesn't show the one thing I would expect which is your budget. If there is a way to show budget information for Android please let me know."

I have consistently had to manually update my bank accounts, investment accounts, subscriptions and that is just the ones that are working. Half of my accounts that I put in such as Netflix and Pedestal banking throw error messages even if the credentials are correct. I have kept this app up to date and reinstalled it. If you would be considering using an app for banking don't pick this one."

Every single account is in one place: checking, savings, 401k, IRA, HSA, credit cards, student loans, and even cryptocurrency. All transactions are automatically logged and can be individually appropriated toward my budget or my goals depending on the category I assign. I definitely recommend it, even over YNAB (and unlike YNAB, Mint is free)."

The reason why I have not given it 5 stars is because I would like an option to create a bi weekly budget as opposed to a monthly one. I also am unable to connect one of my online accounts with the app which would be most helpful. I have had this app for several years and do see the improvements along the way so I'm sure there is more to come in the future.

The features added more recently allowing custom subcategories, and allowing rollover to next month for unused money in specific categories has been helpful. However, I randomly noticed transactions missing and most recently a transaction that was showing in Mint for a week was gone when I checked the app today. Wondering if it will reappear as randomly as it disappeared."

Maybe it's just me, but I cant find the balances on the desktop site and cant find how to add pending tx's on the app. I need to use both to accomplish my intended reason for downloading this app (balancing my horrifically messed up checkbook). Also, am I missing a way to set aside partial payments (ie, breaking up a house pmt into 3 portions so that the money is set aside). If I could figure these out, 5 stars for sure!!"

Intuit purchased and rebranded this to work with their budgeting software and de-emphasized the bill tracking functionality. It used to be a good way to keep track of bills. However Mint constantly logs you out, and gives no push notification when accounts don't update even when it is logged in. Check it at least once a week, which diminishes the convenience of having bill tracking."

For one, you can't pay bills through Mint anymore. Two, it's so incredibly slow to update anything that happens to your accounts. I got notified via email by mint that I got paid 7 days after I got paid. This is not useful and can actually be confusing to get late or duplicate notifications about your bank account. Last, it just doesn't connect well to accounts."

It's nice that the app shows I have no bills to pay, but it's not what I expected. I contacted support and said to wait for an update to roll out, but several updates later, nothing has changed."

When updating Mint it is very common to check another application for data Mint needs but fails to capture from financial institutions, such as the payee of a check or the category of an purchase on a credit card.

My only gripe with it is when you make credit card payments t accounts for the payment as credit and and expense. It all evens out but I wouldn't consider a credit card payment as part of my monthly income.
39,Alex Ragsdale,"April 19, 2020",4," I love this app. It allows me to view all my accounts and update transactions as they come as well. The website is more functional and easier to use than the app for longer periods of time, but the app is great for short usage and on the go usage."
40,Ervin Harris,"April 25, 2020",5, Great app for money management. Useful for anybody. But especially useful for the under 30 gang. It helps you stay on top of your spending habits. Even shows you your updated credit score every several days. The budgeting tool is my favorite.
41,Wydalis Elliott,"April 25, 2020",4," Keeps all my bills in one place & reminds me before they are due. I like how it tracks my spending. The only thing is, if I change something that's a recurring, next month it reverts back and I have to change the location of the budget item again."
42,Christopher McDonnell,"April 25, 2020",4," Very easy to read display that shows multiple accounts. Much easier than logging in to each one. It might not always be up to the minute accurate, but is a great snapshot. Also, I have never had any security issues using this app in the years since I've used it."

46,D McBean,"April 14, 2020",5," Been using the app for awhile and I have to say , it's a great app for keeping track of your money and spending. It's simple , easy , and effective. Plus it gives you your credit score information. This is the app you need for all your financial inquiries."
47,Nikol Phillips,"April 9, 2020",3," This app needs to sync daily and it does not update once bills are paid. Also, notifications are not consistent. If you don't open the app you will miss notifications. Sometimes my bills are late because I didn't receive the notification from Mint.😒"

52,Randy Rice,"April 13, 2020",3," Mint used to be amazing. Now, it's hit or miss. Sometimes it grabs all my information and I appreciate this app a ton. Other times, it needs constant attention to maintain connectivity and it's useless."
53,James Singleton,"April 20, 2020",4, The one thing that bugs me is I keep getting logged out every so often and have to input my password and setup my key. This often occurs when a new update comes out but I've also had it happen randomly as well.
54,Muksit Jamil,"April 24, 2020",1," app doesn't allow for password manage/autofill- this is great for people who want to use a short, easy to remember string to secure all of their financial account info - not so much for the rest of us who prefer security"
55,Judith D,"April 18, 2020",5," I have had Mint for years and not had any issues. Occasionally I would have to reconnect my bank acct., but that was when I've changed my password. This helps to put things into perspective for my hubs."
56,Kendal Barger,"April 19, 2020",5," Love this app, it's so accurate! It was easy to connect your bills and banks! It took a little time to get used to but I love the budget tracking! It's amazing! Thank you for making such a useful app!"
57,Corey Slivnik,"April 17, 2020",4," Best app for tracking transactions, having a cost breakdown, and active budgeting app that I've used. Very user intuitive and simple, plus it syncs up with all your TurboTax accounts and has great credit card offers based off of your financials."
58,Bobby Bell,"April 16, 2020",2, This was such a good app but since so many banks/brokers REQUIRE 2FA it's so inconvenient to log into EVERY account every time I open Mint. I used to use this app every day but now I use it about once a month. Such a waste.
59,Ephraim Baluyot,"April 16, 2020",3, Been using Mint on android for almost 7 years now. The only problem is I've been getting logged out and have to continually log in every day or so. Not sure why it's been like that recently.
60,David Beck,"April 28, 2020",5," This app is a great one-stop-shop for tracking all my finances. I've had it for many years and it had helped me adjust and reduce my expenses, giving me more money overall to use for the things I really want."
61,Shawn,"April 26, 2020",5," Great app, just wish they added an option to export all past income/transactions/spendings to a .csv file. Btw if you really wanna have financial freedom, your first step is to track your money and spend less!"
62,Jeff Simpson,"April 16, 2020",4," Can't link my CapitalOne account. It keeps saying to reconnect even after I link them and authorize it. The account never shows up in my accounts. Very frustrating. Otherwise, I really like Mint. Hopefully this is resolved soon."
63,Donna Arcaro Serratore,"April 14, 2020",5, Love this app. It puts all of my spending in one place so I can track it all. I searched high and low to find this app that exports to CSV file. I don't love the ads though.
64,Elizabeth Richards,"April 16, 2020",2," I like the concepts, and would love to continue to use it but every few days it has trouble syncing my accounts and I have to re-enter my credentials. Seems this is a common problem."
65,Eric Mutabaruka,"April 13, 2020",3, How come iOS is given priority? One example is that iPhone is on version 7.3.0 whereas android is on 6.22.0.63. I just noticed on today's iPhone update my friend is able to set goals why does android not get the update? I love the app still but this game of favourites has to stop 🚫
66,Alhagie Bai Cham,"April 16, 2020",5, I find mint to be great at tracking my finances. Most of the work is automated once I added my account details. I love the budget creation and tracking feature. Great application.
67,aaron ghoul,"April 16, 2020",5, This app/ and website allows me to track all 20 of my bank accounts and loans. Even my primary bank can not do this. Notifications of finance charges is helpful . It is my go to app for money management.
68,Kiana Gilbert,"April 20, 2020",3," App is ok tracking things but here lately it won't update my information. It's now almost May and the last thing it updates to is March. Nothing from April... it won't recognize anything anymore. Loved using this app, too"
69,Steven Tucker,"April 20, 2020",4, A very easy and comprehensive tool. Wish my bank accounts wouldn't stop working after a month but I guess I should be greatful for the layer of security. Editing my credentials fixes that problem.
70,Jennifer English,"April 19, 2020",3," You can no longer add assets, cannot customize categories and can only see budget for the current month. Not being able to customize spending categories is the biggest downfall."
71,Matthew Webster,"April 8, 2020",3, Why can't I view previous months budgets in the app? Only on the website. I want to be able to look at my progress in each budget category this month and compare it to how I did in previous months
72,Murat SARI,"April 14, 2020",3, It is a nice app to see everything together but after couple days stops syncing the accounts. I had to delete and download this app 3 times in around 2-3 weeks. Works after installment but gives issues in couple days.
73,Alex Martinez,"April 23, 2020",1," Very glitchy now, and credit score section is never up to date. It constantly pushes your ""monthly"" credit score back every time you go back. It's been months since it's worked."
74,Scott Pugh,"April 15, 2020",5, Easy to use. The only headache is tying in your accounts if you have secure online access with them. But I'm okay with that because I don't want my accounts getting hacked.
75,Syed Ahmed,"April 19, 2020",5, Love Mint. I used to have Quicken to track my financials and switched to Mint recently. Plus Mint is FREE to use and Quicken now requires annual membership - very silly in my opinion. Switch to Mint if you haven't already!
76,Connor Sorahan,"April 17, 2020",1, The app stopped downloading transactions 2 months ago even though I reconnected the account in question no less than 7 times. No transaction history since February 5th. Why am I paying for intuit products that don't work?
77,Josiah Johnson,"April 17, 2020",5, Great budgeting tool! It makes it simple to budget and automatically breaks up your purchases to keep you up-to-date. Would recommend for starting a budget
78,Tim Arnold,"April 29, 2020",5," Very useful tool to manage your finances, I use it to track various categories where my funds go. Once you dial in your preferred catagories and settings it works magic for you."
79,Stephani K,"April 13, 2020",1," Mint, the desktop version, is great. I really liked the mobile version for awhile too...until they changed something with the security. Now, I only use the desktop version"
80,Tim Illguth,"April 19, 2020",5, Mint is awesome! Highly recommended! I have 7 different accounts and it keeps track of all them plus my retirement account. Great way to track spending and helping me budget.
81,Andrew Palmer,"April 23, 2020",2," It opened fine, I set up an account and now it says something went wrong. I can't get in or do anything. It says check for an ad blocker, but I don't have one turned on."
82,N,"April 26, 2020",2," It either takes forever to open, or doesn't open at all. Not very intuitive, and not easy to change things within the app. At this point it's more frustrating than it is helpful."
83,Sarah Hughes,"April 16, 2020",5," It's so great being able to see my credit score, bank account, credit cards, and investments all on one page. I feel so much more in control of my finances with using this app."
84,Eric Butler,"April 19, 2020",5, Love how it keeps track of my spending habits. Makes saving a lot easier and definitely helpful with advice on how to continue to build my credit.
85,Christopher Haynes,"April 12, 2020",5," Very helpful and humbling. Will help you get back on track with your money. Get this app. If you don't take control of your money, there are many companies that will gladly take advantage of you and it will cost you more than you think."
86,Omer Al-Talabani,"April 19, 2020",1, Support is dismal. Connectivity with banks is spotty. Transactions require policing to make sure it reports correctly. App requires more effort to maintain than your budget.
87,Michael Kearns,"April 20, 2020",2, Mint was great for years. But it no longer syncs some of my accounts. And I have been unable to contact their support team. Because of this I will be trying some of their competitors.
88,Marcus Jennings,"April 28, 2020",4, I love the app. The only downside is it takes like a day or two to update your info even when you refresh your accounts but overall good app to monitor financials.
89,Jonathan Stanwood,"April 13, 2020",3," It's okay but sometimes annoying. For example, I get repeated notifications to check my ""new credit score."" I follow the lead every time - no change. Why is Mint wasting my time?"
90,Grace Mulford,"April 10, 2020",5," Easy to use, and the interfaces work well with all my financial institutions, so I can get a complete snapshot of my finances in one place."
91,Julia Buchanan,"April 26, 2020",5," Love, love love this app!!! Accurate and it gives a true credit score, helps you stay on track, and where your messing up at financially."
92,JesSay Negron,"April 25, 2020",5," This is a great app that helps you keep track of all of your financial accounts in one place. Track and categorize your spending very easily.

I highly recommend it."
93,Haley Smith,"April 12, 2020",5, Super easy to use! Helps me stay on top of finances and budget. Love how you can set different budgets and goals.
94,Bobby A,"April 17, 2020",1," Terrible update. No longer update my bank account. Always have to reconnect to accounts. If it aint broke, dont fix it."
95,Suzy Homemaker,"April 25, 2020",3, It's extremely frustrating that the credit score has not updated since Jam. 9th 2020. I leave feedback in the app and still no response after 5 attempts.
96,Ben Bailer,"April 28, 2020",5," Great place to see all of your bank accounts, assets, bills and loans. Been using Mint for years and always have had a positive experience."
97,Jimmy Sanghera,"April 15, 2020",3, Love the app. But budget graphs are not working to show previous month spending. Reported since june 2019. Still not fixed or is it something on my galaxy 10?
98,Kyle Aho,"April 13, 2020",1," My primary bank, us bank, no longer syncs. Which makes this app essentially useless now. Along with my cell phone and mortgage company not syncing, makes this app unusable. Unfortunate bc it did help track finances and keep budgets."
99,Arvind Sharma,"April 9, 2020",5, Most important feature for me... cash flow. Love other features too including the credit score. Definitely recommend the app to track spend.
100,Chante Eagan,"April 11, 2020",5, Safe and easy. All my accounts in one place. And free advice to maintaining a high credit score! Since having the app my credit score has gone up 70+ points
101,Andrew Veilleux,"April 13, 2020",4, Great way to see all finances in the same place. The app is a little crowded with ads and other promotions though.
102,John Alvarez,"April 11, 2020",4," Great overall, my only issue is not being able to add multiple users to view. Help suggestions do not work."
103,Jay B,"April 16, 2020",5," Always had a great experience, easiest and simple to use, practically does half of it for me, and makes it easier to set aside money and realize how much I'm spending on garbage"
104,David Koleno,"April 5, 2020",3," The app is mostly fine. It does what it needs to and I know, since it's free, that there will be ads.

However, I don't need 5 notifications every day, both from push notifications and email, that I have a new credit score. Why, because my credit score doesn't change 5 times a day. It barely changes month over month. Please Mint, stop this annoyingly obnoxious behavior."

It has become routine to open mint, reset password, then log in again."

I am on it everyday, it has a learning curve but once you get it down it's a wierd day if I haven't opened this app to see what's going on with finances. The only thing I would suggest is being able to break down categories a little more in the trending tab. So I can see what I spent on beer, games etc. I wanna see my frivilous spending."
107,Mike Duff,"April 11, 2020",5, The gold standard of personal finance apps. This app has truly transformed how I budget and track my money. Give it a shot and watch your finances secure themselves with you in charge of them
108,Amy Lu,"April 16, 2020",3, Ever since the new update on apr 7 my account transactions haven't been loading and I am having the most difficult time adding accounts now. This app is not as helpful for me anymore 😔

111,Ciara Tyson,"April 27, 2020",3, I like this app & use it often but there's a bug that's making it count all of my transactions twice so nothing is accurate anymore. Can this be fixed?
112,Rachael Pahl,"April 28, 2020",1," I like the idea but all my transactions show up on the app twice so the figures for budget and spending are obviously inaccurate, rendering this app pointless."

114,Ivan Barragan,"April 17, 2020",5, I've been using mint for many years. It has its quirks but overall is a great tool to keep an eye on your financial health in one place.
115,Matthew Ryan,"April 27, 2020",3," Great app, but I am still having trouble. I let a month pass, but no transactions occurred."
116,Sam Wier,"April 6, 2020",3," Not a bad app overall. Not very sophisticated however. It double reports debits. For example, I place a big order online at a department store. Then I pay it off with a checking account. As far as Mint is concerned, I made two large purchases, and I cannot find out how to reconcile it."

It can help if you are relatively poor and have just a few bills (not too many) and a regular bank savings account. It constantly locks you out of the other systems, investment, retirement -- even large multinationals like Principal and Transamerica don't feed correctly. The alert system is sloppy. Example, the did you pay your bill feature fails to recognize debits to accts and requires too many clicks to clear the alert. If I have have 5 bills due I should be able to perhaps put a checkmark to acknowledge bills paid. Not have to go into each one here and use at least 15 clicks and screen loads just clear the mark.

All metrics are a big mess now. *** Good budget aggregation and summary. I wish it was more flexible, for example allow spending report configuration."

326,Christina Stormson,"April 4, 2020",5," Eat to use with all kinds of accounts. Love that I can see everything in one place. Allows me to really understand our finances, for real. Now especially, it's critical to keep track during this crisis."

328,Andrew McMillen,"April 29, 2020",1, Don't fall for it. No way to delete your account or data after you sign up. Which is concerning considering you link your bank account.
329,Chris H,"March 14, 2020",4," The account syncing has seen significant improvements over the last few updates. It's gotten faster and more reliable, and I appreciate the constant work you guys are doing. The budget tracker seems to have improved as well."
330,Ted Tobias,"February 25, 2020",5," Does what it says it does. I live by this app and swear by it. I open one app and get a complete picture look at all my bank accounts, vehicle loans, credit card balances and my current up to the minute changes in stock portfolio. Bravo!!!"
331,Joe Spinelli,"March 26, 2020",1, The bugs just keep piling up. Intuit has not done a good job keeping their software up to date. My accounts repeatedly stop syncing for no reason at all and the customer support is of no help. Mint has become all but useless.
332,Alex McMurtre,"April 8, 2020",5," Great app and very easy to use! Its allowed me to get a handle on my spending, before I was using an excel sheet, this is much more simple and reliable."
333,Lauren Pies,"April 14, 2020",5, Love this app. I can check my credit score and credit habits easily
334,Anthony Sordini,"February 8, 2020",4," If you put time and effort into keeping track of your finances and your personal budget this app is a great tool. It would be nice if you could have couples accounts for tracking family finances. Keep in mind this is a tool, it doesn't do the work for you."
335,Chad Senna,"February 20, 2020",4," Great overview of all accounts. Consistent issues with updating accounts though which is an annoying issue. They eventually resolve themselves, but I'm constantly warned to take action to sign back into them. Still, great app though."
336,Josh Mangum,"February 15, 2020",5, This app is the best at keeping track of your finances. It has been able to integrate with mearly all of my accounts and is the most comprehensive I have found. None of the other financial apps quite measure up!
337,Layne Whitaker,"February 14, 2020",5," Mint's really helped me get my finances in order. I used to be very negligent when it came to my finances, but now I can't go a day without checking the app! And you can use Mint to obtain your credit score, which was smooth and easy"
338,Mark D. Collier,"April 8, 2020",5, Easy to set up and maintain. Many auto features that save time even though you will want to tweak them each month for better accuracy. Great budget tool.

I love mint but only when it works and it never works. Now the cash flow doesn't work. It shows spent but not earned money. All my accounts show they are up to date. I uninstalled. No change. So I give up. And I don't have time to sit in a help chat about an app that is supposed to save me time.
342,Chris Straube,"March 19, 2020",5," Mint is one of two financial apps I used to finally get a clear picture of my accounts and has helped me spot at least 2 incidents of fraud. For those that don't log into their bank accounts on a daily basis, this app is perfect."
343,Daniel Hartsig,"February 12, 2020",4," Helped us realize what what was going on with our money, and turned it around so that we could stop spending more than we make. The ads are starting to get annoying though, which is why I downgraded it from 5 to 4 stars."
344,Erin Perkins,"February 24, 2020",5," I've been trying to find the best way to watch my spending and get the whole picture. Mint gets it done. There are a few bugs and glitches that woth connecting accounts, but hopefully those will get ironed out over time."

348,Jacob Maggioncalda,"February 13, 2020",4," I like how this app allows me to track my spending. I almost wish they were in the banking business and allowed me to set up a goal for something I want to save for and then they can take money out of my account little by little and show me my progress to my goal. Other than that, it's a great app!"
349,GunBlazer Blazin' It All,"February 14, 2020",4, great centralized view of my money and even lets me include my investments in crowd funding like Fundrise.

Sadly had to take a star off because I get a few transactions per month that are categorized incorrectly and it actually alters the values of account totals. I'm currently in the process switching to a different bank and mint makes it easier and more difficult.
350,Jamez Mellion,"April 3, 2020",5," Definitely helps me keep track of spending. Easily links all my accounts, even when paid with credit cards. Assists me with savings goals, and helps keep me on budgetml."

353,Teresa Brown,"April 29, 2020",4," This app helps newlyweds organize multiple sources of income, and categorizes expenses via bank accounts."
354,Kimberly Brown,"February 15, 2020",3, When I linked my accounts it didn't bring over the most current information on one account but did for the others. I also didn't expect to manually input once a bill is paid since all of my bank account is linked and shows payment to my bills.
355,Rasika Kale,"February 17, 2020",1," Extremely deceptive. Doesn't let you sign in at first. Then signs in, gets your bank account linked and goes back to starting page of adding bank account, when in my notification bar I can still read 'Mint is downloading your recent transactions'. Very very disappointed."
356,Natalie Seale,"March 15, 2020",5," As a recent grad & young professional using Mint, I've learned so much about my spending/savings habits. It's nice to have everything tracked all in one place. The charts & graphs help me visualize my progress. I literally recommend this to all my friends & family."
357,Jacob Carber,"March 16, 2020",1," Missing key features from the website. You cannot view any prior months information besides by transaction. It's March 1st, and you want to see how you did for spending in February? Too bad!"
358,Nicole Aguila,"March 27, 2020",5, I really like how well this app is set up and how the notifications work. I like how you categorize your spending and how you can set limits. I'm able to meet my savings goals with this app.
359,Ryan Cosby,"April 7, 2020",5, Mint allows me to see all my accounts in one place. It allows me to see outgoing funds compared to income and if I'm in the hole that month or not. I enjoy using this application
360,Catherine T. Nguyen,"April 11, 2020",4, Need to update faster...otherwise pretty good. They keep asking me to verify the account too
361,Alec Hirsch,"April 20, 2020",1," The widget for recent transactions disappeared from list of widgets, that is one of the main features I used from mint."
362,Anthony Robertson,"February 9, 2020",2," Please bring back being able to edit at least the ""category"" of pending transactions in app! Sometimes it takes 3 days for the transactions to clear, by then I could be over budget! Why was this removed? Kind of pointless if tracking budgets are 3-4 days delayed..."
363,stevan pierce,"February 6, 2020",3, There are frequent miscategorizations of transactions as well as duplicates. This translates into having to use the website more and more. This is a useful app overall but be forewarned on prior issues.

366,M.Hieu Truong,"February 21, 2020",5, Generally an awesome app. Please improve updates on Android. Deposits / paycheck on my account are only updated after around 12hr period. My friend's iPhone are updated immediately. Still worth a 5* for great user experience. Thank you!
367,Jamie Leathery,"February 29, 2020",4, I like it for the most part...but I am finding that the tranaction history is not accurate. Thete are a lot of repeats and I must go back into the individual accounts to check for accuracy anyway.
368,Vince Marty,"March 1, 2020",5, It's really great you just link all of your accounts in and gives you a great snapshot of how your finances look. The recommendations and tips and reminders are all relevant. Great app.
369,Meme Kimchii,"March 4, 2020",1," Not working anymore. Been trying to reconnect my bills and its giving me issues. I've uninstalled, cleared cache, and restarted but nothing helps. The Tmobile account has been broken for weeks now. Rather not use this anymore."
370,Mateo Lee,"March 10, 2020",3," Overall good app. Just one thing, when u set budget amount, plz let me type number. Dragging up and down is so finicky. I can put the number I want. 1005, 990, 1110..... let me just type 1,000."
371,Jakob Visic,"March 16, 2020",4, Easy and fast way to stay in touch with your spending habbits. This app offers for free what other apps ask you to pay for. Some functionally to look at past months and to changing the tracking dates to your paycheck would be useful.
372,David Day,"April 9, 2020",4, I generally like Mint. It's easy to use and convenient. I do not like the limit on password length. My bank prefers a longer password than Mint allows.

376,Melanie S,"February 27, 2020",4," The app and program are pretty solid, but for a lot of features (like goal tracking) you have to be signed onto the website. I also wish it would send less misleading notifications to grab attention."
377,Jared Rutledge,"March 1, 2020",4," Needs to stop asking for sign in when switching apps, and duplicates my credit card transactions on one account when the statement comes. Other than that been using it for eight years and it's just fine."
378,Myra popejoy,"March 5, 2020",5," Mint presents a variety of ways to look at and analyze your income and spending. It is a great resource to pull all of my finaces together in one picture. I feel safe using it, knowing it is a secured Intuit product."
379,Lyndale Newcomb,"March 16, 2020",5," I have been a Mint user for five+ years now. Being able to see all my money and debt in one place has helped me 1) not miss any payments, which means no late fees and 2) seeing all my debt, I can pay down the highest debt first, allowing me to get out of debt faster. I love Mint!"

386,Kyle Roatcap,"February 25, 2020",4," Takes me to a whole other level, watching where my money goes and where I'm at throughout the month and year is very helpful. Sometimes tells me I'm being charged double and messed with the big picture money, it corrects."

394,Giancarlo León,"February 18, 2020",1," Very disappointed with the app, at one point in my life I would've given this app seven stars if possible. Now I'm looking for an alternative after having to pay 4 late fees because my bill didn't show. Thanks Mint but our relationship is through."

428,Staci Beussink,"February 15, 2020",5, I like being able to categorize my expenses. At the end of the year it's easy to export and sort in a spreadsheet. I do this for taxes and to see spending patterns from year to year.

451,Johanna Toldyouso,"April 4, 2020",5," Excellent app, has helped me pay off my credit cards by showing how much I spend in different categories!!"
452,Meredith,"April 4, 2020",2," Good, until it won't accept or retain a handful of login passwords that work on web browsers or individual apps. Then it's just annoying."
453,SUSANNE SIMMONS,"April 3, 2020",3, Doesn't give the flexibility to not connect to a bank or institution. In other words it requires you to connect to a bank or some kind of institution. Doesn't just let you go by the money you have in your personal safe or on hand in your household.
454,Brian Gallagher,"March 16, 2020",2, The app has improved but the widget no longer updates. It currently shows my balance from 5 days ago. It's been a problem for a few months.
455,Harry Zimmer,"February 7, 2020",3," Helps me budget my expenses each month. However, there is still some connection issues with accounts. Verizon and T mobile to be specific."
456,Jamie McDonald,"February 15, 2020",5, Used mint for years. Works very very well. Like all finance apps it runs into its share of security issues with your accounts. Generally speaking they are fixed quickly.
457,Toppmad,"February 22, 2020",5, Was able to hook up with my small local bank which doesn't happen with other budgeting apps. Really made it easy to catagorize my spending and place budgets that I'm able to follow. No more mis information
458,Leelah Parsons,"February 26, 2020",5," Love Mint! Organizes everything easily and reveals so much about your habits. It really has got me surprisingly organized, saving money, and paying bills on time."

Now I can see where I spend my money and make proper adjustments. I am more conscious now and feel like I am better at managing my money. It's been a positive experience knowing I am making wiser choices during the month. I like the graph breakdown too.
460,Courtney Robinson,"February 29, 2020",5, Fantastic app. Being able to see our average spending helped my husband and me make a realistic budget and save SO MUCH money every month. Highly recommended!
461,Marco Lopez,"March 19, 2020",5," A great tool to get the whole view of your finances, the app is great for quick reference but the website is in depth with a lot more details."
462,Branden Coker,"March 29, 2020",4," Super helpful app for budgeting. I wish the accounts would update a little faster, but it's a minor hiccup in an otherwise great app."
463,Jude Katatumba,"March 29, 2020",3, I think this is a solid app! Perhaps as I continue to play around with the different functionalities I'll eventually find all the enhancements I'm expecting to see.

468,Daniel Osorio,"April 25, 2020",5," Best way to keep yourself organized, and stop paying late fees!"
469,John W. Gennell,"February 9, 2020",5," Mint is great, super helpful for budgeting and getting a holistic view of my finances. Very sad that it's been ignored since Intuit acquisition. The Android app is pretty feature-poor compared to web version as well."
470,Randi Richardson,"February 19, 2020",5, I like Mint!! It helps me improve my budget every month so that i may see any frivilous spending and correct it. I am rebuilding my credit by utilizing this app! Its awesome!
471,Cobalt Protagonist,"March 4, 2020",4, Good app. Could use a detailed calendar view like Prism but has caught up to that app significantly. Waiting eagerly to be able to see the calendar without scrolling past ads.
472,Parker Lowman,"March 5, 2020",3, I would really love to see this app be able to step up and actually account for funds appropriated at such a better refresh rate please consider fixing this thank you! This app is actually helpful but could be so much more....
473,Theo DeLuca,"March 19, 2020",5," The app is simple to use and simple to understand. Connecting all my financial accounts is easy from bank accounts, credit cards, and even stock trading apps."

475,Kyle Neff,"February 12, 2020",4," Works great for most budget items. I have to re-enter some of my account information weekly, but I am very happy overall."
476,Robyn Grahn,"February 17, 2020",4," I check mint every other day and it's incredibly helpful. I know exactly where I'm at financially from all of my investments, bank accounts, and retirement accounts."
477,Madalyn De Jesus,"March 11, 2020",4, Worked great until it didn't. Refused to connect to one of my credit card accounts and after days of trying I gave up and uninstalled.
478,Damon Jackson,"March 26, 2020",5," Great tool for tracking your expenses, while also providing one with helpful tips in managing your money! Thank you for this wonderful tool!!!!"

480,Sean Eyler,"April 17, 2020",5, Great. I compulsively check my personal finances 5 times a day. I know where every dollar goes
481,A Google user,"March 12, 2020",2," Connectivity to Verizon, Spectrum internet, & National Grid have never worked. Was hit and miss for PayPal then stopped completely. And has just recently stopped for Progressive. Can't track any of these automatically now."
482,Jacqueline Pruitt,"March 14, 2020",5, This app has changed the way I keep up with my finances. I tell all of my friends about the great features and the ease of use. UPDATE: I wouldn't use any other app to manage my finances.
483,Beth Harmony,"March 26, 2020",1," The ""live help"" flouting button is obnoxious. Horrible idea, at least let us toggle it off. Would make more sense as a tile or tab (like alerts and overview are)."
484,Luke Bethman,"February 24, 2020",2," Doesn't update consistently, requires login info updated and must be monitored closely to keep it running smooth. A great concept that falls short in many catagories"
485,Joshua Everett,"February 13, 2020",4," It works and gives me solid info on my accounts and how I use them. Could use a few adjustments, specifically to customizability, but nothing major needed so far."
486,Steve Minyo,"February 12, 2020",5," The app is great for budgeting, tracking net worth, and seeing all your accounts in one place. Can't recommend enough!"
487,kristin ferderber,"February 14, 2020",3," Getting more intuitive. Still needing to search to find simple things, like transactions for one specific acct (keep going to list of accts, which only gives very basic info)"
488,HyunJi Boo,"February 17, 2020",2," The split function and Android app is defective. Does not allow you to choose ""hide from budget"" for part of transaction after split. It also is finnicky with showing you the amounts after split. iOS app worked much better."
489,Melinda Heath,"February 16, 2020",4, The app is a great way to keep track of all your finances but there are some problems that make it hard to use. It takes a long time to update accounts and the app itself is slow.
490,Haley Carra,"February 18, 2020",1," I have an Intuit Turbo card through Green Dot Bank. Green Dot wasnt even an option for the banks you can connect, how can Intuit have a budget app and not have their own bank as an option?? I wasn't able to use the app since I couldn't connect my bank account."
491,Edward Nagurny,"March 9, 2020",1, Terrible with credential management. Now locked out of multiple accounts because this app STILL does a terrible job updating login information. Now I remember why I stopped using Mint.
492,cameron stephens,"March 17, 2020",5, Works great! I've looked everywhere for an app that let's you link accounts and let's you manually adjust things and this is the best I've found!
493,Yeraldin Lopez,"March 20, 2020",5," It's a great app, easy to use. I have nothing else to add that other reviewers haven't before. It's more than worth the download; get it and use it!"
494,David Board,"April 3, 2020",4, Great one place financial tracking. A bit hard to keep all the accounts linked but that is mostly two step authentication.
495,Cole Moffitt,"April 3, 2020",5, Great app! Has all my accounts in one place and really easy to set up budgets and see how I'm spending money
496,Joshua Miller,"April 17, 2020",5," Love it, very easy to bring everything together."
497,Crystal Knackmus,"February 9, 2020",4, I use this app almost daily. And it helps keep me on budget. I wish there was an easy way to compare spending habits from month to month though.
498,Carhys Byram,"February 7, 2020",5, I love that it can link to accounts to keep better track of my spending more accurately than I do! Plus having a place to view my credit score 😁
499,Rick Wilcox,"February 11, 2020",4, App work's good but could use some improvement. Like my local elec. Company won't connect. Also it would be nice if you could set your budget amounts

502,Luis saenz,"March 3, 2020",4, I rate it 4 starts because I can't see my trends from past months and I can't make my own categories of expenses. Other wise this app is perfect!
503,Jesse Coates,"March 4, 2020",5, Very easy to use and is helpful by sending alerts and reminders. Seeing trends in spending I a great way to get finances on track.
504,Mark Loveless,"March 4, 2020",5, Great app to budget ur money.. unusually can't link up my bank since it's small and local but here I found it.. also u might have to put time into personalizing it to fit it needs but deff worth it.. 5 star
505,Ian Hancock,"March 10, 2020",1," Service is great. Love the browser version. Mobile app is nearly useless without a budge widget. When that happens, I will revise my rating up."
506,Nadine,"March 18, 2020",1," Your app sucks. Always telling me ""something occurer, please try again later."" Only to never work again later either. Not a reliable app for bills and assets management when it doesn't work half the time."
507,Jose H,"March 23, 2020",4, Really useful to manage your finances. The only thing I wish it had was better category management and more control over what to track.

510,Damon Roberts,"April 2, 2020",5," I'm av big Data person, so love that it allows you to set budgets and see trends. In addition to providing your credit scores."
511,Brandon Nahum,"February 27, 2020",3, I love the app but it has one serious flaw: all of my transfers between my bank accounts count toward my expenses and income making the numbers very high and inaccurate.
512,Niranjan G,"February 28, 2020",5," Very good app. I use the web version mostly but mobile app is good too minus few trend features. Apart from that otherwise, it is still a great app for tracking money"
513,Zhu Yuwei,"March 8, 2020",1, Budget feature with some irritating bugs that has not been resolved for a long time. The app is also full of ads.
514,Malcom Thomas,"March 8, 2020",5, Works well with my tablet. Easy set up of a budget and good quick overview. Nice that when my bank tries to weasel a charge out of me I get notified.
515,Breanna Mcnamara,"March 14, 2020",5, Huge eye opener! So thankful to have this app. It has changed my life. I finally (at 38 years old) feel like I have my finances in order!

518,Ace Cat,"March 25, 2020",5, This is a pretty great app to see and track your income and your spending. I definitely recommend this app is very useful. It takes some time to get it set up once you do it's really really good.
519,Gregory Gilliard,"March 29, 2020",5," Great app,information is very accurate! I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested in their credit numbers."

521,martin,"February 9, 2020",1," The app used to be quick about updating balances. It now struggles to stay current and gives an inaccurate picture of your finances. Mint, please fix this. Thinking of deleting."
522,Danielle Hodgins,"February 20, 2020",4," So far, my experience has been good with mint, in tracking my accounts, and incoming and outgoing transactions."
523,Jori VanAntwerp,"February 22, 2020",5, Absolutely indispensable. Would love to see more granular features for reporting and budgeting. Even if pay-gated.
524,Sayuri Mizuguchi,"February 27, 2020",4, The app is great. I think one thing could be improved in the future is about the Mint features being the same as when we are in the web browser
525,Mallie Jason,"April 11, 2020",5," I love this app. It gets all your accounts together, shows debt, assets, credit score etc. Love it very handy!"
526,Maxamyze,"April 13, 2020",5," App has gotten better, use it everyday to stay on top of everything."
527,JD Crawford,"February 6, 2020",5, Everyone should use this secure app to really know the ground truth of how you are spending your money. Why use spreadsheets when you can have it absolutely accurate and accessible.
528,Kyle Shepherd,"February 12, 2020",4, Great but not all bills can be linked but overall great. It really helps to see where your money is going.
529,Brandon Dunson,"February 14, 2020",5," Keeps all the things in one place that's easy to use. However, I would appreciate the option to pay for the app instead of the in app advertising."
530,SAKIB,"February 17, 2020",1," Mint was great at first, now went downhill. Automatic sync doesn't work. I can't open the app everyday to sync it, and then it shows me transactions and email about way old expenses. Horrible."

I wanted this app to help me get a grip on my financials and it has not done that. It does not send me notifications about bills it does not give tips honestly I think mint profits from the back end of data grabing. If your going to take my data and sell it you might as well help me be a more responsible person. But no again the consumer is offered a service to ""help"" and just sell your data"
532,Sacksofwine,"February 29, 2020",5, Just being able to login and see my credit score helps so much. I don't have to go through the pains of filling out an annual credit report request
533,Deirdre Burns Mondor,"March 6, 2020",4," I just wish that the categories for each payment would learn better, I keep having to re-categorize the same vendor every time."
534,Noah Conrad,"March 29, 2020",4, Great syncing capabilities and spending trends analysis. Investments tracking is a bit wonky and would like more flexibility in how goals are defined.
535,Tony Ryland,"March 29, 2020",2, Used to be great but now often struggles to update. Kinda useless at 2100 hours on a Sunday night. Last updated 6 hours ago.

549,Amanda Route,"February 6, 2020",2, 1. It takes forever to update 2. It does NOT subtract pending transactions or transactions I put in there or bills I say are paid 3. It is always behind by a day or two with three ending balance
550,Sarah Diaz,"February 7, 2020",4, Good app. I wish it updated more timely though. It takes a full day to update all the transactions.
551,Dustin Smith,"February 11, 2020",5, Love this app! Really organized for managing all of your accounts! This app motivates me to pay off debt and get that credit score up!
552,Bri Kerr,"February 13, 2020",5," The newer layout has too many ads, but I'm not paying for it, so just glad it works so intuitively for sorting my expenses"
553,Jason Frederick,"March 2, 2020",5, Mint is great! The visuals really help you see and take charge of how you're spending your money. No complaints from me!

560,Alexander Batishchev,"April 14, 2020",2," Here it was a long explanation why Mint sucks. Please spare me from your ""we would love to get detailed understanding"". I'm tired of discussing with the support all same issues, sometimes over the course of past 5 years."
561,Isaac Hartzell,"February 10, 2020",5," Easy to use, and I love having all my accounts connected, and the automatic additions to my budgests are great."

When it works, it's great at tracking my spending & helping me to pay down debts. Sadly, it has connection issues. Too often, it can't connect to my accounts. Or it glitches, and accounts start showing up multiple times, giving me an inaccurate picture of my finances. Also, while Mint has a Budgets feature, it is reactionary rather than truly help you plan for the future, such as YNAB. Still, for tracking my spending & my savings, it works well."

1353,Ashley Fogwell,"November 24, 2019",5, I was using YNAB but it was more complicated to set up and understand how everything worked. Mint was recommended to me by a friend because it's more reactive than proactive (YNAB). The dashboards and trend lines also help us track our spending over months.
1354,Jim Carlson,"November 25, 2019",3, Love to have one place to see our family spending. Syncing with financial institutions is not reliable first time all the time. Lacks flexibility to correct errors like duplicate accounts and missed transactions. I don't trust it but with supervision it is really pretty good.

I still receive error messages every time I login to check. Customer support replied that they are aware but have no fix. Not worth the hassle of bugs and constant ads to compensate for the free service.
1356,Katie Shaw,"December 13, 2019",4, Love having all my accounts in one place. The app is easy to use and set up. Only critical feedback: most recent update occasionally (at least twice per week) forgets my passcode I've set up and I have to log in again and reset the same passcode.

1359,Laura Prengaman,"December 31, 2019",3," I just recently downloaded it and think it could be great. Unfortunately only my bank accounts are correctly linking so far, all the others I have tried adding look like they connect at first but then say it needs fixed but don't give an option on how to fix."
1360,Brandon Yost,"January 15, 2020",5, Does that it's supposed to and seems to do it pretty well. Wish I could just split pending transactions in the app but it seems I can't. Had used in the past but had issues with two step not working with the bank. All that seems to be resolved now.
1361,Laura Hundt,"January 24, 2020",4," It's been pretty good. Lately, instead of using my fingerprint is been making me re log in. Once i do that i can use my finger again...just kind of annoying. But i do like that it pretty much does everything for me and is accurate for the most part."
1362,Ground Up Photography,"February 1, 2020",5," Really love my experience so far, easy to track business and personal purchases for tax purposes and to get a break down where all expenses are going to in categories"
1363,Michelle Blair,"February 16, 2020",3, Nice to not have to get an authorization code from my bank each time to update their data (since October). Not sure who's side I can thank for that!
1364,Kirby Jackson,"February 23, 2020",4, Decent and easy to use!
1365,C W,"April 2, 2020",5, Love my Mint. Used it for years! Organizes everything in one place.
1366,Arlene Quinn-Wood,"April 4, 2020",5, Mint is great. Reminders for bills and updates me on everything. Except my bank account.. It requires extra log in factors and mint can't do it..
1367,Rachel Maurer,"December 2, 2019",5, Very easy to use. Transactions show up the same day or a day later. A great app to track where you spend your money. I love the trends section so you can compare your spending over a year to a year ago to also other segments of the country.

I have refreshed the app and it will not reflect the correct info. It's extremely frustrating since I have contacted support and they assured this would be fixed. It has been 5 days since I spoke too support about this issue..
1369,Sunny Mallick,"January 29, 2020",5, Been using mint for a long time. It's great. Grab a cup is ☕ and get all your accounts and just set it up. It will do the rest. Mint is essentially my assistant. I can quickly see all my accounts and identify where money if any is being wasted
1370,paul ramirez,"January 5, 2020",4," I've used this app for years. Most recently, it takes multiple attempts (days) to refresh my data. From an app that is made to help stay on top of up to date information, this is problematic. Hoping for a fix soon."
1371,Lane Page,"December 19, 2019",5," I loved being able to have a solid visual of both my monthly income and expenses, and it was an added bonus to see my credit score without any negative effects on my score itself. Really am looking forward to using it now and in the future!"
1372,Dlcgrizzly,"December 23, 2019",4," We'll designed, easy to use once you get over the ""Quicken does it this way"". I do miss the ability to combine bills and the paying bank account into one view, a la Quicken. However Mint is much easier and straight forward."
1373,Rodderick Smith,"January 2, 2020",4, App has worked great as a financial monitoring tool for quite sometime. Unfortunately the account syncs can be frustrating and I find that i almost constantly have to go back and update. I understand this is not necessarily a Mint issue but frustrating none the less.
1374,Joshua Andrus,"December 29, 2019",1, Doesn't work with USAA and Android. My wife can access it via her iPhone but for me it says my information is wrong. I rechecked everything several times and my info is right. Mint just doesn't play well with USAA (or vice versa) if you have an android phone. Off to try a different app...
1375,joseph saxon,"December 27, 2019",4," I have been using mint for almost 7 years now and have never had a problem, the ease of synching accounts and also to have a one place to see all your accounts and reminders for payments is awsome and the fact that this professional app for money monitoring is all free is definitely awsome."
1376,PATRICK GERANT,"January 5, 2020",1," This app used to be okay but after many updates, this app is nothing but junk. I've missed many payments and got many late fees because i relied heavily on this app. If you want the fees and late payments, be my guess. I'm looking for alternatives."
1377,Kim T.,"January 17, 2020",4," Great way to capture financial activity in one place. Would be great if a manual account could be added (similar to expense), each account type could be subtotalled, and a way to see trend or comparison data. I have not experienced any bugs. Solid app."
1378,Jose Rosario,"February 3, 2020",1, This app has great potential but for some reason it will randomly not remind me of my due dates but will alert me to the late I received because the app failed to do its job...
1379,William Seed,"February 5, 2020",4, Great to watch transactions and see Market impact on inbestments. Budget doesnt work very well as it is difficult to categorize and truly manage budget.

1383,T Hinckson,"December 21, 2019",4, Been using mint for over a decade now. It really helps me to understand and organize my finances. Great app. My only problem with it is that sometimes it categorizes expenses incorrectly and duplicates transactions causing for inaccurate spending averages.
1384,Richard Roda,"December 7, 2019",4," Great program. Two additional features would get me to 5 stars: a running balance even in pending transactions, and the ability to set up recurring payments and bills that are visible and part of the running balance."
1385,Courtney Berry,"December 16, 2019",4," I just started using mint. So far i really love it. However i wishi could make personalized categories for my budget, and i wish once something goes uncategorized, that my budget categories would show up first instead of having to scroll through the whole list."

1387,Prakash R,"January 9, 2020",5," It works well for my needs. Getting a consolidated view of my accounts is a really great. I find it useful to track expenses, dispute charges etc , since logging into 8 different accounts is not practical. I wish they had connectivity to Wells Fargo 401k"

I would ask however that you add ❶ more International banks for bills etc ❷ add platform so we can add salary sacrifice cards/accounts ❸ update so we can see all 3 credit companies AND international credit scores ❹ stock & investment suggestions and realtime stock market rates etc. Mainly..... expand a bit for international users with accounts & businesses in multiple countries ☺.

1393,Ayana Moniz,"November 12, 2019",3, I absolutely love this app and I've been recommending it to everyone I possibly can. I use a Samsung Note 5 and Bill Reminders disappeared from the mobile app for me recently. This makes the app almost unusable for me now. How do I get this feature back on mobile?
1394,Korissa Schadrie,"December 9, 2019",1," Since the update ALL of my transactions are STILL duplicated and I uninstalled the app then reinstalled AND same issue!! Overall I love this app, but when I checked it today ALL of my transactions are duplicated?! This must be an app issue and once resolved I'll gladly give 5 stars."
1395,Sam Naimark,"November 18, 2019",5, I use this app ALL THE TIME! I'm building my credit and this is one of the best ways to play that credit game. I literally went from a 500 something score to over 700 in just the matter of months (3 to be exact!).
1396,IMMelita,"November 27, 2019",5," I love it the only thing that disturbes me is that my bank always sends me an alert when someone logs on, for security purposes. And Mint logs on at different hours every time, so I will never know for sure if i have been hacked or it is just mint accessing it."
1397,Wickie Lee,"December 5, 2019",5," Awesome app! Makes tracking budgets, income and expenses incredibly easy! The only problem is that it is a tad annoying to use with my bank because of 2 factor authentication. But I'm not really gunna blame Mint for that, so still giving 5 stars."
1398,Jason Cervantes,"December 26, 2019",5," Nice tool to keep track of finances all in one safe place. It does have some issues connecting to all financial places, but that is largely due to the institution protocols and not Mint. Overall, very satisfied."
1399,Joey White,"January 15, 2020",4," A lot of good things about this app, budgeting and bill calendar are nice. Unfortunately connecting some accounts just doesn't work for some reason, making the app kind of fail at being a central money app sometimes. Over all still a helpful and nicely designed app."
1400,Blake Latchford,"January 19, 2020",5," I mostly use mint to calculate my net worth, and figure out what I spend my money on. The app makes it convenient to determine how much I have in checking compared to my credit cards. It also does a pretty good job of categorizing expenses even without a lot of tweaking."
1401,benjamin busiek,"January 18, 2020",5," Awesome financial tool. Occasionally has frustrating repeat issues connecting to some accounts, but i think that is an issue with all the variation in security and password protocols between sites. Despite the small issues, this app makes taking finances a breeze."
1402,Bb B,"March 1, 2020",5, I am horrible at keeping track of my spending. I have tried other budgeting and tracking apps and this is the only one that has worked for me.

1406,Melissa Matarrese,"November 13, 2019",5, Mostly intuitive for the novice. I use this app all the time to get a handle my money flow. Great for someone that knows little to nothing about personal budgets. It guides you through the process and before helps you grow the knowledge about your own money.
1407,Mark Hopkins,"November 19, 2019",5," A great way to keep track of ALL my money in one place. Occasionally, the app has problems logging into one of my accounts. It's rarely the fault of Mint, but does make things a bit inconvenient sometimes."

1409,derek hoagland,"November 30, 2019",3, Good overall app. Kind of a pain to add accounts or change transaction categories to maintain an accurate budget through the app. Would be nice to change all of one type of transaction to a different category rather than having to individually.
1410,Cinnamon Tea,"December 8, 2019",1," Used to be a good app. Now its went downhill. I cant connect to any of my stuff. Sucks now. I miss being able to pay bills with the app, it's pretty much pointless . Cant check my accounts, cant pay bills, about to delete."
1411,Tyler Doudna,"December 15, 2019",5," Good app. Lets me see alot about my spending habits. Only complaint is some errors occur, and no biggie, but mostly I just wish there was a paid version so I can get rid of the ads. Would still recommend."
1412,Trevor Sean Olsen,"December 26, 2019",4, This app is everything I want in a budgeting app. I've been using it for years. The only problem is that I get four or five notifications a month about my credit score changing and it obviously isn't getting updated weekly.

1419,FAPOS,"November 29, 2019",5," A very useful tool for giving the various accounts a quick once over, rather than logging into each account separately. I've never had any security issues, and with the exception of bank or credit card accounts changing logins, Mint runs flawlessly."
1420,Obaid Junaid,"December 1, 2019",4, Great app. But one thing i dont like is that mint takes all expenses from credit card and then also include the payment made for that credit card as an expense. Basically showing expenses twice. Not sure how to fix that.
1421,Fisher's of Men,"December 1, 2019",5," I like being able to see all of my accounts in one place. All of the features are very helpful with budgeting and keeping track of finances, I was using a spreadsheet before and it was very tedious, this makes everything a lot easier"
1422,Chy Green,"December 12, 2019",5, This app has helped me keep my budget balanced and totally eliminates living paycheck to paycheck. It helps teach you good financial habits and I am one month away from paying off my credit cards completely. Highly recommended.
1423,Michael Burns,"December 17, 2019",5, I love the fact that you can have your investments and your multiple bank accounts linked to mint in one spot. No need to log into multiple accounts to get information anymore. Aaaaaand my assets are logged as well. (Home and vehicles value) A+++++
1424,A.P. Cooper,"December 29, 2019",5, It has been a vital tool in my ability to raise my credit score almost 200 points since January this year and also just makes staying on top of finances much easier being able to connect almost all of your various accounts to the app.

1426,David K,"December 26, 2019",4," Provides all the information I was hoping. The app is well laid-out visually. The software is intuitive, easy to add and remove accounts. However, there are a lot of advertisements that create a lot of visual clutter, but it is free."
1427,Daniel Todd,"January 7, 2020",4, Easy to use. Lets me keep track of all my accounts in the same place. The only downside is I cannot create custom categories to sort my transactions and make budgets. Would love to see a feature like that added!
1428,Katherine Mitchell,"January 19, 2020",4," The interface is great and I love seeing all my transactions in one place. It does sometimes lose the category list when I'm changing something to a new one, but overall very good design for a budgeting tool."

1439,Chloe McIntier,"December 6, 2019",5," Never had a problem with the app. It's very informative and helps me figure out all of my expenses and gives me my new credit score every month. It's amazing and really helps me keep track of everything, and its FREE!"
1440,Devon Snyder,"January 3, 2020",5," I've used mint for years. There are some issues connecting Alliant accounts, but they come and go. This is the app I use for seeing an overview of my finances, tracking spending trends by category, and monitoring transaction errors."

1442,Robert Janowski,"January 27, 2020",1, The budget thing is nice. But. Being the app doesn't keep up with pending withdraw. It only sees what has posted. This can make you think you have more in your account than you do. It's about a 2 day delay

1448,Sanjay A Khandkar,"December 1, 2019",5," The app is amazing as all your bank accounts , credit cards and investments are consolidated in one place. The only thing I would like to have is a way to categorize transactions. Sometimes the app doesn't do it correctly."
1449,Ryan Gilbert,"December 28, 2019",4," That aggregate all accounts extremely effectively and make pulling out data simple. We don't use the service for budgeting, too involved. If like to see the trends feature introduced on the app. We use it for net worth tracking mainly."
1450,Marvin R Calderon,"January 9, 2020",3," Fair: this app need show the right credit score, because it is far away from the real numbers. This app said that my credit is 632 last time was 664 but in real time my score was low then that 597. So for credit report is a fiasco not to thruster."
1451,C.N. Allotey,"January 17, 2020",5," Its is a game changer for me honestly. For my personal needs, it is not a budgeting tool i would use. I am looking into YNAB for that. Howver, gor understanding the trends in my spending to inform better budgeting and income decisions, it is perfect"

1453,Connor Maxey,"January 29, 2020",5, They do a good job. Its good to have a compacted view of my finances. Works with Fidelity and my banks nicely. The constant credit update is good. Im also just glad they're no banner ads or commercials. The advertising for the cards and banks they work with isn't annoying too.
1454,Siddarth Sadashiv,"February 4, 2020",1, It doesnt work most of the time. Accounts get disconnected randomly. Doesnt update robustly.

1457,Jennifer W,"November 20, 2019",3," Love the site, the app is awful. Can't view budgets or goals. It's just a lite version of the service. You're better off using Chrome and viewing the full site for practical use and the app just for checking in."
1458,Kelly Simon,"November 21, 2019",5, Great app for balancing a budget & financial growth. Great options & personalization. Some credit accounts need to be updated often but it only takes a confirmation & done. We will be using Mint for a long time to come!
1459,Stephen Lloyd-jones,"November 30, 2019",4," Excellent tool for organizing your finances and checking in on your account/s in a flash. Automatic categories aren't always perfect, but they're pretty good. I definitely recommend this app."
1460,Reggie E,"December 11, 2019",3, Buggy and to cluttered. I like this app over every other one that I've tried but you can just easily add loans on there that are in offline accounts and it show up. Lots of advertisements but it's also free. Needs some work.
1461,Kristyn Brooks,"January 5, 2020",3," I love the concept of this app, but I wish the balances were more real time. It takes a while for it to catch up to my bank account. I also am unable to connect my account to AT&T - It gives me an error every time."
1462,Nicholas Todd,"December 20, 2019",5," Pretty nifty app. Shows you tons of information on your finances and is great for budging. After a few months and all your accounts are added, it's mostly seamless and gets to know you."
1463,Renee Wigley,"January 9, 2020",3, This app works great. It just needs to recognize duplicate transactions. I use paypal for all my transactions which is taken out of my bank account. It uses both and doubles my spending. Kinda not good for me.
1464,Susanne Dyal,"January 16, 2020",4," The Mint app is very easy to use and doesn't have any issues, however I would love to have the goal feature built into the app. Mint's goal feature is one my primary uses of Mint and it's a shame I can only use it in the browser. Would love to see it in a future update!"
1465,Joseph Droge,"January 22, 2020",3," Great potential, but the app has some bugs. Right now it won't update my accounts. I refresh it and it says it's updating data, but then the same old data that's weeks old is still there."
1466,Cody Clark,"January 22, 2020",3," Some good, lots meh. For some reason reason Mint wont connect to Verizon Wireless, and that is extremely frustrating, as I wanted to have all my bills listed in one place. Not just some of them."
1467,Ethan Miller,"February 1, 2020",5," Great free app for keeping track of all your spending. Categorize, make goals, and add loan accounts."
1468,Ben Hest,"February 2, 2020",2, The auto transaction naming sucks and frequently changes the name to something wrong. Though I would bump my rating a star or two for dark mode.
1469,Amit Sharma,"February 24, 2020",5, Great app to see everything in one place
1470,Kali Hlava,"November 25, 2019",5," I personally love Mint! All of the tools are so useful to give me an actual ""visual"" of where our money is being spent. Most importantly, where we can weigh out our wants versus needs."
1471,Astrid Ellie Hurley,"November 30, 2019",3," While this does and okay job of helping me keep track of my bills, I do wish I could pay bills directly as in the past. There are also often connectivity problems with some accounts that can be irksome."
1472,Leroy Santos,"November 30, 2019",3," I like Mint, I think it can be a great tool when it works. I would use it more but I keep running into technical issues with setting up & linking my accounts. It's not very practical at the moment."
1473,Nathan Snoozy,"January 1, 2020",5, At first it felt a bit cumbersome but how helpful & useful! So easy. Had a hard time connecting my bank but once I contacted them it has been smooth sailing. I love this. Already improving my financial game
1474,Michael Courtney,"January 6, 2020",5, Great app. I have been using mint for years to tack my financial health. Having all my transactional history on one place has proven to be invaluable on more than one occasion. I use MintToReport for custom reporting.
1475,Anirudh Sharma,"January 12, 2020",2, 5 stars after 'Accounts' tab shows total available funds. Currently it only shows bank balance and credit card debt. Seeing the difference between the two as available cash would be really convenient.
1476,IncreasePeace935,"January 7, 2020",5, I really like the easiness and flexibility Mint provides. I'm on the younger side and it's really helped me to start to budget properly as well as keep track of my finances and credit on top. Would highly reccomend!
1477,Dhruven Vora,"January 20, 2020",4, The app has rich set of features which I like. Also the navigation is simple and trends view is good aggregation of my activity. One star leas because of the way ads are placed. Its disturbing. I prefer the gmail way of placing ads.
1478,Amanda haataia,"January 29, 2020",5," I've had this app for maybe 6 years now. Always improving and great, great way to keep track of finances (and I've tried a lot). There are promotions, but they got to make there money somehow!"
1479,Dennis Knight,"February 9, 2020",2, This app was great at one time now it doesn't show some of my bills and it marks some of them paid that have not been.
1480,Tyler Robinson,"April 4, 2020",5, Wonderful and easy to use
1481,Lee Fisher,"April 15, 2020",5, I like it a lot! Very useful app.
1482,K Hoskins,"November 15, 2019",5, This is exactly what I need. All my accounts in one place and they actually sync like they're supposed to. I use the website and mobile app. Both are easy to use and intuitive. I can see what I have and where my money is going.
1483,Daniel hutsell,"November 18, 2019",5, Great app. Awesome you can add all your accounts and you don't have to manually input everything. I'd like to see more features from desktop version integrated in the mobile cersoon. Overall great app 👍
1484,Alex Seo,"November 19, 2019",1, Followed instructions all the way until linking my bank and the app crashed. Now the app just kicks me out when I try to sign in and says login failed. I dont understand how they mess up something as important as new user sign up...
1485,Jeff Lehn,"November 22, 2019",5," Mint makes managing my finances easy, having it consolidate all my transactions in one place to review has helped me determine what I need to cut back on. Once you see your spending and can adjust, you'll be hooked."
1486,Gabriel Balderas Aviles,"November 23, 2019",4," Easy to sync up accounts, sometimes they incorrectly identify some transactions and send you alerts based on that which can be annoying. But it's great to keep track of financial goals. The credit monitoring functionality is pretty useful too."
1487,K McAllister,"November 30, 2019",4," I have used several different apps for budgeting. This is by far the best! I rarely rate anything 5 stars, this gets a 4 because the main page could use some cleaning up."
1488,Christopher John Lindstrom,"December 22, 2019",3, So far so good. One really needs to get all of their accounta into the app to have a complete overview of what happening. It may be si.ilar to bank applications with the value added finance articles and various recommendations.
1489,Matthew Bennett,"January 6, 2020",3," I have been using the Mint app since it launched and my only ongoing issue it it not updating accounts. When I log in it says updating and downloading and shows all accounts updated, however, not all transactions appear and the balances are off."
1490,Valerie Zagnoli,"January 14, 2020",1," There is a bug where if you change the category of a transaction, it will revert back to uncategorized. This makes using mint, for anything other than checking balances, useless. I've opened a ticket and will change this review if they fix it."
1491,Dora Williams-Richards,"January 26, 2020",5," Very, Very easy to navigate among accounts and due bills. It's terrific to have everything in one place without going ""spelunking"" every time I need a receipt or have a question!!"
1492,Scott B,"January 30, 2020",5," It does a good job of helping to keep my finances in order....very helpful app. It's also backed by a rather secure company in Intuit, which is important when it comes to money security/management."
1493,Jonathan Rismay,"February 2, 2020",4, This let's you track your personal expenditures with a good level of detail. You can also edit entries for greater accuracy.
1494,Max Humpf,"January 30, 2020",5," Once you get your accounts linked and transactions sorted, mint is incredibly helpful keeping track of where your money is going. It is most definitely worth putting the time in and it is FREE!"
1495,April Stutzman,"February 21, 2020",5," Works well, I love being able to change or add categories. I love being able to set my own budgets"
1496,ami hodges,"March 3, 2020",4, It's good for notifying me of unusual expenses.
1497,Gabriel Mccarrick,"March 27, 2020",5, Easy to use and keep up with
1498,Brandon H,"March 28, 2020",5, Easy and intuitive. Thx mint 👍
1499,jetstopi,"April 16, 2020",5, Good way to keep track of expenses
1500,Michael Arnim,"April 16, 2020",5, Awesome. All accounts on ONE page.
1501,Rakshith k,"March 18, 2020",5, The best app for personal budget management
1502,Josh Widen,"December 29, 2019",1," Updating transactions often will take the change but UI takes time before showing it. Makes you think your action had no effect. Makes doing multiple step operations problematic. Example, doing a split then making one reimbursable."
1503,Sommer Simmons,"November 17, 2019",5," Absolutely love this app. I love that I can see everything, all my accounts on one screen. It sends me notifications reminding me when my bills are due. Love, love, LOVE!"
1504,Kevin Briggs,"November 16, 2019",4," Pretty good overall, but could use some enhancements, and additional features to have the full experience and be able to see and manage everything you can from the web GUI."
1505,Wendy Tibbs,"November 19, 2019",2, This was a great app before your update! No longer syncs without multiple steps. Hate it now. Useless and takes up space on my phone. Wish I could go back to the previous version!
1506,Julio Blanco,"November 21, 2019",3, For some reason every other time I open the app it thinks I am a new user and asks me to input all of my bank information again. This essentially renders the app useless as there is no way to bypass that part.
1507,Marcus Newton,"November 26, 2019",5, Fantastic app to keep track of all of your accounts! Great way to see all info in one place + Mint gives you a heads up when you go over budget. It helps keep you on track! 😊
1508,unknown profile,"November 24, 2019",5," Stupid easy to add accounts, easy to correct errors, which is rare since it is amazing at guessing categories. Heard they had a glitch where they mistook amount transfers for income and expenses but it must have been fixed"
1509,David Tzic,"December 4, 2019",1, The latest update sucks. It uses to be user friendly-budget friendly. It would show a circle and the list of all expenses in a orderly fashion. Now it's all confusing.
1510,Frantz and Kathleen Luma,"December 7, 2019",4," The app is on point with reminders and helping me manage me my money. So far so good. They only downside is it doesn't recognize all my service providers, especially some that are well known."
1511,Laura Rietveld,"December 8, 2019",5," Very Helpful Budgeting Tool I mostly use this online, but it is a great tool to make budgets, analyze spending and investments, and keep track of all your money in one place."
1512,Miguel A Pachebat,"December 11, 2019",4," It's a good app to have to keep track of your accounts, and to find them in one place. It helps to see what you might have in your account and to see what you owe, or have coming up soon as far as payments are concerned."
1513,Pyatrus Kalinouski,"January 13, 2020",1," The app does NOT maintain secure access to Financial Institutions accounts over time. I always have no access with one or more account. NOT the app, as advertised. (I've spent hours on support chat with no solutions!) :-("
1514,Jade Ferra,"January 13, 2020",5," Everyone should use a budgeting app to keep track of all your spending and this one works well. I can connect all my accounts and it usually categorizes correctly, but easy to change if not. Really useful time saver or money saver if you need the budgeting features :)"
1515,Jeff S,"January 24, 2020",3," App was great until recently. Now every time I use it I have to enter my password, then the 4 digit pass code I set. Makes me not even want to use it since I forget my password. Please fix."
1516,Shawn Strasser,"January 27, 2020",3," Great for seeing overall balances, but not useful for budgeting since it sometimes miscategorizes things and didn't seem to have a way to fix it with future transactions. It thinks purchases on my Lowes credit card are ""gifts"""
1517,Rob Cunningham,"February 1, 2020",5," Great for starting on top of budgeting, and being able to react to surprise fees or expenditures."
1518,Ryan Lunski,"February 27, 2020",5, Easy to use and link all accounts. Weekly notifications greatly help track spending to stay on budget.
1519,Diego Camargo,"April 8, 2020",5, Great app to keep track of ur spendings
1520,Petopia Bay,"November 15, 2019",1, Duplicate entries with no way to delete the extra one. The transactions are automatically imported but some are duplicated. This makes the budget useless because it miscalculates the total from all those entries.
1521,Lorri Sedillo,"November 23, 2019",5, I love Mint! I'm much more organized with my finances and timely bill paying. Their feedback on improving my credit is exceptional! All of this is right at your fingertips! Thank you Mint. Definitely worthy of 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
1522,Jaron Zheng,"November 23, 2019",4, Very nice tool to quickly check everything at once however it can be better if the categorization of spending can be more accurate and required people to set a catagory for each transaction before they make a pie chart for spending.
1523,Kevin,"December 24, 2019",1, It's a sad day. I have to figure out how to abandon using Mint after like 8 years. Bank of America no longer works and I just realized mint deleted an account and the transactions affecting my taxes and personal planning. Looks like there is no customer service to call either.
1524,Kevin Schneider,"January 1, 2020",3, Good app. But it loses my login info every few times it gets updated. I set my login to be associated with my finger print so I didn't have to remember and type it in all the time.
1525,Kenny Harvey,"January 4, 2020",5," I love having a quick snapshot of my finances available at a glance. I use mint on my computer, too for a monthly budget check-in, but the app is great for day-to-day use."
1526,kristen redman,"January 7, 2020",3," App is great, but there are often times when syncing to an account is an issue. Hopefully you can fix that soon. It's a pain to keep verifying accounts multiple times."
1527,Aaron Parks,"January 22, 2020",5, This is an excellent budget tracking app! It works well because it tracks each of your financial accounts. I can use my normal credit/debit cards and track them through the app.
1528,Donald Ballowe,"January 20, 2020",4," Overall good app. It brings all your accounts and bills into one spot, making money management a breeze. Also a big help at tax time, giving that you use turbo tax to file your taxes."
1529,Thomas Abert,"January 24, 2020",2," Overall, this app is effective, however, recently it seems that I'm constantly needing to re-enter certain login info for the same accounts over and over. Increasingly frustrating."
1530,Noah Ketterman,"January 28, 2020",5," This is a great app. It is very well done and has integrations with all of my financial institutions. It sends me all of the alerts I want and none of the ones I don't. Above all, it's free which is great."
1531,Kara Riley,"February 4, 2020",5," Very easy to use, even for someone with very little budgeting or technology skills!"
1532,Joshua Garrett,"February 6, 2020",5, Really awesome to quickly track spending. I highly recommend also using the website.
1533,Lina Nunez,"February 20, 2020",3, for some reason it doesnt update the amounts from my back accurately
1534,David Dolan-Wallace,"December 19, 2019",5, best way to look at your expenses and income on a daily basis if needed.there's some set up work but it's worth it to have one location to check all of your various accounts. Short learning curve.
1535,jdsteg217,"November 22, 2019",4," Very good. Just wish I had a way to get a customizable ""active balance"" where I could put in custom math against categories. Such as ""Cash""-""""Credit Cards"" on the dashboard"
1536,Isabelle Manaj,"December 11, 2019",5, I love this app. Keeps track of everything and very easy to use!! I love all the reminders of when my bills are due and also gives me a weekly update of my credit score.
1537,Mia Strike,"December 31, 2019",5, A true budget organizer. I love the displays on what I am spending in real time. My online banking does this too but the pie chart is the catch. I will be using this more as I plug more online bills to it.
1538,Karen Billnitzer,"December 29, 2019",5," I love being able to check all my accounts and balances in one place. It is easy to use. I can see my credit rating, see how I am spending money, and see upcoming bills. I use it almost every day."
1539,Eric G,"January 6, 2020",1," Terrible app! Keeps telling me I have a ""new score available"" but, I never do and my score never changes! It's currently 2020 and my score is being reported from 2017! Doesn't show anything current! What a joke."
1540,Tim Norman,"January 4, 2020",1," You had one job, Mint. Track my transactions. And you lost track! 4 days after installing, transactions just started disappearing randomly. If you can't trust a financial tracker to correctly track transactions, then it's less than useless isn't it?"
1541,Elier Siria,"January 1, 2020",5," Great way to keep track of all your cash flows. The mobile app is almost more functional that the site itself. The reminders, budgets, and goals are all really helpful tools to help you take control of your finances."
1542,Kevin Kim,"January 9, 2020",5," Great budget app, only issue I have is that changing categories in pending transactions don't stay the same once the transactions are posted, but it's not a big deal."
1543,Prom Queen Doge,"January 8, 2020",5," Great app for keeping on top of bills, budgeting, and credit score. It shows me how I'm using my money, helps me set goals for myself, and shows me what I can do to improve my credit score"
1544,Yoni S,"January 9, 2020",1," Syncing reliability has become terrible over the last year. Their support is chat based only and, frankly, useless. Their report/trend functionality is too basic and has not been improved since I started using Mint many years ago."
1545,Thomas Keiffer,"January 9, 2020",1," Terrible connection with bills. I get notices weekly saying I was charged a late fee on certain cards, when I check my accounts there are no fees. Not only do I get push notifications I also get duplicate emails."
1546,Robert Dionne,"January 11, 2020",3," It's a pretty good app for tracking my finances, however there are some issues with my accounts not staying synced with the app. Not a problem, just an annoyance thus the 3 stars."
1547,Diana Smith,"January 7, 2020",1," Used to love this app, but now the bill tracker is no longer accurate. Missing accounts due that are still listed on the main account menu or completely wrong statement balances due. Worse than not helpful."
1548,Nataly Sherbin,"January 9, 2020",3," Use to be a very good and usefull app, but after some updates all my Capital One accounts (6) stopped working. Tried to contact Mint tech support, but they said it's permanent and will not be able to fix it."
1549,Giraffe Tongue,"January 17, 2020",3, Overall the best free app I've found for easily logging stuff and one of the only ones that lets you add manual transactions. However being able to delete transactions and modify categories more would really make it stand out.
1550,Stephanie Knighton,"January 23, 2020",4," This app has really helped me keep track of my money, get better about sticking to a budget, build up a but of savings, and make a plan for paying off my debt. It has been a real game changer!"
1551,Lucas Eslinger,"January 26, 2020",4, Great app for single person budgeting but needs work if intended to be used by couples. It also has good credit card suggestions for people who have no idea how to get a credit card.
1552,paul mclawhorn,"February 2, 2020",4, Helps to remind me about upcoming bills. Also shows me fees that were charged that I wouldn't have ever noticed.
1553,HM Obeso,"February 2, 2020",5, The best app ever for expense tracking and budgeting. You can add notes to expenses to remind you what you purchased
1554,Becky Herbster,"April 8, 2020",5, A great way to manage your money!
1555,Ben Hunsberger,"February 5, 2020",5," i didn't think an interface could be even clunkier, but this release has proven me wrong. what mattered used to be forefront, not it is enless swiping."
1556,Cynthia Cuningham,"November 23, 2019",5, 11/22/19 Bug fixed. Accounts nolonger inactive. 6/5/19 Thank you for changing back to the old layout. Having to swipe 5 or 6 screens to see what I wanted was annoying. You've earned back your 5 stars.
1557,Jeremy Kautz,"November 17, 2019",5, You will need to take a look and make sure things are categorized correctly but you should be looking at your purchases anyways. MINT makes personal finance easy. Now the hard part is having the discipline to master your cash flow. This is a great place to start.
1558,Katie K. Ylinen,"December 4, 2019",4," Great app, but 4 stars for duplicate accounts when something changes. I know that's an issue on the bank side, but not very intuitive to manually deal with it and relink accounts."
1559,ZBWoodwork,"December 16, 2019",2," When the app works, it works good. But I have trouble logging in every single time and it keeps dropping my account so I have to re sync them. Very annoying. Deleting."
1560,Kristen Baker,"December 17, 2019",5," Very helpful in seeing how much you are spending where, because it categorizes it automatically. Also, sets up a budget for you, and shows you how much money you have coming in versus total spending."
1561,Siddharth Suri,"December 28, 2019",3," Shockingly hideous app. I moved to this from iOS. On the iPhone this app is very well done, the UI is beautiful and Intuitive. Here everything is a mess and all the real estate is taken up by nonsensical ads."
1562,Rick Masters,"December 27, 2019",5, Security login requirements are constantly changing for my accounts and occasionally Mint struggles to keep up with them. But overall they do an admirable job of giving me a consolidated view of my net worth. Good job Mint!
1563,Patrick Darsey,"January 6, 2020",1," Doesn't learn when to update merchant category tags when you update it, not even with frequent merchants. Only allows you to edit the budget categories that have been used -- not easy to edit the others."
1564,Tommy Hajdasz,"January 9, 2020",4," Great app, I use it plenty and it's really been helping me keep track of my budgets. The only think I wish I could do on the mobile app is create my own new categories."
1565,Marissa Korthuis,"January 8, 2020",5," Love this for budgeting. I never use cash so seeing where all my money goes via card is great. Only issues I have is occasionally sync with the bank, but that resolves after a day or two."
1566,Lawrence Rouse,"January 25, 2020",3, I used to like this app. It's still helpful but really needs updating. I can't pay bills directly through it anymore. It constantly puts charges in the wong category.
1567,Audrey Brunell,"January 24, 2020",4," Some glitches, like duplicated transactions and lack of real time updates all the time, but overall an awesome tool for organizing finances. The best I've found."
1568,Landon Denham,"January 24, 2020",4," This app is truly a fantastic way to track and budget your money! The app has a nice, clean UI, but lacks certain features available on the website like transaction-sorting by category."
1569,Jerry Gaffikin,"January 29, 2020",3," The features are pretty cool, but it's really annoying that the fingerprint login resets itself frequently, forcing you to re-enter the password and re-enable fingerprint login. None of my other banking apps have this issue."
1570,Luke Miller,"February 18, 2020",1," Requires an account, which I refuse to create just to track some information."
1571,David Ethington,"April 8, 2020",5," Great app, I recommend this to everyone."
1572,Jessica Tsuei,"December 24, 2019",1," new update causes log in issues. I tried resetting my password and nothing, I keep getting redirected to the log in and a pop up keeps displaying my email instead of user name. when I use the email it says use the username... what?"
1573,Eric Ruoff,"November 29, 2019",5," Rolled back update is back! 5star ---- New update is trash. Used to be 5 stars but new update has ruined the interface. I rarely use anymore to check my budget or finances, I will be going back to budgeting in another way."
1574,Travis Killian,"November 14, 2019",5," Great tool to manage your finances. I personally still keep spreadsheets on spending to see catagories broken down to specific expenses, however this app is a super helpful tool to stay on track."
1575,Jonathan Nagel,"November 17, 2019",5, The best FREE app that help with budgets which kind of blows my mind. Like you get a budget app why do you prey on us by charging us? Ya know. Anyways THIS is a great app. I've loved it.
1576,Ira Edmiston,"November 15, 2019",4," Great budgeting app. Needs a few tweaks, such as fixing split transactions to actually work and allowing edits of them. Also, allowing custom categories and making the search/filter function."
1577,Chris D Wadsworth,"November 26, 2019",4," Really good app, my only problem is that I do have to enter a security code I receive from my bank every time I log in. But it's hard to argue with that."
1578,Jim Goodall,"December 2, 2019",2," Useful app, but the mobile version has minimal capability and compared to the desktop version and no support. I've a clicked the popup upgrade button for Bank of america many times, but nothing happens."
1579,Patrick Navarro,"December 5, 2019",5, I have used it regularly since downloading. Great credit monitoring. Very handing and easy interface. Just wish I could go back to prior month's budgets.
1580,Patrick Harding,"December 6, 2019",4, I would give it a 5 star if I could pay bill through the app. Been using for 6 years and I have seen a lot of changes but overall easy to use and good insight in to your finances.
1581,Lizzie by Design,"December 29, 2019",5, I recommend this app to all my friends who are just starting their financial journey as adults. It saved me from falling too deep into a debt I didn't realize was out of control. Some of us just need it all laid out to understand ^_^;
1582,Kijana Royal,"December 22, 2019",5," Best App for managing my personal finances! It conveniently helps me keep track of my checking, savings, credit cards, and retirement accounts all in one location."
1583,Benjamin Eichhorn,"December 28, 2019",5, Makes it really easy to view and track finances and expenses across multiple accounts. Can also set category spending limits to alert you if a specific category or bill is higher than normal that month.
1584,Joel Fluger,"January 4, 2020",4," I'm liking it so far! Only critique I'd give is that you can't actually manually put in bills that you have monthly. Other than that, it's been pretty handy."
1585,Natalie Howard,"January 13, 2020",4," Great service, super helpful! I only wish they supported foreign currencies, because sometimes my international transactions are treated as dollars (example 500 Czech crowns shows up as $500 usd on mint which it is not) which messes up all my budgets"
1586,ThatFatLady S.,"January 22, 2020",2, Minr used to be comprehensive and fast. I loved it. Now it only syncs most accounts 1-2 days behind. Only sticking with it until I can find something better.
1587,Helen and Everett Ackerman,"January 22, 2020",5," Excellent chat support. For some reason, the sort/filter options and reports are marked as Trends on the home screen. A global delete option and reconciliation would be good additions."
1588,Christopher J. Vezeau,"February 10, 2020",5, Great way to get a glimpse of your finances.
1589,Chris Long,"February 16, 2020",4, I wish I could authenticate with Face Unlock on my Pixel 4.
1590,Carolynn Kay,"March 28, 2020",2," It would be fantastic if I could access into actually Use this App, must I can't get in. P.word complications."
1591,A Google user,"January 22, 2020",1," Update 1: Jan 2020, After a year there is still no way to see your savings goals. Original: There is no way in the app to see your goals... but wait! There is one tab full of offers, JUST FOR MEEEE!!!! Sweet!!!!"
1592,Phaleck Silien,"November 26, 2019",5," Great app to help you see where you spend your money! Highly recommended if you are looking to stay on top of your budget, or if your ate looking to get your budget under control!"
1593,Diana Vierra,"December 11, 2019",5, As someone who has struggled with budgeting this App has really helped. Its eye opening to see how much I spend on certain things. Now I make better choices when it comes to expenses.
1594,Alexander Cocoles,"December 19, 2019",4, An excellent financial app. The browser version has many more features than the mobile. The mobile is great for checking your money and spending on the go.
1595,Evany De La Rosa,"December 25, 2019",4, It is a simple way to track everything in one place. The transaction setting could use some work; in the sense of categorization. However everything else works great and I am loving the new updates.
1596,victor diaz,"January 20, 2020",5, Great choice for budgeting. I've been through so many apps and most I've paid for this app breaks down how you spend and on what so you can see where you can spend less and save more
1597,Kenny Van Winkle,"January 24, 2020",5, Ease of use is fantastic. Really easy to connect accounts and keep track of payment due dates and payment due. Credit score tracker is awesome as well.
1598,Patrick T,"February 22, 2020",4, Great app ads aren't to inconvenient
1599,Daniel Jordan,"November 14, 2019",4, When I force refresh my accounts it still doesn't refresh but the web interface does. app is good for small things but if you're actually want to focus and do some more budgeting use the web interface.
1600,Jesse Coyne,"December 22, 2019",5, The app has gotten pretty dependable over the last few updates. Provides all the insight you need to track your finances and your credit score is a added bonus.
1601,Les White,"November 19, 2019",5, This is a great app that integrates with your credit cards and Banks so that you can budget yourself very easily. It really helps see how you are spending your money.
1602,Christen Walker,"November 19, 2019",5, I absolutely love Mint. It helps me keep all my accounts in one place. It shows me where my money goes each month. It challenges me to set goals for my finances. I recommend it to all my friends and family.
1603,Christine S.,"November 21, 2019",4," I really love this app. There is only 1 flaw, there isn't any place to put in any info such as phone and account numbers. No place to put notes of a phone call."
1604,Sarah McDaniel,"November 28, 2019",1, Cannot sync with banks. Multiple attempts over several weeks and still unable to sync with checking account! Super frustrating. Used to be the best.
1605,Chrisken Koth,"December 4, 2019",5, Great for bringing all your financial information together. Automatically generates graphs and statistics of your spending and income. It's also free!
1606,cool guy,"December 16, 2019",1, Worst app ever. Put in all my info and the first few days it worked great and then I'm unlogged in and my account resetted. All those hard minutes of work I put in vanished. Will not go through that hassle again
1607,Oksana Day,"December 19, 2019",5," Love it! The only thing is it doesn't remember when I change the category. So if an reoccurring charge is being recategorized, next time it occurs the app will assign a previouse wrong category"
1608,Ruth Floyd,"December 30, 2019",4, It's great to have all the info in one place but would really like to be able to add and delete categories and tags. If that's possible I haven't figured out how. Also the adds are annoying.
1609,tom ganrude,"January 5, 2020",4," I am currently unable to add my bank account, hopefully this is fixed soon. I love being able to see all my Bill's and assets in the same place at a glance !!"
1610,Milind Limaye,"January 3, 2020",5," Useful app to track things related to your finances. Also, you can get insights into how to improve your credit score, get credit card/insurance offers"
1611,Ana Vidaca,"January 10, 2020",1," For some reason I have to reset my password a dozen times before I can log in, and it always locks me out. One of the many reasons I stopped using mint and Intuit."
1612,Brian Rice,"January 8, 2020",4, I've been using Mint for a few weeks and I really like it. I think my only problem with it is it doesn't recognize a one of my bills and a credit card mint actually recommended i apply for.
1613,Happily Twisted,"January 22, 2020",5, Exceptional. I only have one issue and that is that it does not show the credit offered on ALL of my credit cards. It only shows the credit on my discover card.
1614,Kyle Martin,"January 23, 2020",5," Great app. My only gripe is that I have to fix my accounts fairly frequently to make the transactions sync, but other than that the app is awesome!"
1615,ensorcell,"January 21, 2020",2," Most connections to 3rd party accounts don't work and many accounts get incorrectly labeled (my 2 checking accounts are both 401k for some reason) with no way to change it, making actual budgeting with this app a complete pain"
1616,Conor Neal,"January 25, 2020",3, The app hasn't been updated with new features in ages. Why can't I see more of what's on the website on the app? I'd like to be able to see more than just 3 trends and be able to customize or filter trends.
1617,Mike Hensley,"January 28, 2020",5," Great way to keep track if expenses, credit score and helps monitor your budget. I use this 2 to 3 times per week to ensure I'm on track with bills."
1618,mraim6164,"February 5, 2020",4," Not as comprehensive as the site (like trends or net worth), but good for an app. Same connectivity issues."
1619,Jeremy Rylee,"March 26, 2020",5, Use every day. Helps me see all accounts and any potential fraud.
1620,Christian Mirabal,"April 29, 2020",5, Simple and helpful
1621,Joel Wasserman,"November 17, 2019",5," I love Mint! It's help me get a quick view where I am at financially. It's a great resource to use along with a personal budget, and best part it's free!"
1622,Arielle Miller,"November 16, 2019",4, Very useful. Few kinks to work out. Doesnt always sync with all your bills. Wish this app didn't have ads for credit cards and loans.
1623,Brian Scanlon,"November 15, 2019",1," This app has never been very stable for me. Now the latest update (Nov 2019) forces me to ""fix"" my bank account every time I refresh."
1624,Heather HHH,"November 19, 2019",1, I contacted customer service about my app not syncing all my details. It was on for one day and then completely disappeared. They can't seem to figure out what the issue is.
1625,Kyle Fossum,"November 23, 2019",5," Excellent service, very easy to use to check on all accounts in one app. Sometimes updating accounts is slow but it may be on their end."
1626,Brandon Jagow,"November 24, 2019",4," I wish there was a way to remove ads (yes, im willing to pay). I'd also like a way to set custom budget dates instead of the calendar month."
1627,Adrian Cubillos,"November 22, 2019",5, It will s a great application. It helps me understand where my money goes each month. I can make financial decisions based on the information I get from my spendings.
1628,Troup Miller,"November 26, 2019",5," Good-to-great connectivity (some financial institutions are incompatible). Excellent summaries, budgeting tools & advice. Best of breed for this type of financial consolidation app."
1629,Carolina Hooligan,"November 26, 2019",1, I've spent an hour trying to create a profile. It just loads on the sign in page. I'll find an app that actually works i dont want an app that half works when im relying on it for budget and finance help.
1630,Bonnie Gorman,"December 5, 2019",3," I used to really enjoy this app but it hasn't updated many of my credit cards in 4 months. So basically, it stopped working for much of the reason I enjoyed it."
1631,Jonathan David,"December 8, 2019",5, I Just downloaded this App for future purposes. And so far I really enjoy this app and all it's basic capabilities. I look forward to tracking my Credit Score and seeing where I'm at financially.
1632,Mike Miller,"December 10, 2019",4," Good budget tracking app. Wish it had some features like face unlock, checking reconcile, more control of budget categories. Though it does offer a lot for the price."
1633,Laura,"December 15, 2019",2, Would be great if you didnt have to log into every bill you have for it to update and you cannot add any new ones or update some with out the error 102. Useless to me.
1634,Jonny Kendrick,"December 18, 2019",4, Love the app. Wish there was a paid version where you could remove ads. There should also be spreadsheets and more graphs. Hard to visualize with only the values displayed.
1635,Lachelle Singleton,"January 5, 2020",4," The app is easy to use and shows all money across apps at one time. The app has difficulties signing on to bank accounts, etc... but otherwise it updates each account regularly."
1636,Braydon Burnett,"December 23, 2019",3," Absolutely love seeing all of mmt financial responsibilities in one place, although I really wish the connection to my bank account was more up to date. The amount it says I have in my account is never accurate."
1637,Donut Supreme,"December 26, 2019",2," It seems like it's a pretty good app, but its not working for me. I connected it to my bank and it's not getting any of the data from it. All my numbers on my dashboard just say $0."
1638,David Dover,"January 9, 2020",5, Helps me track my spending and breaks down categories so I know exactly where it's going. It does it automatically which after initial setup is what keeps it easy to do!
1639,Artemis Rose,"January 17, 2020",2," Great in theory, but it is constantly disconnecting my accounts. I'm done with it, it's so frustrating to keep having to sign everything back in."
1640,Al Diel,"January 20, 2020",5," Great ""one stop"" way to monitor all your finances! Has occasional problems logging into websites as they change their security measures, but these get ironed out quickly."
1641,Cjxtreme66,"January 28, 2020",5," This gives you a good chance to track your spending and set goals for yourself. Needs some work as far as some specific banks and stuff added, but gives you great insight into your habits."
1642,Audrey Thomas,"January 31, 2020",4, It's great! I would love the option of weekly and bi-weekly budgets.
1643,anthony accuar,"April 7, 2020",5, Good app for tracking all your financials
1644,Chris Toppan,"December 27, 2019",5, The new interface is horrible. I am having issues doing the same things I used to do in it and the cash flow page is messed showing I made a lot more money than I did.
1645,binny maxx,"January 11, 2020",5, Very useful app to manage you different bank accounts and credit card accounts in one portal. Been using for a long time. Awesome app. Love it.
1646,Caleb Barker,"November 15, 2019",5, Great way to keep track of finances super easy to use. Great stats and records that keeps me checking what's happening multiple times a day.
1647,John Thompson,"November 15, 2019",5," This app is great cause I can access all my accounts at once. It also alerts me of any mysterious spending habits so, it's another way to track fraud."
1648,C T,"December 10, 2019",5," Works well. Helps me see what my spending habits are, what I need to work on and even shows my credit score. I recommend using this app."
1649,Esther Pena,"December 20, 2019",5, Awesome app that keeps me on top of my expenses and bills. It's great I can link all my cards and accounts so that I don't have to worry about forgetting one.
1650,Jeff Herzstein,"December 31, 2019",4, Great for budgeting and tracking all purchases. Only reason it isn't 5 stars is due to the lack of investment details in investment accounts.
1651,jose louie lim,"December 22, 2019",4," This app is amazing in keeping up with my purchases, but it doesnt automatically register my NavyFed bank, and keeps logging me out when I'm not opening it for a week. But still a good app to use to keep check of expenses"
1652,Aaron V,"January 3, 2020",5," Really great for keeping track of payments, debts, and money accounts. The automatic budget tracking is really useful if you mostly use card payments."
1653,Winston Lee,"January 19, 2020",2, Syncing is the only thing that I don't like with this app. I have used this app for a year now and there is no improvement on it. Very bad syncing in both web and mobile app.
1654,Natalia Vanegas,"January 29, 2020",5, Awesome App for Finances. I really like how it automatically tracks my transactions and puts them towards my budget. I find it useful to get emails when I'm going over my budgets.
1655,Kevin Grady,"February 12, 2020",5, Great way to keep of personal expenses.
1656,Jacob Fister,"February 20, 2020",5, Easy to use and puts all your accounts in one spot

1658,Tristin Vezzetti,"February 26, 2020",5, Taking care of my responsibilities and this app is perfect for that.
1659,gregory moore,"April 19, 2020",4, It lets me itemize purchases in my life.
1660,Joseph Pratico,"December 3, 2019",5," I love this app because I can see all of my accounts and bills in one place. From checking, savings, investment and credit card accounts to insurance, mortgages, and more."
1661,Asa Holly,"November 18, 2019",4, Wish I could develop a budget before the 1st of the month and I could do with less ads. Great App! Definitely helps manage money my money.
1662,Stefan Walicord,"November 27, 2019",4," Great overview of my checkings account, and solid security. It does disconnect from my accounts occasionally, so that's annoying, but overall it's pretty great."
1663,Ritesh Nayak M,"November 28, 2019",5, Love this app. Helps us keep track of all our accounts on one place and stay on top of our goals. I love all the integrations that mint offers.
1664,David W,"November 30, 2019",5," Very useful app, still learning the ins and outs of the app, but has certainly helped us see where money goes and work to save more!"
1665,Kazi Sameer Huque,"November 29, 2019",4," The app has recently started to tag credit card bill payments as an expense in cash flow, this double counting. Really annoying. Please fix."
1666,Myxalplyx Xylplaxym,"December 1, 2019",5," Great app! I live its features. I have only had a problem with it linking up with my Citibank account. Otherwise, it has been very useful."
1667,Jef,"December 3, 2019",1, Fails continually to connect to my financial institutions. Updating a connection. doesn't work despite indications to the contrary. The latest app version is useless. Uninstalling.
1668,Ray Lim,"December 5, 2019",5," Its free and its well put together. Try it, what do you have to lose ? Second best thing is that theres no annoying ads that pop up. Highly recommend it."
1669,Émile Kamele,"December 8, 2019",2, The app counts transactions twice and fails to give me a clear view on my expenses. I rather go back to my excel sheet. It was tedious but effective.
1670,John Jerger,"December 15, 2019",3," I used to love the ease of this app, but now that it forces a password instead of fingerprint unlock, it has become exponentially more inconvenient, and thus less used."
1671,Jared Garfinkel,"December 23, 2019",5, This is my all around go to everyday budgeting app. It is great for setting budgets and analyzing trends. Would recommend. Please fix the security issue with Jovia Financial!
1672,Gladson Jacob,"December 28, 2019",5," Great App for the most part. Helps me see the bills and accounts, all in one place. Helps me with budgeting and tracking my Credit Score."
1673,Eric Hansen,"January 9, 2020",4," I would give it 5 stars if Mint had a way to track joint family finances. For example, my wife should be able to have her own account and login, but we should be able to share data."
1674,Madelyn Hostetler,"January 23, 2020",5, I was really struggling keeping my finances straight and I needed something to keep everything together! Mint does just that and more! Mint gives me the tough love that I need to keep me on track!
1675,Crystal Mehlhaff,"January 25, 2020",4," I enjoy the easy to use UI, the credit card ads seem weird but it's whatever. Mostly used for information, I don't budget with it."
1676,Justin Paul,"February 2, 2020",4, So much better than all the rest I've tried and syncs to accounts perfectly whereas other similar apps had me having to re sync everytime i logged in
1677,Felicia Griego,"February 2, 2020",3," Was going to install, but after reading the reviews and how there are many glitches and what not I'm not even going to bother."

1679,Stephen Miller,"November 27, 2019",5," Easy budgeting through Mint has changed my financial life by putting me in the driver's seat. It's not perfect, but its darn close. I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their financial situation, because knowledge is key."
1680,Steven Carter,"November 30, 2019",5," A very helpful and productive tool to manage, track, and conteol your financial and personal obligation. Excellent tool to work toward a debt free future.."
1681,Darian Cervantes,"December 1, 2019",5, This is a great app helps me understand my budgets a lot better. A lot fast than my normal record of keeping file on what I spend my income on. Great resourse and tool.
1682,Allecia Shope,"December 9, 2019",4, Very helpful. Just needs a little more customizable options. For instance being able to create budget titles of your own.
1683,Corey Simpson,"December 22, 2019",5, Super useful and easy to stay organized. Also I enjoy how it allows you to sync multiple bank accounts all in one to be able to track all of your cards
1684,Paige Lee,"December 27, 2019",3, Used to love mint when it would sync all my accounts. Now it wont sync major accounts. And i hardly use it. I would love it if they could fix the bugs and connections with accounts
1685,Parker Roland,"December 23, 2019",4, Great app especially if you have multiple accounts with different financial institutions. I wish it would update in the background but that's my only gripe with it.
1686,Lisa Lubarsky,"January 3, 2020",5, Makes it really easy to track spending and budget by category! I don't have to remember to write down my spending because Mint tracks it automatically.
1687,Marco Randall,"January 7, 2020",3," Been using it for years, has never worked with one of my mortgage lenders support blamed the company's website. Recently began having issues with NavyFCU. Other than those annoyances it works well."
1688,Kevin Burgon,"January 12, 2020",4," Good, clean way to organize and keep track of spending. Would be five stars if app stayed connected to banks for longer without needing to be re- verified"
1689,Efrain Cano,"January 9, 2020",4, Great app. Best for budgets. Highly recommend it. I'd be willing to pay a yearly subscription if it means less adds though.
1690,Birb,"January 19, 2020",4," Very nice interface and very easy to understand. Although, I wish they had sone sort of auto budgeting feature that can set your budgets depending on the amount of money earned."
1691,Kenyatta Purnell,"January 15, 2020",4," Good tool for financial organization. Often doesn't properly reflect correct balances for extended periods of time. Overall, high quality worthwhile app."
1692,Shane Gorter,"January 25, 2020",5, This app is an excellent way to consolidate all your financial info. I have never had to reverify accounts after initial link which is what brought me over from nerdwallet.
1693,TheBusttheboss,"February 1, 2020",5, Very helpful app. Has made my finances much much easier to manage.
1694,Benita Benavides,"February 1, 2020",3," Helpful, but you'll run into images that won't load every once in a while"
1695,Marcel Lopez,"November 15, 2019",1," Not sure why keep using this app, it never works right and accounts don't update properly. Missed another payment because this app was not updating the account. Don't download this app! If anyone has a better alternative let me know."
1696,Kyle cool,"November 19, 2019",2," It's a fine app to see your expenses, but not accurate for me since it duplicates a lot of my transactions. And there is no way to delete them"

1699,Kellen Oppermann,"December 1, 2019",5," Incredibly useful for money management. My only complaint is the accounts will have trouble updating at times. Otherwise, great app."
1700,Jordan H,"December 9, 2019",1," Slow to load, slow to get data from your bank, even when you get past the long loading time it takes forever for buttons or info to actually show up."
1701,Justin Jones,"December 9, 2019",1," Disabled email notifications and you still send emails. This is very dishonest, as the emails ""allow"" you to change notification settings, but they don't actually do anything."
1702,Allison Bellows,"December 11, 2019",5, Best financial app. Simple UI despite financial back-end complexity. Deals well even with very security-conscious banks that sometimes make online connections with other clients (e.g. Venmo) challenging.
1703,Amber Stephens,"December 19, 2019",4," Cool app, it does help to see all of my accounts at once. I'd give it 5 stars but sometimes it does load or connect to accounts."
1704,Alana R,"January 11, 2020",5," I love mint. In the past 4 years that I have been using it, it has helped me raise my credit score from bad to excellent! It made fixing my score feel effortless."
1705,Jonathan G,"January 17, 2020",4," Great app for budgeting, but I wish I could change the category while a transaction is pending, and they had a section for cash."
1706,Katie Miller,"January 19, 2020",5," I've been using mint for over a decade, and I love the tool, the app makes it so easy for me to stay on top of things and the bill reminders has saved my bacon a time or two"
1707,kranthi juvva,"January 23, 2020",1," I have entered correct logins, still it is not letting me to enter into my account . I am able to enter in browser with same credentials but not in Android app. Please resolve this issue."
1708,K Z,"January 29, 2020",5, So helpful when you add all your accounts. Keeps you well informed without having to look into several sources. The app is easy to use. Love it!
1709,Dan Kampman,"January 28, 2020",3, I wish this was a premium app so I would not get so many biased ads. I would rather pay a few dollars a month and no ads. Also some areas are hard to navigate.
1710,Jillian Morales,"January 31, 2020",4, Decent app to keep track of all my bills and spending. Took a star off because it keeps adding alarms to the calendar reminders even though I keep removing them. It's annoying.
1711,Sam Abtahi,"February 5, 2020",2, Why I can't take screenshots?!! Please fix this and the review will be back at 5 stars
1712,Eric Mackie,"December 29, 2019",1, The tool doesn't calculate a consistent net worth between screens. Support said that due to legacy and technical reasons this was expected. Math is apparently hard for this product dev team.
1713,Kathryn,"December 1, 2019",1, The uplink with Chase is frequently broken so no bank account updates. This time it has been down for a MONTH! This is a significant failure for Mint.
1714,Jason Day,"November 19, 2019",1," Heard good things, got the app, got signed up, tried to sign in but it won't let me. Says that my username already exists but I can sign in fine to the intuit page online. Time to find a better app."
1715,Janice Mosebach,"November 26, 2019",5, I have been using MINT for several years to budget and track my finances. I have never had any problems using MINT and find it very adequate in meeting my needs.
1716,Ben Iser,"November 29, 2019",5, This is a great app to use for tracking finances. I like the desktop version more for in depth reviews but the app is still great.
1717,Robert Weston,"December 8, 2019",4," Overall a good way to track finances, but the data displays aren't that useful, nor have they changed in five years."
1718,Erin Bell,"December 8, 2019",1," Doesnt work ... Has never worked , I sign in and it states the hamsters aren't running Has been this way for weeks. Have emailed for assistance with no reply! Very upsettimg really wanted to use this app!"
1719,Evan Harries-Darago,"December 26, 2019",4," Great app, but NEEDS goal integration. I have a savings goal set up on the website, but I cannot view it in the app."
1720,C Lowe,"January 5, 2020",5, The weekly and monthly breakdown is convenient. Hoping to improve my credit and this app helps to motivate me. Working to get out of debt!

1723,Rhoderick Medina,"December 25, 2019",4, Been using this app for several years and it's been a life saver when managing my finances. Only wish that I could add Budgets on the app like I can do on the full website though.
1724,Oscar,"December 30, 2019",5," Excellent for budgeting ans keeping track of your expenses. If you have multiple bank accounts and cards, this is a must."
1725,Emily Swedberg,"January 12, 2020",4," Pretty good features for free, especially the bank sync. I would like to see more of the analytics on the web version in the app."
1726,Ruvim Trofimovich,"January 10, 2020",4," Great app, easy to add accounts and see financial overviews. -1 star only because widget doesn't give you an option to only display where you are in certain budget categories."
1727,Carlos Williams,"January 12, 2020",5, Using Mint has helped me stay on top of my finances. In the past I would get hit with different fees and high credit card rates. Thank you Mint!
1728,Ismail Gardee,"January 20, 2020",5, Great app for One Stop Overview of your finance and utility accounts. Favorite feature is their intuitive budgeting tool. Very customizable and we'll designed. Bill pay is no longer available but I never used it anyway.
1729,Ryan Otto,"January 23, 2020",3, Not bad... looking to display balances on all my accounts... keeps asking security questions for several accounts and never actually connects... works for a little more than half my accounts.
1730,Harry Legrand,"January 27, 2020",2, The app has gotten worse over time. Sync issues are the biggest issue and and then manually adding transaction to later remove them when the app decides to sync make for a horrible UX.
1731,Sarah Kennedy,"January 28, 2020",1," Double counts money spent on credit card and the credit card payment, and you cannot remove a transaction. Not useful for making a budget."
1732,Anna Marie Valadez,"February 2, 2020",4, Lots of ads & to many offers for credit. I want to pay off debit & not get new credit. Other than that I do like to see my net worth & current balances.
1733,Ashley Aman,"January 29, 2020",1," Constantly glitching, I cannot seem to add investments or loan payments into my budget. Very frustrating because otherwise it would work perfectly for my needs."

1735,Caleb Malone,"January 1, 2020",5, Best money managing app out there. Amazing. (Would be cool if they added a feature to connect bill dates to google calendar) Edit: They added this feature to the app as well :)
1736,Chris Wiley,"November 24, 2019",5," Excellent app for tracking all of your finances. Provides a very useful dashboard of all accounts and many tools to analyze spending trends, budgets etc."
1737,Ella Colvin,"November 25, 2019",5," So far I give this 5 stars because it is absolutely amazing! Between owning my own business, working online on the side for extra cash, and budgeting someone else's check as a representative payee...my heads always spinning. You literally have saved my life! I just downloaded tonight, so I'll check ...Full ReviewSo far I give this 5 stars because it is absolutely amazing! Between owning my own business, working online on the side for extra cash, and budgeting someone else's check as a representative payee...my heads always spinning. You literally have saved my life! I just downloaded tonight, so I'll check it out a few weeks and do a follow up."
1738,Nova McQuoid,"December 4, 2019",5, Makes budgeting super simple. If you cant connect your Bill's through the app you can type them in manually which is very helpful. Easy to understand UI.
1739,Nando,"December 8, 2019",5," Great app for tracking spending, all in one resource to view your accounts. Highly recommend. .. but who knows what they do with your financial data. 🤷‍♂️"

1741,Harry Brislin,"December 10, 2019",2, Hasn't properly tracked my accounts in months. Constantly telling me I need to retry my passwords for all the accounts they track. More hassle than it's worth.
1742,Michael Cornwell,"December 10, 2019",5," Allows me to notate each transaaction for references and tax issues ! My Quicken does the same thing but this allows me to make notation on the go, on my phone. 👍 Michael Alias: Cherokee 🛶 Mike"
1743,Samuel Roig,"December 31, 2019",5, Easier to view and analyze finances than via my banking applications. It would be helpful to see expense categories for previous months as done with the current month.
1744,Alex Roberson,"December 29, 2019",5," I love this app. It keeps everything I need organized in one place. Easy to use, interface is sleek. Definitely recommend."
1745,Marnette Ruff,"January 17, 2020",4, Very nice app. Usually updates my bank transactions same day. I have had some issues with one account not updating automatically for the last 3 months.
1746,Michael P,"January 23, 2020",1," Clunky, hard to update budget from app, constant security issues with synced accounts. A piece of paper and pen will save you more time and headaches."
1747,Florencia Colella,"January 26, 2020",5, I use it to categorize income and spending. It takes some customization but does a lot of the legwork that I use to have to do. I like it
1748,chad howard,"January 31, 2020",4," Pretty cool might help with my atrocious ADHD , just trying to get by in life and I think this might help ! Thanks"

1753,Jim Arnold,"November 15, 2019",5," It can be frustrating that the mobile app doesn't expose all of the features of the web version, but Mint is still the best at what it does!"
1754,Jason Stratman,"November 18, 2019",4," I wish the budgets section showed spending outside of budgeted categories. Other than that, I use this app for tracking all of personal finances."
1755,Laura Petrine,"January 14, 2020",1," This app used to be great, but it failed to download data from my bank for several months. So if i can't count on it to work reliably, then it's basically a worthless app."

1758,Matt Lou,"December 4, 2019",5," It's free to download. I was able to connect my auto, credit, and investment accounts easily. I'll check to see if there's other accounts I can add. So far so good."
1759,Douglas Siegel,"December 10, 2019",2, Not as intuitive or user friendly as it should be. Could be much more useful as a budget planner and for comparing month to month
1760,Alonzo Vallecillo,"December 19, 2019",5, It knows where most transactions goes for each category of budget. Linked up well with bank account. No issues so far.
1761,Marc Bunch,"January 23, 2020",4," I would rate 5 stars, but I discover a glitch/error at least once a week. It's usually take an easy clearing of cache to fix."

1763,Marc Kennedy,"December 28, 2019",5," Mint is one of the best, if not the best, free budgeting apps available. It's a great tool for help keeping track of bills and bank accounts * * * * *"
1764,Jared Tomlin,"January 6, 2020",5, Great app. Still a little querky on some accounts and the app is a little bulky but in all it's the best out there for our personal finances.
1765,Amit Thakkar,"January 1, 2020",5, Pretty good. I can check all my credit card bills in one place instead of login to go each website then pay for it. Saves time!
1766,Barbara Reinhardt,"December 24, 2019",4," I love the overall concept of this app. However, lately I am frustrated with the constant notification regarding synching with my bank..."

1770,Jason Thompson,"January 8, 2020",1, Does not sync with TurboTax/Intuit if had an account with both before they merged. No option to merge accounts either. Unacceptable. Find another solution.
1771,Drew Coyle,"January 11, 2020",5," Easily verify the spreadsheet budget you've worked hard to create! Easy to use, helps monitor and reconcile that tricky credit card statement every month!"

1773,Sanjiv Mittal,"January 24, 2020",3," It works fine for some accounts, for others need to keep updating the details/answer question etc everyday. Specifically it is problem with Credit union or smaller banks."

1791,kat inthedark,"January 14, 2020",5, Really good. Nice to get a snapshot of everything in one place. The android version is better than the iPad version.
1792,AMANDA BACA,"January 15, 2020",4, Pretty good tool for seeing finances at a glance. Budgeting tool needs some finessing to allow for larger bi-annual and other non-monthly bills like insurance etc.

1801,Patricia Livingston,"December 27, 2019",3," Good app in some aspects , but lots of quirks. It's difficult to teach it to learn the correct categories."

Good example is that right now I can't see any dollars in the app and my usually steady connection to my bank is also now not functioning after this latest update.

3003,Logan Rosenlund,"November 9, 2019",5, Helps me keep track of how I am doing with my finances.

Hoping I get bill pay reminders when I add the bills later. Its difficult to trust any app toed to your bank account so dont ever just set and forget it but so far very useful. Good Job.
3018,Drake Blackwell,"November 27, 2019",1, The app is far inferior to the website. The connections are spotty. Can't connect to my bank anymore when personal capital can just fine.

3026,Brandon Hendrix,"November 13, 2019",5, Convenient place to keep track of spending from multiple accounts! No more hoarding receipts every month and then backtracking with a spreadsheet. Mint does a really good job of keeping up with us and we like it pretty good so far.

3030,Kiana Foushee,"November 11, 2019",4," Have only been using this app for about 1 week or so. Impressed with the fact you can see all old transactions, create your own budget and manually type in due bills. It's overall structured in a understandable manner and easy to navigate."
3031,Aaron Ramirez,"November 15, 2019",1," The app is too inconsistent to be useful. When tracking budgets, not all subcategories would be tracked.

3043,MJ Dougherty IV,"November 11, 2019",1," Used to be good, now it's junk. Accounts don't sync, they randomly disappear, I'm having to login once a week instead of it sticking like I checked. It's just junk. I just uninstalled it and won't look back."
3044,Clouded Leopard,"November 25, 2019",1," The App updated with supposingly a fast connection to banks/credit card. After that, some of the accounts will not update while other accounts appear as 2 different account with different names. And worst, the charges appear twice. This makes the App less then useless."

3048,Lawrence Day,"January 14, 2020",4," Good app, slick interface, sadly missing some of the functionality of the web interface. Sometimes takes longer than I would like for transactions to show. Would also like being able to edit transactions before they are confirmed."

Its only useful function is reminding me when bills are due. But what SHOULD be its best feature never works properly. The app touts its ability to sync with all of your accounts to give you live updates on the status of your bank account and exactly how much is owed for each bill and on what day. Sounds great, right? Too bad it doesn't work on about half of my accounts, therefore rendering it useless. Furthermore, some of the things it doesn't seem to work for are maybe the most important with regards to the syncing feature...electric bill, and gas bill. You know, the things that have the highest potential of fluctuating month to month? And don't bother setting up the fingerprint security either, because as soon as you have to ""try again"" to enter your user name and password you'll be stuck in an endless loop of -enter user name - change program to look up password - change back to mint - fingerprint scanner - enter user name again because it's now gone - change screen to look up password again - and on, and on, and on."

Looking over past transactions, there are several that are miscatergorized. For example a gas purchase was labeled as shopping for clothing. From what I can tell, it takes part of the name of the company and tries to link it to another company.... A gas station located in Fancy Gap was labeled as Gap clothing. I have read that after a while the app will start recognizing my changes and catch it on it's own. If not, I will be deleting. Can't set a true budget if money isn't listed in the right areas 😳"
3089,Heather Newcomb,"November 4, 2019",4," I would very much appreciate being able to look back at specific budgets for previous months to track spending over several months in a specific area. For example, how much did I spend on fast food each month for the past 3 months? This may be possible to see, but I cant figure it out."
3090,Carrie Hazel,"November 13, 2019",3, Takes a long time to refresh my back accounts data. And acts glitchy sometimes. I will add a cash transaction and then it disappears only to show up again later. Can be frustrating.

It really helps me collect all the information I need to monitor my spending without actually doing any work. One request, could a feature be added so you can change the category specific merchants fall under? A corner store near me is categorized as a grocery store, when I only buy cigarettes and pop there. This makes it difficult to use the budget function, as transactions are getting sorted incorrectly, and changing the category on each one is tedious. Thank you!"

Its just a giant advertisement and is missing all the quick to view data i appreciated from the old UI. I dont even feel comfortable using this app with my financial information any longer. Honestly, the more i think about it, the app is useless to me anymore. The information is not there nor accurate. Its sad, mint used to be such a quality app to me. I recommended it to so many people too."

What I used to be able to see immediately upon opening the app is now split into multiple pages for no apparent reason; what I could do in one tap now requires half a dozen swipes and taps.

I was disappointed with the bugs in the system though.   1. Mint has a very hard time tracking non-traditional banks like credit unions, it keeps getting disconnected   2. Sometimes double lists my expenses and reports. (double / triple sometimes too).  3. Double listing of accounts as well.   4. Tag management is also pretty poorly done, as I have to repeatedly tag the same kind of expense in a bracket. It doesn't ""learn"" that once Expense X is in category Y, from here on out, it should fall by default in category Y.  5. What is the idea behind showing ads in between your transactions? Why not at the top of the page? It's not conducive to using the app. At some point, there needs to be an evaluation of trade offs between ""showing ads in frustrating locations on the screen for revenue"" vs ""losing users"".

The UI after the most recent update is terrible. The app used to provide a top to bottom view of everything on one screen. Now I have to endlessly scroll though different screens to get to all my information. I have one one account which hasn't updated in a week, but I don't get any prompts to re-enter my login information. My transactions fail to update their category even though when I change an individual transaction I'm told that it's been changed. I don't know who thought the new update looked better or more intuitive. Plus the app is riddled with even more and larger ads than before. Can we please get the old design back? Why would you try and 'tweak' something that wasn't broken?"

It has easy to use budget tools and graphs that make it easy to compare month to month spending. But, silly as it sounds, I don't feel like Mint likes me very much. Sure, budgets are based on math, and you need to know if you've exceeded them. Ditto unusual spending that might signal a problem. But I keep getting emails that send me into a panic because it has mischaracterized a transaction (or a few of them), blowing a budget. I search for the problem, manually change the categories, knowing that it will continue to happen because it never ""learns"" from the changes you make. The dramatic red notification remains on the main page until another one takes it's place and it moves down a spot. I haven't found a way to delete it, and worse, they aren't dated. So when you sign in, you are greeted with a bunch of scolding messages and it's hard to tell if you should be worried or if you have already dealt with them. I also find that if you pay your utility bills or mortgage earlier in the month than last month, it thinks you have spent twice as much as usual, and the anxiety-inducing notifications come flying into your email inbox (and will remain on your main page in Mint). Also, I sometimes legitimately go over budget, which makes me feel bad. Is it shooting the messenger to find all the dramatic notifications and red graphs demoralizing? I know that Mint has to let me know to be effective. I just wish it could be gentler about it. (It never congratulates you for being under budget, for what it's worth.) I wound up setting my budgets ridiculously high and focusing more on the numbers to avoid feeling so bad about the whole thing that I abandoned it entirely. I am considering disabling the emails. In summary, Mint needs to ""learn"" when you recategorize spending. It would be nice to be able to create your own categories. It needs to be able to figure out that making two mortgage payments three weeks apart isn't an emergency. You need to be able to delete the notifications on the main page once you deal with them. And be NICE to me when I screw up, for %$@#'s sake. Nobody's perfect."

It's basically turned Mint into a giant advertisement for credit cards and other financial products with some of your information scattered about on top.  The old interface was superior.  Furthermore, the following ""pages"" simply don't work and show blatantly incorrect information:  --The ""budget"" screen shows the wrong information on the ""you have $XYZ left"" statement.  When you actually look at the dedicated budget screen, it shows the correct amount.  --The spending screen shows the wrong amount for what you've spent last month.  For some reason it thinks I spent zero dollars last month.  -- The income shown on the cash flow page is just wrong and does not match what is shown when you actually look at the dedicated breakdown of spending screen.

The ease at which you get an amazing overview of your information is very helpful, and it's always a good motivator when you open it. Mint is incredible for bettering your financial health, in my humble opinion. But you have to remember to keep the right mindset! Don't lose sight!"

As a loyal Mint fan that frequently recommends it to others based on years of using it, I am extremely grateful that they listened to our feedback. Budgets are simple and easy to use, but more valuable is the ability to see all of my financial accounts in a single view. I will also note that I use the app much more than the website due to the simpler UI."

I have a bank account and a credit card connected to the same account, and the app first treated my credit card as checking, showing my available credit as cash (obviously not how I want it to show up). When I finally got things connected correctly, I closed the app for the day, and when I opened it again in the morning it was showing my normal checking account as my credit card, showing my credit card balance twice, and showing none of my actual money, essentially making it appear as if I owed twice as much and had $0. I really liked the UI and it did a great job of categorizing expenses and transactions, but the hassle turned me off and I wasn't interested in spending time trying to fix it when other apps have not had this issue."

It would be great if there was a way to track that way as well instead of just a monthly overview."

Unfortunately the data the app shows is incorrect compared to the account via web. The 'budget' is completely off (shows more available funds than actually budgeted from income). The app is incorrectly showing a credit card payment as a transaction made at the store the card is for. Also, the general layout of the app is terrible. You can definitely see that it is more geared towards trying to get you to apply for credit cards, so they can get their affiliate kick back.   That being said, this app is being uninstalled. It is completely useless. Just access the web page via your mobile device. You will at least get accurate data and have the full functionality of the website."

Let's say you have a family (which quite a few people do). Said family members usually have various bank/credit accounts with different account holders. Some accounts are joint, some not, as anyone who has ever had an account can attest. Some families might even have two Intuit accounts, one for each adult. Is there some way to link these accounts? Not that I have found.   Ok, so you have to pick one Intuit account and put all the banking information in there in order to build a single budget. So let's say both adults in this family want to be able to log in to the account. Well, two factor authentication cannot be turned off, and since it only accepts the primary account holder's phone number, that means the other family members cannot log in. This is a laughably predictable problem, and completely defeats the point of a family budget; if only one person in the family can participate."

This app let me monitor and manage all my bank and credit card accounts. It helped me get out of debt and significantly improve my credit score. Many people, like me, found out that it was much better than Mint and quit using Mint. SO, Intuit bought Check and renamed it "" Mint Bills "". Then, they ""merged"" it with Mint. Actually, in reality, they just killed Check. Mint is still nowhere as good for managing money as Check was. I tried using Mint, but gave up. I now keep searching, hoping someone will come out with an app like Check used to be. Sadly, hadn't found one yet, and I hate Intuit for destroying a great financial management app."

I've had some issues like most people but if you hop on the web browser version you can 1 do more and 2 chat with live reps. I really wish the Bills and Budget sections were merged myself.

This sync issue remains unresolved for MONTHS! ***What on earth is the point of having an all-in-one app if I need to CONSTANTLY update or talk with customer support about updating?!*** It has become ridiculous and I'm finally fed up enough to switch to another service. We've used Mint for YEARS and the last two have been abysmal, in terms of feature rollouts (virtually NONE beyond credit reporting, which was an industry standard already by the time it was adopted here), account sync, and even MORE ad cluttering than before. Notifications randomly stop with and without having to re-implement settings, and despite forums chock full with years of requests for both paused goals & receipt integration by many long-term users (many of whom used onereceipt to work-around until it shut down), no action has been taken. Honestly, this is overall just disappointing and completely not worth the time spent fixing things anymore. What a complete waste of what was once THE best all-in-one money management platform. 3 stars, only because it served us well for so many years before now. Really, for a new user it's only worth 2 stars given the intense level of ongoing adjustment and tuning to get a real sense of your budget using their tools."

(previous review) new interface is terrible. very difficult to navigate. the previous interface was fine. switching to using personal capital more. this is a shame. mint was fine now eh sorry have to uninstall.
4137,Charles Yu,"May 27, 2019",1, Terrible update! The app used to be great before the latest update. It now takes unnecessary steps to get to where I need to go. Transactions from accounts that were specifically marked to not show up in budget and trend were showing up and giving me inaccurate information.
4138,Alyssa Barnes,"June 19, 2019",5, I have been using Mint for years and decided to get the mobile app so I could check my finances on the fly. It's a great tool and it's free!

4152,Tia Darby,"July 5, 2019",3," I love this app, it connects to all my accounts and helps me keep track.

Previously gave a 1 star review because an update screwed up the interface and made it much less convenient to use. Good on y'all for listening to user feedback!"
4199,EXA FROM THE ASHES,"February 14, 2019",1, The updates unfortunately have made this app useless. It worked awesome orginally however recently the information is incorrect and the math is way off. I've tried correcting it to the proper amounts such as my income but there is a massive disconnect between my banking information and the apps.
4200,Sam Ko,"May 2, 2019",1," Mint was great for keeping track of finances, but the new update at the end of april completely ruined usability.  Information is buried menus deep without any real context as to what information is where.  I get that they need to monetize product, but this latest update is clearly a push at ads."

4204,Kiresten A.,"May 10, 2019",1, so just like everyone else says the new update made the UI so much more difficult to use. none of my information is even on the main screen anymore and it just tells me to link accounts. this app which I have recommended has rendered itself useless to me and has become too difficult to use.
4205,Mara Lucas,"September 17, 2018",3," I like this app, but it's really frustrating that it keeps disconnecting from my accounts and won't log back in when I'm entering the correct credentials. I just have to keep trying until it takes. It has also duplicated a couple of my accounts so the totals are inaccurate."
4206,Chetan Raj,"June 3, 2019",4, So glad they rolled the update back. The old (now current) version had flaws but it gave you the information you needed. The updated version (now defunct) was borderline unusable and hid the most relevant information. I was close to switching to another budget tracker.

4208,Jacob Clenney,"June 8, 2019",3," Good website, nearly useless app. While the website application is really useful (I highly recommend it), the lack of past history in the budget or trends makes the app pretty useless for anything other than a quick check on how you are doing on your budget this month."

And when I go and try to update it, it shows I own $0 on all my bills this month. And this was on the 1st. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but that did not work :("
4216,Alex Small,"July 16, 2019",4," The app works great and offers almost everything the site does. Sometimes Mint doesn't interface well with my various bank and investment accounts, but that's mostly because of security features. I used the app to track my balances more than I use it for budgeting, but it's useful for both."

4268,Caleb Brown,"July 5, 2019",4, mint is a great app that helps one manage their money. The only drawback to the app is that it sometimes does not update as fast as one would want it to. that being considered though the app is great as it is a way to combine all of your accounts in one place for quick access and address.

I though maybe I could get help through their chat but 1 accidental tab of the back button means I lost the conversation and I can't find a way to get back to it.
4270,Marlon Lee,"July 7, 2019",4," Convenient to view all my accounts in one place. Minor issues. Duplicate transactions once in a while. Incorrect transaction label. For the most part, very handy to see if you are spending more than what you make to adjust your lifestyle. Recommended."
4271,Diana Huang,"July 8, 2019",5," Have used Mint for years, love how it integrates all my accounts so I can have a complete picture of my finances. Sometimes some accounts will have trouble linking, but these are almost always due to the bank, not Mint, and Mint customer service has been very helpful with these issues."
4272,Edwin Whitehead,"July 8, 2019",5," This app is the best hands-down when it comes to budgeting/personal finance. It syncs all your bank accounts and credit cards, as well as accounts from service providers and utilities, so you always know what's due when, and how much money you have after everything. It is the best!"
4273,Arielle K.,"July 18, 2019",5," a very helpful app! I like that I can adjust the budget and the way I can label things under hobbies and such. the chart of the budget is very nice, and the overall design is beautiful! very straightforward and sleek, but colorful and fun. love it!"
4274,Sergey Rogachev,"July 19, 2019",4," I love this app for keeping keeping track of almost all of my accounts in one place. Best financial app on the market. However, there are certain accounts that keep disconnecting every 24 hours no matter what I try. Once this issue is fixed it will be 5 stars."
4275,Bobby Sinclair,"July 13, 2019",4," I love the Mint app. Not only does it keep a record of your net assets but it compiles the data in such a way so as to maximize efficiency. With that said, I wish there was a way not to see ads on the overview screen. I would pay to not have to look at them. Other than that, great app."
4276,Brianna Taylor,"July 19, 2019",4," Love this app, so easy to use and helpful with budgeting. You can create your own spending limits, and get notifications when you're about to or did go over your budget. Some features are easier to use on the website but still I use the app 99% of the time."
4277,Melanie Connelly,"July 26, 2019",4," Great Fiance Tool! It gives a place to track bills, accounts, loans and such so you get a great idea of worth. It refreshes pretty well (sometimes you have to clear cache) and gives you a great view of ALL accounts you have linked. Wish would be for more flexibility on viewing Bill's and reports."
4278,Jeffrey Montague,"July 12, 2019",4," pretty great app overall. the only thing I would change would be to include a line chart for investments. That, and one of my brokerages (Robinhood) fails to update after the account is added, where it does initially have the correct value. Then it needs to be ""fixed"" every time I want it to update"
4279,Jameel Mohammed,"July 20, 2019",5," A very simple application to use, yet a very useful and powerful app. It gives a comprehensive dashboard of all the budget, expenses, drill downs, goals etc. Relieves me of the complex effort of tracking expenses across different cards and banks. lets me manage it all from one place."
4280,Amber Maguire,"July 26, 2019",5, I've had this app for years and whenever I try to go to another app to see if I can find a better one I always come back to mint. I rarely have issues syncing my accounts and the look of it makes it easy for me to navigate through the app. I love the fact that my credit score is on there too.
4281,Jennifer Thompson,"July 16, 2019",4," I have been using Mint for years. Wonderful tool to help budget, balance the checkbook, and track certain transactions for the next tax season. There is some functionality that works better on the site and the ad space is a pain, but overall would always recommend"
4282,Randi Watt,"July 29, 2019",5, This makes my monthly budget much easier to keep up with. It also makes it easier to make sure all my Bill's are paid on time. The only negative thing I can see about this app is it is not real time - my accounts only update every few days instead of hourly or daily.
4283,Naomi Jenkins,"August 25, 2019",4," This is a great app for keeping track of your income and spending. It makes it easy to see where your money is going and to budget and set concrete goals for savings and such. It has been a little clunky and slower to load since the most recent update, but other than that I highly recommend it."
4284,Naomi Chavez,"September 2, 2019",5," I love being able to see all my assets and debts in one place, plus do all my budgeting. I was able to link all my accounts: cash, investment, property, bill, cc, and loan. It's the best finance management tool I've used yet, and I've tried many."

Mint doesnt support two out of three of my credit cards which definately makes budgeting more difficult. The app also has a hard time recognizing transfers / withdrawals and could use a few more transaction categories (e.i. waste / garbage disposal is forced somewhere between utilities or home improvement because there is not a specific category for it.) Better yet, maybe add a few customizable categories"

4295,devonbscott,"October 18, 2019",4," I love the user interface this application has. The only thing I can think of that would make this app perfect is the ability to create customized budget classes assigned to the specified categories.

4418,Christina Segovia,"September 11, 2019",4," Great app except for the transaction categories. You cant even edit them on the app at all, and you can't delete the automatic categories that Mint has. I want to be able to make my own categories and not have to scroll through all these other ones I never use."
4419,Jacqui Bodwell,"September 15, 2019",2," I love the app and would give it 5 stars but I've tried to add my Capital One card multiple times and it keeps saying there's an error and to try again. If this gets fixed I'll bump up to 5 but right now, I've only got half my accounts on and it's not worth it."
4420,M W,"September 27, 2019",5," At first I was optimistic but after playing around on the app and getting my expenses/income squared away, I was blown away by how much i was spending on needless items. You can pick the category for your spending and set budget amounts for said categories. So far, i have high hopes"
4421,Jimmy Ward,"October 3, 2019",4, This app is great to keep everything manageable in one app. The only thing it needs is a faster refresh rate. When I first logg in or try to refresh it takes a while before the information is updated but besides that I haven't found any other issue with it!
4422,Farid Elias,"October 7, 2019",5, Excellent app that integrates seamlessly all the different services I need to track my finances. It also gives you the freedom on certain cases to change things like the transaction date or the transaction category. It's great to have everything on a single place.

4425,Aaron Alder,"November 21, 2019",1, Terrible customer support. You cannot delete your account from the app or online. You have to chat with somebody online. I have been chatting with someone for 45 minutes and no luck. Don't waste your time.

4432,Peach,"January 6, 2019",1," Can't add cash. This app would be great if you could manually enter cash and other accounts. You can only add accounts that can be linkes to a bank or a bill, which is frustrating when your main income is cash. Fix this error and I'll redownload."

4434,N K,"January 2, 2019",4," Loving it so far. its really helped to get my budget under control, the stats are accurate and updated throughout the day. While you can set goals online, you dont have access to view them in the app yet. hopefully that'll be an option this year!"
4435,A Google user,"September 22, 2018",3, The app does not give you ability to see net cash for the year. It gives you net balance cash for the month. That is just dumb. How about total spent for the year? Not there either. How about a graph for the year? Nope. Maybe if they add those functionality they will have better rating.
4436,Cindy Rhodes,"October 5, 2018",1, I have spent over 30 minutes trying to reset a forgotten password. No longer have the phone number associated with the account. I tried support but there was no chat available and tried to reset my password the long way. No luck. This is not with the effort.
4437,David Gordon,"April 3, 2019",1," What's going on with this app now!!?? Not a single account is connecting or updating. When I do try to use in-app support, I get a bunch of jibberish back in response that just doesn't make any sense. What is going on over there!?"

4442,Julie Lopez,"October 17, 2018",1, it was all fine and dandy until it started to duplicate all of my accounts and transactions. I would delete accounts and reestablish them and the next day it would duplicate again. not worth the hassle. the only good thing is being able to see my credit score
4443,Colby Shreffler,"May 7, 2019",1," They've ruined Mint. i just dont understand the redesign. Its far worse and less user friendly than before. I'm unable to do the key things i previously used the app for so now I guess I'll have to find something else after all these years. Honestly, what idiot signed off on this redesign???"
4444,Kylene P.,"April 25, 2019",2," Loved the app before, but now the newest version treats me like a new user. I liked the simply and ease of use of the app before. Now it is just a large ad and each page for a credit card or for me to add more accounts."
4445,Louie Apollo,"May 2, 2019",1, Worked just fine before but the new layout is cluttered and makes the whole process of using the app cumbersome and I'd much rather go oldfashioned or use nothing at all instead. I understand the need for ads but they really f**ked it up with this one.
4446,Gabriel Sylvester,"June 3, 2019",5," Thank you for listening to the reviews and rolling back the new UI. Your team is sitting on gold, don't change it. Best banking app available, been using it since I was 16 and will continue to do so for the forseeable future. I reccomend this app frequently to friends and collegues."
4447,Hansel Berbrich,"May 4, 2019",1," App used to be great. Now they updated it to maximize ad space while breaking half the features of the program and removing or hiding a ton of features that made using the app even worthwhile.

4450,George Harris,"May 3, 2019",1," The old app was great. The redesign is difficult to navigate, buggy, contains many more ads, and is ugly as well. I am actively looking for a new personal finance application and would not recommend Mint in its current form."
4451,Peter Hill,"August 10, 2019",3," This app is very useful for viewing all your account info when it successfully updates. thats a problem though because it can never finish updating unless i force stop and restart it. constantly gets stuck on ""15 of 15 accounts updated"" If they could fix that issue it would be a 5 star."
4452,j stroud,"June 25, 2019",4, It is so helpful to see it all in one place. We have quite a few accounts for special savings goals and other investments and this keeps it all sorted. Sometimes the account updating can be a little slow but that may be due to our accounts more than Mint itself.

4456,Stephanie Williams,"July 8, 2019",3," After recent update, this doesn't update data even after it says it has downloaded and updated my data.

4460,Joy,"July 16, 2019",5," love this app. it helps me stay on a budget, it shows me where am spending too much on, you can set up future budgets for anything( car, vacation, etc.) tells you how much you should invest monthly and when you will accomplisg your goal."
4461,Tyler Long,"July 22, 2019",5, Probably more of a 4.5 star but I love this app. They seem to be working on upgrading the features. It connects to all your credit cards and your bank; Even my IRA. I can see month to month what my savings are and I can keep trimming my budget.
4462,Tony Ashmore,"July 24, 2019",3, This is a great app. my only negative is the data does not keep up with you actual balance. It doesn't capture pending transactions. so you can't rely on balances being correct. The other portions of the app are great features and very useful.
4463,James Mueller,"July 18, 2019",4, I find this app to be very useful when trying to get an overhead view on my financial situation. One update I'd be in favor of is allowing users to purchase a premium version that doesn't include advertising. It's annoying to have a giant ad in the middle of your screen.
4464,Laura Hassett,"July 20, 2019",5, i love being able to keep track of our accounts and budgets all in one place. the app is intuitive. I installed the app after adding accounts on the web/desktop version so cant comment on the ease of doing that via the app. But once configured its great.
4465,Joel Hoffman,"July 18, 2019",5," This is definitely the best Budgeting app I've seen. Everything is very well organized and easily customized to your budgets. It''s so convenient to be able to see all of my transactions from every card, bill and account I have in one place."
4466,Roel Rios,"July 24, 2019",4, You can add bills but most of mine are not detected as paid automatically. This and the fact that i have to re-categorize a few transactions a month means its not quite a five star app. That being said it is very useful and I recommend it to everyone.
4467,Michael Lazear,"July 31, 2019",4," App is not perfect, but I primarily use the browser based version on a computer. I've been using Mint for almost 10 years now, and I absolutely love it.

There needs to be something so I can seperate gas from snacks/fast food since a lot of gas stations sell food. I need to see my spending on that, but if I change the catagory, it changes it for that store entirely. Also the app never updates/sends you notifications unless it's open so kind of useless."
4469,Dave Kadylak,"July 31, 2019",3," Good automation if your accounts support it. Need to add support for importing CSV files for the accouts that do not support syncing, like most other budget finance apps support! It wouldn't affect keeping track of the other accounts if you were able to say certain accounts were manual entry only."
4470,Miranda Passig,"August 1, 2019",4," Easy to use but i want it for monitoring my budget and that can be improved. It apparently doesnt save the budget month to month so it has to be rebuilt each month.

4475,Orin Dix,"September 5, 2019",4, I've been using mint for quite a while and really love the app. It's a great one stop shop for showing all my accounts. It's nice. The only issue is the more sites that are instituting 2FA mint is becoming a bit more time consuming to login and update accounts.
4476,Ve'Amber Miller,"September 9, 2019",3," I've been using Mint for a few years now and enjoyed it. However, all of sudden there are bug issues that have me missing bills (some bills I added disappeared). While it was good while it lasted, I think I will be moving on soon to a different app."

4482,Chris Leigh,"September 29, 2019",3," It's pretty good, and one of the better apps out there, but the automation really restricts the customizability.

4504,Nelson Nakatsu,"March 10, 2019",5, Love that it integrates all your finances in one place! It track all your spending and income. Only flaws were it sometimes cannot connect to certain accounts and there are a lot of duplicate transactions that pop up that I will have to manually hide to track my progress.

I'm afraid the garbage collectors are going to come take my phone in the early morning as a result. Who ever approved this redesign needs a new job. It takes wayyyyy too much longer to get around now. All this redesign did was change the app so it's easier to push new credit cards down my throat but actually make it harder to use the app for its features. Might be what pushes me to use another budgeting app after years with Mint.
4506,Jacob J,"May 27, 2019",3," looks, like a good app, but not what I'm looking for. looking for a stand alone app, that all info can be manual insert and not link to any online account. certain account actual activity vs description and transferred needed to be coded and no linkable for let's call it safety reason."
4507,Pim Linders,"June 7, 2019",1, I absolutely love mint but since the latest update its been unable to update pending transactions from chase credit cards. Over time you'll have hundreds of pending transactions making the app not as useful. The web experience is unaffected so i'll continue using it in the web.
4508,Thaddeus Eichorn,"June 20, 2019",5, I love this app for helping me track my finances! It gives me a snapshot of where I am instantly and lets me track expenses for budgeting. I have used the data from this app to feed into a more comprehensive budget and cashflow projection system in Excel.
4509,Michael Ouellet,"June 22, 2019",5," Been using Mint for years. It helps me get an at-a-glance look at my finances. Some accounts have problems with ongoing connectivity, but that might be an issue with my financial instituion and their two-factor authentication."

Needs bug fixing although it's a great idea otherwise."
4511,Nilesh Telang,"July 4, 2019",5," This application is Awesome! Not only is the interface, flexibility and auto population from accounts great, this app also has notifications when it detects anomalous spending in a specific category. Its has exceeded all my expectations of a budgeting application."
4512,Gail King,"July 8, 2019",5," This keeps me on track with my bill paying and alerts me to my balances on my credit cards. I would be lost without mint on my side. Just waiting on the iPad version to catch-up with the mobile phone version, then the app will be complete!"
4513,jairah zinni,"July 13, 2019",5," We use it all the time. It has been an incredible tool for budgeting and understanding our finances. There a few things I would change. For example, when scrolling through a month's expenses and I tap to another screen, it immediately scrolls back to the beginning which is frustrating."
4514,Annie Aguirre,"July 23, 2019",1," So stressful! Mint no longer syncs with my bank. I need to get a pin verification to login from Mint, and neither the app nor the desktop supports that. I ended up with overdraft charges because of this app. I've made several difficult attempts to contact Mint support without success. Uninstalling!"
4515,Thomas Corrado,"August 10, 2019",4," overall mint is great for managing your personal finances. everything i need at a glance. I wish the app wasnt as buggy as it generally is, but its workable. i recommend using it to people but with the caveat thay sometines accounts just wont update when you try to refresh and youll always see ads"
4516,S P-Ch,"August 13, 2019",3," I use this app regularly, but mostly just to sync my transactions while I log in online. The app doesn't have goals, charts and trends, or the ability to edit multiple items, like the site does, so it's really not a stand alone product."
4517,JФЛǪUłŁ MϾÐΛЛłΞŁ,"August 13, 2019",4," Great app for setting up budgets and keeping track of all your accounts. I do wish they kept their 3rd party account connections up to date, though - there's always some services I can't connect to because the API they're using is out of date."
4518,Kathy Nairn,"September 3, 2019",3," It's just ok but not great. On one hand, i find it lacking enough detail to know what the various charges are come from or who from. On the other hand, maybe it's better not to have so much detail available to an app. Im still out on how i feel about the app."
4519,Isaac,"September 1, 2019",4," This app is great, the features help me keep track of my spending but my only issue is that there seems to be a bug when I purchase. The dates when I purchase something are off by one day late. Fix bug and no issues with a full 5 star review."

4521,Virginia Mule,"September 16, 2019",5," Great for keeping tabs on my finances, I use this app to track trends in my spending rather than making a hard and fast budget. I mostly ignore the ads unless I'm specifically in the market for one of the products (like credit cards)."

4523,Felipe Dominguez,"September 26, 2019",4," Great intuitive app, had really helped me with managing my financial goals. To many credit card offers is my only complaint about the mint product overall. Having credit card companies sponsor your money management program is like giving the keys to the fox to guard the hen house"
4524,Daphanie Burnham,"October 1, 2019",4, Been using for quite some time. Like how I can budget and edit transactions to reflect what they actually were. Don't like that I cannot see or edit budgets and goals in the mobile app. Some of the alerts are annoying and not helpful too.
4525,Nathan Straus,"October 2, 2019",5, App does an excellent job keeping all of your accounts to track in one place and get an overview of your assets. Also highlights improvements and changes you can make and allows you to set your own goals. There are more features than I can talk about in a single review!

No help contact (some of my transactions show up duplicate due to a glitch & there's no way on mobile 2 fix this or 2 ask for help from Mint). The mobile doesnt show the goals you can set on desktop. Will continue using but differences between mobile and desktop are frustrating + classist."
4527,Nikola Hall,"October 26, 2019",5, Read a review before I started using Mint years ago that mentioned it was a great starter tool for someone wondering where their money really goes. A few years later I'm in a much better place financially (and otherwise) and using Mint has been a big part of that change.
4528,Luke Hunter,"October 28, 2019",2," Normally love it, but lately been terrible.

4529,Jonathan Herring,"October 30, 2019",2, Was great to see all my transactions budgeted in one place... Until it completely glitched and told me I had a surplus for months when I was actually losing money. Completely defeats the purpose of the app if I can't trust it when I make financial decisions. Really disappointed.
4530,Nicole Richwine,"November 9, 2019",4, The one problem I have with Mint is that I have to approve the downloading of the data every time I open the app.
4531,Jody,"November 12, 2019",1," Since last update 3 days ago my accounts are no longer showing. To many bugs, doesn't sync correctly."
4532,Kimberly Miranda,"November 13, 2019",4, Perfect way to track your expenses. Does not update right away your credit line.
4533,Daniel Olker,"December 2, 2019",5, Well made app that helps organize finances all in one place. The advertisements are easy to avoid.
4534,Joel V,"December 4, 2019",5, Budgeting never looked so good.
4535,First Last,"January 15, 2020",2, Neat app but cannot ad a few accounts. No point when it's supposed to be a hub for all your accounts.
4536,David Übersteuernen,"March 14, 2020",2, The app had issues trying to connect with my banking service providers.
4537,Jacob Johansen,"April 22, 2020",4," Great, easy to use app for basic budgeting."
4538,Armando Navarro,"June 25, 2019",4," Could be a great app, but UI is all wrong. Menus are in the wrong place. Layout is cluttered and disorganized. Ads are way too intrusive. Can't even access previous months. UPDATE to previous layout has much improved the UI. now just waiting to acces previous months cash flow."
4539,David Foote,"May 13, 2019",2," App works, but why does the app chew through 20% total battery useage on my LG G7 (which has a phenomenal battery btw)?? I check the app maybe once a day. This only started since the most recent update with horizontal screen pane scrolling. Maybe it defaults to run in background now."
4540,Gene Kane,"May 21, 2019",1, New app's interface is awful.  Focus has clearly shifted from the customer experience to advertising revenue.  Takes multiple motions/screens/views to retrieve information that was previously easily accessible.  Will likely discontinue use unless interface is fixed.  Shame.
4541,Francis Danforth,"May 9, 2019",2," Wow, way to ruin a perfectly functional app. Prior to the redesign this was a great way to get a snapshot of your personal finances. Now it is a great way to scroll through ads for useless services. As if the data they get to mine isn't enough."
4542,Luke Szczepanski,"January 16, 2019",2," The app does not connect to all accounts, namely President's Choice Financial Mastercard. This app is useless if you can't track your spending through your credit card. It used to be great, but if it doesn't connect to all your accounts it's useless"
4543,Nick Millward,"August 2, 2019",4," Sorry, but the latest UI update is a huge blocker for the app. Basic information is now scattered and blocked by non-useful information. I now rely on the web app exclusively. Update (August 2, 2019): Thank you for reverting back to the previous version -- changed rating."
4544,J Abcde,"June 28, 2019",5, Update: They rolled back to the older UI. Old review: Please roll back the UI to how it was two UI changes ago. This new one is filled with ads and scrolling by horizontal cards makes it hard to know where to stop when trying to find something quickly.
4545,Dusty Snider,"April 23, 2019",2, New android app is horrible. I get it you want me to link accounts. why does that take up 3/4 of my whole screen after i have linked everything? Also the bar chart for the cash flow is not in the new version. That was the primary reason I use the app.
4546,Rory Smyth,"April 27, 2019",2," i used this app for the first time last week. was impressed. opened it this weekend to have a review. some really bad product decisions made. as someone whos only used both once, this version gives me an aneurysm. youve obscured any usefulness with a dribbble inspired UI."

4549,Melissa Jackson,"July 5, 2019",5," Edit: With the recent rollback of the changes, this app back to its best self. Very nice and convenient having all the info I need about my finances in one place. If you dont mind some ads this is a great app for managing your money."
4550,Joe Katakowski,"July 5, 2019",5, Experiment with the swipey app version with loads of ads appears to be over. Back to the original more useful version. Thank you for listening to the commenters. I would still love to see all the trends from the web version available in the app.
4551,Nathan Thornton,"June 27, 2019",5, They reverted their awful UI changes and the app is awesome again! I would love to see the ability to mark transactions as duplicates from within the app. Currently this can only be done from the website (which is not at all mobile friendly).
4552,Jason Payne,"March 30, 2019",1," Can't even make it past first step to link a bank account. I'm able to sign into my bank and pick the accounts I want, but when I'm returned to Mint, the app just shows 3 blank lines and a button to Link Account with no intructions for what I'm supposed to enter."
4553,Brent Snodgrass,"July 31, 2019",2," Now that they went back to the old UI that works, it now doesn't update accounts. It says it is downloading the lastest transactions but when you click into accounts it has been hours since it was last updated. Something is broken again."
4554,A Google user,"September 18, 2018",1," I wasn't a fan of this app at all. It was very behind when notifying me when money was deposited into my account and it would warn me about bills being ""due soon"" when it was a monthly bill that was three weeks out. Not useful, more frustrating than anything."
4555,S C,"May 15, 2019",2," The home page of this app sucks. The ""overview"" shows very little relevant information - only credit score. The rest of the options like budget and spending are buried in a sub-menu. Forget about locating or altering your budget. Mint sucks."

4557,Garrett Aronin,"May 25, 2019",1, the new UI is horrible. It's impossible to see the relevant information and every tab has one or more ads for some financial service. it seems like the change was made just to maximize ad views and not help the user see their financial information.
4558,Matthew Brown,"April 29, 2019",1, The most recent update in April changed the entire uaer interface and it is terrible. All the informstion you used to be able to see at a quick glance on one page is now spread across multiple pages. I really dont like it.

4561,Dan Starr,"May 31, 2019",4," Leaving a positive review because the UI was reverted back to the ""old"" one. The new UI had me looking strongly for alternative apps. Web interface is great.

4562,Nichole Burkett,"June 23, 2019",3," Mint is extremely helpful in keeping me on track with my budget. The only drawback is the lack of real time figures. Transactions, bills and deposits don't show up in real time. So you have to be aware of your finances or you may overlook something."
4563,April H,"June 25, 2019",2, Frustrated - spent a lot of time adding accounts and linking the ones that could be so that EVERY time I open the app it gives me errors and says login is wrong etc... Yet when I go to the websites for the accounts and use the same login info it works just fine. This needs to be addressed.
4564,Mia,"June 27, 2019",5, seamless experience. indispensable app. you will use it daily to monitor your funds from bank account to credit cards and more. probably the best one out there and their website version is even more extensive and detailed.
4565,Jay Brown,"June 26, 2019",5, This app has made me more aware of my spending and helped me understand where I was wasting money. I've recommended to everyone who asked me how I got my money and spending under control and gotten out of debt. Can't ignore it when it's in your face. Highly recommend!
4566,Simone Chambers,"June 28, 2019",4," Mint has been great keeping track of my all my accounts. Immediate purchases are shown. I love the fact that I can see which bills have been paid so am never late. I only wish some of these bank would work with mint, so all my accounts are in one place."

4578,Mary Penrod,"August 17, 2019",4," Good for budgeting and keeping track of where your money goes without much effort from you. I couldn't connect my Amazon Prime account bill, but otherwise I was able to add all my bills. It takes a few days for transactions to appear."

4582,Beth Meier,"September 15, 2019",5," This app is super helpful for when you want to have a general idea of where you money is going but don't want to spend tons of time tracking it.

4586,Alan Jacobs,"October 2, 2019",4," Over all a good app, to allow you to see everything that is going on financially. It can get really slowed down though when it tries to update your accounts. Sometimes my account has just perpetually loaded trying to get my information."
4587,Kevin,"October 10, 2019",2, Its constantly logging me out. It wouldn't be a big deal since I have fingerprint sign on but everytime it will require a password to log back in. Not to mention it always loses connection with my financial institutions. Used to be okay. Currently looking for a new app.
4588,Mark Badger,"October 31, 2019",2, Im struggling with the usefulness of the Mint. Its always about a day behind with its data. It never displays updated information after refreshing.

4595,Aki Nakanishi,"April 30, 2019",1," Bring back the old UI! Let us opt back in! I've been using Mint for years and love the app, makes centralizing and tracking finances so simple - but the new UI fragments the experience across multiple screens and is a HUGE pain to navigate. So disappointed."
4596,Joseph Kwong,"April 27, 2019",1, Have been using Mint for years and have enjoyed it and found it helpfull. That saud the new design is horrible. It now takes several steps to do what used to take 1 or 2 tops and information is no longer consolidated but requires swipes and taps to view.
4597,Kyle Dillon,"May 12, 2019",2, Website is so much better. Mobile app is complicated to navigate. I have no idea how to look at previous months budgets (should be as easy as clicking the current month for drop down menu) and even finding the budget tab was difficult.
4598,Michael W,"May 1, 2019",4," The app is definitely worth the download. by far my favorite app on my phone. The only problem I have is that some of my accounts won't link because of a ""connection error"" but I've connect to several different wifi networks but nothing works. Other than that I HIGHLY recommend the app."
4599,Frank Geilen,"April 28, 2019",1, New UI is a significant step back. Too many clicks required to get to the information I need. On top of it this release crashes a lot. A rare (but big) fail from an otherwise great app that I use daily.
4600,Matthew West,"February 15, 2019",2," It worked well at the beginning. However, now my phones UI is failing everytime I open the app. I removed the app and phone worked well. Reinstalled the app and phone went back to failing. Unknown what the cause of this is. Owner's may want to look into this problem."
4601,Laura Rogers,"December 27, 2018",2," It was pretty good until they changed the upcoming bills feature. Now I can't see my bills that will be due in the next 30 days, which is why I used this app to help me budget. Now it says that I have no upcoming bills for this month, even though rent is due in 3 days. Not helpful."
4602,Nikki E,"May 6, 2019",1," I downloaded this app thinking it would be helpful....had it for 10 mins and now I'm gonna uninstall. It is not at all easy to use. I can't find my banks or make it work with the app. I dont even write reviews, but I will for this because it's one of the least helpful apps I have tried."
4603,Liam Riley,"April 30, 2019",2," New app is... not great. No way to hide useless pages. Can't reorganize the layout. Way too much swiping to find information. The old layout might have been showing its age, but at least it was functional."
4604,denicknel braithwaite,"May 16, 2019",1," Very disappointed by the new update, The old version worked great and the layout was way better. This new one: too much swiping between screens and it makes it harder to find what I'm looking for. Definitely not a fan."

First my Credit Score won't update Tried everything gave about 2 weeks to let it update over several failed attempts. Then i reistalled the app and now it won't even log me in. I reported my problem through feedback, but no reply still. I would never recommend this app after such a big fail."
4606,krishna teja,"January 28, 2019",5," this app and service is no match to others. Very very helpful in tracking and budgeting. only downside is regarding the recent discontinuation of bill pay. With that in place, you don't need to visit any of your bank accounts or any bill pay services. Missing that very badly."
4607,A Google user,"November 16, 2018",1," Trying to add some things like T-Mobile and Verizon FiOS. Can't, because I keep getting ""Hmm something's up with the connection"". By the looks of reviews, it hasn't been fixed in weeks. Don't bother trying to use this."
4608,Sergey Pikulik,"May 20, 2019",1," so now my car loan is counted as actual cash? since when? All of a sudden Mint is now showong that i have an extra 20k to spend when in reality i dont! this app went from good, to better, to bad, and now to worse. More synching issues first with Verizon, then with Nissan, now wit PennyMac. I'm done."
4609,dale xredman,"November 2, 2018",1," Broken for me Moto z2force At the ""get started"" page After i try to add any account, I end up at a screen where I can't proceed that reads ""link your account to mint"" and has 3 lines but doesn't say what information to put and ""link account"" and ""forgot login"" buttons that are both grayed out."

The way you have it disables all passphrase management for the app, and I can only assume this must be on purpose. It's not more secure just because I have to type it, it's less because it's literally hell typing that many random characters, incentivizing less secure passwords."
4611,d Lilly,"April 22, 2019",1, You will spend excessive time trying to link your accounts and then deal with connectivity issues between Mint and your accounts. Save yourself time and aggravation and access your accounts directly...NOT through this app that CLAIMS to compile them for a more complete financial picture!

4613,Frank Ramirez,"June 25, 2019",5," New layout is awful! app is complete garbage now. UI is laughable. PLEASE UPDATE THIS GARBAGE! APP IS USELESS, HOW HAS THIS UPDATE LASTED SO LONG?! Please roll this back, or come out with version you have to pay for so it is usable again. Edit: They rolled back the interface! back to five stars!"
4614,Waylon Reynolds,"March 8, 2019",2," Frustrated. When I add my credit union I have to verify security questions. But when I select my answer, nothing happens. No next button, no anything. Just stays there with the check mark next to my answer. Also it won't scroll. Only way I got it to scroll was by using my pen on my Note."
4615,Clifford Timmons,"October 8, 2018",5," Mint is the only reason I found out my credit card information was stolen. It dissects each purchase and provides accurate descriptions. I have since report my card stolen and have gotten my money back, and I plan to keep Mint for the foreseeable future."
4616,King Bofadeez,"February 9, 2019",1," i deleted this app awhile ago because of issues with linking my verizon account. I download it again a year later.....same issue. why does it keeo asking me for the same security question, especially when i answer it correctly. every. single. time..I think im just going to stick with Prism."
4617,Tim Roberts,"June 8, 2019",1, App worked great for the first month or two. Now Im missing transactions that show up on my bank accounts. What good is linking accounts if i have to put in or double check every transaction. I could do that with a spreadsheet and its yhe only reason i chose this app
4618,Hunter B,"June 1, 2019",2, User interface is not the best. It is always reporting an error with my Robinhood and retirement accounts. You can't view a past month's budget once the month is over. There is no way to set your budget page as the home page.
4619,Brad Asbury,"June 11, 2019",2," Somehow the app continues to struggle... fails to update accounts, always lists duplicate transactions, the updates to the app itself somehow go away and revert back to the previous version, constant re logging into your bank accounts. Doesnt really make life more convenient if you ask me."
4620,Elias Bardis,"June 20, 2019",4," Best app for tracking all my accounts, credit cards, and investments. great interface and easy to use. it does take a few days to receive transactions like when I've paid a bill but other than that no complaints."
4621,gavin hurst,"June 23, 2019",4, Great application to capture an accurate picture off all of our accounts and tools to budget accordingly. The visuals and snap shots assist in understanding where we are and should be with our finances. Glad we gave it a try after it being recommended so highly
4622,Christian Wallace,"June 24, 2019",5," I use this app more thany any other. Having my complete financial picture in one place has been a gamechanger. Mint has enabled me to set budgets and meet goals for saving. It's become such an integral part of my planning and daily routine, it's hard to imagine working without it."
4623,Caleb Bruhn,"June 25, 2019",4," Almost perfect budget app. Keeping track of spending has never been easier, especially online. My only critique if that the Android app should have just a little bit more of the website functionality in working with budget and trend categories."
4624,Vinny S.,"June 26, 2019",3, The app is great for keeping an eye on your finances under one umbrella. But there are areas within the app itself that make it a bit painful to use. E.g. vustom fonts and font sizes don't display correctly everywhere.
4625,Constantine B,"June 28, 2019",5," Gives you a good overview of your transactions, bills and balances. You can also check your credit score for free. This app used to be even more awesome when it had the bill pay feature, but unfortunately that got removed."
4626,Shelly Dunn,"October 10, 2019",5," After some issues the first couple of months (not sure if user or app error, honestly) I have done to depend on this app. It has helped me become better with my spending choices, earmarking money for savings, and staying within budget. Great app!!"
4627,Michael Brown,"August 26, 2019",1, It was great until i read the fake news in their blog that is sent through their app. Pay gap in the same careers are a myth. The gap is only real when you compare the incomes of people in completely different fields or positions. I never uninstalled an app faster.
4628,Rachel Goodlow,"July 1, 2019",4, Been using this app for about two years. Works nicely for the most part. Minus one star because occsionally it will mislabel a transaction or two. It also has a bit of a login issue (AES occasionally with security question) which locks me out of my AES account.
4629,Danielle Hibbs,"July 5, 2019",1," Wouldn't update my bills for this month, said they were all paid. They were not btw. Wouldn't update my bank account balance, transactions or deposits. I restarted my phone, which is brand new, and that didn't help. Uninstalling!"
4630,Hannah Eskelson,"July 6, 2019",4, Great app! Love that it can connect to small local banks instead of just the big ones. 4 stats because I wish they still had a bar graph option for expenses like they used to. I also wish they had icon options for food categories like other apps.
4631,Aquila Kashino,"July 8, 2019",5," Amazing tool for keeping a constant and close eye on your finances and budgets. This app helped me recover from some financial hardships as a result of the recession. Couldn't live without it for daily, weekly and monthly budgeting."
4632,Gary Mangelson,"July 28, 2019",5, I Love this app it helps me manage all my finances. I would recommend this app to anyone that is trying to just begin learning how to manage their finances to someone that has a large number if investments and trying to understand their financial position quickly.
4633,Katherine Clark,"July 13, 2019",5," My favorite budgeting app. I actually love the notifications I get because I'm reminded of our goals and it enables us to live more within our means! It's super user friendly, and a great help to tracking spending."
4634,Kelli Janzen,"July 17, 2019",1," My main bank and savings accounts won't connect anymore. ""Your bank needs you (108)"" error. No phone number to call customer support and the chat button on the support page is always hidden, meaning the chat is constantly busy. Switching to Personal Capital! ✌"
4635,Jeffrey Purganan,"July 11, 2019",4," Mint helps to keep track of a variety of accounts in one place. There are a few glitches with connecting between the app and some features missing or difficult to use, but overall, the program is straightforward and user friendly."
4636,avery baker,"July 17, 2019",1," Completely pathetic, the app failed to even function. Right out of the gate I'm unable to login with the code they sent me. I wouldn't recommend this app, if you look at the reviews it seems like it's been completely broken for a while now but was useful before that."
4637,Paul Marchand,"July 25, 2019",4, I love the fact that it aggregates any account you have. The only criticism I have is that you can't add a spouse or significant other. You can add their accounts but cannot see or get warnings regarding credit scores or other issues pertaining to them.
4638,Shelby Powell,"July 31, 2019",5, I love the organization of Mint. it makes budgeting actually enjoyable and to see where your money is going visually with charts and such. And ITS FREE! Hook up your accounts from everything you use and let it do the hard work for you. keep track of bills in one place.
4639,Mainak Mitra,"August 3, 2019",5, Awesome app already. However I wish if you can add a graph showing. Current Balance projected balance based on Income streams and bills with weekly spread. It will definitely help with money and expense management. I do it using my own script now.. but would love to see this as product feature.
