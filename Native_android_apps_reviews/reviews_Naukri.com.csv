I have a small suggestion it would be helpful if there is a continuous follow up from recruiter like notifying the recruiter about applicants and also a courtesy reply would be great ex: job is filled, require more skills, interview ongoing etc. The application status remains same for months together which doesn't look good for naukri. If updated this would stand apart from other market players"
2,bidyut Ranjan,"April 24, 2020",3, I am using the app since long and day by day it's quality of service is improving.

Jobs redirected to company websites do not open at all. Jobs that we touched do not open and instead some other job is opened. Sometime app acts very weird, not sure if is programmed that way or what. This app give only feel good factor to its users but no real benefits - no interview calls or invite from recruiters."

Simply it means the recruiters don't want to see the unhighlited application or profile. So it's not so beneficial for the freshers. I have applied to many of the job but there is no response. Also I have make my profile on naukri almost 2 months ago but no single profile view and no single C.V download. There are many of the drawbacks but I don't have time to write all.
