It will be great if the emojis which are typed along with the text are a little bigger like in WhatsApp so that we don't need to strain ourselves to identify whether it is crying emoji or laughing emoji. The second think is that it is great to have such wonderful pictures as wallpapers but it would be very nice if we could able to see the preview of the picture as wallpaper before applying it.

It's acceptable as it does a lot stuffs when typing. I am a developer I can understand. Anyway good work. I am however pretty scared about how they collect data. The suggestions seems to personalized, when something is personalized it means they have collected data. Anyway we can't expect anything to be free. Make sure you guys clear the chat often. They save the pics and photos in cloud."

38,Kritikayrhre Kritika,"April 20, 2020",5, Hike Widget should be available like WhatsApp so that we can figure out the unread chats from the desktop itself rather to open the app and check for the newly received messages everytime.

The sticker options are really good. The option displaying the do only to your friends is really great. To display the hidden chat you have to touch the hike symbol at top left it could be good if it's placed bottom center. Another small drawback is that sticker suggestion option takes too much of screen space while chatting and if your display is small you won't be able to view pre msg.

Whereas it works perfectly fine for other chat apps. Shame!! Even after knowing this issue (also reported by several other users) hike doesn't care. Hike messager is totally unreliable. Maybe they are running out of money and they have done cost cut downs which resulted in such chat issues. Maybe it's intentional.

Get rid of every extra feature and only focus on chat features. And I have a special request to make. Please use google emojis in place of old emojis.

Make home page name list smaller or rather compact. It is big and looks heavy in the eye.

There is so much that Hike offers to its users and the best part is, Hike listens to its users. I have a couple of suggestions: 1.

Like when Offline notification comes, the area where ""Send free SmS"" is shown and the chat bar below it seems wierd due to seperation. Also when we reach the bottom of any chat and swipe up, the faint white curve that comes and the chat bar appear wierd due to seperation in the two.. and there is some problem with the dark mode, which personally I have never liked as it makes text dull. When we rotate the screen, brightness changes."

To change the hidden mode password if the user has forgotten it then the whole data inside that mode needs to be deleted is a negative point from the end user point of view.

If you uninstall and install it later on you can't restore the backup from your local storage even if you have the latest backup. If restore your backup from cloud after completing restore process it still show restoring backup and you will not be able to cancel it and backup settings also will not work when it is restoring. It starts restoring that evwrytime you open hike and it starts from begining.

3018,Kshitiz Jain,"September 27, 2019",1, First of all remove that feature where we get reminded again and again to say hey to the contracts on hike. If I want to say hey to someone I will say it them after searching them. There's no need to constantly remind us again. Also WhatsApp works fine sometimes but hike sucks.

3020,Manabjyoti Nath,"October 13, 2019",1, Stickers loading time is pathetic. Seems like it tries to download the stickers everytime I wanted to use and it can take up to 2 minutes to load that particular sticker I wanted to use. The new hike is really very poor compared to the old hike. (Using hike since 2014)

3038,Harinee Naidu,"April 11, 2019",4, stickers are really good. features - excellent. just a suggestion: it will be great if there are stickers that express the natural being of two best friends be it a girl-girl best friends or boy-boy best friends.. like how 2 best friends behave with eachother in their daily life.
3039,Neeru Raj Duhan,"March 29, 2019",4, App running smoothly....all things are good...but m facing a issue... a chat of hike team doesn't delete or not open...every time i want to delete..it regenerate automatically and notification show one message....please solve this issue...

3045,Raunak Roy Chowdhury,"April 15, 2019",1, It's just another chat application without any uniqueness. Something like Explore and checklist kept me going for hike. No more. Life's truly more simple now as WhatsApp is handling all the features of hike quite well.

3208,A Walking Wanderer,"November 16, 2019",5, I still find it better than WhatsApp. I don't know why people still don't use this. Hike has many things to offer and the best part this is Indian. I think we Indians still believe that line saying That ki murgi daal barabar

3242,Kumaravel Palanisamy,"April 15, 2019",5, Its a best application from the available alternatives. But main drawback is providing lot of features in every new releases which causes lot of user cannot understand or adopt to new features. You must gradually provide features.
