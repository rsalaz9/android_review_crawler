They made it so you have to play with energy now and they don't match you evenly in pvp. They have so many glitches that I ended up losing out on so many crystals and clan gold it's crazy. I have spent over $100 on this game but with all these new updates and problems I'm contemplating just uninstalling the game!

I've ever spent money in this game. Doesn't force you to watch ads - but the option is there if you want for extras. However with the latest updates I have lost ALL of my power ups, the energy thing limiting how much you can play is terrible, it's buggy now, and there's been no fixes for it. It's only been downhill."

The developers took the simple fun of an arcade shooter and made it so tedious that it's put me off playing. Time to look for a new fun game. Deleting."

When you play pvp after couple of games its telling you to play for free. What is the point of playing for free in a pvp game ? . It is impossible to pass any level . The game it's just not a pleasure to play anymore. The chances of winning now are null. So disappointing. I am stuck passing one level for weeks now.
5,Hexum944,"April 15, 2020",1, Waste of time and $$$. I actually would spend more time and money in this game if it wasn't so difficult and expensive.

They made this game impossibly hard to force you to buy endless upgrades. The ship upgrade process is incredibly confusing and expensive. Its really unfortunate because the game is fun until you quickly reach the point of impossibility without a minimum of $200 to $300 in upgrades (not exaggerating).

This game beginning to suck big time.

Now I can't even play as it says it needs upgrading but nowhere to upgrade. None of my upgrades work and the features I have paid for are no longer there. Adding new features which seems to break existing isn't a good business model. All the bugs need to be fixed instead of making the game harder and more frustrating. This was once good timeout bit of fun not so much now."

Everything (pvp and single player) now cost energy to play. it doesn't take long to run out. With a handicap of random Game play issues. Its no longer a time killer but a reason for killing time. just so you can beat that level or boss you're stuck on. The game is very challenging and fun to play.

The game designers seem to reply to poor reviews by saying they will evaluate at the difficulty curve in future updates. My view is this game isn't fun anymore. It is too hard to proceed.

The only thing that really lets it down is the game never seems to works properly. Too many issues with the game at the moment. It seems the higher you get the more issues there are. You think a problem is fixed with another update, then you get another one and it does more damage. Updates seem to focus more on repeated offers for spending real money rather than fixing the errors in the game. You can make more by fixing the game and advertising."

My only concern is the trades made within the game such as buying new fighters using earned coins. You never really ""buy"" any. You only can select them at a reduced price before gameplay. They could use the word ""activate"" or ""unlock"" instead of ""buy"" which is misleading by content to me. However, I still play this game for a few mins everyday and enjoy it."

This is a new tactic from these devs...and it's a HORRIBLE one!!! I hope return to norm. Then I will return my 5 star rating.

Basically I am not getting rewarded for my quest because it seems they don't want me getting clan gold which is required to purchase boosters. They want you to spend money instead. I really feel like deleting this app but I have invested so much. They let the hackers get all the rewards and punish those of us that play honestly. They are taking fun out of game.

88,Abu-Bakr Mudawi,"April 13, 2020",4," Fun game, and lots of hours have been spent here. I understand that game developers need to make money, but you can end up spending a lot here.

146,Richard Hermann,"April 29, 2020",1, Terrible game.. fun to play but if your not willing to spend $$$ real money you won't go very far and it has a ridiculous amount of adds and you very rarely evenly matched in pvp modes. Waste of time find a diff game.
147,Anil Lalwani,"April 16, 2020",1," To many ads , and when u finish the stage with high power then again u have to start with zero in next stage, that's ridiculous.. As games progress, the hard it become's to jump to next stage ..with no coins.. no extra powers ..no booster's etc"
148,Theresa Hall,"April 17, 2020",1, Loved playing the game but then they went to energy for all aspects of the game. One reason I loved it was that they didn't have that. It is not worth waiting for energy when you get stuck on a level and die repeatedly.
149,Robert Lee,"April 11, 2020",1, keep saying I'm disconnected also you charged my card but never gave me my Crystal's.....this is getting out of hand with your hackers either fix it or give me all my money back!!!!! Why are you taking our pvp points away if we lose. Your game sucks now. You need to fix it.
150,Private Individual,"April 13, 2020",2," Losing interest in this game dramatically. Too many cheaters and hackers on game. Plus, the 'Pay to Play' B.S. And now you have to have these 'lightning bolts points' to be able to play. It's just getting ridiculous."
151,Martin Papke,"April 19, 2020",1, Changed from 5 stars due to your money hungry tactics. Now you have changed the chest time back to 30 minutes from 15 minutes. You SUCK!!! Do Not Load This Game!!!!!! They have now removed all of my VIP benefits. Do not load game!!!!

157,Tina Deuel Associates,"April 15, 2020",2, Like the game but do not like they place a hold on certain items where you cannot reach in a game challenging especially after paying to get double the win. Do not like the limit with the Lighting. This is starting to be a money pit.

160,John Ferro,"April 27, 2020",1, Used to love this game but now it is no fun to many adds and updates. Also game gets stuck all the time you should put it back to the aridganell game by for now and why do we have to spend lightting bolts everytime we play something
161,Phumzile Khumalo,"April 12, 2020",1, The bonus points meant to be loaded after a video are not loaded fully. This really upsets me cause that is my data exchange for points. All in all it is a fun game though.

163,Michael Shuster,"April 28, 2020",1," The game is unfair to play. In the arena, you are matched up with people with far more power. The pay to win aspect of this game makes it not much fun once you get deeper in the game."

165,Mauro Pais,"April 12, 2020",1, Disgusting... It was used to be a good game... now if you want to play you need to pay a lot of money in order to proceed... And you still get tons of adverts... Do not bother...
166,Jaimie Bernstein,"April 9, 2020",3," Edited down to 3 stars. The pvp is no longer enjoyable because the matches are imbalanced. If you don't spend a lot of money on upgrades, you don't stand a chance."

168,david cain,"April 13, 2020",3, Seems as the updates to the game force you into paying to advance after you reach a certain level. Very buggy and during PVP you never seem to be fairly matched after the latest update. The paid players seem to have more of an advantage now.
169,Jason Brooks,"April 18, 2020",1, After the last update I lost everything. Cant play campaign mode anymore. It wont go past the 1st wave. I've played this game for a long time. If not fixed I will uninstall
170,Richard Johnston,"April 14, 2020",1, Developers obviously don't listen to the players. Game is riddled with bugs which means you lose PVP points or CP power. They keep adding stupid things which sucks the fun out of what was a great game.

Also, the game cheats at most things, like the Survival mode or the Spin. PVP matches do not work but reduces pvp points. Its incredibly difficult to go to higher levels without spending money and everything is unfairly expensive. Better play Clash Royale or Candy Crush."

546,Jonathan Donaldson,"March 28, 2020",1," It' a fun game to play other than a few things. The PVP match ups are usually ridiculously one sided. Also, watching up to 45 seconds of adds every 3 minutes is a bit much. And don't bother wasting your money on stupidly overpriced powerups."
547,FIRE KING,"April 14, 2020",5, Good game needs more power ups and ways to get free upgrades otherwise than that good game
548,Madalina Vojniac,"March 28, 2020",3," Used to be my favourite so I would have rated it 5 stars If it wasn't for the ""update"" that gives you limited energy.

560,Alfred Baldwin,"April 3, 2020",3," Dont like how the system is set up to were you can advance, it really stacks the odds against you in verses mode. Only way to get anywhere is you have to spend money, that's how people get the great ships, so said."

566,Matthew Roughan,"March 23, 2020",5," A fun and addictive game. It doesn't rely on in game purchases to be fun. You can buy boosters and ships to use on missions that are challenging with coins you earn for completing missions, without spending real money if you dont want to. Fun and varied."

572,Michael Kyser,"March 26, 2020",1," You make it almost impossible to get pass certain levels. When you playing against the bosses you have their weapons that can track you making it impossible to escape, so on that note I'll be deleting this game as of today."

644,Jeremy Lauderdale,"March 22, 2020",1," New pvp where I'm stuck waiting to play for hours a day because of ""suspicious activity"". Pretty dumb. Tool the fun out of pvp. Very hard to get your daily pvp points. The game was working just fine, then you guys go and screw it up. I won't be playing nearly as much."
645,David Caughman,"February 11, 2020",1," Full of glitches. They do not answer emails or messages concerning issues. If you complain, on their Facebook page to get things fixed, they ban and block you. If you want frustration... this is the game for you."
646,Ronald Laremore,"April 23, 2020",5, Pretty fun game not quite sure how it works but it's kinda fun 5stars +e for effort
647,Alan Kozusko,"April 3, 2020",5," Great graphics and hard enough to keep it interesting. Way too many ads, though, and not much instruction to find out full benefits of the game."
648,Dean Seagrave,"April 22, 2020",1," New update is rubbish, no gameplay available on any level, no response from messages either"
649,A Google user,"March 27, 2020",1, Is there a rating less than one star? Update took away the slow down for bomb/shield. Making it impossible to beat higher levels. You might as well get rid of them. I've wasted $300. Total scam!

652,Emily Mcswain,"February 17, 2020",5," I love this game I started playing it years ago, and every phone I get I make sure this is the 1st game I download. It makes time fly by. You wont be disappointed downloading this game. No interruptions. Best game ever"
653,Tina Beasley,"February 20, 2020",4, When you try to use your crystals on Boss it kills you before you even get to play and half the time your Shields don't work. I was going to buy a package but I won't waste my money
654,Itz Me,"March 27, 2020",1, Game was good untill they decided to find ways to charge you more so you would play. Dont bother people! Let's make this game developer broke by not playing or purchasing his products 👏Been playing a long time now I'm deleting..
655,Garth,"April 1, 2020",5, It is very addictive to play this game on my Nokia 5 . It would've been much better if you can play unlimited instead of waiting to by full of energy.
656,Anthony J. W,"April 1, 2020",5, Wow ain't had this game for but a few minutes and it reminds me of the old days of the arcades in the 80s. Absolutely cool game . Definitely a keeper on my device

661,rosa hightower,"April 20, 2020",5, Real good game easy the boss is so easy not a lot of ad
662,Yasser Doaibes,"March 27, 2020",1, It's very bad updates and using people. I have lost many times even the match didnt start. They put you to play with very higher than your level. What is this Energy? Are you for real??
663,Mike Karge,"February 7, 2020",2," Every time I make money on this game. It takes it. And when I spin the wheel. It stops on the same. Thing every time It's either $1,300. Or a spaceship"

I have paid a lot of money to become a Vip12 and they falsely accused me stealing my vip status and stripped my pvp points and access to clan. I tried to communicate to there email and messanger I have provided all my receipts of my purchases to prove I paid for my vip. It has been over 5 days with no response or my game being fixed. I feel like they should handle there accusations differently. I am considering uninstall game but I have to much money invested.
666,Wolfs Rain,"March 31, 2020",1," This used to be a good game and now its not, please go back to the way it was and dont be greedy, its not fair on the ones who never pay money for new stiff and try to earn it themselves. Will be uninstalling if this continues, please don't get this."
667,Edward Lewis,"April 13, 2020",1, Dont ever download this game unless u spend alot of money u cant win dont let anyone tell u different its a rip off since i updated i have to spend alot of money to get the upgrades
668,Daniel Roman,"April 3, 2020",1," Just another greedy box looting buggy game. It has potential, but the scheme to make you pay a lot of money has become disgraceful with the latest updates."
669,Wins Alwin03,"February 15, 2020",1," Dear creator of this apps, it keeps me lose in 2seconds just started the battle, i am losing my PvP points for no reason.. HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENED? It suppose to be a stress reliever but it doesn't... fix it!!!!!! 😬😬😬"
670,Shawn Gillis,"March 21, 2020",1," Had initially given this at five star. For the second time I've lost a large amount of crystals because I hit the wrong button. It's my fault not theirs, however, it's their loss cuz I'm done with the game."
671,ohn axton,"February 12, 2020",1, It's fun in the beginning but you quickly get to the point where you can't advance without buying upgrade packs for at least $10-$15. No thanks. Removing from my phone.
672,John Clark,"February 20, 2020",4," Game is excellent but full of bugs, lost 100s of 1000s in gold & 100s of crystals due to game saying ""defeated"" before it even starts. I would not spend 1p upgrading ship because of this, just play free game & enjoy for what it is."
673,Joey Higgins,"March 3, 2020",5," Game is good, but there Is slight gameplay improvements that can be made, i would recommend making the upgrading ship part a little more of a variety of upgrades, instead of 2. Other then that it's a great game"
674,Mubbashir Abbas Jouheri,"March 21, 2020",4," There is an interruption in my game. There appears a notification "" you were disconnected"" in the middle of the game. Now its has become unbearable and i can't play a single game from start to end."

I will no longer play the PVP 1 vs 1 - 3 until you program the game to pit players against other players who have the same ship and power levels. THAT is fair. Until you change this aspect of your game, I will give this a one star. NOT FAIR."
677,Heather Morris,"March 27, 2020",1," Used to be good but now they all they do is change it and now it sucks. Used to be able to play levels as many times as you want, now you have to have energy. Complete trash now."
678,Jason Crook,"April 13, 2020",1, Unistalling. Pvp is ridiculously one sided. If you to pay you don't win.
679,Sassy A,"February 27, 2020",5," The game freezes often and at the worst time. Other games do not freeze for me. I still love the game, just wish it flowed better."
680,Wahinya Douglas,"March 2, 2020",1, 1. Can't quit some ads. 2. Game keeps kicking me out on pvp on 2nd to 3rd wave. 3. The spin is automated to give one specific gift... No randomness. 4. Support won't respond to concerns.
681,Gigantic Walrus,"March 27, 2020",1," Put time and money into this game to be hit with energy lockout. Need to watch a ton of adds already. Instead of fixing game and banning cheaters, they add an energy lockout so you can buy more, watch more ads or wait to play. Developer greed is killing this game."
682,Nicoshia Lobo,"February 19, 2020",1," Please fix the game.. As I start a PVP, i am being defeated. So many of my points have been deducted. There is something seriously wrong with this game after the recent update."

685,Bob Bowers,"March 1, 2020",5, Very addictive game reminiscent of Galaga. There is some pressure to buy upgrades and you may eventually hit a level you cannot get past without an upgrade.
686,Fanis Georgiou,"March 21, 2020",1, You have made this game so hard to make people spent money. You remove world boss and you add some other s**t that gives you nothing . Many people are talking about uninstalling the game but you don't care.
687,Andrew Fuentes,"March 22, 2020",5," Its FREAKING AWSOME !! i love this game,once you start you'll want to keep going & beat the next level PLUS+ there are more ships to try & use you will like this game trust me...if space is your thing then get this game!!!!!"

696,John Song,"February 9, 2020",1," Bad game design, one shot kills your plane but it takes multiple shots to kill a small alien plan. Another money grabbing greedy company. Stay away from this game. It simply wastes your time."
697,Dark Hands,"March 8, 2020",1, It clearly states that you earn 1vip point for every 0.99 spent so I spent $29 thinking i will get almost 29 VIP points. No did not I received enough to get me from VIP level 5 to level 6 which was 3 VIP points. I want my money refunded
698,Francis Baratta,"April 15, 2020",5, Fun but has its flaws. Lost all my progress once and now I lost my clan. But I like the game.

700,James Melton,"March 28, 2020",1," I enjoy this game but hate the 45 second ads every 2 to 3 minutes,kinda like having to stop at every red light you come to on your way to work."
701,Skyler Vande Velde,"March 31, 2020",1," Spent a lot of money to be matched with players who obviously spent more. Had a transaction that didnt produce what I purchased.

703,Clendon Pete,"April 22, 2020",5, Controls suck. But still an average arcade shooter.
704,Crosby,"February 17, 2020",5, Lots of ads. No instructions and about 200 different items to power up your ship but no idea how to get them out what they mean.. Fun game but extremely frustrating
705,Wolf Riley,"February 23, 2020",5, Very close to an old arcade game. It has a few differences and all seem to work for the player. Missile Command next please.
706,Johan Lindqvist,"March 31, 2020",1," Great game, but features keeps being changed and ""cancelled"" with the developers making snyde comments on it on Facebook. Now there's been significant reduction to the player experonece."

714,A Google user,"March 5, 2020",2, This games deliberately withholds the power ups and makes you lose your coins and crystals in order to make you spend actual money to get more. If I were you I wouldn't give them your money or credit card information.

719,Hey I'm Leona Jeanne,"March 17, 2020",4, I love this game so much and it's very interesting and I think they could add about 3 lives per level but other than that this game is fun and amazing. Thank you so much for this game.
720,Aaron Vandenberg,"February 17, 2020",4," Ads are a thing, but they're skipable. Progress can be made through playing, but in reality, progress is heavily tied to how much money you spend in game."

736,Eric Kewley,"March 27, 2020",1," I loved this game until a few days ago. Energy consumption metric added, and is just another way to force users to watch adds. GET RID OF ENERGY METRIC PLEASE. IT IS SPOILING THE GAME."
737,Jay Larsen,"March 30, 2020",2, Not a bad game. Uses lots of power. Latest update SEVERLY limited the number of time you can play each day and that is only if you watch the adds

748,Jt Harland,"February 26, 2020",3, Good game for a couple of days. Problems are unbalanced matchups and you can't see the bads guys moving horizontally because of your shooting thumb/finger.
749,Wes Mastay,"March 8, 2020",1, Be nice to be able to turn off the volume since I won't use it at all and don't need loud sounds from the game. Especially when you have music playing. So far the game has been ok

And always some problem happen meanwhile played in all session in the game. Now energy ⚡ system put because they don't like who played without looking boring advertising meanwhile play.

I made a purchase in game and did not receive my item. ABI SUPPORT team could not care less about customer satisfaction or reviews. They kill the people who have a passion to play with updates, etc. Do not download the game because you will love it and get destroyed in game. You will lose everything you've earned w/o resolution; it's not worth it!"

764,Lito Lagman,"April 22, 2020",1," Unfair with other opponents, the bigger their guns the more boost they get."
765,Evan Crow,"February 9, 2020",2, It is unfair in many levels. And kicked me out of survival when I had 2 seconds left to complete the level. When I completed it
766,Will Cato,"March 9, 2020",5, It's very great game so you have to destroy the alien ships at all times and the boss battle as well without those guys shooting at you and remember to dodge the rockets
767,Joshua Franzen,"March 15, 2020",2, PVP is very unbalanced and game is glitchy even on high speed Wi-Fi. It's very fun but until the developers address how unfair gameplay is I wouldn't download it.
768,Whisk Loughran,"April 1, 2020",1, Horrible new energy system. Requires you to pay twice. This is an add watching app disguised as a game.

772,Jonathan F,"March 26, 2020",1, Update needing to have energy to play completely ruins the experience. You can get 10 energy for watching ad but each game takes 4. Not fun anymore.
773,Scott Conway,"March 16, 2020",1," Fix the soundddddddd Added my Facebook profile now game has no sound, game has way too many ads for people who pay like me. Fix my sound or fix your program then I give you a ad first then more stars"

777,zac cheatum,"February 11, 2020",5," Very cool game, and can be played without spending money. Down side is a lot of ads, but you get boosters for watching them."
778,Madd Leviathan,"April 1, 2020",5, Decent. It must never end. Need more cash to upgrade ships. Drone tickets hardly coming. Higher levels are more difficult but I love the challenge.
779,Joseph Vusi,"April 2, 2020",5," Addictive, gave it 5 stars because I play the gane game every day. So many levels to play some levels are challenging but I figure out at the end of the day,"
780,Kenneth Perez,"February 17, 2020",4, Good fun game. There are cheaters out there that some how have figured out how to jump out of a pvp game and it shows a defeat and you lose credits. That sucks.

790,Leslie Wagner,"March 1, 2020",2, no one ever responds to issues. Now you get penalized in pvp for winning too many matches. It makes you wait hours until you can play again
791,Kp Rounds,"April 10, 2020",4, Great game but has frustrating errors. Getting better with errors but too many changes that are not for the players benefit.
792,Hunter Nettles,"March 12, 2020",5, Reminds me of the 80s acarde game Galxay or Space Invaders. Been looking for something like those games. Very fun and old school look to it. Also has some challenging levels. Good jobs guys!

The enemy alien ships are more tougher and stronger than your ship. And the system mostly now matches you to compete against much higher skilled players.

But it is an undeniable fact that the vast majority of players who are not top professional gamers, have to spend money to succeed and go through stages, as it is insanely difficult, even if you spend many hours per day playing, like i did. Also, a big disappointment is the clan market: Unless you are in a top clan, you won't get enough to buy Cards or Skins, because the Clan Gold distribution is extremely low. It would take you months to raise the minimum of 2500 for a basic card (although you can buy some of these), Another thing i find tragic is their prices. £50 for a single Spaceship or 3 Cards? You must be crazy! I am not a marketing guru, but i know that you can make much more sales, selling a £10 item than a £50 item. It feels the people who designed this game are very tight and stingy with their money, it feels they are trying to squeeze every penny out of your pocket. Even their discounts are laughable. The Crystal rewards are so low, they don't really help is such small amounts. Last but not least, check the top 100 players list: at least 85% have VIP level of 12, which is the highest possible. That means that to reach the Spaceship Firepower, Defence and Card Possession to achieve such rankings, the have spent hundreds. Random coincidence? I don't think so!"

The game got stuck a couple of times at the end of a level causing a forfeiture of the reward requiring a replay. The ads are a little over-the-top though. In the early stages of the game the ads are mostly 20 to 30 seconds long. However, once you get past about level 15, the ad length increases to 45 seconds. Definitely pay to play. The quantity and quality of gameplay does not justify the length of ads."
