The way conversations and vocabulary are intertwined to teach is just great. The leader board is also a great idea. At the least, if you intend to take a proper course, going through this before will definitely give you and edge. Love it. Keep up the great job. Plus it FREE. P.s. I wish there was a way of retaking the tests from the get go insted of just practice options."

The only thing I'd change is having more things to spend your reward lingots on in the shop. I bought the whole shop by the time I hit the first checkpoint. Please add more outfits, skills, stories etc! Overall I can't complain, this is a wonderful app considering its free."

But then my retention is not good. I mean when you try to apply it in sentences, you wouldnt be able to. I got tired eventually. But now after a few months of not using, I played again, and it gets better. You know, when you already encountered the letters, your memory somehow will remember, now you'll focus on understanding the usage instead of familiarization. Because you're already done with that phase. Practice. Rest. Give it time. and then do it again."
3,Danielle C,"April 29, 2020",5," Such a great app! I've looked at a couple of other ones and this one is by far the best and my favourite.

I've looked at a couple of other ones and this one is by far the best and my favourite. I really like how it's playful and nicely mixed up so you don't get bored. Hasn't crashed on me yet. Voice recognition is good, content is good, it's also available for download on cellphones, Windows, Mac and also online and your progress copies over to all them with no delay. Love this app!"

Just one question, why can't I access the ""Tips"" menu for certain languages like Norwegian,Romanian on the app when it is surprisingly present when accessed through the web version? I don't understand the logic behind this and I find no reason to not include the for-mentioned in the app. It wouldn't require a big deal of effort I feel. It is going to be just a simple additon."

When you miss a card, the ""tip"" that often follows is extremely annoying and often irrelevant. When it's not irrelevant, it's insulting, because I just saw what I did wrong, and I don't need it pointed out again. I've seen multiple people complain about this in the duo forums. The feature needs to be removed or users need to be able to disable it. It is pushing me away from the app."

Like: more option should be provided in the mobile app. That includes a lot of things in it. Dictionary podcasts are also in the more option. Discuss one is also a option. I work in laptop and even in the mobile. This made me got to know about the features that are extra in the laptop. There are unlimited lives in the laptop and mobile which is not there in my other devices which I stopped using. I like this bug.

It's given me the ease of access that I needed, especially during this lockdown/quarantine. I would say the only set back are the ads, but you honestly hardly notice them unless you're trying to get your hearts back when you make a mistake. But with that in mind, it plays like a arcade game and it makes learning very fun and unique. Things actually sink in for once. Get it!"

Sometimes I do a lesson and the completion button doesn't show up and I'm forced to X out and do it all over again. Second, I despise the new update that includes lives. This is an app that's supposed to teach languages. In order to learn, people need to make mistakes. This is just a coorporate scheme to make us spend money. I AM DISGUSTED."

I wish it would rotate so I can use it in landscape format on my Samsung tablet and have the charging lead sticking out at the side instead of at the bottom. And a British English option would be welcome: yes, it accepts my British English translations from French or German, but where English text is presented for translation it is American in spelling and idiom. Also, ""Watch an ad"" - ""No thanks"" - Ad plays anyway."

Free, educational, and entertaining, what more could I possibly asked for? However, I think the mobile version needs to improve and add more features (like the PC version). Even though the league is not that beneficial, it still is a great way to fuel my desire to learn more and compare my progress to others. I hope there will be more languages soon, and more ways to spend lingots. Oh, and please add a way to disable the choices. Overall, great application!"

The grammer is not even proper in things. The subscription is absolutely not worth it with all the mistakes in each course."

If I had to criticize, I would say it's unfortunate that not all courses are given the same TLC. My Spanish course is crazy in-depth. Japanese even got expanded. But then my Korean course is still very basic. Also, some inconsistences in the recording quality with the native speaker voices. Some sound human while others sound like robots."

In 'tips' it just tells you enough to get through the first couple of levels of a lesson, and then it throws exceptions or slightly different cases without explanation, just to drain your hearts and make you pay. Cheap trick for an education app. Would be 4 stars otherwise, but it gets more and more annoying rhe further you progress, almost enough to make you drop out. Shouldn't education apps aim for the opposite effect?"
18,Jill Adams,"April 28, 2020",1, I have changed my mind after using the app for four months. It is like a gambling machine that is loaded against you.

It is like a gambling machine that is loaded against you. Every miniscule mistake is punished by losing a token. Without tokens you can't progress. If a long comprehensive answer is 99% correct it is marked as wrong and you lose your token and have to start again and again and again and again. Great for beginners or if you want a few phrases for holiday but not good for deep understanding.

Lots of short lessons, flexible, and great for a little downtime. You can compete against friends and family, so it could be a fun family activity. Lots of hidden tools. Cons: No explanation of the language in the lessons. They have blogs, though. I wish they had lessons for quiet places, like waiting rooms. Games would be nice, too. Shake it up a bit."

Duolingo has a variety of question types including native voiceover, write-in, multiple choice, rearranging words and understanding narratives. There are a lot of ads and the pricing plans are quite steep, but the ads are relatively benign or easy to skip. £12 for a month, £8 or 9 each for six months and £7 or 8 each for a year. (Even crunchyroll isn't that much, but this is definitely a more comprehensive service and the ads are faster too.)"

If learning languages such as Korean, Japanese or Chinese like myself, it also helps you to read the characters and pronounce them correctly. My only complaint is that you have hearts, and every time you get something wrong you lose one. You can upgrade to not using hearts, though I think this costs money. You can practice a lesson to earn a heart though, so not the end of the world."

You'll get some variation as to how much content is available depending on the language but some have grammar tips and stories aside from the normal listening, speaking, reading and writing exercises. It's possible to use this as a jumping off tool with a new language and to continue on with it to higher levels, though you may need some supplemental materials for grammar explanation."

Of course basic daily appliance of the language is a must to learn the language better. I have supported the app and not regretting it. Experience is much more enjoyable now.

I believe it would be a nice thing to try your new learned language skills with somebody who maybe is native to the language or also learning it. Great app. Recommend.

But I miss grammar explanations, it's only learning by doing which is great if you already have some skills in a language but hard if you start from scratch. Also quite easy to get the algorithm behind the different answer options so it's quite easy to guess correctly even without actually knowing.

It can be a little hard to learn new languages because there is little explanation, it's a lot of trial and error and that can be frustrating with limited hearts.

They integrate a lot of different learning styles that are ideal for trying to learn and remember a new language. The reason behind 4 instead of 5 stars is that I find for some conjugations there is no breakdown explaining how and when to use a certain form. You kinda have to read the comments for that question or just pay attention to the subtle differences

I do wish they could include the words , dictionary and forum functions on the mobile app as well. It would make it better if: 1) The tips are given in more coherent order 2) If the progress quiz in the Plus option does not test the person on grammar and vocab that they have yet to be exposed to. It defeats the purpose of real progress. Otherwise, I am very grateful and happy with the tremendous amount of work put into this."

The only reservations I would have are:- as far as French is concerned, some of the questions are too difficult because you cannot know which gender to use for your answer.

I like how they reward you with achievement pins and gems and I love that they have the leaderboard and you can see your friends achievements for those who thrive off of some friendly competition. It would be good if you had more of an introduction into a lesson as it's jumps straight in and if you're unsure of a word you'll more than likely lose a life but it's definitely had a positive impact."
257,Vinny Desimone,"April 17, 2020",5," Honestly I completely love this app, you can go slow or fast and take as much time as you need to advance. The little achievements they give you help to keep you wanting to learn and strive for more. I'm already learning so much and it's only been 3 days, this is so much fun and I honestly love it."

However... 1) the update that forces you to lose hearts when you make a mistake is a really terrible design, as it does not encourage you to continue learning, but discourages instead, making it an important aspect of a pay-to-win mechanism (forcing you to buy Duolingo Plus or to grind endlessly for in-app currency to restore the hearts). 2) The images resembling a man and a woman (and probably a few more) now show people that are undoubtedly associated with middle-eastern culture and religion most popular in that part of the world. Could Duolingo kindly keep their language-learning app as culturally universal as possible? Why do you think that a heavily bearded person wearing a turban is a good choice to represent the word ""man""?"
259,Gargi Subramanian,"April 15, 2020",4," It is super helpful and great if you wanna learn new languages. It has all the facilities of any school, but if one's internet is slow it doesn't catch up and it lags. It would be better if they upgraded the internet part. Other than that Duolingo is a great friend and fun to use."
260,Susan Barnes,"April 20, 2020",5," Been using this for some months. Have learnt so much and can do so at own pace. However, you are encouraged to progress by competitive leader boards.

An entire chapter was dedicated to loan words like Bluewings (because Korea has a bunch of fans??) Get LingoDeer."
304,Daniel Redley,"April 27, 2020",5," Easy to use. Minimal ads. Great lay out. The only thing i can put a slight down point on, is that between the fenale and male voices the app uses, there are variations in the way they pronounce some of the words. Can get hard to know which is closer to being correct"

Both were upsetting. If you happen to have a typo in your answer the whole thing is wrong, you will lose your streaks and health.

Review is constant and there are stories and other options that I haven't taken advantage of yet as I want to develop some competence first -- this week. I chose the paid ad-free Plus option soon after starting."

I have my very own book where I write down all the things I learn each day. Duolingo has helped me understand a bit of the Korean language while I watch Korean Dramas on Netflix. (Goals are to watch K-Dramas without english subtitles 😊👍) Basically, Duolingo assists me a lot when learning Korean; going step by step with easy-level practices. I'm also a big fan of K-Pop. Meeting my dream idols (BTS) while speaking fluent Korean would be a dream come true😄"

I love that one can learn multiple languages. For me: Russian, Italian, French, Portuguese. Rewards keep you learning daily. My grandchildren are using it for their Spanish lessons while homeschooling. The only issue I have is that in order for them to use it properly, each of them to use it on a different device with a different email address for each. They're 6 & 9 years old. So this is difficult. I wish the app had the option for multiple users at different levels."

This is not a game app where you burst candies and then wait 3h once you lost all your lives. People install this app to seriously make progress in learning a foreign language and now you get punished for typos by losing hearts and being forced to pause for 5h or so. This discourages people who are serious about learning and want to progress by forcing them into hours long break. Punishment doesn't help people learn dear duolingo!

The content is based on American English rather than International English. It is a further let down by use of American colloquialisms. There are inconsistencies on user assessments.

Also, I wanted to ask you that how can I remove or restart a langauge from my profile in my Android phone? P.S., why does the checkpoint 1 does not unlocks in Spanish after completing all the pre level courses?"
401,Matt Johnson,"April 25, 2020",2, Regular updates that almost always worsen the experience. I haven't learned anything new in over a month because of constant reminders to re tread old topics. The constant reminders also wear thin quickly. It's good for a brief intro into a language but not much more.

404,Eleni Vasilaki,"April 9, 2020",4," Great app, keeps you motivated to refresh a language or learn a new one.

415,robin matthew Myburg,"April 12, 2020",5," I love the app. I have recently recommended it to my retired mother and friends. A great way to spend the time in isolation.

It would be very helpful if they would at least have an option to review the basics. For some reason Duolingo doesn't offer an overview of the course or a side note about what we are learning.

There are no apps as good as this one dealing with major Indian languages, even with millions of people speaking them and wanting to learn them. It would definitely be untapped potential. Please try to include them soon!!"
458,Mary Beredam,"April 29, 2020",5," Wonderful language learning app, packed with different languages; Spanish, Korean, French, German, Chinese etc. Moreso, the packages for learning each language are diverse and appropriate for both beginners and middle levelers.

461,Yatesh Rawat,"April 22, 2020",5, The app is great with variety of languages with easy consumption and learning in a quiz manner. I enjoy learning in the app which is more like a play. It engages not only the visual senses but also the auditory senses. Kudos to the developers for their efforts.
462,Fox Jones,"April 24, 2020",5," The interactive way they introduce the languages i find is very beneficial. It has a good flow, introducing many components of a language in a way you can still grasp it. Dedicate time to this app and you're sure to have progress in your venture of a new language."

I actually used it before and didn't like and deleted, then I used many apps for language learning and couldn't find one. So I had to try duolingo again. But omg! I don't know how I didn't like it before!! It is amazing.. Thank you!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
465,Anika Basler,"April 14, 2020",4, Great for vocab although the order in which they are introduced is a bit random. Grammar is explained under tips which was helpful and levels can be skipped by doing a test when too easy. Would love to get a list of vocab that I learned but I don't think there is that feature.
466,Tolka Manolka,"April 24, 2020",5, Pretty awesome if I say so myself. I like how you can get free premium for a week for inviting a friend. DEFINITELY recommend. It also gives you compliments and says your okay if you make mistakes. Great for all ages. You did a good job with this app!
467,Nicola Diamond,"April 29, 2020",4," Great app....the only reason I give it 4 not 5 is that it could say the Polish for ALL the sentences, it could also have a bit of leeway for nearly there sentences, for instance if you have 1 letter wrong ...but it's a great app other than that, getting me through the lockdown."

470,Julius DaMaximus,"April 16, 2020",3," The learning part is great, I love it. But the stupid heart system is horrible.

472,Roxanne Paquette,"April 12, 2020",4," I have used this app for a few years. I love it and have learned alot. However, With the new changes, only five mistakes are allowed and then you are forced to quit unless you purchase more hearts to continue. It is increasingly hard to finish a lesson and has become very frustrating to use."
473,Magdaléna Kubová,"April 9, 2020",2," I enjoyed this app a lot up to the point I learned that I need to pay for unlimited heart feature while the others get this for free due to some kind of randomization system. This has been a great disappointment, honestly. Please, get this fixed. It's very misleading and demotivating."
474,Luke,"April 22, 2020",5," Ads are infrequent, would only recommend more activities to do daily, ie a random topic quiz to challenge friends with for example, to keep me encouraged to learn every day, along with another way to earn hearts faster as the current method is a bit dull, still a 5* app for me though"
475,Alessia Bachmeier,"April 15, 2020",2, i really liked the app until lives became a thing. i find them really unmotivating and disencouraging especially when starting a new language. I wanted to start a second language but since I knew nothing at that point and made quite a few mistakes this feature made me give up very quickly.
476,James Wilson,"April 28, 2020",5," I enjoy Duolingo because of its ease of use and multiple ways of reinforcing each lesson. Overall, I prefer to use it on PC, because the mobile quizzes are much easier, since each word is already spelled out andust simply be selected, however the portability of the mobile app is nice."
477,Neko Birdy,"April 29, 2020",1," It talks down to me, it's extremely tidius, and worst of all it takes the fun out of learning a new language. Also you can't remove language on mobile versions of Duolingo only the PC version."

479,Monty Matson,"April 17, 2020",4," Great app, but could be twice as good if they just put the grammar tips that are available online on the app too for all the languages! Am doing Dutch at the moment and would mean I'd actually understand the grammar rather than stumbling my way through and guessing at each stage!"

Can i get ad free premium but still retain limited hearts but reduce the wait time to maybe 2-3 hours that would be awesome.

I respected the company and the app very much for giving access to so many people who would otherwise have none. I recently downloaded the app to brush up on a language and found the new free version so limited that's it's not worth the download. Great job to you smart CEO who optimised the site to a useless level.
482,Yareyare Spravedlivo,"April 27, 2020",5," App is more useful than everything I met before, but there are some bugs with pronunciation, especially in Japanese.

485,Alex Kap,"April 10, 2020",3, The app has many bags. The heart refill during the lesson sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Sometimes I refill more hearts using my gems and it didn't refill..

491,Kyle Huber,"April 15, 2020",5," I really enjoy the app. It certainly helps with reading, translating and spelling foreign languages. The only recommendation I have is building in a feature where it teaches you to speak a new language. Otherwise, can't complain."

525,Diana Atchley,"April 30, 2020",5," I like the way learning news words is reinforced by repeated usage in different contexts. I find this invaluable. Sometimes I do need a little more help than what is available from tips, but all in all, it is a great learning experience."
526,OtisBear 1000,"April 26, 2020",3," It's fun, but a little too easy to actually learn the language, also when you run out of hearts, you can take another test or pay for unlimited, what's the point in a free game if your gonna run out of hearts and have to pay for more?"
527,Doris LaHart,"April 27, 2020",5, I enjoy this program for the most part. But I don't understand and don't like that I am not allowed to learn when I don't have enough hearts. And the only way to get hearts is to pay. And if don't pay you will lose your progress. I am close to deleting app. Disappointing.
528,Adib Siddiki,"April 22, 2020",5," So far, a pretty great app. For someone who doesn't yet want to commit to purchasing the full experience, this is the best option I've used so far. Even for those who already know a little of the language you're aiming to learn, there is something valuable to take away."

530,Daniel Craddock,"April 22, 2020",5," I really enjoy this app! Very useful! I am currently learning Hebrew. Just one suggestion though, having the aleph-beit letter lessons would have been nice. I already knew the aleph-beit by memory. Having this feature would help others as well. Thanks for making this app, I like the mascot as well."
531,crystal Williams,"April 29, 2020",5, This app has been very refreshing. Ive previously taken 6 total years of spanish but it had been over 17 years since I was in an instructional class. It came right back to me with Duo Lingo. Easy to understand and easy to navigate thru on the app!

540,Christopher Lucas,"April 23, 2020",5," I like how the lessons are broken up based on the grammar of the language you are learning. Lessons are made up of different formats, such as speaking into the device, translating the sentence via text, arranging sentences, etc. so I feel that I get a holistic approach to learning a new language."

After a while I reinstalled and it didn't have the heart system and I really enjoyed it. After a couple of weeks hearts appeared again. Uninstalled.
543,Ryan Gentzler,"April 25, 2020",4," It's great for hearing, speaking, reading, and writing but the computer voices could be better. One thing I've recently discovered is the stories which are a much better conversational basis than the normal lessons."
544,Peter Guyver,"April 13, 2020",4," Great app, lots of languages which help you learn fast! Just wish on some of the exercises it wasn't so obvious what the answers are or that it'd explain how and when to use some words. Other than that, it's the best."
545,Sam Degefa,"April 14, 2020",5, It's the best. Fun and interactive. I've tried other 'best' apps but this definitely deserves the trophy. I Especially love the podcast feature in which you can learn to listen to stories like a real speaker boosting your confidence.

I loved unlimited hearts and no ads – and very excited to do tests since my Belgian friends (I was learning Dutch) were making me tests. I felt ready to do one, and so I did, but the words/sentences had nothing that I learned, being passed the first unit. I got none correct, all because none of the words I learned were in the tests. That's the only downfall, it's be much better if you could include words that you've learned so far. Thanks!"
547,Pratima Panda,"April 19, 2020",5," The best app to learn languages. Though there might be a few problems for casual learners, but overall the bugs and glitches can be ignored and won't matter once you grasp the language. Recommend it to everyone learning a new language"

549,Chris Howard,"April 10, 2020",5, Learning fast. It's slow going at first but once you start getting sentence structure you start to fly through. I recommend the subscription version if you plan on learning as fast as possible so you get unlimited hearts and no ads.

556,Urban Dzindzinovic,"April 16, 2020",2," It was a great app, until today. They added very distracting visual effects that break your focus. The effects are completely unnecessary and there is no setting to turn them off (like you can disable sound effects)."
557,Cece Sinclair,"April 11, 2020",3, An extremely useful app. My only issue so far has been the support. I have lodged multiple issues experienced and feedback is not often forthcoming. There are times I have to trawl through user comments to gain understanding of some problems I experience

Enjoying my experience although it has been only two weeks since I downloaded the app.. The only thing I want to mention is that you should also add Urdu language.

596,gregory jones,"April 16, 2020",5," Excellent product for learning a new language. Informative and fun, it allows you to learn at your own pace, and uses an effective combination of verbal, visual and graphic tools during the sessions. I thoroughly recommend it."
597,Jules Rommens,"April 9, 2020",1," Why can't you access the freaking settings? Entered the wrong email address? Then you have to go through aaaall the starting process before being able to change it, that is really bad UX. Update : everytime I restart the app, it connects me on another account.

599,mark oco,"April 12, 2020",5," It's a best app, in terms of aesthetics, variety of contents and features, but I think it is still lacking in terms of overall engagement and/or competition against other users. I am a Duolingo user for more than 2 years."
600,Paul,"April 23, 2020",2," Without paying for extra 'hearts' / lives (which you lose if you make a mistake), it's hard to judge if the app's any good.

When you're first starting out, you can lose them all before you can really get going and have a play around with it - then you have to wait another day to get more hearts. So it's not useful as a free app."
601,Lesley Cooper,"April 27, 2020",4, Brilliant for a complete novice. Too much info on screen for multiple choice making answers to obvious. I feel that I can read and spell french now but speaking french and retaining is much more difficult. That said I would still thoroughly recommend this app.
602,Angela F,"April 15, 2020",5," Excellent app! I'm able to keep practicing my Spanish and finally having a go at a few other languages - all in one app! It's easy, quick and I can feel that I'm making progress. Commitment is flexible so I can learn at my own pace. And the paid version is well worth it."
603,infires man,"April 25, 2020",4, Good app learns very well but the problem is that the audio is messing like a lot of times I dont know if the problem is the update or something but there sint audio like even at the whole lesson it's a big problem because the audio helps the most to everything so please check it thanks.
604,Kent Brown,"April 10, 2020",4, Had so much enjoyment from this app. It's not 100 percent correct and it has some information missing but just work in conjunction with the net and its all good. Nothing matches it for portability and ease of use.
605,the sidekick penguin,"April 11, 2020",3," Yes, it's a good app, but t randomly got rid of my 30 day streak, ignoring my streak freezer. I am definitely learning a lot, but please fix this. Also. I feel like there needs to be more in the shop."
606,Ishta Thakur,"April 9, 2020",1," The chapters are not downloading. I am not going to loose my 103 days streak because of a stupid error. Everything was working fine till 3 days back, I dont know what has got into it. App and phone both are updated and my Internet connection is also 4G. Please look into the matter asap."
607,Peter Hernandez,"April 10, 2020",4," Great new language learning tool. i already speak French thus has been a great refreshment. I will.look to other languages soon. The only little downside is the app is specifically design to specific translated word, so pay attention when doing translation exercises."
608,mahshid zare,"April 8, 2020",1," I have a problem. Suddenly the sound of the app that reads the words and sentences, does not play without vpn, and images does not load. I didn't have this problem before and then I loved this app. But now I can't work with it!"
609,Kwakye Peprah,"April 8, 2020",5," Great language learning App. I like especially the opportunity to practice the oral forms and the many listening challenges in each practice set. Also, the App allows me to set daily reminders that prompt me with a short text each day so I don't forget to practice."
610,Ruslana Shramovich,"April 17, 2020",3," I like this app very much. The only things I woud change is the screen, to make it larger, and another, to give more hearts without plus. Not all people could afford plus, not saying that it is me though, but above all this app is awesome."
611,Alan Glancey,"April 24, 2020",4," It's pretty good, with LOTS of repitition and drilling to make sure it goes in. Progress is slow but steady. Ad-driven, but you're getting it for free, as long as you ignore the siren calls to upgrade."
612,Catherine Connolly,"April 18, 2020",1," It started well, but you have to create a profile to get past the intro. It froze every time I tried to register. Now when I open the app, all I get is a screen saying 'retry'. I've un and re installed twice. Same every time. Now frustrated and will look elsewhere."
613,Joc Marrs,"April 26, 2020",4, As the lessons get harder you run into words you haven't dealt with yet so you are left absolutely clueless. This doesn't hinder your progress much just slows you down. I wish there was a guide to direct you in some way to make your learning more efficient and retainable.
614,Ian Carmichael,"April 22, 2020",4, App is great. For practice it is excellent but is a little short on explanation at times. It claims to be proud to be free (and it is remarkable that it is) but it spends a lot of time trying to get you to buy the paid version.
615,Shrekboi Yeet,"April 26, 2020",5," This app makes it fun to learn languanges Also i've noticed that a lot of people dont actully know that if you press the heart button,you can litterally just practice and get 1 or 2 hearts,people seem to think they have to wait 4 hours to refill or pay for it,hope i cleared that up for yall"
616,Graham Powell,"April 28, 2020",5," Awesome App... excellent language learning tool..

622,team Dill,"April 21, 2020",5," Excellent App for learning languages it doesn't move on too quick unless you want it to, so it gives you plenty of time to practice. Also it gives you the chance to write, listen and speak the language which is important."
623,Kere Amohau,"April 26, 2020",4," Love this app, but I'm giving it 4 stars as the offline learning is now part of the paid version, when before it used to be free. I also wished it had the option to save words to a list to study again later."
624,Flyby,"April 28, 2020",2," Not sure if its just me but the new update seems to make you retake the ""skills"" you learn even if you go on the app everyday to gain other skills. Seems a bit ridiculous making you use xp points to retake it again."
625,Allie Popoff,"April 10, 2020",5," It really is an addicting app! Growing up I was fluent in French, but have been long out of practice. This app has been a great way to brush up on it. It's fun and so much is coming back to me. Love it. I'll be using to learn Japanese down the road as well."
626,Bhim Singh,"April 16, 2020",3," Please add more sentences of different types and more vocabulary words. Please add some other topics like office talk, customer talk, marketing sentences, update the app on regular basis. Add more and more sentences. Relationship talk, conversation with seniors."
627,Yousif Alkindi,"April 15, 2020",3," Though the learning experience is amazing, the app itself is bad. It occasionally crashes and freezes.

And for all these reasons, the app deserves 5 stars!"
629,Fabian Munoz,"April 25, 2020",1," It is so bad now, an app that practically forces you to pay unless you don't have any mistakes while doing each lesson, which is almost impossible when learning a new languaje, causing you to have an extreme delay in your learning process."

631,Proud Whovian,"April 19, 2020",3," I don't mind in-app ads, however the volume of the audio ads is at least twice as loud as the in-app audio. It is jarring and often painful when listening with headphones on. It makes the app unpleasant to use."
632,Andrea MacMullin,"April 11, 2020",3," It's great for brushing up but for a beginner it lacks basic vocabulary and study tools. Having to backtrack for hearts without forking over money is annoying as hell! That being said, I'm enjoying brushing up on my French."

I am learning Spanish and haven't missed a day since I started 10 days ago. I am retaining more than I thought I would for such a short time period. Thank you so much for this app. It's amazing.
673,IKEANYI OZIOMA,"April 21, 2020",4," Awesome! Duolingo is cool! But how about starting with the basics like the alphabets, numbers, days of the week, months of the year and other basics in every language introduction? Nevertheless a great app."

It would be very useful to me if they add Tamil language.I hope this would happen. But in otherways it's a very nice app to learn different languages.Anyhow if you want to learn any regional language like Tamil. This app is not the right choice.But I want atleast Tamil to be added as there are about 70million people who are residing in Tamil Nadu and speaking Tamil language.
675,Danica Tajcman,"April 9, 2020",5," I just love love loveee Duolingo! It's a fun and innovative way to learn a language. Kudos on the stories part of the app! For English speakers there is more than 30 different languages to choose from. The app works 99,9% of the time so I really highly recommend it :) Thanks Duo ❤"
676,Tammy Thomas,"April 18, 2020",4, This app is good but it could be better if you had more than five lives so you could learn more...... Cause if you mess up 5× you cant play anynore until the next day witch kinda sucks buuuut i do like the way it teaches you to learn a diffrent language. It teaches very well. Gracies
677,Nasim Z,"April 22, 2020",5, Its really a fun easy way of learning a language... Im greatful for such a useful app! Ps. Edit==> i still love the app just recently there is no sound when it pronounces the words! The other sounds in the app are fine just the main important one!
678,Ava Fraser,"April 7, 2020",5," I love this app so much! It's so helpful, and fast to learn a language. It's not annoying at all. And I like how it makes sure you practice all you've learnt and remember it! And I like the streaks to encourage you to come back! Je donne à cette application 5 étoiles!"
679,Maisarah,"April 21, 2020",4," Please add dark mode to the Android app as well. Please add more languages such as Malay, Vietnamese and others. Also, there's a lot of mistakes in this app. It doesn't accept translation answers when it means exactly the same."

It was good. Now returned to learn Spanish, the app is updated and improved, I'm enjoying it now! There are short stories available now to listen and learn new words+grammar, as well as Duolingo podcast allows you to listen stories and train your skills. Moreover, now for each lesson you have tips and explanations. Great experience, motivates me and is free to use unless you want an even more upgraded version !"
681,Kuba a,"April 17, 2020",2," First, secons and third levels are alrightbut when you are higher you need to write answers and one misspelling or something then the answer is incorrect and repeating the same cycle. Besides its great app its getting me fourious literally after repeating the same things multum times."
682,Dwayne Loller,"April 29, 2020",5," I'm loving this app, 100 days in and I'm finally learning a new language to knock off my bucket list. The format is set out well and the tips are handy. The option to discuss questions with other users is handy also. Highly recommend."
683,Abdul Zabbar,"April 20, 2020",3, I do not like English transcriptions because I want to learn Hindi. I think English transcriptions are no longer needed here when an audio system is very active. Hope you deactivate the unnecessary features from this very useful learning application. Thank you.
684,J. /,"April 23, 2020",2," Good app till it ""forces"" you to pay. The mic never works (it does not matter whatever you say, it keeps ""not hearing"" you). Then it substracts you hearts and asks you to pay to continue. Elaborated scam, but still a scam."
685,Alex Eliason,"April 13, 2020",5, This has made learning German much more casual and fun than I realized and the knowledge is sticking as a result of daily practice. This is a very useful way to teach languages to people cause it makes it engaging and fun!
686,muhoza kalisa,"April 17, 2020",4, This is one of the best app that help me during this quarrantine. I have it four stars due to a lot of ads but I know we have the option of going to premium but still maybe you can think of reducing them not giving them after each lesson. Thank you
687,Sami Cheikh Omar,"April 22, 2020",5," This app is great, it provides a lot of languages for you to learn, and you can choose whatever second language to learn of. It would be better if the stories are available in mkre language ( for me: spanish for french speakers.)"
688,Kayla Outhouse,"April 14, 2020",5," Awesome app to learn a new language in your own time. You will be able to speak, read, and write a new language with using this app. Plus you can do it for free! There is an option to pay for unlimited access but doing the basic access is still excellent."
689,Gracie Kollias,"April 19, 2020",4," Wish I could access just the tests, as they alone don't justify the price of plus. However, they are the only feature I would want exclusive to the paid version. I would like to contribute as well, but don't use the app frequently and can't justify it currently."

691,mac henderson,"April 25, 2020",4," Good learning tool but takes forever to get past the basics which makes it frustrating for those with some prior knowledge, even though the test is supposed to gauge your ability and pitch the lessons accordingly."

All the courses gone, i could literally access nothing.. it was all there but it said ""I was off line"" but my wifi was on and working and so was my data. I'm going back to the free version cause I ain't paying for something that you cant access. And I will not answer to generic ""please contact us at"" messages. If you want the customer make sure the service works"
693,tamara ns.ns.II.,"April 11, 2020",3," Easy and fun. Also free (ad supported, but you can buy premium to get rid of ads). Unfortunately occasionally shoves so called progressive gender politics down your throat and there is no option to prevent it."
694,Chas Cranfield,"April 24, 2020",4, Very handy tool and encourages me to practice every day. The French/English can be tricky for British English speakers as Duo speaks American English which is often very different. Nevertheless I highly recommend the app. Thanks Duo.
695,Samir Bhushan,"April 18, 2020",5," An awesome app to learn different languages and practice them as well. There is a big list of language options and you can choose which ever you want to learn.You can learn more than 1 launguage at a time. Overall, the best free language learning app on Playstore"
696,Katyaini Ranjan Chaudhary,"April 25, 2020",4," I love how interactive the app is as well as the tips with every lesson. Though, I wish there was a way to keep track of the words learnt... Is there any way to add a dynamic vocab list which gets updated with each chapter finished?"

698,مهدی عباسیان,"April 13, 2020",4, I used this app for learning italian and it was great. Recently I have decided to use it for learning Arabic but unfortunately there is no sound when there is a need for pronunciaton! I think there is something wrong with the app I tried reinstalling it but it didn't work out...😕 plz guid me?
699,V-Lee Mars,"April 14, 2020",5, Im trying the free trial and i love this. I feel like im really understanding how to SPEAK a language and not just learning words in a different language. This is worth it not worring about mistakes cuz you go of what you remember ..and its actually fun i find myself wanting to get on duolingo
700,Tabitha Rubin,"April 15, 2020",4, I love this app for the most part. I have reported a bug with the practice component that hasn't been fixed and has carried over to other practice lessons which causes you to quit 3/4 of the way through.
701,Alex Hutcheson,"April 18, 2020",2," I was disappointed to find that you are unable to type answers when translating between languages, but have to use the word bank instead. This renders the app completely useless for me as I find using the word bank far too easy."
702,Gina Saupp,"April 24, 2020",5, I love this App!! It cheers you on as you learn and knows when you need to come back and revisit particular translations. I look forward to completing a lesson every day. I will continue to use this app as long as I can.
703,low quality juice,"April 27, 2020",4," the app is good overall but the meaning when the sentences are translated are a bit unatural for a native speaker. and I want a function where we could review all the new words, sentences, grammer we have studied I'd love to have somemore Duo Owl's skin, it's cute."
704,Sonja Ropedancer,"April 18, 2020",2," Update: I unfortunately have to edit my review. I really love duolingo and am a big fan.

Now one of a sudden you changed the Greek voice from female to male which wouldn't be an issue if the male voice was decent. He pronounces words and letters differently than the female one and I'm losing hearts due to that. He swallows endings, mumbles. I tried to post on the troubleshooting forum but the page is so overloaded that it's terrribly slow and won't let me post. Really unhappy at the moment."
705,Arctic Seraph,"April 28, 2020",3, This is an excellent application that helps you learn your desired language in a fun and interactive way that's free. However having only 5 hearts makes it too difficult to learn without having to pay for more hearts.
706,astrick338,"April 19, 2020",5, Keeping me sane while in quarantine. It makes me feel like I'm acomplishing something. I'm only a few lessons in and the ones I've done I can repeat without the prompts. The adds aren't invasive either. I'm very impressed.
707,Allison B,"April 22, 2020",4, I like this app it is helping me alot I was recently reading a book and it had a couple of french phrases and I was able to understand them because of Duolingo but I wish it would have a little more of what I would need to know how to say I haven't got that far into this app but so far these things ...Full ReviewI like this app it is helping me alot I was recently reading a book and it had a couple of french phrases and I was able to understand them because of Duolingo but I wish it would have a little more of what I would need to know how to say I haven't got that far into this app but so far these things are less important to know how to say and read like a french woman I would like to know how to say where is the nearist hospital or somthing like that but over all I really enjoy using this app
708,Becky Brookes,"April 12, 2020",3, I enjoyed using this app but since the new update I'm not hearing all the audio so I have to click that I can't listen right now. I don't think it's my phone or my headphones. Has something happened with the new update?
709,Collin Otto,"April 13, 2020",5," I was skeptical about how a language education app. might work as far as results were concerned, but I feel I've learned a lot more in my language of choice in a few days then I learned in collegiate level course in weeks. Awesome application."
710,Eugene Cooke,"April 10, 2020",5," This app has really taught me allot about what I did not know and helped me understand it. I had tried CD and book combos but this is reading, writing, listening and repeating all with direct feed back. Great little app."
711,Ann Hakin,"April 11, 2020",5, This is an engaging app. It has a good balance between verbal & written content. It makes learning fun. I feel I am making progress and this app encourages and supports you through your learning curves.
712,Lawrence Mc Grandles,"April 16, 2020",5, A convenient way to use your phone for something useful at last other than checking social media. A straight forward app that does exactly what you need it to in order to start learning another language quickly.
713,Abhishek Goyal,"April 23, 2020",2, Lately the app is not working good. Too many bugs Sometimes the screen ceases at the loading screen and sometimes in the middle of the lesson forcing me to restart the lesson again. Also the app is taking too long to respond. REALLY ANNOYED!
714,Roberta L,"April 21, 2020",5," Extremely efficient on learning languages, I've been learning Japanese on it and since I'm writing down all the words I can't forget!😅 The content in it is a quiz it will give you questions eg. Which of these is 'ro' or match the Japanese words with English."
715,Ashish Sharma,"April 18, 2020",5," I am learning Spanish with duolingo and, i must say ,Duo es estupendo, its great hardly 3-4 minutes for each lesson, a reward system and a streak to maintain really keep me engaged. The weekly leaderboard is great too to compete with people while learning. Overall great app. Gracias"
716,Stuart Barclay,"April 26, 2020",2, I paid for the plus version and found that half way through the course certain levels I opulent complete as it wouldn't let me fill in the gaps required. OK but probably best not to waste your money. Better ways to learn through pod casts
717,Anna Obal,"April 21, 2020",4, User friendly. Offers a variety of teaching techniques which makes learning interesting . Occassionally freezes or sound stops working but not often enough to be annoying. Overall would recommend.
718,Nicholas Khaw Kim Seng,"April 28, 2020",5, I like this app a lot but for some reason after the first part when I created an account the app continuously stops me from logging in and resetting my password does not work either it just tells me that it is an error
719,Yves Pangatungan,"April 28, 2020",5," This app has been a great substitute for games even though it doesn't give that enough hype atleast it doesn't hook you enough that you became addicted to some apps or games. Also it is also a great way to learn by yourself through this app, all in all 10/10"
720,Devin Dzelme,"April 21, 2020",5," Amazing to learn new languages step by step covering your reading, written, spoken and listening skills. I absolutely love the short story segments. It makes me want to learn more."
721,Carl Radcliffe,"April 26, 2020",4, The volume on the averts is way too loud. Otherwise it would be a 5 start as I love this app.. most used app on my phone. Don't waste time on pointless games. Play this app and learn a new language 😉👍

Now i moved to japanese and im hoping to be trilingual!! The only issue is not being able to remove courses, and i wish you could form sentences to help me learn better, forming sentences helps me get a grip of how to form and structure the language. Other than that it is easily the best way to learn! And its fun"
723,Frankie F,"April 21, 2020",5," This is a great app. Going on 8 days in a row and it's really helping me learn spanish. I really love the fact that it is not heavy with ads, and if it does have an ad, it's not a 30 second one. Highly recommend it!"
724,The Kentucky Rifleman,"April 24, 2020",2," You supposedly ""fixed the bugs"". I've seen no difference at all. It constantly freezes in the middle of lessons and I've found that some of your translations are wrong. You need to fix this."
725,Joshua Paea,"April 10, 2020",5," I'm pretty sure they can predict the future, because the words I learn in Japanese always somehow pop up in the anime I watch. Like don't get me wrong that's cool and all and I rate the app but it seems to good to be true for a free app."
726,Jason Fracaro,"April 16, 2020",3," No love for Tagalog. Been waiting for years now for this to become supported. Otherwise, the best app to casually learn a language in bite sized chunks. Fun to use. And it's from the creator of CAPTCHAS that has helped machine learning digitize the world's libraries and now self driving. Grade: B-"
727,Ángeles Matos,"April 16, 2020",5," I like this app. It has really helped me with my french i just wish that if they had adds then why add in app purshases. Like yes you can learn without having to pay, but if you do wanna pay it's mad expensive like 12 something per month!"

At the moment I am trying to learn 3 languages with only 5 hearts between all of them and it is not working. Please could you do it so we have 5 hearts for EACH language because I would like to be able to add more languages in the future as well and it's not possible at the moment. Except for this I love this app and its been very useful! :)
729,kyle garrett,"April 24, 2020",4," A good way to practice all forms of a language. (Reading, writing, speaking. Etc.) Still within the first couple weeks of using the app and using the free version., so my knowledge is still pretty low."
730,benrulez4eva,"April 16, 2020",5, Great app to increase your vocabulary and practice. I would still have some basic command of the language first before diving in. Something for developers to consider. Perhaps an introductory video course before starting lessons?
731,GuessWho XD,"April 21, 2020",5," It's all good, great even this will help me educate and hone my multilinguistic skills for future use until I tried Japanese where in 'ni' sound doesn't play and bugs out all the audio for every course until I reset the app (hopes the devs see and fix this)."
732,Giovanti Walton,"April 27, 2020",5," Solid systematic introduction to the languages. Explored Spanish, Japanese, and Russian. Very intuitive user interface with an enjoyable almost game like learning environment. Thank you Duolingo team!! You guys are killing!! n,_n/"")"
733,Laura Horton,"April 18, 2020",3," Great free app but... I'm English and I get a lot of answers wrong because of the US English. No one here calls women ma'am. We don't refer to our train stations as subways, even if they are underground. It'd be great to have UK English answers accepted."
734,Nicole Q,"April 27, 2020",4," This is an amazing app that offers effective reading, speaking and listening practises, probably writing too-there are so many things to check out! Thank you Duolinguo, the brief lessons really motivate me to keep learning. :)"
735,Eric Winston,"April 19, 2020",4, A fun way to get exposed to language. Progress is game based so you can't really go back and review. Otherwise it's great. The ads aren't bad either. At least for me they are focused on what I'm interested in
736,Chelsea Octivia,"April 16, 2020",4," I just started and I'm really enjoying it however, I'm at a point where I tried to type in the answer and it refused to accept it even though I typed it correctly... Update: the issue was my fault... everything is ok, this app is great"
737,Caylin Ravens,"April 10, 2020",5," I love it so much because I used to hate learning languages, but this app makes it fun and interesting. It doesn't take a lot of data and I can spend my whole day learning and it would feel the same as if I'd been playing any other video game."
738,Brrt Tök,"April 12, 2020",3," Was a great app until they got ads and started this whole ""energy"" thing. Now you have to pay to practice for any meaningful amount of time. It's a cash grab and it's disappointing."
739,Shokoufeh Talebi Taher,"April 11, 2020",5," What's happening? Why do I not have any sounds? I used to have it, it was okay! Now I need it the most and it's gone. I've checked the setting I've checked on Google and lots of people are having the same problem. Please help 😭"
740,Derek Marchant,"April 20, 2020",5," Dont find this sort of thing easy but having the option to go over ""modules"" to enforce a subject is good. Theres also a ""peak"" option that I use after I've written the sentence before I submit the answer which is helpful"
741,ikr001,"April 16, 2020",5," Great app with lots of language options, helpful repetitive practices and super easy to use! The free option has very little and not very bothering advertisement but still many great functionalities!! Definitely would recommend this app to anybody trying to practice or learn a new language!"
742,Shanty Adams,"April 25, 2020",5," I really like the adaptive challenge levels so you can progress faster to topics you need to work on. Also, the conversational stories mimic real life so it makes more sense than just disjointed sentences. Thanks Duolingo!"

745,Awolola Praise,"April 20, 2020",5," This is the first app I'm ever rating cause it's really amazing. Everyone is got to give this a 5 star. It has a very good learning environment and not only teaches, but also gives you tests and questions. And so far it's really helping me out."
746,Cindy Smith,"April 28, 2020",4," I love this app., it's helped me learn faster than others. The reason I give it 4 stars is because Duo won't allow some offline learning for non--paying customers. Not everyone has internet 24/7."
747,Kanika Tandon,"April 29, 2020",5, I have been using this app for 6 days and till now I have found this app amazing!! This app teaches you language which such good variety of exercises that I am in awe of this app. You can learn any language which is available on this app to a great extent.
748,Naama Almoraissi,"April 24, 2020",4, This is a great app as a supplement to your language learning regimen. Its not a program meant to make you proficient reliably on its own. That is why I gave it 4 starts. Still a fun and great app.
749,Emma Llewellyn,"April 29, 2020",5," Repetition is used to help in the learning process. I have become more confident in learning welsh There are different ability levels to choose from which also helps with learning. Duo lingo is free, and it is ideal for learners."

And learned nothing and it sits on its own unread.

Made it very simple to learn. Upgraded it!"
754,Roshen Panicker,"April 23, 2020",5," Extremely Good. Thank you developer for sharing such an app. I am excited to spend time with the app everyday, infact i cant wait to get done with my daily working hours to spend my leisure time with this app. App is designed amazingly too."
755,alex savill,"April 23, 2020",5," Very good for learning german. The heart system everyone is talking about is actually ok and after 5 hours you get another heart or you do a test to get more hearts, or you buy them with an in built currency. It is teaching me well, and I have quite a lot of fun on it."
756,Aislin Sargent,"April 13, 2020",4, I dont lile the new update because you get a certain amount of hearts. When you use up those hearts then you have to wait a while to get more. No hearts no playing. But other than that it's a good game.
757,Jacqueline Bonner,"April 14, 2020",1," The regular app is pretty good they force the plus adds on you barely able to use lessons. Sign up for the ""free"" trial. Extra fetures barely work and when you cancel they still charge you for it and make you keep it. Just don't bother."
758,David Anstee,"April 16, 2020",3," The content is good, but setting up a profile or an account is impossible. I'd be happy to give money if the account set up worked. Can't have 2 kids under one parent email. The back end needs work."

760,Steven Landes,"April 13, 2020",4," Been quite brilliant, provided you are paying attention to the lesson itself, and not just playing multiple choice. Can you do it? Certainly. You still will learn, but less. -scl"
761,Ben Reid,"April 9, 2020",1, Great app but took full payment for the year in one payment instead of the monthly payment of 6.99 i was expecting and has left me with no money. Absolute con as it is not made clear that this will happen !!!! Extremely unhappy customer
762,The Undisputed,"April 20, 2020",4," It's great for learning languages that use English letters, still good for learning Hebrew, and Arabic it's just those type of languages are lot harder to get the hang of even with this app, but other than that Duolingo is quite good."
763,Franklin Dabman,"April 26, 2020",5," Have been attempting to learn spanish with this app and I love it. The tasks vary so although its repetitive (as it needs to be to teach you) it's a fun way of doing it. Really enjoying it, I've used it every day so far and I and making good progress. :)"
764,Amanda Silva,"April 8, 2020",5, This app is so much fun and you are learning. I love that it challenges you to learn more and reminds you to refresh your memory just so you can really retain the language. And the podcasts are great to listen to.
765,Malcolm Davenport,"April 18, 2020",5," I found this app a while ago and thought it was neat. Then, about nine or so months ago, I found out that they have a course for Scottish (Gàidhlig) and I immediately downloaded the app. I take a few other courses as well, and am amazed that there doesn't seem to be a limit.

Then, about nine or so months ago, I found out that they have a course for Scottish (Gàidhlig) and I immediately downloaded the app. I take a few other courses as well, and am amazed that there doesn't seem to be a limit. And it is truly free. A plus option that you can purchase, I believe for a monthly fee, gives the option for a more in depth learning experience, but if you're just looking to speak a new language for FREE, it's here."
766,Jung_kook_bts,"April 13, 2020",4, This is a good app and one of the best apps I've ever gotten . I've given it 4 stars bcs u have 5 hearts and everytime u get something wrong one of ur hearts go away.Once all of ur hearts are gone u have to wait a long time for them to come back so u can carry on with ur lesson
767,Nicole Miller,"April 10, 2020",5," I really enjoy this app! It's fun and easy to use, but that doesn't mean it slacks on quality content. I am retaining so much of what I learn and I'm only a few days in, with an average of 20-30 minutes daily."
768,Poulami Roy,"April 17, 2020",2," I had above 1200 gems yesterday. But today when I opened the app my gems have all disappeared and I am left with 25 lingos. And when I am getting rewarded with gems, they aren't adding with the existing lingos! Please solve my problem."
769,srabana chaudhuri,"April 20, 2020",4, Pros 1. You get to choose from 3 different pace of daily learning like 10mins a day 2.repeatation of words within a topic helps learning the word by heart Could have 1. An introductory video explaining how the heart/points system works 2.could have a weekly leaderboard for each stage of learning
770,Jose Villalobos,"April 9, 2020",2," I liked the app, it's good. But when I saw that they charged me 83 dollars for the whole year, I mean it's a good price, but I wasn't able to afford it at the time, and they never specified that I was going to pay the whole year they showed me a monthly sum. Anyways still good content."
771,Jason Choy,"April 12, 2020",5," Great free app for learning the basics of many different languages. Thoughtfully structured and intuitive. Just keep in mind that if you really want to go all the way, you will have to go beyond just using this."
772,Roberto Perez,"April 24, 2020",5," Duolingo is one of the better language learning apps I have come across.

It is very well put together, very interactive, extremely fun, and allows for learning new languages enjoyable. I highly recommend this app for the eager student that would like to improve their Spanish for class, to the foreign neighbor interested in learning the local culture. 5 stars!!"
773,looker G s,"April 26, 2020",3, I hate the upgrade. You have to buy lives to be able to learn.😭😭😭😭 The un upgraded version is the best. I will have to give this app 3 stars because of the upgrade. This app will do great without the upgrade.
774,Paolo Santos,"April 11, 2020",5," Has few ads after a session but not that annoying, this is one of the most famous and effective language learning app and its free. Its activities are fun and tries to improve the language you are learning"
775,AleeXandra91,"April 20, 2020",5," Best learning app ever! Learning doesn't feel like a chore anymore, I actually enjoy it! The creators did an incredible job by finding a way to make learning so entertaining. Thank you this app helped me so much🙏🏼❤ Totally recommend it!👍🏻"
776,Kaushiki Roy,"April 16, 2020",5," I think that the app is extremely useful, and that, combined with the fact that it's absolutely free, makes it an extremely valuable asset to anyone who wants to learn a new language---whatever their purpose may be. I love Duolingo!!!"
777,Raúl Cuevas,"April 26, 2020",5," I really like how easy it is to progress and to keep getting new knowledge. Now, this app will keep insisting that you use it, so if you are easily annoyed by notifications, maybe try something else."
778,Rania T,"April 22, 2020",3," I really like this app , but the problem is that it would never know your level at the language, it helps a bit to learn languages that you already have known things about but you can't really learn a new language with it ."
779,Aisiri .P,"April 22, 2020",5, Its a very nice app..it makes learning fun ..i used to have a lot of difficulty in learning a language..but now with Duolingo its easier for me to learn new languages ...and on top of that it is a completely free app!!!😃😃
780,Charmaine Mak,"April 23, 2020",4," The games and learning method is perfect, most of it is perfect but I feel like they should increase the speed of hearts so I can learn more and make it easier for those that cannot afford to go plus to learn"
781,Lizibizi Lizibizibu,"April 25, 2020",1, I hate it . When I have no hurts left I must quit and lost all my progress . I am not enjoying when I have to do one level for seven times . This app can be really annoying . Ofcorse if you are not doing any mistakes this app is for you. 😡😡😡
782,Steve Hall,"April 24, 2020",4, Good all round language teaching - very frustrating having all those adds though that's what makes it free I suppose. Can also be a bit long winded with the heart system ( you can't advance without them and you have to earn them )..
783,Mary Grace Doña,"April 8, 2020",2, I already cancelled my subscription as I only wanted to try the 7 days free trial but after 7 days it is still on pro. The date keeps changing when it will expire. I'm afraid it will cost me money. Please fix this.
784,cecily boyd,"April 10, 2020",4," Really good for the most part; however, certain things dont translate the same even if the meaning is the same, and the system doesnt recognize the nuances and mark it incorrectly."
785,Vivian Yang,"April 17, 2020",4, It teaches you really well but it would be better to teach the same thing more consistently to have it stuck in your head. I think the lessons are too short. But it is such a fun and educational app!!!
786,ranjani k,"April 21, 2020",5, Really a good app....I enjoyed it and I love the way of it's teaching......We don't have to memories anything from that language which we learn.....it repeat the word again and again until our brain stores it...it really awesome....❤❤
787,Prudence Zitha,"April 18, 2020",4," Fun way to learn a new language. The app freezes sometimes times, especially when I've needed to speak into it as part of saying a sentence. Otherwise a very good app."
788,Niclas,"April 12, 2020",4," Its a very good app to learn a language. The UI is simple and understandable. The only thing I don't like os the heart system, but due to practice mode even that isnt a problem"
789,Sandro Sanon,"April 14, 2020",5," I really dig the app. Only problem is after I did the update, it stopped working. Just freezes and never come back on. Hope it can be fixed, I must say that I am learning a huge amount from this app."
790,Nicole Godetz,"April 27, 2020",3," Too many ads for an app that keeps saying keep education free. Also, too slow for progress, should have more intelligent analysis of mistakes. Has a glitch on one type of activity and there is no one to contact about it"
791,Brenda Nyakoa,"April 13, 2020",4," Nice and simple vocabulary for a new learner. The phrases are useful and reading them out loud improves grasp. If you are starting your learning journey, this is the right place to start"
792,Vernon Benton,"April 27, 2020",5," its effective and enjoyable, at leastfor spanish. probably learned more than I did in high school that's for sure. only negative is that some of the best perks are hidden behind payments, but its generally cheap, and the price tag encourages use."
793,Narges Ghomeshi,"April 13, 2020",1, Tips section doesn't work for me. Sound doesn't work(only in stories section it works) It goes not responding all the time. I used to enjoy learning with Duolingo a lot before. Do something about the problems please
794,Alma Orts-Sebastian,"April 23, 2020",5, I am loving it so far. I'd like the levels to be a bit more different in difficulty to keep up the challenge but I might just be a competitive nerd. Thanks for making this for free ;)
795,Olivia Tatlow-Stokes,"April 25, 2020",5," I have tried for ages to find a good language learning app, and finnaly I have found one! This app is so helpful and also really fun! It reminds you when you have full hearts and when it's time to practice your language! Would defiantly recommend to anyone whose trying to learn a language!"

797,Sam Heppner,"April 22, 2020",5," Awesome! This app manages to keep me motivated to learn. The only issue is that it sometimes doesn't work with certain Bluetooth headphones. Otherwise, very easy to use and surprisingly fun!"
798,Alexis Wong,"April 28, 2020",5, Great way to start learning a language! I have been using it on an off for years now! They make it simple to learn and fun as well. They also have a lot of languages to choose from!
799,Veronique Denis,"April 13, 2020",3," When running out of hearts, the option to upgrade to duolingo plus works but not to get more hearts using gems. I am using the app on an android tablet. Please fix this bug as it is very frustrating. Thanks."

Why did I not receive the plus feature for the two other friends who joined?"
801,Kerrie Callioux,"April 16, 2020",5," Love this app!! Even though it can be repetitive, I find this useful to help me remember new words. Love the stories as they help me understand the spoken language better."
802,Jean Attwood,"April 29, 2020",4," I think the varied presentation of the words is good. I do not like the system of rewards of hearts and gems, which , in my experience, is designed to limit what you can do in any session."
803,Aditya Joshi,"April 21, 2020",5," One of the best apps I have used, really interactive learning provided by the app. Best way to start learning a language as it provides opportunity to read write and speak. Really recommend."
804,武蔵宮本,"April 27, 2020",4," Good app. Only issue Is, currently learning Italian. And found that it's the only language without stories. French and German has lessons where you read and listen and guess what they're saying via story/conversation but Italian doesn't. ."
805,Deepjyoti Roy,"April 10, 2020",3," I would've given it 5 stars. I've been using it for around two months and quite recently for the last three days, the app gets stucked in the loading screen everytime. Please fix it!"
806,David Flores,"April 23, 2020",2, It is accessible and fun to use but you have a limit since you have the hearts as lives when you get a mistake you run out of hearts. You can learn from basic which is good for a beginner.
807,Amira Abdallahi,"April 28, 2020",3," This app is quite good, I love it but it focuses more on the vocabulary so you'll get a very slow progress and you can't rely only on it. This is my experience with the free version and again it's good."
808,Evans Builder,"April 15, 2020",3, There's a glitch in level three I cant get passed that level... can you plz fix. I have one month without being able to use. I love this app. Plz fix it. I'm sure it's something simple.

810,The Pawvoy Dog Hotel,"April 19, 2020",4, I find this app addictive! Have 3 languages on the go and getting to the next level is exciting. But I have over12k hearts but have nothing to use them for? I agree it would he fab to able to have a chat room or to connect to a follower
811,Mayuri T,"April 28, 2020",5, I love this app! It has a simple user interface which combines audio and written info quiet well. It gives us a great recall value. The leaderboard thing is great too.
812,Marius Fusariu,"April 18, 2020",1," Awful, this app used to support landscape mode, now it just forces me to hold my phone in portrait mode. I don't intend to take any selfies, guys. I also see a lot of romanian ads to companies like vodafone, who also have developed apps for people with eyes aligned vertically Awful, just awful"
813,Misha Volkov,"April 23, 2020",5," Outstanding app for learning even the most difficult languages! The work that's gone into it shows, and I defy anyone to find a better language learning app. Ten thumbs up, and that isn't easy!"
814,Wilco Verweij,"April 21, 2020",1, This app was good until they decided to bring in the heart system that not only adds unneeded stress but forces you to make more mistakes. I'm glad the hearts have yet to be brought to the desktop version.
815,kurt wyngaard,"April 19, 2020",5, In the past it felt like a chore trying to learn a new language and always had an excuse when it came to having the time. Duolingo is really impressive with how I've been progressing with French. Simple and very effective!!
816,Charles Emslie,"April 25, 2020",2, Duolingo was a pleasant and fun casual way to learn a foreign language. However the switch to hearts to punish users for mistakes really makes the app feel more like a gatcha game rather than a learning tool. Look into other apps for learning.
817,Sarah,"April 29, 2020",5, I have never used such an amazing app before! Everything is clearly made and understandable. I have tried many apps but none of them can compete with this.
818,beto cajamarca,"April 15, 2020",4," Simply great, I have learn a lot in just a couple weeks, I have been studying for almost a year and learned a lot, but now I became a little simple, would be asome if you ad something like meetings to test your level like Duolingo events in zoom for example"
819,Kaviya Srinivasan,"April 28, 2020",5," Spectacular app, I have been using it for a while now and have been totally enjoying it. Effortlessly learning spanish. Just that the title of the app is a little deceptive. Please do take time to change it"

I wish it had more options on spending the lingots cuz I find mine just sitting there and I really really wanna spend it. I have like 200+ lingots that just hang around till next week to spend 5 on the weekly challenge and it doesn't make a huge difference in the amount I'm getting everyday cuz I use this app a lot. And btw Duo's such a cute owl 🥺 you wont regret downloading this.
821,Raja Venkatesh,"April 19, 2020",5, Great app to start learning. This gives us confidence on the very first day that we can learn anything . This tests our ability and brings the inner quest out with it's design. I am grateful 🙏
822,Peter Acres,"April 15, 2020",5, Excellent app. Allows you to spend as little as 10 mins a day improving my skills in learning a language. The learning process can be undertaken at any time. Timely reminders are sent each day!!
823,Me,"April 16, 2020",2," Up until today I have been enjoying using Duolingo to learn a language. But they've begun adding adverts with audio. I finished my lesson today only for the app to jump straight to a loud scream for some garden puzzle game. It was awful, and may put me off using the app in future."
824,Jack Cervantes,"April 25, 2020",5, Makes learning languages efficient and easy. You can learn hundreds of words and phrases in just a few weeks. Complemented with practice and consistency would have you speaking another language in just a few months
825,Josef Andrew,"April 21, 2020",5," Amazing app for learning languages, by offering many ways to study the language in writing, reading, listening and even spelling, and the most important option is the motivation by planning weekly world wide leagues."
826,Estridge Family,"April 23, 2020",4," It's set up like a game to keep it fun, but it's like hopping straight to a test without ever being shown a study guide. Also it would be helpful if the ads were in the language you're trying to learn."
827,Isaac Andu,"April 17, 2020",4," It has been exciting to learn Italian, which I have always wanted, but didn't have a chance. The app makes it so easy to learn, pronounciation needs practice. May be a 5*, after further learning."
828,Umm Shaakir,"April 23, 2020",4," I love duolingo, the mini stories which are quiet amusing, and also the practical sessions, tips and tests. They dont take too. Much time and you can pick up alot from it. Great app, have already recommended to friends and family"
829,Fern Griffiths,"April 18, 2020",2, Its a great app! But the app gives you 5 hearts and everytime you get something wrong it takes the hearts away and once the 5 hearts are all gone you cant do any lessons until the next day when you get another 2 hearts and it happens again.
830,Charles Tracey,"April 16, 2020",5," This is an absolutely amazing app, definitely use if you want to learn a new language. It has everything you need to learn for the language, it's super easy and convenient, and has a wide range of languages to learn"
831,Srivatsan,"April 18, 2020",5, Learning so much! But I think a good feature would be to show how your ranking goes up or how much of a difference is there between you and the one above you would be a nice feature that will encourage us to learn more.
832,pankaj mandal,"April 20, 2020",5," I love this app. But I'd like to add one more feature to it so that we could mark words, that we are finding difficult to either memorise or pronounce. I hope you take note of it."
833,Emmanuel Alcina,"April 19, 2020",1," It is a lousy application that can only be run with Wi-Fi, ads and commercials every second, poorly translated words, languages, poorly crafted phrases are not designed to learn languages. Is really terrific."
834,Thomas Whiteside,"April 25, 2020",5," Brilliant and so easy to follow, I've been trying to find somewhere to learn Scottish Gaelic and this is it. There are a few ads but not too many so getting lessons free and a few ads is well worth it."
835,saedy mccoy,"April 26, 2020",5," Great and Fun Way to Learn Languages - repetition, bright colors, great encouragement increase absorption and desire to return to the app. Useful for setting you on the path of different languages, including endangered languages."
836,Martina Dolezalova,"April 11, 2020",2," Adverts all the time and few points for the day to try to force you to upgrade and pay for this app.shame....i still use it because i like this design,but there are better apps for less money if u really want to learn."
837,Mj malana,"April 10, 2020",4," This app is great so far but i suggest to make the lessons of the harder languages more like in a style of how it is thought in spanish, the ads are not even a problem in this glad i has something to achieve this quarantine period (learning spanish("
838,Lourens Strydom,"April 10, 2020",5, Easy and effective. The app keeps me challenged to go further. I can see that my language skills are improving. Offline mode is only for premium members which is sad.
839,Aadishree Vaidya,"April 13, 2020",5, Brillant app allows you to learn how much ever you want (free) it never lets me down . I started learning spanish the tutor is too good if we want slower speed for a word or sentence it has given you the option . The best learning app ever
840,Karen Christmas,"April 27, 2020",2, I love this app but since the latest update it randomly shuts down in the middle of a lesson. It is very frustrating and is happening more frequently! Please fix this!!!!
841,lazy bullet,"April 12, 2020",5, I am enjoying learning. Very much satisfied with what it offers for free. I would have never learnt anything new without this app. My social sites time has been utilized for good. Loved it and its already 1 year of use

I love it, but it is really more than learning language as speaking to others. It is learning the spelling, lanuage rules... Like being in school. Wish there was a program that just taught to speak by learning words and pronouncing words showing pictures. Like kindergarten. Small words to start, phrases, .... But I am determined to keep going and learn it, maybe slower, but will be ables to read Spanish"
845,Ken Esgana,"April 24, 2020",5," Very nice. This gives you an option to participate completely coz you'll need not just to listen, but it also allows you to write and speak, which makes learning fast I think."
846,Rushikesh Awad,"April 16, 2020",1, Why the whole interface change to hindi language when I want to learn English on English interface. Now because of this I have to first read Hindi then translate to English and then answer my questions rather than you could have given a normal English interface and save our time.
847,Chemical Creations,"April 15, 2020",5, Provide a wide variety of languages and the new 'tips' feature is well overdue. I would love it they added more articles like that as reading the specifics of a language helps allot in the learning.
848,Tawfeeq Ahmad,"April 17, 2020",5, A very good app for learning languages. It's very user friendly UI and repetitive practise of new words not only makes it easy to remember new words but also articles and grammar. Definitely 5 stars.
849,Firuza Harunova,"April 17, 2020",5, Hi! Could you please add the new feature: to add words which are in new lessons by clicking on them and then to see them in separate section? Not possible to review new words and to repeat them.
850,Ankita Arya,"April 26, 2020",3, The app is good....but somehow they don't teach most of the things that should be taught to understand the particular language. And they should add a major test and evaluate us on the basis of the marks...so that we could know our progress better.
851,Nathan Dumessa,"April 27, 2020",5," I love how well designed this app is!! Very user friendly. Great, short exercises that make it easy to practice in brief periods without getting overwhelmed. Love it!"

854,Pravin Sondulkar,"April 28, 2020",4," I'm using this from few days and this app is very helpful for me. Application has good techniques that helps you to remember word and meaning. If possible please add Indian Languages in it like Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Bangali, Gujarati, etc..."
855,Kristin Gerhardt,"April 10, 2020",5, So much fun learning a new language. Makes it easy with the patterns of new phrases and categories and slowly building up. I could honestly see myself learning multiple new languages with this.
856,Baljinder singh Pannu,"April 11, 2020",5, Amazing app for language learners. Easy and fast way to learn a language . There is a huge platform for learners to learn a different number of languages. also one can even lean multiple languages at a time which is best part about it .
857,garry onhunt,"April 10, 2020",4, Hi..dis app is no doubt best but these days certain issues are coming with respect to starting the app. It has been continuously showing the logo on the screen and not initiating the lessons. Can it be please fixed.

859,Larry Cook,"April 11, 2020",5," Great app to learn from. Each skill gets a little more difficult, which is awesome for me. The little lessons make it easy to pop out for a few minutes anywhere."
860,Chelsey Brown,"April 13, 2020",3, It is an amazing tool to use when studying multiple languages but there needs to be permanently download feature opinion for those that are in the military whom doesn't have WiFi for long periods of time.
861,Ellie Daniels,"April 19, 2020",4," Great app but please fix! Works so well be occasionally bugs out and wont load the next question. Means i have to go back and start all over again, so annoying. Other than that, brilliant!"
862,Dylan Delaunay,"April 16, 2020",4," Not perfectly working... The microphone is activated but doesn't work on this app... and it is a big problem when I want to use it... please, do something to resolve this..."
863,Zagroz Aziz,"April 18, 2020",5," It is an amazing application. You really save hundreds of dollars in learning as many languages as you want. For me personally, I find it even more useful than a personal tutor. Thank you Duo!"
864,Samriddhi Shedpure,"April 19, 2020",5," It's a perfect app for learning different kind of language, for now i am learning Spanish and French. Am I enjoying learning the language. On regular bases I take a minute lecture and i am able to see the results..... All credit goes to Duolingo"
865,Marjorie Murray,"April 26, 2020",5," A first rate language learning app. Makes it easy to keep going with daily practice. Speaking, listening, reading, writing. Fun stories and very interesting podcasts."
866,Oky Doky,"April 19, 2020",5," It's a perfect app to learn or improve your English skills, good enough for new learners or intermediate level learners and why not even for advanced ones just for fun, enjoy learning a new language as the app says what you can learn with fifteen minutes of social media?"
867,luap remlap,"April 28, 2020",5, I do a couple of hours a day and loving it. My only criticism is start a new subject new words are introduced and you have no chance to practice which means you can loose your hearts quickly.
868,Erica Williamson,"April 25, 2020",4," Great language learning app, but please, please, please make a button on the app - that is easy to find - that lets you manage a course and delete one EASILY! This is a top priority and many would appreciate it! Thank you!"
869,ahajshqjxbsjdb Oxjandhamcbsjzk,"April 26, 2020",4," Okay. Ive got to change my review. This app sure is fun and you learn a lot from it. The league feature though, i dont like it. Its a distraction really. I liked it the way it was previously."
870,Navneet Bhamare,"April 23, 2020",3, This app is nice it really teaches very well but the only problem with this app is that it speaks very fast. When they give conversation to read the women speaks very fast and it becomes difficult to understand

Can you also introduce dark mode to the app? Thanks!"
872,RICHARD SMITH,"April 15, 2020",5," Very good app, lessons help you understand and learn the language. Each level you go up makes the lessons that not harder. So it keeps you interested and improves your language skill."
873,Reina Sabie,"April 14, 2020",4," I love this app. I wanted a kids version for my elementary aged kids.

My daughter's iPad is too old to support it, so she can't use that either. Plz release on Android and for all countries or at least make a web version available like the original Duolingo is! We love Duolingo"

876,Todd A,"April 18, 2020",1, The Russian Keyboard on my Galaxy is apparently not set up to run this program. I downloaded another keyboard only to have the same problem. It's a great app with the exception of their is no choice to bypass the keyboard and keep on learning.
877,Tom Evans,"April 9, 2020",4," Great way to learn new languages, however some words can differ from prior knowledge of the language. Also it would be better to add the stories teaching method to all the languages."
878,Connie Leung,"April 26, 2020",1," the app already speaks very fast in level 1, I cannot listen to what the speakers say and am gradually losing interest. Each mistake costs a heart it is punishment that makes people lose interest in learning new language"
879,No One,"April 15, 2020",5," Useful, accessible, streamlined. Ads between lessons aren't overly obtrusive, which is generally the make or break for an app like this. I have no complaints."
880,Bob S,"April 8, 2020",5," I find it very convenient that I can at learn at my own pace. The friendly reminders at first were somewhat irritating, yet to my chagrin, I have found that they work for me."
881,Tikka Blu,"April 16, 2020",2, Nice program need to work the bugs out of it a bit better. Like the speaking exercises...no instructions. And the heart thing is cheap but then im using the free platform so no real surprise.
882,Idk Idk,"April 13, 2020",4," I love this app, it is easy to use and helps me learn Japanese, but I don't like how I have hearts and you have to pay to have unlimited, I would like unlimited hearts all the time, so I can learn faster. But, I do love this app."
883,Davram Campbell,"April 28, 2020",5," Great app. However, if like me you've come to learn Scottish Gaelic, you will find a limited amount of available material compared to the other languages."
884,Gireesha Arora,"April 8, 2020",5," I love this app. You can learn a few languages together... not sure how many but it is very helpful.

885,Khai Kazama,"April 24, 2020",5," Effectively educational. A good start for any green leaf to learn any language. but then, its lost speaker after update. So, do please fix this problem because I begin enjoy learning and want to recommend it."
886,Fecchio sb,"April 18, 2020",4, Its very good apps for learn a new language for begginners buut i think it should be grest if we can have some lessons with and not only kind of test all the time... its good support but really need to have an other one for make some real progress so i mix babbel and duo its very nice
887,AgentMonkey08,"April 28, 2020",5," Amazing app! Not many ads, and it is very simple and easy to use! It is so seemless and smooth looking. Also, it fills the screen of newer phones!"
888,Melanie Schweich,"April 11, 2020",5," It s a very good way to start learning a language Through repetition of listening, speaking and writing exercises, the basic vocabulary of a language is easily remembered."
889,Eileen Bolton Lee,"April 15, 2020",5," It's simple and lots of repeats. Lessons are short , I have time to write words and their meanings. I get little reminders to practise. It's enjoyable learning and there is a great sense of achievement for me🤗🤗"
890,Pouria Ghahremani,"April 9, 2020",5," Found it fun and useful. Really helped me a lot, but If you would have added Persian language, more ppl could use this brilliant app. Persian speakers are a lot in the world, please consider my suggestion. Thank you ..."
891,Adam Harvey,"April 23, 2020",4, Really simple to use and the quizzes are a great way the reinforce the words and phrases taught. The only negative is how quickly the hearts run out forcing you to stop learning if you make too many mistakes.
892,Gloria McPherson,"April 10, 2020",4, Overall very good. Menu could be more intuitive. I wish all the language apps would allow viewing the whole alphabet at once and a short list of simple vocabulary words to learn along with alphabet.
893,Kevin Mwakio,"April 20, 2020",4," It's user friendly and very colorful, making learning fun. The fact that you have to wait for 5 hours for your lives to refill is, however, too much of time; wish it was shorter."
894,Gypsy 2222,"April 20, 2020",5, Excellent app. Requires some self discipline to write down some things and some comprehension skills for grammar breakdown but if you have these things along with an ability to research and a desire to progress you are golden!
895,Marijan M.,"April 19, 2020",5, I think it's a great and interesting app for learning new languages. But u need to practice a lot to get the gramma stick in your head :) I'm doing German. Try it out u will not regret it.
896,veer vikram,"April 11, 2020",2," Sir, could you please help with the app. There's a glitch in the app that prevents it from opening even if there's a steady internet speed. I request you kindly to look into the matter and solve the issue."

It's fun. It could be more fun and encouraging with less emphasis on spelling, (my spell checker is not ok with French and English together) since Duo Lingo cannot make fine distinctions I.e., ""license"" mispelled, transposing the letters S & C and an unintelligible spelling i.e., ""₩¥+%#"". The latter is not even close. Why bother with spelling if it's only holding learners back? Thanks for your serious consideration of this note. Mac out."
900,Nicole Thomas,"April 21, 2020",5, It's really nice and repetitive to get you used to the words and phrases. I have told multiple people about this app. I hope to become fluent within a year's time to help assist me in my travels to south America!
901,Bianca Lozano,"April 23, 2020",3," This app is fine overall, its helps to learn a bit but the only thing that irks me is the heart usage. Once you run out of hearts, you have to wait and it's not fun as it used to be."
902,Anmol Pal,"April 22, 2020",3, The microphone of the app doesn't work. It keeps on saying wrong for everyone time I translate the phrase in to the language I want to learn. Not a single time I got it correct.

I just started a few weeks ago, and I am already able to think quickly in spanish. I completely reccomend this app for parents who want their children to have something else to do during these hard quarintine times. The ads are only at the end of the lesson, and do not pop up everywhere, so I do not think they are a problem, but Duolingo plus is ad free, so if that is what you want you can go get that."
904,Dagoberto Mosquera,"April 17, 2020",4," Every time l open Duo, l think l am playing and learning at the same time. It is easy to follow and memorize. Also, l feel connected to and with the world."
905,Joshua John Samuel,"April 26, 2020",5," Wonderful, fun way to get to know languages better, mind you, you would not immediately become an expert in a language, but it helps with reinforcing it with audio visual help"
906,sinagaken,"April 27, 2020",5, I like the learning process. It is a step by step and it feels like doing the fuzzle and i enjoy. I highly recommend this app for anyone to learn the new language. The exercises are fun.
907,Daphne Bal,"April 27, 2020",5, Great and fun way of learning a new language. Very user friendly and interactive. Love the way new words are introduced and that it even incorporates pronunciation.
908,Terpen Karaflipops,"April 29, 2020",2," This app is not great, audio feature needs a lot of work as well as the structure of the the tasks/ exercises and needs more such as more learning features and selective lesson. But for a free app pretty good"
909,Mridula Jamwal,"April 11, 2020",1," Ever since the recent update, I've been having problems with loading the lessons. It's taking too long to load or a message pops up saying ""error loading""."
910,Adele Jang Don,"April 20, 2020",5," This is a godsend! Korean husband, I'm trying to teach my son korean(I'm english!) It has helped in so many ways. So easy to use, you just have to put the time and effort in. Great app!!!"
911,Juliette Goddard,"April 27, 2020",5," I love this app. It is easy to understand and the tips are so helpful. I am feeling confident when I start a new level. I can go back to a previous level and finish with no mistakes,"
912,Videlin Piskov,"April 20, 2020",5," Coming from a language highschool I can't hide how pleasantly surprised I am by this app!!! Definitely opt for Plus. Surpassing the regular version's limitations, makes the learning process much better!"
913,Never Castle,"April 12, 2020",4, I'm not sure how effective it is in actually learning to speak as it just moves on eventually if it does not detect it being pronounced correctly. Plus does it keep your voice recording?
914,Ella Oliver,"April 27, 2020",2," Really disappointed by the introduction of ""hearts."" Add benefits to the premium model, rather than disincentives! Duolingo used to be great, really hope that they rethink this 'feature'"
915,Peter Alderton,"April 11, 2020",2, Lowered previous rating as it's become buggy lately. It keeps resetting my progress near the end of a lesson and I have to start again. It's come to a point where I'm losing interest. Too bad because otherwise it's a great app.
916,Sanjeevsankar Jayanandan,"April 20, 2020",3, It's good so far. Usability is good and I have learned so many words. Grammar is a big confusing though. There is no explanation why certain grammar is certain way.
917,Manuel Marin,"April 27, 2020",1," Leaderboards are rigged to force you to keep playing. Also, this is the third time I write this review in two days, and it mysteriously keep getting erased. I wonder why..."
918,Kayleigh Reilly,"April 16, 2020",4," Normally love this app. Unfortunately, lately the sound just stops working on lessons where you need to listen. I'm hoping the new update will fix that."
919,A Google user,"April 14, 2020",3, A really useful way of learning or revising a language. Would get a 5 if there weren't so many really annoying bugs they everyone complains about but they simply refuse to fix. It really exasperates the volunteers who make the courses.
920,Tom M,"April 22, 2020",4, There is an issue in the app. For the 4th time on the last question its freezes and you have to do everything again! It happens once a day on the first lesson Please fix this!
921,Robert,"April 21, 2020",5," Excellent eduationcal app, teaches you similar to how you'd learn in a more natural setting, wide variety of languages available. The ads are minimal and non-invasive especially considering the quality of the app"

923,Jesse Lee,"April 15, 2020",5," Easy to use, intuitive in that it feels like a game but you are learning, very infrequent, minimal and short ads, not at all greedy with optional in app purchases, very fair."
924,natalie Williams,"April 20, 2020",4, Fun to use and feel I'm progressing. The hearts thing is a bit annoying. Surely you want people to practice as much as possible. But apart from that really good
925,so lim,"April 9, 2020",4," I really like this app. Learning a new language is fun, easy, and FREE. But for some reason I didnt get credit for 5 of my friends joining using the invite link. Other than that, it's a great app"
926,harshith vdn,"April 19, 2020",5, Thank you for making this wonderful free app. I can take a glimpse of any language and it's fun. This app serves as gateway to anyone who want to begin learning languages and this app is special because beginning is hardest part of any journey and duolingo made it easy...
927,Joseph Stalin,"April 9, 2020",5, It is pretty good app the only thing I have a problem with is that it doesn't have many things to spend lingots on besides that the app does a wonderful job it helps language learners and aslo help when one is bored.
928,AIZA MARIE Sarra,"April 17, 2020",5, This is a great app. This is my tip for you: if u ran out of hearts you can always try the 1 heart practice that way you will be able to get hearts to play the game.👌👍😊😀
929,simona nekrasaite,"April 15, 2020",5," I love this app! It's genius, it's so much fun and it's addictive like a game (in a good way, in this case:)! I sit down to do my 30 min Spanish practice, and two hours later I'm still on it!..:)"
930,Tara Lee,"April 13, 2020",4," Very good app, a nice skmle way to learn a nee language. Only comment I'd make is it doesn't really explain sentence structures alot. Also doesn't have much about the alphabet or numbers. (Learning French)"
931,Jerry Trageser,"April 17, 2020",4," Great for learning gramar. My favorite aspect is the blog on each lesson. If I get it wrong and don't know why,. I usually find the answer there. Instant feedback."
932,Victoria Cornell,"April 14, 2020",5, Really good for people wanting to know some beginner words and phrases. I do not believe you can become fluent using ONLY this app. but it is a good starting point.
933,Sonya Lillis,"April 17, 2020",3, I loved the app till they put the hearts thing on it. My husband just started learning and he was very fustraited with it and gave up right away! I used the app for 2 years wirh out hearts and loved it. Please remove the hearts nonsense.
934,Akhile Dlula,"April 13, 2020",5," I'm learning frases in different languages for free and it gives tips on how to use and write certain languages effectively. I also appreciate the fact that they remind you when you haven't been on the app, and they are always eager to help."
935,Alex Williams,"April 27, 2020",5," Excellente!!!!!! Only been using this for a few days and already know loads of new words, the heart system is brilliant from making you practice what you have learnt so you can access more lessons"
936,쿠란경,"April 16, 2020",5, It's perfect for learning languages. But some problems (like in korea) are wrong. Many people wrote comments. You should make the problem correct. Thank you
937,Herosk #24,"April 16, 2020",5," I really really loved this app. I never expected that I will be mad to learn new language. And this all happen because of it's the kool, simple and features. Truly I'm love with this app."

941,Jamaal Davis,"April 19, 2020",3, Learning a lot. But the translator is awful. Will translate the sentences right and will still say I'm wrong. Sometimes I don't get the chance to say anything and it will say I'm wrong.
942,Shamim Ahsan,"April 27, 2020",4, I love it.The app is so fun and useful.but I don't like it when they copy one thing several times. But I still like it very much. Now I can speak Japanese very good.
943,Jacob,"April 27, 2020",5," Very easy to use, caters to what you already know and is very leniant on spelling mistakes, such as a typo. Translations are almost always correct and is very helpful!"
944,elise jayne,"April 29, 2020",3," Don't get me wrong, it's a good app but when you loose all of your hearts, it doesn't even let you save your progress??? That definitely requires improvement but other than that, it's a great app."
945,May Miya,"April 25, 2020",5," Everything is very easy to understand. And it's very convenient that you can fill up your hearts through practice, which is good, because sometimes I need that extra practice lol."
946,Suvi Piira,"April 8, 2020",4," Fun learning game, can even take on several languages at the same time. Content is a bit repetitive, but then, repeat is what you need to really learn new things."
947,Phillipa Maddan,"April 27, 2020",5, This app is very interactive and allows one to learn from repetition. I highly recommend this for any age. I personally find the ads in between annoying but the app itself is good

950,Sarinea Meserkhani,"April 27, 2020",4," I've learned some ridiculous phrases/sentences that no native speaker would ever say, but besides that, the app is fun to use and the competitive nature to it makes me more motivated to use it."

953,Suman Thapa,"April 19, 2020",5, Best learning experience so far. I have learned more in 1 week of DUO than last 3 months combined. Maybe my old knowledge helped me a bit. I hope it doesn't change when I advance to being intermediate from a beginner.

I enjoy the reward they give you after the lesson, it encourages you to do more. But what i was suprised is that there was not chatting system in the sense that after you learn a little spanish it helps when you can speak that language to a person who is also learning spanish and i hope you can improve"
956,Shirley Jefferson,"April 21, 2020",5," Incredible but one issue stories won't sync to the progress on my laptop. They say I have completed then all and there are no more which is false. Apart from that, awesome.Muy bien!"

960,Sai Sunil,"April 9, 2020",5, Love you guys for this great app. Just a request if you guys want to add anything......than please add a place where we can learn recently unlocked words from the language.....it will help more in practice. Thank you.
961,Trisha Harry,"April 14, 2020",5, This is a fun little app and super easy to use and learn. I love being able to set my pace and have gentle reminders every morning to continue learning. I definitely find it much easier than most language learning options.
962,Animesh Topno,"April 14, 2020",5," Brilliant, easy to use app. Small modules keep it interesting. Note to developers: After the latest update, I am not able to view my own scores."
963,Remy Freebairn,"April 9, 2020",4," Super fun way to learn a language! Find the lessons lead to difficulty when understanding the language as a whole, but am pretty new to the app so i hope it gets easier in more advanced lessons!"
964,Johnson Moyo,"April 10, 2020",5," Great app motivates you to do a little everyday which is best way to learn anything especially a new language. Helps with reading, writing and pronunciation. Perfect all round teaching."
965,Kevin Dawson,"April 15, 2020",4," The first 3 weeks using this app have been great. I feel like I'm really retaining the lessons. The free version is slightly limited and you have to watch some ads, but it's worth it."
966,Shreya Debnath,"April 15, 2020",5, I find it easy to learn french on this app than taking actual courses. The best part is its self paced so you can learn anytime anywhere you want. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn any language quickly and on the go.
967,Paul Gunberg,"April 27, 2020",5, The exercises include oral and written French in common situations. I especially like that individual exercises can be completed in 5 minutes or less. This makes it easier to find time to learn French.
968,Anita Gallagher,"April 19, 2020",5," Practises all the language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking, with constant repetition to endorse the learning. Plus it's really fun and in bitesize lessons so I don't miss the time"
969,Cris M,"April 19, 2020",3, Its annoying. The hearts dont get counted as it should. Id get notifs that my heart is full again but when i open the app id have 0 hearts despite last playing 24 hrs ago. I like this app but this annoying bug should be fixed
970,Janelle Dudley,"April 17, 2020",5," I love it! This app has you talking spanish into a mic to get you talking another language, writting sentences, and word matches(so far im on). Im excited 🤞🏽cant wait to see whats next, only on my 4th day, 10 min a day."
971,Deter Swanson,"April 28, 2020",3," Can't log in with my old account so it frustrating. Even changing my password, i can't login. I prefer the computer even the mobile is much more handy. But love the app minus technical issues."
972,Chastine Ryela Bonoan,"April 27, 2020",5," I'm trying to make use of my time to try to learn italian with the app. The tips are really helpful. Thought, there will be ads to interrupt you while using but its okay for me since the apo is free. I hope that stories will also be available in Italian 😊"
973,Esther Ndungu,"April 28, 2020",5," Excellent exprience in all the lessons. Good English and clear tutors. The rewards make me smile , the encouragement and congraturatory messages makes me feel motivated to learn more. The email on my performance is beautiful consideration. Duolingo is the best"
974,Robert Hunter,"April 26, 2020",5," Duolingo is an excellent resource for learning a language on a busy schedule. The reminder push notifications makes it easier to stay consistent with the lesson plan, which is one of the keys to improving language skills."
975,Aslihan Gurbuzel,"April 18, 2020",4," It's a great app. You learn rather passively, doesn't help with speaking or writing. But for comprehension and building vocabulary, it's quite good."
976,Alale Vakhideh,"April 24, 2020",1, I wonder how it got this score!!! I can't hear any voice in this app when practicing listening! I tried some steps but they didn't work! So i deleted my account!!
977,Sharon Benny,"April 29, 2020",5, It's a very useful app to learn multiple languages that we don't know. It starts the basics with images so that we can easily find the word corresponding to the picture in any languages.
978,Karla King,"April 18, 2020",4, Really useful except I think it should change content in the exercises a little more; tends to be a little to redundant/repetitive. Other than that it's pretty effective!
979,Ariane Chambers,"April 10, 2020",5," It doesn't get any better than this!!!!! Best app to learn a language. It is fun and it encourages me to learn. If you are contemplating getting this app, just get it, trust me it would be the best decision you will ever make."
980,phantomhive,"April 15, 2020",4," the story telling option is great! and helps a lot with learning. PLEASE please add it for other languages as well, eg. korean, japanese and other rather less popular languages."
981,Judy Batt,"April 23, 2020",5," Much more useful than I expected, with systematic explanation of grammar points followed by repeated practice and testing, both active and passive use of the language and help with aural comprehension and pronunciation."
982,hakuna,"April 9, 2020",5," Very good at getting you into learning a new language, it starts from varied sets of vocabulary to using them in simple sentences and continues to get more complicated as you go! Its very fun and challenging !!"
983,Parakram Singh,"April 9, 2020",4, The app is really amazing and greatful for learning a new language. However it has started crashing and a new lessen doesn't start easily. Please fix the issue so that we smoothly access this wonderful app.
984,Philomena Mullins,"April 22, 2020",5, Very easy to follow. Excellent audio and visual support. Having problems inserting accents but that's probably my device not the app. Enjoying learning a new language.
985,Paige Honeycutt,"April 9, 2020",4, Love this app so easy to use! And they make learning fun and easy! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cuz u kinda need the subscription unless ur okay having ur learning slowed down by waiting for heart to reload. Other than that this app is amazing!
986,Keath Sayess,"April 21, 2020",1, This app is a wonderful tool for learning new languages. The new hearts feature discourages making mistakes and makes practice harder and take more time. Horrible feature to an otherwise excellent app.
987,Pranita Jain,"April 27, 2020",5, Very easy to use and I am enjoying using this app to learn a language... Very good app for self learning. Just started with it. Will see how it goes and share revies if I face any issues on the way.
988,Snake Tanner,"April 18, 2020",3," It's a good experience, and teaces the languages, but the app keeps eating my streak freezes for no reason. It made me use 5 of them but only in one case was it actually my fault. Not ok."
989,Richard maunsell,"April 19, 2020",1," The voice is really quiet and only works randomly. Not suitable for young kids, requires lots of English reading, went straight into quiz mode, no children's bells and whistles"
990,Josh Boden,"April 9, 2020",5," Very easy and intuitive as a revision tool and for beginners too. I get my students to use this for their language homework, but also for my own improvement."
991,emily shields,"April 16, 2020",5, Very good app. Good to learn diffrent languages and very fun just there are a bit to many ads and it sucks you only get 5 hearts. When you lose them all you cant play on the app but overall its a good app.
992,Lindsey Falkenstein,"April 20, 2020",4," It's a very engaging app. I'm enjoying the pace at which I'm learning a new language, and their approach. I would like it if the hearts refilled a little bit faster."
993,Jaime Garcia,"April 25, 2020",5, This app is good enough to help you create a foundation for a totally new language. Lessons are crafted in bite sized pieces as not to overload you in order for retention to really set in. Recommended!
994,Shima S,"April 27, 2020",5, It's the best app for learning a new language..but there is one thing: it doesn't have Farsi(the Persian language)..well it's easy for me to use it in English but if you could add Farsi for the others it would be great.. thank you so much❤❤
995,Terhi Bryant,"April 12, 2020",4, I love the app. I have learned so much by using it. It has a lot of repetition which is the perfect way for me to learn. I just wish I would have the chance to test myself and see my progress on the free version too.
996,Deadskin Studios,"April 12, 2020",5," Duolingo is easy to use and fun to use. My parents tried to teach me Spanish and it was not fun.

Things are made easy to understand, it gives you audio to listen to, there's a multitude of languages and there's a goal you can set to optimize how much practice you get in a day. Give Duolingo a shot, it's free, my brudda."
997,ADude YT,"April 23, 2020",2," It is a fun app for learning but, when the hearts update came it just became more less fun for people to learn a language. Plus maybe if you remove the heart update it might be fun like it was used to before!"
998,Dishin Goyani,"April 13, 2020",2," App is great in starting levels but after some levels it's get annoying. Don't endorse. For Hindi to English language they are unsystematically using A, AN, THE anywhere and makes your submission wrong and make you confused."
999,A McWilliams,"April 9, 2020",4," Excellent and gripping app, as long as you like repetition and activities that sometimes make no sense you can make real progress. ""The men write in the sugar"" remember! 😂"
1000,Mohamed Sidi,"April 11, 2020",1," I can't go to the next lesson from ""intro"" when I clic next it doesn't take me to the next lesson. It keeps showing ""loading"". You need to fix that problem."
1001,Ian Kenworthy,"April 15, 2020",5, Brilliant. Was recommended this app by a friend a while ago and have never looked back. This is the perfect app to either learn a new language or consolidate current foreign language knowledge.
1002,Radhakrishnan Iyer,"April 13, 2020",5," Simply Amazing 😍 Very beautifully designed, covers topics step by step and makes sure you practice well. The heart system keep a check that mistakes aren't done and also earning a heart take practice."
1003,Aidan,"April 15, 2020",5," It took me a while to figure out ( they really should have something stating how the course is laid out, or intended to run), but once I did, it was a really great course.

Not only did it explain the language verbally and how to communicate, it covered the grammar, and related the grammar to English structure; that really helped! Lastly, it even has a competitive aspect to it, in where you compete with other people to learn your respective languages. I thought that was pretty cool!"
1004,Josh Rose,"April 24, 2020",4, Amazing app but now I've been having an issue where it always thinks I'm offline when I'm not. Like when I go back to using it after my phone was locked or switched apps then go back.
1005,Paras,"April 21, 2020",4," Duolingo helps me practice a lot of la languages. I love using Duolingo and reading tons of stories.

I hope you guys release Duolingo's Dark Mode soon enough. Thank you so much to teach and help me practice many languages, Duolingo."
1006,Ciara Manderson,"April 18, 2020",5, Absolutely love this app it makes learning languages fun and easy...and also cheap! You can pay to get extra things but I love it even without buying the premium. Would definitely recommend to everyone
1007,Sandie Leeming,"April 22, 2020",5, A great way of learning. I am learning Italian and this pushes me to do modules every day as I am competing against other learners. Organised into exercises on different topics and verb tenses to make learning clearer. It has taught me so much
1008,Jay Acosta,"April 25, 2020",5," My experience with the Duolingo app has been nothing but enjoyable, and I am actually absorbing the content rather than just staring at pretty imagery and getting nothing out of it. Thank you, Duolingo, I promise I will get back to lessons now."
1009,Enid Trinidad,"April 24, 2020",5, I've been using this app for almost two years and truly enjoy the learning experience I've received. The updates have improved the app overall and I love how it challenges me to do better. I highly recommend!
1010,Hannah,"April 22, 2020",4," I'd say this app is really good at teaching the basics of any language, it's helped me keep on track with the daily reminders and it's a nice way to spend the time when bored so I would definitely recommend."
1011,Heather,"April 21, 2020",5, Amazing and fun way to learn a new language! I find it pretty addicting like some games but this app is educational. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning a new language! :)
1012,Matthew McLennan,"April 29, 2020",5," Very well set out. The app is really great gor a learning tool, even just by itself. It covers all the writing and speaking elements of learning a language as well."
1013,IE M.,"April 29, 2020",5," I love it. I just hope that the Stories don't crash anymore.. im wasting time whenever it stops, I dont get any points. But the rest is great. :)"
1014,Siavash R,"April 10, 2020",5, Its a good app but i cant play the listening part. Actually it doesnt play any sound. And thats frustrating. The most effective part is not working on my cellphone
1015,Zen on,"April 14, 2020",5, I love the app I have dyslexia and it is really important for me to come clear image and here I have ! The app is simple and clean ! The font also suits me 😁 I wish to have dark theme like it is available on Android 10
1016,Exclusive Samwar,"April 8, 2020",4," I love the app. Firstly it's free of cost and very easy to use. But I'm facing a problem, the icons like eggs, suitcase etc., are not responding. They don't open the learning option... Please give solution to use it..."
1017,Christina Selby,"April 11, 2020",5," Very complete app. They even added stories, which I appreciate for learning in context. As a second language teacher with students stranded at home, Duolingo is good alternative. Thank you so much!"
1018,Charlie Ambridge,"April 12, 2020",4, Very good and engaging app that has improved my Italian a lot. The only reason I didn't give this app a 5 was because I would like them to update the Italian tree and add more topics.
1019,Austin Grossnickle,"April 13, 2020",4, It is a really good learning app with many cool ways to learn words in a certain language. But it doesn't have all the languages. Only the very common languages.
1020,Karin Fritz,"April 14, 2020",5," Good app, smooth learning, lot of repetitions. I am personally missing more focus on grammar, it is more subtle to understand and learn the grammar here as compared to school lessons."
1021,Kate C,"April 16, 2020",4," I do enjoy this app, I wish it had little tutorials about why and how certain words are formed though. It would make it much easier to recall and understand"
1022,Ratna Dewi,"April 17, 2020",4, It is a great app. I could just learned other languages without spend a lot of money. Eventhough there is some bug that need to fix. But overall is good
1023,Shanelle Robertson,"April 18, 2020",5," Super fun, easy to navigate and get help where you need it. Love the owl and game like features! Enticing without pulling focus away from learning the language."
1024,Jeannie Pizzey,"April 23, 2020",4," Good, but it takes too long to raise through levels. There should be a way to start higher than level 1 if you already have studied your selected language"
1025,Andy Mills,"April 18, 2020",4, Very easy to use and you can maintain a nice pace. Good bite size lessons so doesn't require too much time at one sitting. The noises can be annoying.
1026,Maria,"April 27, 2020",5, Duolingo is a brilliant app that enables you to learn a language using repeated exercises to rapidly increase your familiarity with words and phrases. It is a fun way of consolidating fundamentals for all ages.
1027,Ingrid Phillips,"April 26, 2020",2, App doesn't always load lessons correctly. With only 5 hearts a day I can't make much progress and can't get through check point 1 as they speak too fast so I guess that's the end of the learning.
1028,Ray Valentine,"April 15, 2020",4," I enjoy the app, it's nice that it's free and a great way to learn, the only issue is the voice recognition doesn't pick up every word so that can be frustrating. But all in all I still love the app."
1029,Bonita Sinha,"April 18, 2020",5," This is one of the convenient way to learn other languages.... It helps me lot in learning Spanish and all other languages in a very playful way....also I've recommended my friends , who have a keen interest in learning languages.."
1030,Moumita Mitra,"April 22, 2020",4, It's amazing... But the voice is not very clear.. And also it does not teach big sentences.. It would be more effective if there was big sentences or paragraphs.
1031,stuart musasizi,"April 27, 2020",4," Wow, this app is so cool 🏃🤭🇺🇬🇫🇷🇬🇧 I like the part for stories. But there needs to be some adjustment though,to add more brain teasers that enable me to speak and the app can recognize my words as another way of learning. But so far so good ✍️👍💚"
1032,nasi kk,"April 14, 2020",5, It's perfect. But recently I have a problem with playing voices. I can't play any voices in the app and therefore I have to lose some practises
1033,PUMKIN pie,"April 19, 2020",5," This app is amazing and fun to learn. I learn german and also love the books, tips and the new cute people that say the sentences. The only thing i want for this app is new costumes and lessons for the time (for example easter) AND LOVE THIS APP.🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪"
1034,Cyan,"April 21, 2020",4," I think on mobile the leagues should be optional since a lot of the time learning turns to seeing who can get the highest xp in leagues, duolingo becomes more of a game and less of a learning experience."
1035,Brenda Gold,"April 26, 2020",3," They sneak in written questions which cause you to loose hearts, therefore you cant continue playing. Who can write Hebrew when your just a beginner? Therefore your forced to pay the monthly which is a recurring payment unless you remember to cancel."
1036,WavedMoss,"April 28, 2020",5," This app is incredible, I've only been using the app for a few days now, but I've never learned so much in such a short amount of time. Found a absolutely no flaws and I love the reward system."
1037,Teresa Mondragon,"April 14, 2020",1, Very frustrating the way they try to you (at least for ) Hebrew. Beginner level they flash (and say a word) then you guess an answer. On the third question they ask you to translate a sentence and the answer is one single word. Would not recommend this app to my worst enemy.
1038,Fardjad Davari,"April 25, 2020",3," I'm generally happy with the app but it gets frustrating when it doesn't play audio clips. Especially in ""Tap/type what you hear"" exercises."
1039,Denni Hartono,"April 12, 2020",5," Really love this app~ I could learn any languages from the very basic, and the explanation and tips really helpful, hoping for the future update could be better, and more details for the tips and explanation 😊"

1043,asma nasr,"April 24, 2020",2, I know some Arabic beforehand. For it to not adjust to my knowledge level and make me go through all the words is a bit tiring. It also does not translate the words as they come. Maybe things will improve at higher levels.
1044,Malgo Pawlowska,"April 28, 2020",5, Fantastic experience of learning new languages. I have attended some language courses before but Duolingo is even better way to lern languages in my own experience. I wish I had discovered it more early! Would recommend it 100 percent!
1045,Marco Garcia Rojas,"April 21, 2020",5," Duolingo is great. I've been improving my german skills with it, and it completely does its job, with nice multiple choice questions, tap the pairs, fill in the blanks, speaking and listening exercises! Totally recommended!"

1060,yOu kNOw bTs? - Billboard singer,"April 9, 2020",4, It's a pretty good app and I had a good experience. I am learning Korean and Japanese and it teaches me well. The only problem is that it goes from teaching Nouns in one lesson to Adjectives in the next and it's all over the place :(
1061,Clare Stratmann,"April 16, 2020",5," It's easy to use and makes learning a language manageable. You probably won't learn as quickly as taking a class but this is free, fun, and you can easily do a lesson in 5 minutes or less!"

It also glitches and counts something wrong like an accent that hasn't been counted wrong before. however it's been a good resource for learning Spanish but it makes it harder if you don't buy premium and have limited hearts."
1071,Noreen Osama,"April 24, 2020",4," It's a very good app, but i think u should add something has the ability to till us if our pronunciations is right or wrong and that would be perfect,one more thing, please add training by Arabic language 💓"

Not so much for the grammar though, am having a hard time working this out. But generally this is a fun and useful tool to start your language learning.

1110,Marc Gauthier,"April 13, 2020",5, Only thing Id change is unlimited hearts for paid version. Takes the risk and intense focus out of it. There has to be stakes for you to focus on it. Maybe just increase the daily hearts with paid.

1115,Martin Chatfield,"April 22, 2020",4," Excellent app for learning. Slight niggle that certain phrases are scored as ""wrong"", but from the feedback pages etc, they are actually correct. I suppose the fact you become incensed by this proves the App motivates your learning!"

But as you progress it is a complete time waster for the simple reason that the app still gives you a bank of words to choose from. Sometimes the word bank is actually the correct answer without any misleading words to even throw you off. After more than 5 years of using Duolingo, I don't have a grasp of any language I used the app for simply because of the Word Bank feature. The Word Bank should be completely optional to be useful."

1143,RJLion,"April 22, 2020",4, An awesome language learning app but the reason it's not 5 stars is that there should be more languages to learn cause there is only few of them. I hope they update the app and add other languages

1173,laura dooley,"April 16, 2020",5," Awesome app so far! It appeals to my competitive nature to earn levels and prizes for practicing, etc. Now I just have to find someone I know to take the same language so we can talk."
1174,Mehdi Aqayani,"April 15, 2020",3," It's a good app, but something is old and app doesn't update them, and lingots are useless. Add Night Dark Mode. This app supports some language with 1k speakers but doesn't support Persian (Pârsi) the 13th most spoken language in the world 150M"
1175,Leny Zu,"April 12, 2020",5, This app gets the goal perfectly as the mission is to make learning fun and easy. I really enjoy how I learn step by step. Thumbs up!!!
1176,Jane Cane,"April 24, 2020",4, Very easy to use and to my surprise I am learning French grammar quite painlessly. I like being reminded to practice but am taking a break from the leaderboard -too much pressure!
1177,Ryan,"April 18, 2020",5," Had Duolingo sitting not doing much, started getting involved in the friends and leaderboard challenge and found myself keeping a 30 day streak alive never thought I'd pull that off. Great features and easy to learn from."
1178,C.A. Phillips-Clark,"April 29, 2020",5, Super simple and easy to use. The only thing that could possibly be improved (imo) would be the option of being able to practice with other members.
1179,Buff Noob Slayer,"April 27, 2020",5, This is the best. You can pick any language you want. Definitely recommend people this if your looking to learn a new language. Did you know learning a new language is the best thing your brain can learn?
1180,Birds Song,"April 14, 2020",5, It's a great app if you want to learn European language as well as some asian countries language. I wish duolingo app should provide more languages like Punjabi and other’s! Indeed learning concept is the main thing of this app which is mindblowing🇧🇩🥰🤠✌
1181,Samantha Alex Torres,"April 14, 2020",4, The app is amazing it's a great way to learn any language but I hate on the mobile app the enter button on the keyboard and the button to go to the nex set of words are too close together
1182,Cadin Lappin,"April 19, 2020",3, Dulingo so far has been good but sometimes it's frusterating when they tell you to type something in a different language but that keyboard doesn't have the letters you need.
1183,Botti,"April 21, 2020",3, Im trying to learn japanese but the sounds dont work. It looks like the sounds are on but I don't hear anything even though my sounds are on max. Fix the sounds.
1184,Kamilah Godinez,"April 27, 2020",4, This app was pretty ridiculous because after i tried doing my test it told me it was ok to have unlimited test so i tried doing it ona different level and it told me to purchase it again. Though it is a wonderfull app
1185,Winnie Chongo,"April 25, 2020",4," Very good app, been helping me a lot, mostly because it repeats the exercises several times which for me, allows me to memorize both pronounce and meaning."
1186,PsychicPoops,"April 28, 2020",2, Good app but it keeps saying I'm offline when I'm not. It would be good to be able to review the words and phrases covered in previous lessons.
1187,Brandon Vella,"April 14, 2020",5," For the cost of zero, the free app is a nice way to learn a language at your own pace. The repetition helps the new learning stick."
1188,Palika Rastogi,"April 9, 2020",2," This is a good app to learn.. but after 5 days my stops working.. whenever I start a lesson, the loading screen appears for so long and the lesson doesn't start. Now I am unable to access the lessons."
1189,Angelica Barcelona,"April 8, 2020",3, This app is really helpfull especially to beginners like me. The process of learning is easy to follow. I recommend it but rate 3 stars only cause I haven't discover the full feature yet.
1190,Carlos S,"April 10, 2020",5, Easy and fun way to learn any language. I only recommend to include more languages for Spanish-speaking persons. Everything else is excellent
1191,Sean James Vaughan,"April 13, 2020",1, It is very frustrating to lose hearts and have to stop. It is very counterproductive for me. I question whether that makes it a free app. It seems to be just a device to frustrate learnersh into paying.
1192,Dina Petelska,"April 28, 2020",4," It would be awesome... But I can't log in! I've logged out, accidentally, and I can't log in or change password 'en error occurred, please try again later' :c"
1193,Nishant Trisal,"April 12, 2020",5, Amazing UI. I have never seen such a brilliant leaning experience before. This app is outstanding. A must try if you want to learn a new language.
1194,Trashyartkiddo,"April 14, 2020",3," Sometimes it wont really make a sound when it says ""what sound does this make?"" When i have it full volume. It might just be my phone but i dunno."
1195,Miss April Rose,"April 14, 2020",4, Very interactive and easy to navigate. My only issue is with the amount of lives you get and lose. I would prefer to be able to learn a lot longer than 5 minutes
1196,Kush Aadia,"April 20, 2020",5, I love this app.It helps me a lot.It improves my tense formation & I also suggested that to my friends to download this app & it is the best app when you have free time to practice on this app.So that why I give it 5 star rating.
1197,similkameenhorseman,"April 19, 2020",5," This is a great app for language learning. It's not just vocabulary and basic repetition, and the fact that you also work in writing/typing with proper accents is great"
1198,Tobi Neptune,"April 16, 2020",5," I have severe memory loss issues, so the idea of tackling another language is so daunting to me. But this app with the annoying amount of reminders actually helps me out SO MUCH."
1199,Daniel Zayas,"April 19, 2020",3," The app runs much slower than it used to, even freezing occasionally. I'm still committed to using it, just wish it would be more usable."
1200,TT,"April 29, 2020",2," Some people have hearts, others do not, which feels unfair. It should be optional. If you make a mistake on accident, the game punishes you for it. I think the hearts were put in just to get money."
1201,Cassia Smith,"April 29, 2020",5, Great for home schooling especially because it is like a game in ways so to make it fun for kids. Great way to learn just for good experience.

But for some reason I can't access the leaderboard but since I've used Duolingo before I have a place in the leaderboard and I might end up losing that spot! It really is an amazing app but if someone could please help me that would be great and I will definitely rate 5 stars!
1203,Stacy Goodrich,"April 24, 2020",5," I love this app. Easy to use and a great tool to help learn a new language. Iv been taking Scottish Gael for years and have learned more in the past year, after I got duolingo than I did in all the years before."
1204,Mary Godwin,"April 29, 2020",4," This app is very resourceful and apt! The issue is just too many adverts after each lesson. Otherwise, this app is good to go."
1205,Kishore Chandrasekaran,"April 29, 2020",5," Love the app, I am learning French using it. Plan to learn other languages as well. It's very addictive. There are some bugs in the app though. Overall very good and useful"
1206,Just Drzazga,"April 26, 2020",5," There is no equal to the learning and fun that u can have with this program. Hands down the beat there ever, is, and, or wil be. Just keep playing and tell me differently"
1207,Michelle Ryan,"April 18, 2020",4, Absolutely great app the only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because for some languages like Spanish once you reach checkpoint 1 you can read stories I would like if you could add that to other lessons like Japanese
1208,Jay Ferm,"April 10, 2020",4," Still on intro, but I find the motivational aspects compelling. It's slightly addictive so it keeps me going. Breaks lessons into bite size yet effective pieces."
1209,Rachel Kirin,"April 24, 2020",5," I have been very pleased with my experience so far with this app. It is intuitive to use, you get words of encouragement as you progress and the owl is a wonderfully adorable mascot."
1210,Nucleus of A Skinny Planet,"April 17, 2020",2, This app has been so bugging lately. I have reached more than 20k XP. But the app has been slow and unresponsive. Losing my interest and focusing on lingodeer.
1211,Bone Lady_191,"April 10, 2020",5, AMAZING! no ads! And I learned Spanish in 3 months! It really helps me accomplish my goals! I wanted to speak different languages and this app did just that! It definitely meet my expectations.
1212,Siska Voosen,"April 23, 2020",5," Love this app. Give you a lot of exercise and explain details, step by step. As long as you on top if it then you will got it."
1213,Alanna Burgoyne,"April 28, 2020",5," One of the most useful and engaging learning apps I've ever invested in. An absolute joy to open every day, and it has restored my faith that I CAN learn a new language!"
1214,Rachel Teale,"April 10, 2020",4," A few quirks, and the fact you can't turn off American English is really annoying - biscotto is ANY biscuit, not just a cookie, and who knew Americans called tortoises turtles? - but otherwise a really good language learning tool."
1215,maheen mangla,"April 10, 2020",5," Duolingo is a great way to learn a new language!! I have had it only for a few days, and love it! I have been learning so much. The only complaint I have is the ads. 100% free! 😄"
1216,Arezoo Dn,"April 22, 2020",5," There is a sound problem. I don't have any sound for listening and writing practice in new updates... please , please , please fix it."
1217,Rhiannon Bennett,"April 27, 2020",5," Fantastic app, so easy to use and keep you engaged whilst learning. The ads are not too intrusive on the free version."
1218,Steve Swift,"April 13, 2020",5," This app is very good. After years of struggling to learn Spanish I'm enjoying the process of learning for the first time. Easy to use, clear and enjoyable what more would you want. Give it ago."

1220,NYARAI SHAWA,"April 10, 2020",5," Great app, easy to use and very effective. Me and my 10year old are enjoying learning a new language during this uncertain time the world is going through."
1221,Emmanuel Collins Gbinije,"April 13, 2020",1, I love this app but lately even though I'm connected to a stable internet connection after one lesson. It tells me I am not connected to internet. Fix this asap please
1222,Adebayo Samuel,"April 11, 2020",5," This is the best language learning app out there. It helps your listening, reading, speaking and writing skills. The icing on the cake is that its fun and free. A million stars"
1223,Nicole C,"April 22, 2020",4," Super fun but not sure if the lessons are really ""sticking."" Also can't continue if you're out of hearts, which hinders some learning in my opinion."
1224,Nala Lee48,"April 22, 2020",4, It's really good and I use it daily. I just wish there were tips available on mobile for Swedish like it's for other languages and on PC.
1225,Sahaj Gill,"April 16, 2020",4, Great app....but was just wondering I lost alot of my lingots...I had some 1000 plus of them and now with the new update I only have 52. Otherwise great app keep up the good work.
1226,Ewaen Ehimwenma,"April 25, 2020",5," Duolingo provides a really fun way of learning a new language with all the essential components present, listening, speaking, writing, and reading. An amazing app!!!"
1227,Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu,"April 24, 2020",5, Its a great app. Consistently I've been able to learn so much Spanish and I can completely rely on the path that is made without confusion.Methods are completely reliable. 👌👌👍👍
1228,Tina Barton,"April 21, 2020",5," It is a great building on the language, testing, speaking, spelling and grammar. Love the experience , the reminders and rewards!"
1229,Kris Ocean,"April 27, 2020",5," Excellent learning app for languages, easy to use, informative, great for all ages at any level, plus it's free. What more can I say."
1230,Mayra Moralez,"April 30, 2020",4," Tried many other apps and this one is so fun, easy and helpful. Wish they had more languages to learn. Like that I dont have to sit through adds to enjoy this app."
1231,Frances Dougenis,"April 16, 2020",4," Great way to learn...you get back what you put in!!! Practise, practice and more practise is the key..... Have come back after a 2 year hiatus am pretty rusty but app has improved in leaps and bounds...."
1232,Felix Mousseau,"April 18, 2020",2, (Japanese) I mean it's good to learn the alphabets and all but you lear impressively slow and you can't memorize the words. Just the way they make you learn is not that good.
1233,Catherine Dicaire,"April 19, 2020",5," Love it !! It is really user friendly compared to other app that I was using, I'm able to remember more and to practice as much as I want."
1234,Dhana Beaunol,"April 21, 2020",4," I love it BUT big annoyance: 150 lingots, nothing else to buy, I got the extra skills and the different outfits now what? That's a bit of a let down to be honest!"

Hope the 'Stories' and 'Podcast' will be opened to more languages like Italian. But this app proves to be a great foundation from which you can use other resources to build your fluency. However, it may be best used for languages similar to your native tongue. As an English speaker, I found Greek and Korean to be challenging learning using the format of this app but I just may need to stick with it longer. Overall, great app esp since its free!"
1238,George Hunter,"April 23, 2020",4, I find the lessons good fun. They repeat the phraseology using the varied words in each of the different themes thereby I find that I learn the rhythm of the language quite readily.
1239,Eric Yeboah,"April 11, 2020",4, It's a really nice and cool way to learn languages. But I had a problem with my leaderboard. Anyways this app is recommended for language learned around the world I understood French on a month thanks to Duolingo
1240,Gill Malcolm,"April 15, 2020",5," I love it! The goals are achievable, there's lots of reinforcement activities and I feel I'm being successful and the encouragements go a long way."

Interface is intuitive, good looking & simple to use, lessons are repetitive enough to stick but not boring, challenge level ramps up including different tenses and how to talk about abstract concepts. I have a pre-existing vocabulary base in French and Spanish and the app allowed me to take a ""test"" to auto-complete lessons up to my estimated language level, which is a very good tool."
1244,Ruchira Chatterjee,"April 24, 2020",5, Great app. Step by step learning. One should go through the tips before starting the lesson. Learning in a fun way.
1245,Isabel Tandoyog,"April 24, 2020",5, Love this app. I am learning new words each day. I give it a five star for the reason that it is easy to use and navigate. Will continue using it now and in the future. 😁
1246,Fundip #3,"April 20, 2020",4, It's an amazing app my lessons are going great. My one issue is the hearts system I would practice a lot more if hearts would regenerate faster or have there be no hearts.
1247,Cooper Pauliks,"April 26, 2020",5, An addictive app that can teach many languages including unusual ones like Navajo and Hawaiian. If more motivation is needed in angry birds 2 there is an owl card that you can use duo (the duolingo owl) card that you have to answer a language question to use it. I would give it 6 stars if possible.
1248,Dr. Shrekenstein,"April 23, 2020",5," This is a really great app, it helps with almost every language that is used or not used, like Hawaiian. I am learning French and this has been a great help. 10/10 would reccomend"
1249,Catherine Zwink,"April 16, 2020",4," Love this app! Useful, addictive, helps me stay on track. Wish they had a way to practice writing Chinese characters!"
1250,Debbie Knight,"April 27, 2020",5, it supports a wide variety of learning styles and is easy to practice what you have already learned when you move on to a new subject. Would thoroughly recommend.
1251,Karen Loss,"April 26, 2020",5, I'm loving it and learned 350 words in 4 days. I'm playing on it a few hours a day. It's distracted me from social media and taught me a language. I like the short stories.s
1252,Veronica Guerra,"April 26, 2020",5, Great app to practice and improve any language you want to learn. Easy and with a lot of exercises. Highly Recommended.
1253,Ashish Sood,"April 12, 2020",3," Please add an option to type out the English translations (from other languages, German in my case) rather than by just using a word bank."
1254,Hannah Leubner,"April 16, 2020",5," It is extremely easy to use and it is actually really fun, you get rewarding messages, points, and friends!! Best app ever"

Personally, I know up to 3 other languages besides English - those being Spanish, Mandarin, and Khmer (Cambodian). Speaking of which, I would love to see more languages like Khmer (my mother tongue) on Duolingo someday."
1256,Curious,"April 19, 2020",3," NOT a serious tool for learning, it purposely slows you down ... so that you watch more ads duh. Fun I guess but never forget, the main purpose is to make money off you by making you purchase pro or watch ads."
1257,Iga Wos,"April 15, 2020",5," Great speed of the course, just to suit your needs. It can be intensive or slower, depending on your time and needs. I would highly recommend it."
1258,A. SAEED,"April 21, 2020",5," It is a great app . Duolingo allows me to learn a lot of languages in the same time and in way fun , simple and free . Really I loved it ."
1259,Nodira Tursunova,"April 12, 2020",5, Brilliant and very helpful! It is never boring or difficult to learn a language with Duolingo! I am learning Arabic and I enjoy it a lot!
1260,Jennie Reid,"April 23, 2020",5, Brilliant and fun way to learn a new language or polish up a language you already know. My only criticism would be the lack of speaking involved in the lessons.
1261,moussa traore,"April 26, 2020",4, Horrible. I absolutely despise this app because you have hearts and you have to wait a few hours or so if you have got one heart or less.You could do lots more to improve this annoying app.
1262,Ajewole lois Oluwapelumi,"April 23, 2020",4, It's an amazing app. I can actually understand some Spanish phrases in just four days. I also love the way the idea of a hall of fame.... The hearts needed tho
1263,Fotini Terzaki,"April 24, 2020",4, It would definitely be better if it had some more notes on grammar rules and vocabulary but other than that it is amazing. If you manage to stick to it.
1264,Salla Voutilainen,"April 28, 2020",5, Game-like experience with achievements. Sentences are sometimes funny but that's okay. Kanjis are introduced early on 👍 and all words and sentences can be listened to 👍👍
1265,Tillie Weaver,"April 29, 2020",5," It's really fun, and helps with all aspects of language acquisition: learning vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and word recognition."
1266,Isabelle G.,"April 24, 2020",5," This app is awsome, try to learn a language eith the same alphabet you use in your first language because it doesn't teach you the alphabet of that language. Not knowing the alphabet makes it harder"

1268,Mong Ai Tan,"April 15, 2020",5, Easy to learn. Ads are a bit annoying but tolerable. Friendlier visuals and format of words compared to Memrise. But that is much cheaper compared to Duolingo plus.
1269,Kate,"April 8, 2020",4, Varied range of activities repeating/reinforcing language/learning. The ads are a pain but I can cope with them if it means I can learn languages for free!!
1270,MEIHUI喵喵 SUMNER,"April 25, 2020",5," Perfect for my study for the French,I do enjoy that. The speech is the spectacular feature I have found nowhere else."

1273,Rachel Eberle,"April 29, 2020",5, i like that if you get something wrong it tells you but then works you through it. i also love the selection of languages they have for you.
1274,Joanne Carpenter,"April 20, 2020",4, Love it except for one problem. When the person talks in Italian saying a sentences they talk way to fast and cant understand and have to listen over and over.
1275,Paulene Rodgers,"April 25, 2020",5, Great app really helps you learn a new language step by step and most importantly explains when you make a mistake and gives you the correct version.
1276,Nicholaus Chikovani,"April 19, 2020",5," Perfect app. When you learn new word,you'll meet this word so many times,you will remember it fast.And every exercise is just made to think."

I'm taking French because I've learned it off and on over the years. The lessons are short enough, but detailed enough to make me work. Repetition is key and its helping it sink in. My only frustration is I can't seem to speak it to have the repeat lessons register it, but speaking the language has never been my strong point. Personally I think everyone should try this program. I'm even considering the purchase of a few months."
1281,Mischie Moon,"April 29, 2020",5," Thank you for this wonderful app! Keep it up. And also, I wish there's no hearts so I can learn a lot of languages without stopping. But it's okay :) This is a great app!"
1282,Nicole Ali,"April 28, 2020",4, I like it but I wish it would start from the absolute basics instead of jumping around. I'm not really reviewing what I've learned. I'm trying to learn Japanese.
1283,Sheena Comer,"April 28, 2020",5, Easy to read and understand new languages with helpful pictures and dialogue on saying the words properly. Very engaging for BOTH kids and adults - can't put it down

1287,Tamara Middlebrooks,"April 16, 2020",4, Good app to use if you are familiar with some Spanish terminology. It will introduce you to new words and phrases as you progress in your levels.

You not only learn vocabulary and grammar, you also get plenty of listening and speaking practice. The ads you have to watch for free access are not excessive, mostly demos of other apps."

1290,Shawn Lewis,"April 10, 2020",4," It's great, especially good at keeping you practicing, but if you really want to learn the language, you need to supplement with other learning materials."
1291,Caitlin Mae Cruzado,"April 22, 2020",5, I love it!!! The content and the context of this app is magneficent and I really had a lot to learn by this app and its all free too unlike other learning apps and its pretty useful for students like me... Thanks for creating such an useful app☺️☺️
1292,Y W A,"April 28, 2020",5, Awesome. U can learn lots of languages and the tasks are easy and fun too. The only problem is the fact that u can't learn Thai here. It would be better if there was Thai.

Would also love to see Maori added to the list of languages.
1298,ioli _,"April 10, 2020",4, I started using it to learn Spanish. I'm very pleased with the results. However I'd like to see some kind of dialogue that one would have to translate making it easier to understand Spanish in the real world.

Most words, pronunciation and grammar features are easy for me because I speak other Romance languages. I want to be able to speak Italian. Or, Duolingo is mostly based on learning words and translation. The skills it tries to develop are reading, writing and listening at a low level of course, but not speaking. As a foreign language teacher myself I'm not comfortable with translation at this low level. Students may end up by speaking their mother tongue with foreign words."

1304,Peter Rouse,"April 14, 2020",5, I'm finding this app fun and easy to use. I haven't found out how to go over old levels and re do them yet but it's very clever in the way it helps you to learn.
1305,A J Lagmay,"April 19, 2020",5, I really love it.. But can you please add a Filipino Language? It would be easier for us filipinos to learn other languages using our own languange. We can understand it more specific. Thank you 😊

However the male's pronunciations were hard to understand but the female's was fine especially when the tongue is rolled to say airport.

However, some tips, which greatly help the learning process, are only present in the desktop version (such as for Russian).

1383,Drew Case,"April 19, 2020",5, I really enjoy learning Japanese on Duolingo it helped a lot with my college Japanese 101 and 102 classes. I would recommend it to my friends and family. My girlfriend has started using it to learn French and she likes it a lot also.
1384,Tejas Gudi,"April 19, 2020",4, The app is great but I have a problem duolingo says I have learnt 175 new words in a language please can you add the list of words learnt by us after every lesson. It will be very helpful. Thankyou.

You can track your progress, and learn in different innovative ways."

And another thing which makes it so lovable and easy(ish) to learn (learning a new language isn't that easy) is the fact that it is FREE to install. I mean come on, isn't that amazing! You don't have to pay ANYTHING AT ALL if you don't want to. Seriously, I would 100% recommend this app to anyone who has an interest in learning a language and I can wait to log back on to it!!!"

1471,Paya Asgari,"April 26, 2020",4, It's a good app for everyone but has lots of errors and problems i can bot use it anymore because of those problems. Bust still it's a good app.
1472,Bea Fox,"April 18, 2020",5, During this Covid-19 pandemic's shelter-in-place I thought I would try to learn another language. 5 minutes a day covers just enough information. Reading the tips before each session is a must. Great teaching format!
1473,Katherine Thomson,"April 22, 2020",5, I am really enjoying the French course. It rates you and you collect hearts so you know how you are doing. There are several different teaching methods so it reinforces learning. It's great
1474,Karun Monnappa,"April 26, 2020",5, First of all its free..! I didn't find many ads too..! The speed that u learn with is all up to u..! Great app to learn new lingo..!
1475,Chandra Vaiyapuri,"April 15, 2020",5, It is a great app to learn a new language. It follows shadowing & spaced repetition technique to help a beginner to Learn new language.
1476,Asmita Tondwalkar,"April 23, 2020",5, It is really helpful in learning new language as it starts from basics and gradually keeps on moving if you give even 30 minutes a day you can learn your preferred language in 06 months
1477,Angela Hirst,"April 25, 2020",4," Very good app for learning. The fact that you have to watch ads, to gain hearts to progress very annoying!"
1478,leovaldo ugas,"April 28, 2020",3," I'd give it a five, but the pronunciations of the audio on the part of the program don't sound good. It is requested to repair it as soon as possible. And I'll give you the five stars."
1479,Stefanie Stumpf,"April 25, 2020",3, Good for the basics. Fun to use. Pronunciation a bit weird sometimes but still cool to learn or just keep practicing.
1480,me Crazy,"April 23, 2020",4, Hi I'm a 13 year old who really wants to learn a different language ur app is awesome but I thought it worked offline the ads are enough but it needs data to work. I really do like it please but can it be a bit more clear because I really wanna learn Korean.
1481,Gracelyn Dick,"April 21, 2020",3, They said the app is free but yet as soon as one get a few answer wrong you lose most of the hearts.The adds presented are asking you to give your personal information for something that is unnecessary and are of no importance to me.
1482,neda sajadifar,"April 26, 2020",1, There's no voice to check pronunciation!! And also no microphone. It's really awful.
1483,Sabrina K,"April 19, 2020",4," Would be five but I'm not a fan of the heart system! I've used Duolingo before, by far the best language learning all- I never noticed the hearts so I don't know if that's new but I'm less inclined to use it now."
1484,Gerry McDermott,"April 27, 2020",5, The learning is very well structured. Very easy to absorb at a rate that is very suitable for beginners and inprovers.

1486,Tara Burleson,"April 27, 2020",3," I am enjoying the app. However, you recently added hearts which I really liked, but you took them away. Please add them back."
1487,Tyler Eaton,"April 28, 2020",4," Decent beginner language learning, could do with some adjustments definitely but overall well rounded. Users probably shouldn't expect 100% language proficiency."
1488,Morgan Gelfand,"April 29, 2020",5, This turns learning a language into a game which really makes you want to stick with it. I've been using it every day for over two weeks and don't see myself stopping any time soon.
1489,Brenda Robinson,"April 30, 2020",4, A great way to start learning another language. I like the audible translations so you can hear exactly how it should be pronounced.
1490,Teresa Risso,"April 29, 2020",4," Is fun, active and very useful. Little repetitive from time to time but sure would reccomand with no second though"

1492,Amanda Santa Cruz,"April 17, 2020",5, Amazing app. Hits all learning centers. Works great for me if I use it multiple times daily. Self immersion.
1493,Sharmistha Das,"April 14, 2020",5, It will be helpful if you put different options for practising speaking skills and listening skills in the practice mode.
1494,Retr0,"April 23, 2020",3," I really like it and it has really helped me learn different languages, however a big draw back is that you have limited heart's"

1497,Sarah Warren,"April 16, 2020",5, I have found Duolingo engaging and it has spurred me on to learn. 10 minutes a day is easy to achieve and it is rewarding to see the progress.

1508,Racheal Michela,"April 14, 2020",5," Love it! It is so easy and works in good increments, repeating lessons often so they become more permanent."
1509,Danica Smith,"April 16, 2020",5, Its kinda like a game so it makes it more enjoyable. It does alot of repeating but it helps me to memorize it more.
1510,Maryam Torabi,"April 27, 2020",4, It's a very useful application and easy to use the only problem I have with it is that most of the audio exercises are silent!

One thing the developers might look into though is that in the Spanish lessons it is constantly telling me to ""watch the accent marks"". Since I am using this app on my cell phone and do not have accent marks easily available, this is very annoying. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn a new language. But if you're like me and want to learn faster, augment it with other free resources."

I have progressed way better than i thought i was capable of due to this app and how it teaches. Best of all its free! The only reason why i haven't given it a 5th star is because sometimes i dont understand why something needs to be spoken differently and duolingo doesn't explain these differences. For example, in welsh, there are different ways to say 'the' such as y, yr, and 'r. But duolingo doesnt explain what one is appropriate."

1531,Gracy Kelle Oliveira da Silva,"April 19, 2020",4, It's very useful as you will repeat more or less the same exercises for few time which will help you to memorise the new words.

Several languages can be learned simultaneously if desired. However, the mobile app differs from the desktop browser app in a few ways, most noticeably the use of 'health' points (except when using the Plus version), more speaking exercises in the mobile version, and some differences in the Tips. The mobile app is convenient for French and Spanish (English speaker), but I prefer desktop use for more difficult languages."

I have to agree with others though that it takes entirely too long for your lives to generate back up in the free version of the program. I try to study/play every night at the same time and sometimes can only try to complete lessons with 3 lives. It should not take more than a 24 hour period to get back to full lives. The developers or programmers need to time that better.

The app always thinks I'm done talking if you pause for more than half a second. The app will say that I got it wrong because I failed to say the rest of the words. I was getting to them!

I think these are well done and not too intrusive. For the more mainstream languages the experience is 'throttled' by the use of the hearts. This seems reasonable (if regrettable) because they have to make a living somehow. The paid for version is good value on their yearly subscription. Slight downside is on the Welsh course they are slow to respond to comments or don't.

I only dislike that they removed the parts of speech and tense lessons. i want to review past tense so I can get back to reading novels in French and I can't just go to the past tense lesson."

I like the repetition it provides, because that's the best way to learn. But sometimes I get a little frustrated with the attempts to help after I mark an answer incorrectly, because it drills on the basic rules, particularly for gender, when the error is due to a rule-breaking noun. When that happens, it is really not helpful. Example, one would assume from the rules that ""problema"" is feminine. But rather, it is a rule breakers. S/B specific to error."

Something annoying is if I'm told to translate something I'm supposed to translate it as it is read. When I translate from English to the language it's different. There's also something else I'm forgetting but I lose hearts"

Im learning the language way better than I did in school or on my own. Many people say this doesnt work as a standalone app but I dont think thats true. It does randomly introduce new phrases or words but it gives you clues as to what it means and you can just read the comments after you answer the question for clarification. This is pretty similar to learning a language as a baby where all you have are context clues to figure out what stuff means so I dont mind it.

On the plus side, it is free! Of course there are encouragements to upgrade to the pay version but you can continue without. I think Duolingo's success is due to the way they have been clever at making into a game so my target every day is to get at least 100 points. More interestingly, my wife started before me and once I started, she felt compelled to get more points than me every day! Then the app told her that she was in #3 in current Portuguese learners which motivated her to try even harder! The element of competition certainly does encourage some. On the negative side, I am baffled and discouraged by the order in which the lessons are presented. I have learned the words for ""congratulations"" and ""armadillo"" but have yet to learn how to count to 10 or introduce myself! Surely teaching us things that are immediately useful would be a good motivator to keep going. I feel committed to keep going now but I've started using the Mango Languages app in parallel with Duolingo and it is presenting material in a logical order. Lesser concerns: The speaking exercises are a whole short sentences. There needs to be a ""speak slowly"" option to hear what we have to repeat. Better still, let us learn to speak one word at a time and then put the pieces together! I usually fail at least part of the exercise but generally it lets me pass and I don't get the opportunity to learn how to do it properly. The listening exercise do offer a ""speak slowly"" button so you can hear the individual words and that is helpful. Mango Languages allows you to record your voice and play it back at the same time as the native speaker so you can compare which is excellent. One at least two occasions the correct answer on multi-choice questions has used words that have not been previously introduced so that is super confusing. Finally, it would be nice if there was a ""European Portuguese"" option though I recognize that there are 200 million Brazilians and only 10 million Portuguese so there is less demand for it."
2439,Uzair Islam,"April 15, 2020",4," Love some of the courses (such as French), but really disappointed in the fluency level of non-Western languages like Arabic. Also would really appreciate if they expand their languages to include more non-Western ones like Urdu"
2440,Allison Warren,"April 4, 2020",1, Let me say I LOVED this app. I used it very often until I noticed today that they have implemented this stupid hearts system. I hate every game that makes you wait or buy more once you use all your hearts and I will probably be uninstalling it now. Just ruined it for me.
2441,Neha Mohajer,"April 7, 2020",4, I love the app but sometimes it stops working completely. I had full hearts and yet it wasn't opening the lesson. It showed that the lesson is loading and I waited for 5 minutes before I tried different lessons and none of them were opening. But the app is great!

However, some of the guides are really difficult to understand and the moderators get nasty with commentators, which is very offputting. Also, the lessons are nonsensical.

The robotic voice is good but isn't as useful when it comes to the actual pronunciation.

I've learned a lot so it is still effective in teaching you the language."

The comments under each lesson give experienced learners and native speakers opportunity to answer questions. Would get five stars but I was using the app for months before someone in the comments pointed out there is an entire website with lessons, rules and vocabulary. Why doesn't the app tell us this?"

You just have to make sure you keep yourself learning on your own time too. It makes it like a game and it's super fun and addictive. I'm relearning spanish and it is better than the 3 years I took it in school and plan to learn a few more languages. The only thing is that the pronunciation is a bit off on words and causes some problems. Google helps cure it though. It's very in depth and even has a levels on how to flirt and politics.
2497,Emily Mansley,"March 27, 2020",3, It's a great app. It has helped me to learn french. I chose to pay for the upgrade because you lose hearts too quickly and that's super discouraging. They have a way to earn hearts bit you don't earn enough to continue for long before get to annoyed. The upgrade is way to much as well.

2499,Soft Shoe,"April 5, 2020",5," You get out of this app what you put in. Learning a new language takes effort and no app can do that for you. Having said that, if you put in the work this app helps tremendously. However, I will say the ""placement test"" for a language I am already somewhat familiar with with was way off."

I studied French years ago in school, but never truly absorbed the content like I have with Duolingo. I'm a visual learner who does better with interactive learning. This app is helpful because it fluctuates between practicing speaking, writing, multiple choice and story telling. It offers tips before your lessons & knows what concepts you need extra practice with by incorporating follow up questions for words/grammar that you incorrectly understood. 💯🌟"

2506,Ellen King,"March 17, 2020",4," Useful introduction to languages, the feeling of playing a game makes it fun but can be deceptive - I think I've learned more than I have, when actually I've just learned how to match certain words/characters without getting the meaning.

After a while, one just starts to think in the language. Some issues in variable pronunciation which may reflect actual idiomatic use.

In Arabic, firstly, the app needs to teach all the alphabets and phonetics. I had to learn it off the internet to read signage.

With this as an extra practice tool, I have been able to memorize terms and phrases more effectively than I had without it. It's helped me get ahead of my class and I can't praise it enough."
2561,Laura Towler,"April 8, 2020",4, It's fun and easy to use. I don't like when it doesn't tell you phrases and expects you to guess them. It's level 1 I need to be taught. However most of the time it makes sense and sets a quick pace of learning. It really encourages you to log in every day. Although the adverts get annoying.
2562,Donna Allen,"April 10, 2020",4, It's a little simplistic without formal rules....but I suppose it's good to work them out for yourself. (eg. Verb forms.) Good for listening and pronunciation though. I enjoy the lessons and am glad of the constant reminders to practise.

The community-built environment is useful, as there are discussions explaining reasons behind language use and opportunities for in-person practice events and continual content improvement.

The lessons are simple and informative, and I do feel like I am learning a good bit. My only complaint is the different lessons are not really organized in an effective manor and it is difficult for me to learn the conjugations without them telling you beforehand. You are forced to read the same sentences over and over until you find a pattern."

What I sincerely dislike is that if I have just earned hearts before I start a module and the app freezes, I will have one or two less hearts when I stop / re-open the app. It is frustrating. Typically, I stop for the day. If this can be fixed, my review would be 4 or 5 stars. I have a Samsung S9."

2741,shelby prentice,"March 12, 2020",4, Love it. Very engaging. The levels and rewards make learning feel like a fun game. I'm sure the plus version is better. Adds are frequent with the free version. More verbal skills would be great. The microphone takes a long time to work and isn't always accurate.
2742,B E S T L E A F,"March 30, 2020",4, I do like it and whatever is covered is explained very well . It is very repetitive though and I have not figured out yet how to skip certain lectures to jump up a level and make it harder. The reminder system definitely helps in making sure that you stick to learning nearly every day.

2756,Sam Norton,"April 3, 2020",5," It makes learning fun! I love the ""games"" the speaking part, there's a catch though- you must spell each phrase exactly as they are, but I take notes and bc of that I am learning far quicker-so I highly recommend doing that.. but I love this app."

Despite the being an ad every other level, it was an exceptional learning tool, however there are times when it translates someone's back to English weirdly. I was translating ""Tengo un plato de pescado muy bien"" to English and the correct answer was ""I have a very good fish dish."" But, aside from a few... wierd... translations the app was perfect."
2807,Jamie Evans,"April 7, 2020",4, A wonderful and useful app. My only criticism is when you make a mistake it doesn't explain the mistake you made (I.E. using the wrong gendered language) which I think would be helpful. Aside from that though this app is fantastic.
2808,Dimple Selvaraj,"April 3, 2020",2, The app is great but some sounds of the letters are similarly pronounced so it's hard to give the right answer. Once I'm done with a language I try another one. But the former language cannot be deleted. I wish there was an option to delete.

There is no way to completely memorize each lesson before moving onto the next. Back when we were able to repeat lessons I actually learned allot faster.

2814,Hailey Vasquez,"April 15, 2020",5, Its good and all but one thing i hate is when i have to type in the word to translate it and it counts as wrong because i didnt put punctuation.
2815,Sahvanna Chaffins,"April 18, 2020",5, Been using the app to learn Scottish Gaelic. It makes it easy and fun to spend time learning another language. Same allure as playing a time-wasting game but with a better reward.

2821,Bela,"April 20, 2020",3, It emphasizes memorization over any helpful hints that may be useful when learning a language. A 30-minute YouTube video was enough for me to understand something that I tried to memorize for over a week with Duolingo.
2822,Keyrsh Doodle,"April 19, 2020",4, I like it. It's a fun way to learn. But they need a way to explain the lessons on mobile like they do on the computer
2823,Rebecca Cusato,"April 23, 2020",5, Its amazing for adults too. I've been very entertained during lockdowj learning loads of new skills.

I am disappointed, however, that there are EIGHT sections so far in the French module that cannot be completed due to no answer choices actually being available for the gap-fill exercises. It's quite frustrating to be at the end of an exercise and then have to abandon and lose all of that progress because there's no way to complete the lesson. I can't possibly be the only one with this problem."
2831,Leena Kar,"April 3, 2020",5, Duolingo is the perfect app if you want to learn a language. There are no problems with the functioning and the way the language is taught is sure to keep you reminded of all the words you have learnt. Its main goal is to make learning Free and fun.
2832,GC T. Nazareno,"March 21, 2020",4," Would've been great if you add Latin. And also add an option wherein you look for simeone to chat in order to practice your language. And yeah, can you add a feature where we can save tips offline? And also maybe an option where you can chat with native speakers to practice. That would be useful."

I'm trying to learn as much as I can before my honeymoon in Paris and this app makes it impossible.

2934,Mr Nut,"March 30, 2020",5," It's a great way to learn languages; the heart system is good because once you run out, the practice option enables you to replenish them whilst enhancing your knowledge of previous blocks.

2947,Graeme Port,"April 4, 2020",5, I'm working my way through the Scots Gaelic course on Doulingo. The app is fantastic. It provides useful grammar tips for each level and the activities are fun and work. The extra things like 'streaks' and league tables and points are clever ways to keep your learning on track. And it's free!
2948,Tharun Vignesh,"April 6, 2020",4, The app's great and the activities are fun to do . But a small issue I face is the microphone never works properly (despite me giving it permission) and SOMETIMES the speaker also fails to work. Can you please suggest how to fix it?

It is so easy to study a language with the help of this app. 👌but the only problem is if you make any mistakes you'll lose a life but there are only 5 hearts and if you make 5 mistakes at a time then you will be not able to learn for a few hours. But there is this option to regain a heart by practising option. Nice app . There are not so much adds .good job
3006,Daniz G90,"March 11, 2020",4," It's good but I thought it'll be different not like a game where I need hearts in order to continue, it gets a little annoying because if I mess up several times I get out of hearts and I have to go back and practice, which is good don't get me wrong but that part gets to me"

3010,Gabriele Donati,"March 17, 2020",4," Great for getting familiar with languages. Although there are some mistakes, and it doesn't explain much of the reasoning behind the language. However I do believe that learning a language is mostly based on repetition, and this app is really good for this, if you dedicate your time to it."

3012,Rebecca Knol,"March 27, 2020",5," A really great app so far. I will say the amount of ads in the free version drove me crazy and with two small kids running around just didn't have the time to sit and wait, so I bought the full version. I use it everyday and have quickly picked up my family language."
3013,Jeffrey Lawson,"March 30, 2020",3," Very good start. Stories are great. Could be better with more pertinent dialogue in lessons outside of stories. ""I want a cat"" may be a true statement, but what about: ""Can you give me directions to...."" or ""Why is this price so high?!"""

3020,Nurullo Subkhonov,"April 7, 2020",5, The app is just awesome. I found it quite easy to learn a new language. Anyway it would be better if some more features are added to the friendship content as well as competitions or games or chats with people from foreign countries.

3042,Michael Applebee,"February 8, 2020",4," I like the way Duolingo approaches language from different angles. This allows the user to notice differences in singular and plural or in the use of pronouns. I only wish it could help with pronunciation, but maybe it does and I'm not far enough into the lessons."
3043,David Handy,"March 16, 2020",4," The app is great. It is really helping me to practice my Welsh, alongside my normal lessons.

I stopped using it after about a month because I got a point where I was failing 75% of the time without being given any meaningful feedback as to why as I was wrong. The worst part was that I wouldn't fail out because I'm a subscriber and had unlimited health turned on. So I would spend 30 minutes a day beating my head against an endless brick wall.
3045,Lweendo Chisamu,"April 2, 2020",5," So first, duolingo lets you pick a language. There is spanish, german, french, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish and more. Then after that, you start. Tip: Make sure that you don't make to much mistakes- or you'll loose health and won't be able to play in an hour!"

The tips are great and stories that have been implimented are amazing as well. I ask that more of them be added for languages such as japanese though.

3083,I dont care,"April 16, 2020",5," Very easy to learn as you go. I'm currently learning Spanish so I love how it had the different sections and you can click on the words to review what they mean. Finally, I love the notification about my streak do I can keep it going. Great Learning app!"

3085,Shweta Mistry,"February 13, 2020",3," Is the new update responsible for not being able to drag the words while forming a sentence? Or is it something else? I can't drag the words in an order I want now, and it has become more time consuming. which is not something I want to do, please look into this. And thank you! Cool app!"

I feel It is not really fair on people learning languages with sounds that we don't have In English like Chinese and Korean because the English alphabet does a bad job at representing said sounds. It won't be a problem for people who are at a intermediate level at those languages, But a good majority of people don't commit long enough to get to that level. Not to mention the app asks things we haven't learnt"

I wasn't given the option. I've had no response from either duolingo or google play to resolve this issue. I want my money back.

3094,Sara Sanford,"March 13, 2020",5, I love this app. It has really helped me on learning French in such a short amount of time. And unlike the other apps that cost money after only one lesson this one allows as many lessons with the expense of 5 hearts that recharges after a little bit. 10/10 would recommend

Add some Pehragraps for speaking. Like question ans. You show question and your users give ans by typing. Thanku
3107,Leslie Clark,"April 13, 2020",5," The easiest way I have found to learn French. It includes written, grammar, verbal which many other formats do not. And it is fun, so much so at times it's hard to put down! Thank you to the creators of this wonderful program/ app😊"

That being said,my biggest complain is that in it's Spanish course, it completely ignores peninsular Spanish, and pretends that only Latino Spanish exists, which is a bit insulting to original Spanish, and adding conjugation for ""vosotros"" wouldn't be that hard. The other thing is that the tips for Welsh are not visible accessible via the app."

But I still would recommend this app
3142,Jason Ferland,"April 5, 2020",4," It's good, seems to be working so far but you have to keep up with it every day. Being under quarantine has helped stick with it. I don't like the ads or losing hearts when I make mistakes but I am too cheap to pay."
3143,Shante Flowers,"April 4, 2020",3, I only wish the prices for the plus were a bit cheaper. And for the free section more than just 5 chances to mess up b4 having to wait so long. Wishing they had a reference section for characters or words we have come across already.
3144,Yves Maerien,"February 29, 2020",4," It's pretty fun and easy to learn a language with this. You can take even just a few minutes of your day to do this and feel like you accomplished something.

3153,A Google user,"March 22, 2020",5, Coming into the app already knowing basics like how to read and say the alphabet is a massive advantage. If you're entirely new to the language then you may struggle a bit for the first few lessons but the pain is worth it in the end. An excellent app for all types of learners.

3164,Beata Dorain,"February 18, 2020",2," Very disappointed with the app, waist of time. You can't just skip the easy part and go to your level. Also it checks your English more often than Spanish. I find few apps more interesting like Wlingua where you can select the right level. I hope developers take my comment seriously."
3165,Stephanie Joy Rosalia,"February 19, 2020",3," Automatically playing ads is not a good user experience for me. It always catches me off guard and my heart rate goes up. Not good, Duo. If you need to do this, at least do it with the volume muted so that we're not badly surprised. ☹️"
3166,Ranjon Jonas,"February 29, 2020",3," The app is pretty cool. I like that it involves a lot of exercises to help the learners retain information. The hearts system is kinda ehh tho. Also, the dictionary and words feature are missing and I really like those features. I hope those features get implemented into the app."

And as advertised, it is fun and free! You can pay extra for the plus version to get rid of ads and to get quizzes, as well as some other additional things I'm sure. I am simply using the app in it's freest form and it is still a handy tool. Can't wait to try other languages!"

I had to relearn some things Rosetta Stone taught me because I inferred the meaning wrong. I've learned a lot more in a shorter time with Duolingo than with Rosetta because of this. It also gives you a second button that slows down what the speaker said, which is nice when trying to decipher what a fast talking native is throwing down."

3235,Rob Craig,"March 20, 2020",5, Very intuitive. Has changed my life beyond measure. The setup is loosely like a video game letting me transition away from just games as my hobby. I am not sure if it is just me but i find it easy to understand yet still challenging and fun!!!
3236,Valentina Ramírez,"March 18, 2020",5, I really appreciate that it's for free. It's very fun and the tips are the best grammar short lessons of any language. I like it that it pushes you to keep it up if you're competitive enough to practice everyday just to keep your name on the top of the leagues.
3237,Laurie Boese,"March 23, 2020",4," I have an upgraded version, so I can always be sure to play without running out of hearts. I'd love more stories, and more opportunities to practice my pronunciation. All the same, happy with my progress. Would buy a Duo action figurine for my desk."
3238,Zoe Parsons,"April 1, 2020",5," I love Duolingo! I like that there are different options used to learn... translating, listening and speaking to give you the whole spectrum. The repetition helps things ""stick"" and it doesn't move you forward too quickly."

3242,ER,"April 5, 2020",4," Amazing for free to be fair, however, there is no way of learning a languages structure or meaning behind pronunciation etc.. You would be able to read a language but not be able to converse with ease due to these limitations"

Both sites could do with increasing the pronunciation of not just the selected/correct option but each of the alternatives.In that way my vocabulary would expand more readily. Comparing the two sites, Scottish Gaelic is by some way rhe better site by virtue of being non punitive - no loss of hearts for typos or distortion by predictive text. It is also streets ahead in terms of assisting learners with pronunciation."
3255,Norman Padmore,"March 29, 2020",4, It's fun but it`s work. With consistency you will learn. And keeps reminding you to practice. It`s a good app. I enjoy the fact that I'm learning at my own pace. You'll only get out what you put in. Have patience it will get better

Great app though"
3309,Miljan Djukanovic,"April 2, 2020",1, Horrible app. Too many grammatical errors.

3333,River,"February 21, 2020",4," Mostly I love this app. It's fun and helpful. But I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's getting more and more frequent that it says I'm typing in english when I'm definitely not, and I can't get past it so I have to abandon the lesson and start over. Really getting on my nerves."
3334,Bone Tee,"February 29, 2020",5," Love this app because it teaches like a person learned their mother tongue(s) . While you can find ""the rules"" if you want or need help to understand, Duo teaches you to learn what sounds right. The repetition schedule and additional practice keeps learning fresh!!!"
3335,Dakota Hamilton,"February 12, 2020",4," I like this app, its simple to use for learning different languages and gives you insensitive not to mess up, but throws you in the deep end a bit (which I like). I don't care to much bout the ads they can be annoying after a bit tho."

3354,RiiceBe4nZz,"April 1, 2020",4, It's a fantastic app if your looking to learn or start to learn another language the only problem that bothers me is the lives when you are learning you are bound to make mistakes I dont think 5 lives is enough maybe 10 but otherwise no complaints.
3355,Gi Ga,"April 3, 2020",3, Its a great game but it would not let me make a username at first it said I already had an existing username but I did not so thats why I give it only 3 stars.

3356,Navya Rajarama,"April 11, 2020",5," Amazing app which teaches you languages from very basic. Very easy and fun way to learn a new language. Great going, but I also feel the pro charges are on the higher side."
3357,Danilo Caruso,"February 12, 2020",5," I've been hooked to this app for more than a year. The best way to learn a language in an interactive way. Only downside is that learning through Duolingo is not as quick as you might expect, but you do slowly notice you've made improvements over time."
3358,Leigh Trelaine Farrow,"February 19, 2020",5," Super awesome free app with ads (paid for add free and additional content) for expanding your knowledge of a tonne of languages!

3359,Alison Cromey,"February 27, 2020",4, Just began using this app. Already love it. It's quite addictive. And reassuring - because you practise a topic using various different methods before moving on. Effective and enjoyable and the best part is you are achieving something...getting better every day.
3360,Lauren Brazeal,"February 7, 2020",4, Great for brushing up on a language if you already know a lot of it and are rusty. Its also great to learn basic conversation skills for tourists.

I do supplement with video. Since my initial review I have started formal Chinese classes at a University. Duo remains an important was to stay ahead."
3402,Louisse Y.,"April 6, 2020",5," Awesome app. Very efficient in teaching a new language. Gracias, Duolingo. I love that the new update added stories in it. Opens up a lot of new things to learn in a refreshing way. 🥰"

I hadnt been on in awhile but I decided to learn some french. They're trying to get to buy ""unlimited"" (monthly fee) and if you dont, than you dont get ""unlimited hearts"" in other words theyre limiting how much you learn beacause you only get 5 untill you buy more. Im giving this 1 star and unless you want to PAY for an app that was made so you could ""learn a language for FREE"", DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!"
3404,z f,"April 11, 2020",5, The sound of this app is completely gone! Could you please fix this problem? Thanks in advance.
3405,Dan Damian,"February 15, 2020",5, App doesn't crash and it is probably the best free app out there. Suggestion to include Serbian or Croatian and Filipino/Tagalog would be in high demand. I like the simple menus and how the progress is achieved through lessons without mistakes. Highly recommended!
3406,Kathleen Morris,"February 24, 2020",4, It is an interesting way to learn a language. I think it tends to skip some grammar rules which are fundamental. The stories are excellent for learn the language and increasing vocabulary plus they are much more fun than the lessons.
3407,Lucy Joachim,"March 25, 2020",3, Great for learning but only 4 days after downloading I am experiencing a bug where it is not picking up my voice for the speaking tests . It loads for a while then starts again. I am also paying for premium! I hope this gets fixed soon.
3408,raha ahoopai,"March 26, 2020",3," It was the best app until the recent update , I can't hear most voices any more and the exercises don't load properly half the time and it takes a while to take me to my exercise. The app was wonderful in the previous versions."

Czech used to have Tips & Lessons for each session so that one could have an idea before going into the exercises. But now the Tips/Lessons for Czech have completely disappeared and we are faced with exercises about things we do not have any information about. How do you think we can learn a language like that? The Tips are there for German. Why have they been removed for Czech? This kills our interest in using the app.

But some of the ads that you all show are very inappropriate. I understand that you can remove ads if you pay for premium. But some people do not have the funds to pay for premium. But in the meantime you all need to censor your ads Me or my child does not need to see a homosexual man laying in the bed in his underwear. As a ad for prep with HIV.
3412,Gail Walter,"April 2, 2020",5," Absolutely brilliant, could do with more hearts😉, but you learn in a steady way, learning the basics first. Leader board helps if you are motivated by competition."
3413,Annelie Stephenson,"April 3, 2020",5," It nicely builds on each lesson. It's annoying when you run out of hearts (from each mistake), but by then its time to get back to work anyway. Tempted to buy Duo Plus soon."
3414,LaKeshia Bryant,"April 8, 2020",5," So far, this app has helped me get back to the basics of learning a new language and keeping it up. I work on my skills with daily quizzes and harder content to enhance my linguistic skills. It keeps me focused"
3415,c philly20,"April 13, 2020",4, I have been using Duolingo now for a few years. I quickly noticed within a short period of using this site just how effective it was. Duolingo enables you to learn at your own pace illustrating step by step guidelines every step of the way. I love this app.

Only been using Duolingo for about 6 months to learn Spanish. Took 4 years of German in high school and never was this easy.

Would definitely give it 5 stars then.
3417,The Catholic Cabbage,"March 11, 2020",4," Very good language trainer, keeps you motivated very well. I wish certain things were better explained. Sometimes the examples are too similar and I end up making certain errors (hard to explain) but all in all, I like it."
3418,offonoff,"March 18, 2020",1, After the latest update this app is worse. It has more ads popping up every once in a while. I don't get the XP I should get and some of the translations are exactly the same with the one I gave but still they are counted as wrong.
3419,Leo Verheggen,"March 4, 2020",5," Amazing, I hope they will add serbian. Great app for learning words and basics I heavily reccomend talking online with people who speak the language you want to learn or visit places because it's important to really really learn. Though the app does everything it can and does it very well."

3422,Jeremy Cortez,"April 23, 2020",5," I've taken a couple of Spanish classes, and I have to say this is a great way to stay in practice. Learning a language is a process that you have to actively put time into on a regular basis, and this app allows me to do just that."

3432,Priyanka Gupta,"March 29, 2020",1," This app is faulty. It doesn't give option to change language right now. All 4 icons at top are not functioning anymore. Crowns, stake & lingots too not working. When I click on Alphabets all it does is breaks egg and doesn't. Plz fix this app issue/bug/glitch. And I tried restarting my phone."
3433,Collin Welch,"March 10, 2020",3," Overall Positive but could use a few tweaks. The biggest is that the lingers have essentially no use outside of the three ""owl outfits"" and the ability earn more of them. It would be useful to update the shop for more useful items like buy quizzes or the plus features."
3434,Amie Love Lee,"March 5, 2020",5, I love the stories! I do wish that the bots feature was still an option. It's amazing when I practice my knowledge with friends and I realize that I've actually retained information from this application. I'm very pleased!
3435,Aida Malekoltojari,"March 20, 2020",5," I really like this app. Sometimes when you make a mistake, it gives you a little lesson (like for verb conjugation or grammar) and I wish it would do those at the start of each lesson because I randomly stumble on them and find them really insightful."

3458,Luther Schalk,"February 18, 2020",5," I wouldn't mind a technical part of the app in which users could look up things like vocabulary, grammar, and conjugations, but this is the only thing missing. I think it's a great tool for adults with limited time and attention available to expend."
3459,Matias Ulvatne,"February 18, 2020",5," The only issue I have with this app is that it keeps pushing me when I have no motivation, but ultimately, I'd say hat is also a good thing, since keeping a streak often feels more important than watching another episode or scrolling Imgur for 10 more minutes."

If they remove the heart system I will bring my rating up to 4 or 5 stars
3464,Artie,"February 24, 2020",3," I'm frustrated with the app. It is constantly cutting off audio at the end of sentences, where I have to replay audio a few times to hear the entire sentwnce. Can the devs please fix this?! I dislike that I was forced to move to the hearts platform too."

3476,Tonyaa Leist,"March 30, 2020",5," Fantastic way to learn a new language! I really like the varying ways of repetition to help the words stick. Not only do you learn to speak, but read and write the new language, which is helpful. Look forward to my daily lessons!"

3478,Sappho Culloden,"April 1, 2020",3," I like aspects of this app, but l feel there is too much reliance on the learner extrapolating when a word is used and why. Learning Latin was frustrating when the app didn't explain when it is habitas and when it is habeo, for example."
3479,Denise Meredith,"April 2, 2020",4," Good, but it's Brazilian, not Portuguese. The pronunciation is different, as are many ordinary, conventional words. I thought I might brush-up on modern usage, but sadly, this is not to be."

3492,Morgan Mallow,"March 19, 2020",1, I dislike how if you get something wrong it gets rid of a heart which leads to less time learning the language and more time waiting for the hearts to refill. If you could get rid of the hearts and just make it unlimited learning it would be really great.

3494,Kristen Hibbs,"February 14, 2020",4," I think the app, content, and repetitive learning approach are effective in helping me learn Spanish. The pop up ads can get annoying, but always come up at the same time, so it doesn't interrupt right during the lesson."

3496,Ashley Ramon,"March 14, 2020",4, I have recommended this app as it was recommended to me by my fiance. You can practice even if you're not subscribed. Waiting 4 hours per heart isn't too bad considering I feel fried after practicing for 20-30 minutes. It's always good to practice moderation.

Literally 5 days of this app taught me more Spanish than 12 years of school. The only cons are that the leaderboards can distract you and take your focus off the language.

3503,Sami Ma,"March 4, 2020",5, Really awesome... Loved it a lot... I think it made by professionals because of the programme.... And everything. But we missed the pronounce tests... I don't know why they took it off! Hope they put it again... Otherwise everything is good.... Thanks alot

After the first month of using it I did a review of how much I'd learned and found that the only thing I'd learned with 28 days of continuous learning, I'd only learned how to say just a few easy French words like ""cheval,"" ""homme,"" ""garcon,"" and ""pizza""! I really wouldn't recommend Duolingo to anybody but a mildly prodigious preschooler."

3506,Wendy Nelson,"March 21, 2020",4, I love this app. It is great for learning different languages and has helpful reminders that you can turn off. The plus edition is awesome too. It is still the exact same app offline except for the fact that you can't open the store.
3507,魔法 自然Mahou Shizen,"March 28, 2020",5," It's fun, but it has a weird way of teaching new stuff, because they ask ""translate this to English"" when I sometimes learn a new word I don't know. Also, sometimes the audio doesn't work. But its easy and fun!"
3508,Hannah Sophie,"March 27, 2020",3," Another app sold out, this was a great app until you've now to got to wait for lives to refill if you get a few questions wrong (which you will if you're a beginner) 🙄. It also has loads of ads unless you pay for the plus version. Really disappointed 😔."
3509,Mary Alavi,"February 18, 2020",5," this app is really great and helpful but the new version has some issues, the voice that reads the letter isn't played in some devices... and it got really slower! i hope these would be fixed in the next update."
3510,Karen Knight,"April 2, 2020",4, Love using Duolingo. I really am learning another language (Russian). Just wish when it comes to when I have to speak it that they had a speaker button that slowed it down. Its had to heard how each word sounds.
3511,Bryden Davis,"April 5, 2020",5," Easy and fun to use, with good pronunciations and images to match the nouns. Voice recognition could be a little better but overall a fantastic app and I highly recommend."

3515,tapatioboi 21,"April 23, 2020",5, This is an amazing app i love it because now i can have full convos with my family from mexico without sounding odd when speaking. Just something to consider is i wish they had the aztecs language nahuatl because id love to try and leanr that language as well
3516,كمالا خيربك,"March 27, 2020",4," Its an amazing app , but the only one thing which really bothering is that if i lost hearts i must wait for hours ti recharge them again.

3517,Vanita Ramaiya,"March 13, 2020",4," Love this app, learning a few different languages, adds are a bit annoying but you have an option to pay for no adds. The sentences could do with focusing on basic language used when visiting the country but, good for learning different languages."
3518,David Bowles,"February 11, 2020",5," Awesome stuff, works wonders and is just as fun as a game if you learn to use all the features..I'm actually getting somewhere with my German ..finally ! After 10 years of talking about learning German And it's so fun I took on another challenge... Russian!!!"
3519,alisha welch,"April 11, 2020",5, It's actually free and and if you invite friends to the app you get a week of plus free but you don't need it. If you are trying to learn a new language then go on doulingo the also have great goals you can set for yourself with a wide variety of lessons.
3520,Kay M,"March 16, 2020",1, The most recent update has introduced auto playing video adverts with the sound automatically turned on. These are incredibly distracting and often very loud.

Only thing I would like with the Hebrew course is speaking exercises like they do with the Spanish course. Love it, thank you. xxxxx"
3522,Stephen Moss,"February 10, 2020",5," Great for someone who wants to learn a language but at your own pace , easy to use. I hope that they can also add European Portuguese to their list but it is only Brazilian Portuguese there at the moment. And it is not spoken on the continent."

3524,Pineapple Claws,"March 18, 2020",5," It's awesome! It's easy to understand and it's fun! Most free apps to help learn languages is boring and laggy, but Duolingo is amazing, for learning and being entertained! Download if you want to learn fast, or want a good program that is free!"
3525,Rita Keegan,"March 20, 2020",5," Great to learn the correct pronunciation and I like the way the spoken phrases speed up as you learn more (although sometimes I have to use the slower phrasing!) Even when I feel like giving up I'm encouraged to keep on, love it"
3526,Gabriella Torres,"March 27, 2020",5," Learning French has always been a bit daunting to me, however when I started using Duolingo, the challenge became much easier to tackle. I love the format and how it combines vocabulary with grammer in a fun and simple manner. This app has become part of my daily routine!"
3527,Charlotte Mackay,"March 29, 2020",5, Absolutely fantastic app. Did GCSE Spanish 5 years ago and wanted a refresher and to take it further. I wish I'd had this back then. It's addictive!!! If you are considering getting it then please please do!!!! I couldn't recommend it more. So so easy to use and fun with a good pace and helpful tips
3528,Bernice Leung,"February 24, 2020",4," Personally I think Duolingo is effective and fun to use. However, something that has gotten me really frustrated is that you simply CANNOT change your email. Being able to change emails is super important as you will need it when you lose your email or no longer use/have the email."
3529,Monique Goddard,"February 26, 2020",4," I am having a really good experience with this app, because I used to be fluent in German, very many years ago and it is excellent at jolting my memory. I am not sure it would be so good for a total beginner, hence the missing star."
3530,Steve Hood,"April 9, 2020",5, Good for getting started with a language. The 'game' style helps keep motivation up
3531,Dragomir Cristina,"March 1, 2020",5," It is an excellent learning app. Duo, the owl, encourages you all the time. The app has several motivational tools whenever you achieve a new goal. The levels are well calibrated. Once you finished the first level you just cannot wait to start the next one. Great app!"

3537,Cookie K Playz,"March 26, 2020",2," I would rate this higher but, the hearts system is completely useless. Once you mess up and lose all of your hearts, its a useless and boring game to have. And waiting 4 hours to get them back?! Outrageous! The hearts system should be eliminated."
3538,Sammie Marie Stent,"April 5, 2020",5, Excellent! Especially now that i have all the time on my hands due quarantine. The app makes you competitive against other people and it does bombard you with too much content that you dont know!
3539,Bharath kumar,"April 6, 2020",3," It could be nice if the voice is more natural. Since it's going to be finite set of sentences, it would've been more natural to pre record actual Dutch voice and playback it."
3540,Darren Smith,"April 8, 2020",5," So easy and great fun. Learn at your own pace with lots of activities to keep you going. It's persistent, you'll definitely learn! There's no add ons, no extra charges. Enjoy"

3551,Erik Faue,"March 3, 2020",3, Very fun to use. However I was charged for my second month of Duolingo plus then cancelled it so I wouldn't be charged for a third. Then it didn't let me use Duolingo plus anymore even though I paid for 2 months. I should still have 20 or more days left.

3556,Lilly Diaz,"March 23, 2020",4, This is an amazing app and i am finnaly being able to understand and talk to my family! The only reason for the last star is all the emails they send me and notifications i get. But very user friendly and easy to use. The format is great. 9/10
3557,Martha Leigh,"February 16, 2020",3, It's very addictive and the repetition is a good way of learning.I enjoy it. The hearts system is rather irritating because if you run out and want to carry on you have to practise by going back to very basics which seems like a waste of time.

3559,Sari Pashko,"February 10, 2020",2, New update is horrible. When it asks you to type an answer the space where the words go is covered by the phone's keyboard so you can't see what you're tying. It didn't used to be like that. Hoping I can roll back to the previous version
3560,Kathryn McDaniel,"April 2, 2020",5, I like the rate at which Duolingo teaches and I like learning a bit about multiple languages at once. The interface is really user friendly and it's help me communicate with my foreign friends.

I use it personally but also assign work for my French and Spanish students as extra credit to increase their input in the language of study. The only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because there have not been any speaking activities for Arabic to date after 60 straight days of work AND the listening activities don't always produce sound so I have to skip them - whether on my phone or computer. Big bummer! Hope this gets fixed soon.

3567,Holly Platt,"March 31, 2020",5, I have only been on the app a few days but it seems set up well and a good way to learn. It allows me to go pack and practice and does not allow me to move forward before I have learnt the following step so as to not be rushed in learning. 👍🏻
3568,Justin Rohrbaugh,"March 26, 2020",5, This app is great. If learning a language was this fun in school I would've learned a lot more. I love that it is totally free. If you make too many mistakes you can either wait until you earn more hearts or practice what you've learned and earn more.

3584,Enis Erem KIYMACI,"February 17, 2020",4, The app is really helpful especially for beginners. There are some mistakes that should be fixed but the real problem is it becomes too easy for long term users in English. We need harder and more complex lessons.

The annunciation is terrible in the audio verging on deliberately misleading. The heart system destroyed it. Keep creating accounts until you don't get the heart system. It makes it impossible to progress and every spelling mistake or autocorrect fail becomes rage inducing."
3589,Pink Panda,"March 12, 2020",5," it's a very good app to learn a new language. I love how there will be a motivation message whenever I did well or when i keep answering wrongly. Overall, i will recommend this app to people who wants to learn a new language!"
3590,Nidhi Pandey,"April 18, 2020",4, The best language learning app I've ever come across. I love it for it's user friendly and fun UI.

My friend without is able to study for much longer at a time than me because I was lumped with the heart version. I've gotten to a point where it's getting trickier and the heart system is really stunting my progress. I'd start a new account to roll the dice on getting a non heart account but I'm too deep.

3595,Nargis Jamal Malavi,"April 1, 2020",3," Works really well. Very easy to use. Downside - Since it works on a gaming module, it takes FOREVER to move from one level to the next. So you could be stuck on a level for ages and finally lose interest."
3596,Abby J,"February 23, 2020",5," Uh, this app is pretty epic, and just after like two weeks of using it, I now recognize more words in the language I'm learning and can have very limited conversations and can like ask where the bathroom is and stuff which is a lot more then I knew before downloading doulingo"

If you want to learn a new language, I think this is the best and most accessible way to do it. A heads up to the creators on one of the lessons; Italian -> Verbs: Present 1 -> Level 0 -> Lesson 7, it is almost completely filled with previous challenges from a different level. The only new verb was 'to finish' I think. It highlights words like 'scrivi' as if it is a new word. I'm sure this is a bug. Or am I missing something?"
3598,Kai Kasvin,"April 26, 2020",5," Easy to use, love I can learn at my pace unlike a classroom."
3599,Suzzette Haye,"March 5, 2020",5," Fun, interactive and competitive. The best language app that I have used so far. Facilitates reading, writing, listening and speaking of the language your learning! Even has a podcast and additional learning material through website."

3602,Meredith Hilt,"April 3, 2020",4, Great but could be frustrating for younger children since the free version only lets you make 5 mistakes at a time. Also wish the app could switch between accounts so siblings could share a device. Loving it though.
3603,James Johnson,"April 5, 2020",5," Fantastic app with all the basics of many of the languages you desire. If it does teach you it, you will learn the basics that will allow you to go forth a develop yourself from. Highly recommend."

I needed something to do during quarantine so why not learn a language and come back to work with some extra skills! I started Italian 3 days ago and I can't believe how fast I'm getting it. This app teaches you at the perfect pace, I did get suckered into paying the monthly subscription just because there is no ads. But hell of a lot better than spending $50 an hour on a tutor. As long as you've got the motivation and persistence, this app has the perfect platform to begin. Happy!"
3605,RacingSteel,"March 31, 2020",5, Cool easy way to learn a new language. I like the short easy to follow lessons. A cool feature is that you can view feedback from other students and some experts aswel.
3606,Jack Kinney,"April 1, 2020",5," I've really been enjoying learning German, but I wish there were a ""?"" option for when you get something wrong, so instead of memorizing it, you'll better understand WHY you were wrong."

3611,Maria Lourdes Steiner,"March 10, 2020",5," I enjoy using Duolingo. The simplicity, ease and short exercises make it enjoyable and a good way to either brush up what you already know or learn a few new words or phrases. It is great as a supplement and would recommend it."

3618,James Burt,"April 8, 2020",4, It's a great app really enjoying it... Only reason I didn't give 5 starts is but have noticed some errors in the English which make learning a new language based a little more tricky than necessary. Would recomend have a native English speaker review content.
3619,b k,"April 2, 2020",2, Not happy with the way invites are updated in account. I have sent invites to friends and they have joined using the link. But it's not being updated in the account. Plus feature cannot be activated due to this glitch. So 2 star

I havent gotten far, at one point I dropped the app altogether from being heavily discouraged by the ranking system- it wasnt fair, as youd be against people that are just using languages they already know for more points or just dont sleep, or s o m e t h i n g, theres no point anymore because of them.

I started out of curiosity to see just how I'd get on because I was never that good learning languages at school and have always had such admiration for bilingual people. Within a few days I was quite hooked. From the early stages, the repetition of basic verb forms & words into sentences with different pronouns and situations reinforces the grammar of the language gently, completely and enjoyably. I'm onto my 3rd language now. Thank you so much Duolingo"
3644,Jazlynn Q,"March 10, 2020",5," Absolutely great! I love that the app is free and makes learning a new language fun and easily understandable. Plus! The very short and skipable ads are great, thank you for not making us sit through long video ads when using the app. I highly recommend."
3645,George parker,"March 17, 2020",5, Extremely useful and indeed the best application you can ever experience. I think that the implementation of a subsection to exercise and repeat the previously learned words in any skill can make the language education more deep and brains more powerful !!!💪😎
3646,Jatin Sharma,"March 29, 2020",4, It's a great app but can be better. If it would have a feature to chat with the different people in different languages then it will help to learn any language in a very exciting way by making new friends and this app will become the best.

3651,Sophia Potter,"March 3, 2020",5, The lessons focus on certian words so it is easier to learn each word. You can always do a lesson even shen you run out of hearts because you have a practice heart. Amazing graphics and controls. Even accepts misspelled words but not too far off obviously.
3652,Edwin Shaji,"February 19, 2020",5," Many apps make u subscribe after a lesson or two, here almost everything is free perfect for those who cant spend money but still want to learn spanish for school, travel or any other reason.

3655,Agata K.,"April 7, 2020",2," The app to learn languages is not bad, but I would more recommend the website. There is no dictionary in the app or neither the site with words you have learnt. It has only courses. Website has much more things and is easier to use."

3657,Cynthia Sperry,"March 7, 2020",3," The free part is very time limited. You can only go for a short time or make very few mistakes before your ""hearts"" are up. You then have to wait or pay. But the actual activities are good - just not really free"

3671,Justin McKay,"March 19, 2020",3," Besides being a paid app that poses as free, it's pretty decent. Video advertisements are very annoying, some inappropriate. If you make five mistakes in a day, you must take a 12-24 hour break. This is disappointing, considering the app title 'learn languages free'."
3672,Susanna Kelland,"March 1, 2020",5," First couple of days in feel like it's leading me in the right direction, feels very intuitive. And 60+ days I can see progress and still so much fun. Raced someone to the promotion zone today, and got to the next level by seconds!"
3673,dehj,"April 3, 2020",3, Too many ads! Bring back the ad banners rather than play a whole ad in the middle of learning. This really discourages people to continue once they've gotten in the groove.

3682,Sally Williamson,"February 14, 2020",1," Why can't I set a new profile? Trying to set up a profile for my 8 y.o. son but the app keeps hanging on registration screen. When i restart it says we've already registered but then doesn't let us sign in. Cant progress without a profile, thus rendering the entire app. useless."
3683,Kisho Sakuta,"February 18, 2020",4," Great app for practicing phrases you've already known or learning new ones. Unfortunately there isn't much of explainations (""why it is like that, why you use it like that in this case"") so you need to find out yourself."
3684,Sandra / Sam Carson,"February 15, 2020",3," The app is not free and though I was okay with the ads, I wasn't expecting to sign up for a free/ then paid version. The constant reminders of how well you're doing, then told you don't have enough hearts to proceed is contradictory. Strange concept to me."
3685,John Wallace,"February 18, 2020",4," I'm not finding this easy, but that may be because it's been a long time since I used to memorise lots of new stuff, and I've reached an age where my short-term memory and wordpower are not all they used to be. I don't blame the app for that!"
3686,Michael Grant,"February 21, 2020",3," Great however it really needs an option to speed up listening/writing excercises. It's super annoying to be typing faster than the voice is speaking and thinking a sentence has ended only to find out it's slow to pronounce ""and"" in between clauses."
3687,Marianne Hughes,"April 7, 2020",5, It makes learning fun. It repeats lessons you don't do well on until you've mastered them. I enjoy learning both the correct spelling of the language and the language itself. Reading the language was an added benefit for me.

I came to know about this app through BBC article on the creator of this app, hats off to the whole team. It is requested to kindly include either Urdu or English to English option so that more people can get benefit from this. Thanks"
3689,Matt Taylor,"April 9, 2020",5," Great fun firstly, but also great for helping you remember phrases with the repetition and mixture of writing/reading/speaking. The format is ace, with different leaderboards to keep you motivated!"
3690,Bentar Nuur Robbikah,"March 7, 2020",5, Great for language learner! The team behind does really know how to teach language. And the best part is: we can get the most benefit of the app though we don't pay anything (keep aside the ads). Keep up the good work!

Unfortunatly app is getting too fraustrating bc of this errors.The only good part was this stories that after new update had disapeared!
3692,Jem DemonBelle,"March 9, 2020",5, Feels more like a game than a language learning tool. Which makes it super fun and easy to use. After a week of using it I managed to decipher a small passage in french. It was great. I cannot recommend duolingo enough.
3693,Molly Canwell,"March 4, 2020",3," I would like the learning to include more explanation, and less mindless memorizing. I want to understand what I'm learning, not just practice things until they stick. That may just be personal preference, though- overall, a great app."
3694,Joseph Faria,"March 11, 2020",5, Great app for learning basics into languages! Of course you need to put effort into it if you really wanna learn. It's of practical use and the premium enhances your experience. Recommend to anyone who wishes to get started into becoming bilingual or polyglot.
3695,Steve Hindmarch,"March 15, 2020",1," Ok, this is now one star to get your attention. I cannot use the bug report tool in the app. The Captcha does not work, you cannot click it. Once I have filled the description I can only see and edit the first few lines as there is no scroll in the box provided."
3696,Emily Moore,"March 19, 2020",5, This is a wonderful tool for learning a language. The format is multisensory and has levels that increase in difficulty and content. I homeschool my two (middle school age) kids and we all actually enjoy using it!
3697,Oliver gamer pro,"March 22, 2020",4," It's very good app but it's have some bugs example: it's said translate this sentence ""the men drink the water"" (English-italian) I wrote ""Gil uomini bevono l'acqua"" and it's correct but it's said it isn't correct and in correct answer wrote my translate :/ I can send you screenshot!"
3698,Stefan Lukić,"March 18, 2020",5," Super-useful app. I am using it for about a week and planning to buy premium account. I think that you can make really stable base for any language. Plus it's interesting with a lot of tips. Great job, Duolingo team!"
3699,Lori Barger,"March 15, 2020",5, I enjoy the set up of DuoLingo and have learned a little but if several languages through both the app and the computer method. I have taken the German course more seriously than the others and have learned quite a lot. DuoLingo go is an enjoyable way to learn the basics of many languages.

Duolingo helped my husband and I learn some Spanish before going to Spain. It's fun and entertaining, and very encouraging. We used it several years ago and then came back for more recently. The app has been improved and is even better! There are stories to read along with, nice and easy and just at my level. The podcasts are true stories in Spanish, very challenging for this beginner, but they immerse you in the sounds of Spanish, and make me want to learn more. High marks!!"
3701,Sunny bacon,"March 17, 2020",4," Love it! Great place to learn! But theres no place to talk to someone if you have a question or problem with the app. (Other than other users). The fact that a forum exists in here kind of disturbs me because its probably going to get infiltrated by pedophiles, which is another issue"
3702,Maylea Howe,"March 29, 2020",4," Very good app, however, I can't seem to sign in or create an account. When I fill out the details and then press 'sign in', it just sits there and loads forever. Thai is really frustrating. Could you please fix this"
3703,Mary Perner,"March 29, 2020",3," I signed up for 5 minutes a day. I do my 5 minutes early in the day and Duolingo pops up that evening wanting more. It's a little annoying. I don't really understand the completion (eg. 4/5) system. I think I have finished a section, but it keeps changing."
3704,Maria Alexandrovna,"March 26, 2020",5," love the app, easy and fun learning. they have a big variety of languages. there are some ads in the free version but they are not annoying and you can skip them after few sec, not like in any other app that I saw."
3705,maressa huff,"March 28, 2020",1, I LOVE the app for helping me brush up on my Spanish 😁. But after a day of using it... The next day it gets stuck on the loading screen 😔 I have to uninstall and reinstall. But I've had it for 2 days I'm going to get tired of the un/re installation process. Please fix🙏🏽
3706,Paulo Lobo,"April 1, 2020",5, This App is great !!! Not only because it's free but also because it's a way to learn a language we need.I've been in Mexico for 2 years and learned the basics of Spanish but with this App I learned a lot more!!! 🇲🇽🌊👌 Rated as an Excellent Rated as an Excellent App!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3707,Max Pulan Jr.,"March 27, 2020",3," App often hangs; does not record progress even if one has already finished one level. Suggested alternative answers take time before being finally accepted. Work also has to be done on languages that use characters, e.g., Japanese and Chinese."
3708,Teall Burns,"March 31, 2020",4, Learning a lot and I find it as fun as a game on your phone. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it has a few bugs. I've reported the bugs and they haven't been fixed but either way I'm still progressing
3709,Nathan Perkins,"March 28, 2020",4, Really easy to use app that is great particularly with regard to vocab and reading. It could have more things on which to spend rubies. I would also probably pay for the app for a one time fee instead of a subscription.
3710,Mr crazy Emerald,"April 2, 2020",5, Makes learning languages fun! You can learn just about any language for FREE! Great for the covid-19 lockdown as you are still learning new languages when you have to stay at home. Awesome! This shows that apps can still be educational and fun!
3711,Rachel Brodie,"April 3, 2020",4, This app is amazing!!!! Im a single mom of 4 littles and I can easily fit in one lesson bc theyre so short and very easy to understand. You're learning but its not like you're trying to learn. It just comes naturally.
3712,Joshua Fraats,"April 2, 2020",4, It's a great app. I love the tips update and I'd love to see regional variations offered as you continue to learn a language. It really is a wonderful app!

Like me; I am persian but my language isn't able there so I have to choose English and can't learn it either
3714,Ben Alexander,"April 3, 2020",4, On and all a good way to learn tye basics of a language. But to really learn to speak a language you must have conversations. The The app could use more drill diversity. An unseen passage to read with questions would be excellent
3715,Roxanne Savino,"April 3, 2020",5," It's a great app for learning!! Only downside is that if you make too many mistakes in one session, you have to wait in order to be able to continue learning. But overall great apl"

3718,Jennifer Lau,"April 10, 2020",5, For mandarin beginner it's really good. I just wish/hope they include Cantonese as well please!
3719,azumi hirochi,"April 12, 2020",2, it is pretty good app but after I use it for the first night I downloaded it. The next morning it won't open...
3720,Sheamus A,"February 26, 2020",5, This is great. I get to learn languages for free. The application is good comparing to others. Makes me feel hommy. Love the story feature!! We all know reading stories when we learn a new language can improves a lot
3721,Infinite II,"April 17, 2020",5, It is a good application for learn other languages. It's too useful.

3724,Narges Tjk,"February 6, 2020",1," it was perfect at first, but it's been almost 2 weeks that it doesnt play any sound. I mean the application doesn't play sentences or words so I can't hear the correct pronunciation. I've installed it again but it didn't help."
3725,Joanna Duell,"February 10, 2020",5," This app is amazing. They have a great system for learning. When you need to earn more hearts you do so by taking quizzes, not just watching ads. It is awesome. I would highly recommend it to someone wanting to learn a language in their free time."
3726,parsa amini,"February 22, 2020",1," Its a really really nice app but it has a problem recently; the listening part is a total havoc, and its not only for my phone; couple my friends got the same problem with your app. I'll be thankful if you fix because it is a good app"

Plus other people get five mistakes but me and my other friends only get 2 hearts so they need to delete this
3730,Patrick Williams,"February 26, 2020",5," Awesome App. Only issue with it is that it gives you hints in the matching portions by highlighting matches. This disengages the brain, and people will learn more from getting the wrong match than from not having to think."
3731,Jayne Lee,"April 12, 2020",5," Great fun, makes learning interesting and not hard work. Love it"
3732,Maté Taixi,"March 2, 2020",3, Teaches the language. Also after having a 180-some day streak I experience that the app is getting more sluggish and slower with time. The buttons for listening exercises often don't work - no audio plays (yes I have the media volume turned up).
3733,Jameson U,"April 15, 2020",5," I have tried books, websites, and countless other resources which I made no progress with but using Duolingo made language learning a breeze!"
3734,Tia Flowers,"April 19, 2020",4, Good. Voice files sometimes seem incorrectly conjugated.
3735,Jenna Miller,"April 2, 2020",5, It is super easy to use and it is just what I was looking for. Most other Korean apps teach you all the formal stuff that you never use but this has a balanced mix of formal and informal.
3736,Carl Tanner,"March 19, 2020",3," I really like this app, however... the heart system is really bad as it limits how many mistakes you can make. If you make to many mistakes, the lesson should repeat questions, but shouldn't just be cancelled. Please change this. Also please add stories to Russian. :D"
3737,Lara Frederiksen,"April 4, 2020",5, Easy to use and fun when you realise you start learning. I didn't see how it could start teaching me Japanese but coupling this with some other methods has already shown a huge difference!
3738,Neelesh Sharma,"April 10, 2020",5," Easy UI and quite interactive way to teach languages. I find it quite easy to learn various languages as they have created simple and yet deep lessons to go through. Good work, team Duo."

3741,Soo Yi,"April 5, 2020",4, Great app but there are no writing exercises. Only translation back into english. I'm aware the apple version has access to writing the different languages so why is there no option on the android version.
3742,Dileep kumar chaudhary,"April 12, 2020",4, It is very nice for beginners to speak English fluently.
3743,Michael Sacco,"March 14, 2020",5, Very good app 👌. I couldn't find an app that was fun to learn and easy to remember. This app is probably the best learning app that l have downloaded so far. It is also super fun to play because my dad speaks some Spanish and it is fun to play with him and also learn from him. BEST APP EVER!

3750,Zarathustra Mcalby,"April 10, 2020",5, Great app! And free! Makes it really fun to learn a language or keep practicing one. But please include a dark mode! And also why not more fun prices for lingots that are way more challenging to get?
3751,Tessa Groenewoud,"March 19, 2020",3, It's easy to use but it is frustrating that you only get 5 hearts which makes your learning process go slow. I understand that it gives extra motivation to do well but it also makes you get stuck in certain exercises.

3754,Sharmaine E.,"March 13, 2020",4," I'm enjoying Duolingo stories and reaching my daily goal easier because of them. It also helps that there are hints and tips in the app. I can't wait for stories in other languages. Maybe even add stories about ""Super Duo"". Keep improving."
3755,RS,"March 9, 2020",5," You should definitely get this totally free app!! It is totally worth the time; in just pretty much two days, I had learnt a whole new range of arabic words. It will give you a good understanding to the language you are learning about, and has an amazing layout!!!"
3756,Aleksandra Dautova,"March 28, 2020",4," Cool application, but it could be better if to add vocabulary into it, so you can check all the words that you've learnt to avoid situations like ""oh, there was some new word, but I forgot which one..."""

3768,Chris,"March 31, 2020",5," Easy-to-navigate menus, intuitive and engaging content that pushes you to do just a little bit more, non-invasive ads. Pretty much the real deal outside of learning a language in the actual country."
3769,Ciara Quinn,"April 1, 2020",4, I don't think you should only be aloud 5 attempts because if your new to the language it's really hard to play and you only end up playing for two minutes. Other than that its quite good for learning new things to do and becoming more cultural.
3770,Mat McDonald,"April 3, 2020",4, Great. Ads are not intrusive which is a change from some other apps and the learning can easily be done at your own pace and is extremely easy to understand and navigate.

3773,Ghosty_Ghost 05,"March 17, 2020",4, I really liked this app. It's a free way to learn languages and it provides plenty of useful lessons. However I wish that there was an easier way to remove courses. Like a remove or reset button. But overall still a good app
3774,Uliana Dmitrovsky,"April 1, 2020",5," Easy, friendly, inviting, even addictive. Like you are playing a game. Phrases stick with you afterwards, like a song. Highly recommend."

3777,FaustyArchaeus,"February 17, 2020",2, Seems like it would be good but there is a system in place if you make too many mistakes you can no longer progress for the day unless you pay. I was learning Chinese and it really turned me off as it is not easy and it will make new users walk away.

3780,Jonathan Frutis,"February 27, 2020",5," Better than Rosetta Stone software in the way that allows an already challenged individual pick up a new language in not only one form of communication e.g. verbally,visually,audibly, fluency in said language is learned almost organically from the gecko. great app, love it!"
3781,Mandy S.,"February 23, 2020",5," I love this app. Im trying to learn Spanish, and its really simple and helpful.

3782,Rayleigh _Rose,"February 28, 2020",5, Really good app. It has helped me with my french lessons at school. Best language app I have used with a wide variety of languages to learn. I would definitely recommend this app to any beginner . It is a fun way to speak and read the language of your choice. Love it!!!
3783,The Kids,"April 25, 2020",1, It is terrible and it keeps on rushing me until I quit and can't deal with it anymore and uninstall the app and restart it and then I just got rid of it
3784,Siam Ahmed,"March 13, 2020",4," Used it for about a week, you can learn a fair amount from this app but bear in mind this will not make you a proficient in your target language. l personally feel you need more in order to learn a new language from scratch. Still a solid language learning app for beginners, and fun at the same time"
3785,SC MP,"March 21, 2020",5," I absolutely LOVE it! Reminders help you to stay focused and keep at the learning, which for me is really helpful! Plus right now, I have A LOT of spare time on my hands, so its nice to be at least slightly productive! Thanks Duolingo!!!"
3786,Gaming with Lamis,"April 2, 2020",5, It is an amazing app i am in the first week and I am learning but there is a small problem is the hearts because if you have mistake it will take a heart from but also an amzaing thin that if you don't hearts you practice to get one and these thing make me understand why they put 5 hearts only
3787,Özlem Çiçek,"April 3, 2020",5," This is really good and improving application. Its french section, there is a parth which include short stories but it is not in italian, ı wish ıt would be in italian part too. Except this, ıt is very joyful. Thanks for the app. 🙏"
3788,Victoria Nowlan,"April 5, 2020",5," I think Duolingo is the best way to learn a new language, if you just take some time to learn it will not take that long. And I like that their adds are not videos they are just a picture"
3789,Henry Spilker,"April 2, 2020",4, I find the online version a little better because the layout is a little simpler and lingots are easier to use-- but I like how you can purchase more things with lingots of the app! Overall a super fun app
3790,John Keeble,"April 5, 2020",5, Very helpful. A clever program that does not need explanations. Very good in helping with listening and saying. I am using it alongside lessons with a teacher and an elementary Spanish teaching book
3791,ashish chauhan,"April 7, 2020",5, A great tool that makes learning fun and easy. The design of the app is very unique and it's interface is very user friendly. I am enjoying learning Spanish these day. Truly it is 'Fun and Learn'.
3792,Vanessa Simon,"April 12, 2020",5," This app is awesome! I was having problems with French in school ,and now I can almost speak fluently. Try duolingo it is scientifically proven to work,and I am living proof of it.👍"
3793,Hannah Cardwell,"April 13, 2020",5, Great to pass time and brush up on other languages. Almost like a game
3794,Ayushi Sharma,"April 11, 2020",3," The app is great but it takes too long to open, the sessions will not open. And if you start a session it will keep saying ""loading......"" but doesn't open"

3797,Julia Witcher,"April 20, 2020",4, Interesting but the hearts run out quickly which is annoying.
3798,Sujit Yadav,"April 16, 2020",4," This is wonderful language learning app, but only for some languages like Spanish, French and German. I like it , but you can make it better for learners of Russian and Arabic in which I'm facing problems. Please Add South Indian language Tamil soon. Thanks Duo 😍🙏"

3802,youssef Soliman,"April 20, 2020",5, It is really helpful... Duolingo makes it look even easier to learn a new language although it's difficult! I recommend anybody who Is looking forward to learn and gain knowledge in languages to give it a try you won't regret !

I can't contact anyone to help fix my streak so what is the point."
3811,Jada Y,"March 1, 2020",5," I wish i had the finances to go pro just so i can support these guys. What a great app!!! As long as you keep going, all the tools you need to speak a new language are there! When i finally get out of this financial strut I'm in, I'm definitely buying. Thank you for your great work! 👍"
3812,Susi Carlo,"February 8, 2020",3," It can be a good app to practice with. The issue I keep coming across is, with some of the question I am answering it correctly but it still marking it wrong. Because of this I can't move on to a new level. Sucks!"
3813,Rosemary Jaques,"March 16, 2020",5," Love Duolingo, I definitely would recommend. There are a few glitches here and there, but overall a really fun app. I've been using Duolingo for just under a year and have loved every moment. It is more difficult if the internet is slow but all together amazing."
3814,Ian,"February 21, 2020",5," A fun and simple way learn some languages. A good use to help remind me of simple vocabulary. Lessons are short and variable, so they don't feel very dry. A lot of emphasizes to get a subscription but if you can deal with the adds it can remain free."
3815,Chris Johnston,"March 15, 2020",4," Overall, it's a very good app, especially for the price of free. One issue I have though is that the voice clips for words and syllables cut out mid sound sometimes. That aside it's great."
3816,Barbara Rauhut,"March 21, 2020",4," Love the repeat of previous lessons without being bored. Keeps me interested to learn more and good to learn speaking, reading, and writing Spanish in same lessons together. Like the format! Could rate to a five star but not that far along yet."
3817,Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis,"March 31, 2020",2," The sentences you learn are very random, and the subjects are uncoordinated, lack a clear structure, and are often incomplete. Plus, the app now started to randomly crash, making it impossible to finish a lesson."
3818,swapnali joshi,"April 1, 2020",5, Love it. Goes at a slow pace which enables learners to learn the language easily. Tips are very useful and helpful. Would like to thank the creator.👍
3819,Sonja Mae,"April 7, 2020",5," Really great app! I have been trying to study Japanese for a while now and everytime I get stuck I come back to Duolingo, they have helped me a lot in my quest to become fluent!"

3822,Desire Johanne Botha,"March 13, 2020",5, Amazing app!! Would be cool if you could download some lessons to study offline and if you could also have the slow motion for the rest of the sections with speech.. Also maybe consider syllables to better pronounce new words.. And have a dictionary on the app..
3823,Kaycee Heemstra,"February 14, 2020",5," Love this game, You can learn sooo much in just 5 minutes, although you only have 5 lives and if you run out you have to wait 4 hours, but otherwise this is an awesome game you can learn a lot of languages. 😊😊"
3824,Dwight Schrute,"February 20, 2020",4, It's a great language learning app but the heart system is kind of annoying when your really trying to get into the game and then it won't let you play until you get more. Overall though I think its an amazing app!
3825,INFERNO GAMER56,"April 6, 2020",4, It is great it has helped me to be able to read Russian and dutch. But I will say it will be difficult to be able to speak fluently in a new language with Duolingo alone but it helps a lot
3826,Ash,"February 16, 2020",4," the app itself is really good but i have a problem. Everytime i reach the matching words part and when i link the correct answers, it does not work. Please fix this as soon as possible. Thank you."
3827,Caitlin Tabbot,"April 5, 2020",5, Great app! The only thing I wish that was added to the all was in the French section. I wish that you were taught the alphabet and what the different slashes and stuff like that meant.

I decided to learn japanese with my boyfriend and his brother and neither of them have hearts on their apps. This means that there is no hope of me actually keeping up with them because they have unlimited mistakes and when I make 3 mistakes I cant continue learning for 5 hours, unless I want to spend money on hearts. Change the heart system and id give the app 5 stars."
3830,R Weeks,"April 21, 2020",5, I am amazed at how quick I was able to pick up basic words and phrases. It makes learning fun.
3831,Marissa Henneberry,"April 8, 2020",5," I love this app, it really help me learn Spanish, but I wish American sign language (asl) was a choice to learn. Other wise it a great app."
3832,Saman Mansouri,"April 13, 2020",5, It is interesting but its better to make it completly free or remove some restrictions

3835,Erna Botha,"February 17, 2020",3," A fun way to learn a language. Combine it with other sources that explain language rules in detail and podcasts and you're off to a good start.

3841,Kimberly Kopoulos,"March 14, 2020",5," It takes a lot of time, because it's thorough. When I switch devices I'm at different levels, so now I can speed right thru beginning levels. And it's not repeating exact material, either!"

3843,Lindsey Graves,"February 26, 2020",3," This is pretty great, way better than I expected. I have noticed that some people have more lessons per level than I do. It is frustrating to see my wife have 10+ lessons in a level and I always get 4"
3844,Brett Hawkins,"February 24, 2020",4," Love the support it provides for conversational usage. I do wish it had a ""classroom"" mode so one could drill particular things (correct genders, correct case, working with idioms/German ways of putting things, etc.)."

I'm learning words I never learned in class & the leaderboards give you motivation to keep earning points, only the top 10 move up a league. I like that it challenges you to practice everyday & complete your daily goal that you set for yourself. I always find myself grabbing my phone so I can learn more on Duolingo! 5 stars!"
3846,Vinay Karthik K Iyer,"March 11, 2020",4," There needs to be an option to set your own goals. I managed to get more than 1000XP in a day whereas the highest goal available is of 50XP. Also, how about a rudimentary messaging option for users to discuss their progress with each other?"
3847,Andrew Welsh,"March 24, 2020",3," It is a good idea for a language learning app, but it doesn't help me. The lessons go by quickly and they baby you through so you're more so copy paste then learning the languages. It's all short term memory after 10min I forget it all again."
3848,Jessica Edquist,"February 7, 2020",4, Love the way that using the language in little phrases helps you build vocab. Only problem is that very occasionally the randomness means you are asked to translate a word that you haven't yet seen in that lesson (or previous lessons).
3849,Kevin Kortekaas,"February 13, 2020",4," I enjoy the app, but I hate my ""version"" of it, with the hearts. My wife's version uses lingots and it is much easier to use. I wish I could get ahold of the company to switch my version to the lingot version as opposed to the heart version."
3850,Jesyka Polito,"February 26, 2020",5, Duolingo is one of my favourite language apps ever! It's extremely friendly and easy to start using. And the best part is that it's totally for free. There is just one thing I would like to have in this app: a night mode. It would be great to have it.
3851,Tammy Royster,"April 16, 2020",5, I love this app does anyone know if the monthly payments can be made or do they take the full amount; if they do take the full amount they shouldn't have monthly rates listed.

3853,Abigail Barner,"February 19, 2020",5," Other than being an incredible learning platform for new languages, Duolingo has especially been improving the learning experience by adding supplemental features like tips and stories. I'm happy to see that they've gotten creative!"
3854,Amanda Beard,"April 27, 2020",5, This is a simple and straightforward app that helps you learn languages.
3855,Michael Reynolds,"February 29, 2020",5," While I probably won't gain fluency from this app alone, this app is essential for my regular study of language. I love it. My best recommendation is to not get too caught up in the leaderboards competitions."
3856,Lise Smit,"March 23, 2020",5," Great way to learn a new language! There are many languages available for free. All you have to do is watch a few ads sometimes but that is well worth it. It seems like the content and program itself is frequently updated, based on user feedback, which is great. Keep up the good work!"
3857,Serenity,"March 9, 2020",4, Very good! Glad to learn. The app phone version does not show u the reasonings behind different plurals etc though so you kind of have to just memorize it or learn elsewhere why it is what it is. Other than that this app is 10/10 to me.
3858,Leo Hill-Kawai,"March 17, 2020",2," Its a great app, but be aware that if you sign up to duolingo plus, it'll tell you its £7 a month and then rip £80 from your bank. At least thats what happened to me. You may not get that unlucky"
3859,John Bandak,"March 23, 2020",5," Great program. Keeps you learning. Only negative is it doesn't explain why you are wrong when using certain words in specific circumstances. Most of the time, you can figure it out. But in others, more information is needed."
3860,steve anderson,"April 4, 2020",4," Great, non text book style, ideal for the home education of a 9 year old. Only minus is difficulty in getting past profile point, when I have one. But free of charge , Excellent."

My daughter doesn't have this flaw in her app. I am dyslexic, so spelling is defiantly not my thing, now I need spell words that I have just learned I will never make be able to get through a lesson. Thanks Duolingo it was already stressful just answering questions with very little practice now I have to worry every time I make a mistake that I might not complete the lesson. Rewards are a better way to encourage people. Now I just get to feel stupid. Do you provide the dunce cap? It feels like this is about money not learning. I will not be paying for hearts or your paid version. I am so unhappy with your free app why would I pay you for anything."
3867,rix stuart,"April 28, 2020",4, Really really good some minor issues with muting after a hr close app and restart its fixed again
3868,Emma Mahumane,"March 7, 2020",5, Learning a different language is so made so much fun on this app. They've made it really simple but yet tricky enough for you to keep coming back to learn more . I'm inlove with itttttt!!! And theres no many different languages to choose from!! Its a fun must have app!
3869,Barbara Maehara,"March 11, 2020",4, I the listening aspect of the exercises. The reuse of the vocabulary in different constructions is good. I wish that you could select and rerun specific constructions for listening. More stories in more languages would be great.

3872,Luke Nelms,"February 24, 2020",5," The app sends helpful reminders and has a clean interface. It's very gratifying to use; gives positive feedback when correct, and detail when you're wrong to help you improve. It works well with the way you naturally learn. I like it!"
3873,jonathan cameron,"March 7, 2020",4," Love the app. I would only advice that the lesson tell you whether or not they are using the word, ""you"" formally or informally. Because sometimes the phrases are just saying ""...you..."" and then the correct answer is ""usted..."", rather than ""tú...""."
3874,H Roman,"April 4, 2020",4, It's good. I would like if they added a list of words and phrases you have learned already. That would help since I like practicing all the phrases as much as possible. Otherwise I like it and it is effective so far.
3875,Laya V Smith,"March 19, 2020",5," Love, love, love this app! It is easy and fun and you really do end up learning a lot. Plus, the free version comes with so much content. I plan to but it once I get to the end of the available course material. I would recommend it to anyone."
3876,Z Yoder,"March 23, 2020",5," This is a reading and writing focussed free language learning app. They do what they do very well. (If there were more images in their default design I would prefer that, but this is amazing for what it is)"
3877,Catherine Jones,"March 25, 2020",5, It's brilliant. I am making progress with French in a way I never thought possible. It's particularly cheering me up now when we can't go out. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start another language from scratch or someone who had some knowldge but has forgotten it all.
3878,Alexandre Alex,"March 29, 2020",5," One of the best apps online ! I tested many many many and this one is really good.

3879,Daniel Rablin,"March 25, 2020",1," This is a great way to introduce yourself to the basics of many languages without having to commit to more full-time study. On the downside, there is no way to view lesson notes seen on the website. The ads are also becoming more and more insufferable."
3880,John Beasley,"April 21, 2020",5," Love this app, definitely helps me continue to learn languages and stay practiced."

If you haven't earned enough hearts and can't pay...you are literally halted on your learning and can't go on. Ridiculous ploy when there are tons of other unlimited and truly free options for language learning out there. The also added ads that you must pay to remove!"
3885,Zakariás Nagy,"April 10, 2020",5, The lasf update made some things unsuable in the app. Its full with bugs now.
3886,Tea Đorđević,"April 13, 2020",3, The app is good but I wish it had an option for chatting !
3887,Charvi Khanna,"April 22, 2020",5, One of the best app till date. I am loving the update but please add story section in other languages like turkish and others. ❤
3888,Saeed Zamani,"April 22, 2020",5," It is so good and funny, but it doesn't read the words... Please check it. Thanks."
3889,Saffi Hassan,"April 18, 2020",5, Very user friendly and a great learning experience all in all.

3891,Ali,"February 16, 2020",3, I loved this and it was a really helpful app until 'lives' were added. I'm trying to learn a new language but whenever you get something wrong you lose a life. It would be five stars otherwise 😕
3892,Crystal R. B.,"February 11, 2020",5," Love this! The learning is fun, and through repetition, I am actually remembering what I learn in the lessons. I also love that they don't explain everything until you get a question wrong. Go ahead - try it!"
3893,Der C,"February 13, 2020",5," The app is a good flashcard style planning app. Repetition is key and slowly builds on each lesson. The app is designed around a fun, slightly competitive grouping with enough rewards through the free version to still learn and not need to fork out cash."
3894,Chris Smart,"February 14, 2020",5, I love this app I speak English but my wife is Turkish but I have learned so much with this app and the improvements made to it are great I use it while traveling so I may not be able to write down phrases so removing that was good and replacing it with the voice translator was great.
3895,Nagito FanGirl,"March 16, 2020",4," This app is great and it is helping me learn Japanese, but it will say ""which one is blue"" and next to the answer it will show the color blue so I know exactly which one to pick. And it does this a lot."
3896,upendrak light,"April 16, 2020",5, The is amazing and it has helped to learn a new language very easily
3897,Arthur Nay,"February 23, 2020",5," The initial free version was very limited on how much could be learned in a day. By upgrading to the plus version, it allows the flexibility to move through lessons faster at an affordable rate."
3898,Karen Gell,"April 15, 2020",4, This is an appropriately challenging program. Goals are clear and positive.
3899,Lila Mayer,"April 15, 2020",2, I used to like this app a lot. Until I got a limit of 5 lifes. Because now it is really discouraging and I am not really motivated to learn anymore. :/
3900,Carole Jacques-Wilson,"April 18, 2020",5, I am enjoying this app! I love the way it navigates through the language.
3901,Katina Glo,"February 22, 2020",5, Everytime using this app it has been super easy and glitch free! I love this and it is such a good learning resource. I really hope this wonderful app will stay free as it opens up learning to such a large audience. Love it!
3902,Kara Talley,"February 20, 2020",5," It has been very helpful as I am trying to learn such a foreign foreign language. Japanese sounds like nothing I have ever tried speaking and duolingo's repetition, positive reinforcement, and bite size lessons have been wonderful."
3903,Giardap Hslaw,"February 24, 2020",5," I study Irish and French in school and this app is really good for revising little parts of grammar or vocab that you have forgotten. If you want to learn a new language, I've had fun with Japanese and it seems pretty good. Plays very much more like a game than a test."
3904,adam thrift,"April 26, 2020",5, Really like the app i really like how one of the classes has a book option i hope the other classes will have same option in the future
3905,Ahmad Sammour,"April 28, 2020",5, Great and smooth way of learning. plus the app is really good
3906,Lam Ching,"March 15, 2020",4," It's free, it's effective, it's everything you need if you want to pick up a new language. Edit: still a great app, however I recently brought an outfit for my duo but i can't see it at all on any of the duos, please help me developers :("
3907,ajay kaushik,"March 9, 2020",4, A very interactive app to learn new languages. Keeps us reminding to practice regularly. There should be an option to stay out of the leaderboard to keep learning more fun and take it in our own pace.
3908,Nisa Carmia Nadhifa,"March 4, 2020",5," It is a fun way to learn language, and what i like the most is all the content is free! I suggest to add speaking section and writing kanji in japanese course, and grammar explanation and speaking section in arabic course, thank you"
3909,Hannah Gustafson,"March 10, 2020",4," Would be 5 stars but i for some reason have to either practice for ""lives"" or pay a subscription. Whereas my partner does not have this problem, he downloaded the app and has unlimited access without having to pay anything and doesnt lose any so called lives. What is going on?"
3910,Mobina Yousefi,"March 15, 2020",3, My God!I loved this app until it starts to get on my nerves. It doesn't work well. It doesn't play the sounds i can not get the right pronunciation. I thought it would be better after updating but nothing changed!!! Please do sth i cant stand this anymore

3912,Beverly T,"March 15, 2020",5," Aside from what I think are misplaced files if translation duo lingo has been spot on. It is very easy to navigate. I've found that so long as you don't just treat it like a game, you will learn while having fun."
3913,lula Val,"March 13, 2020",4," It's great .There is one problem. At times during 'translation' or 'type' the very first word of the sentence is lost on the normal speed, sometimes I'm able to pick it up on the very slow speed."
3914,Tony Hannan,"March 12, 2020",4," Duo lingo is great, i rhink there should be more two person dialogues. Arabic script although large for individual words ar first level, is still way too small when sentences are shown to be able read the letters and vowel markings at early levels. Thanks."
3915,Matt Schabo,"March 19, 2020",5, Awesome app if you put the time in. I took Spanish on middle and high school until my junior year. Decided recently after 10+ years to brush up on it using this app. It's fun and I've enjoyed it. I'm not paying for the pro version and honestly you don't need to.
3916,Rudolf Schütz,"March 14, 2020",5," Just encountered a bug. In Polish course in checkpoint 3, the question has to be answered in Polish, but even then it gives an error message as being written in English. Other than that, I cant but recommend it."
3917,Cansis Widger,"March 18, 2020",5," I've been using this app for almost 5 years and have learned two languages. It's very helpful and it works, I love how I can sign in and save my progress and the new story feature is fun and effective in learning."
3918,Tim P,"March 22, 2020",4, Reviewing as a learner I would say it is helpful in parts. It is infuriating sometimes when you use up all your hearts and it cancels the learning by telling you effectively you have to quit. Very geared to upsell but I have learned some language basics.
3919,Colleen Rose,"March 24, 2020",5, This app is great to learn a new language. Whether you are traveling or just to learn something new. This is perfect. Simple to start and you continue to learn on your own time. For me it is to learn something new and interesting as I get older. It is good for all ages as well.
3920,Arman Shaikov,"April 3, 2020",5, Great tool with step by step system to have a basic idea of introduction to foreign language. Easy to use and a little entertaining. Recommended!
3921,Sarah Seymour,"April 9, 2020",5, Great app for learning spanish. Could do without so many ads though.
3922,Ramona Dsouza,"March 27, 2020",5," I find the app very easy to learn . And if we make a single mistake they repeat it so that we learn it properly. They also keep repeating new words so that, that particular word gets stuck in our heads."
3923,Michelle Diaz,"April 13, 2020",5," I used it to review spanish which i already speak and it helped me improve. I found it very easy to use. I am now learning chinese and am having the same pleasant learning experience. It's wasy to use, goes slow, I think it's great. Use it :)"
3924,Sabeen Umar,"April 14, 2020",5, I started with Arabic. It is an amazing app. I think i can understand Arabic to some extent only after using this app for few days.
3925,Blaze Budd,"April 2, 2020",4, It does a nice job of introducing the language to you. Also the software will repeat failed questions. It's a great tool to be exposed to the language and get the basics.

3950,Helena Hlavaty,"February 22, 2020",3, This is an excellent app for learning languages. However my goalbwas learning Hebrew and for this language Duolingo is not very suitable. Mainly because writing Hebrew is different from speaking. I think the developer team should review with Hebrew speakers how to improve it.

Not many people magically know Korean words written in hongul before even learning the alphabet so instead of this app intuitively teaching the alphabet first it throws Korean sentences at you in the alphabet module and expects you to know what the Korean words mean and translate entire sentences. Going to Babel, this is a waste of time. Even Drops is much more intuitive than this and I'm learning a lot more using their app. It just makes sense."
3955,Lloyd Anthony,"February 25, 2020",4," It's easy to use, offers the chance to speak the language as well as read it, could maybe to more of that. Running out of lives to make a mistake is a bit annoying, but so far it's been quite enjoyable and hopefully I'm learning too."

3958,CL Lim,"March 15, 2020",5," Have been using this app for about 2 years years. It is very good and I try to practice daily. I chose the minimal version to learn so I don't put pressure on myself. My progress is incremental, slow but steady."
3959,Joseph Wilder,"February 12, 2020",5, It allows me to hear it spoken. To have ndw words added without feeling the need to memorize. You just begin to recognize the words. I have paid for plus for a year. Appreciate this app.
3960,Kishan Mahabir,"March 20, 2020",5," AMAZING. The app is totally user friendly, has a fun UI and encourages a great deal of productivity. I love this app. I've learnt 3 completely new languages since I started using it. Consistency is the key."
3961,samane sabet birjandi,"March 30, 2020",2," Honestly it 's good but the listening and speaking skills has so much bug. after a lot feedback to the developer, do not want correct them. It's a big negative point specific in the test question for progress to upper level"
3962,Gregory Boatswain,"April 5, 2020",5, I've only been using it for a week so I'm still going through the basics. But it's easy to use and I love how it makes learning a new language into a competitive game. I'd recommend at least getting the free version and seeing if you like it
3963,Анна Илиева,"March 27, 2020",4," I like the app and I learnt a lot of things from it. But, please fix exercises with constructing sentences: I can't move the words if I do them wrong and I have to turn them off and start again."
3964,Tyler Kelley,"March 9, 2020",5," It was recommended to me to use Duolingo to help with my general memory.

3976,Ashish Pd,"April 7, 2020",3, Duolingo must have options to chat (audio / video) with our competitors to enhance language and overcome of fear of hesitation of speaking with time limit. And more features like newspaper reading or any article with q/ans .
3977,Jonathan Alexander,"April 5, 2020",4, It's alright for beginners and people who want to make sure of certain things regarding their knowledge of a language but a little too simple for anyone who wanta something more advanced.

3983,Benjamin Horti,"March 10, 2020",4," I downloaded this app in hope of learning Icelandic but I couldn't jot find it, and would be happy to have it in the near future. (And I saw 2 languages from movies. You could also maybe add elvish.) Otherwise its a great app, with very good functions, and a wide range of languages."
3984,Algirdas Vainikonis,"March 11, 2020",5," Such a good program, of course it has it flaws. Problems - some of the sentences can be expressed and the program doesn't understand that and not all words have definite translations. Also the ads are not annoying af."
3985,rocketleaguetv y,"April 1, 2020",5, Not much watching ads and Is free to learn another language. I would recommend this to everyone who struggling at school at language or just someone who wants to have fun without having to pay to learn!
3986,Doughnut121YT,"April 5, 2020",2," Yeah it's accurate but there are two ways of saying some words, but it only teaches you one. And I get at least 5 notifications a day, and it's really annoying."

3988,Erik Kozina,"April 3, 2020",4, This app is a great for learning new languages! I would like it if you add more languages because I want to learn more languages but there not on Duolingo if you add more or all the languages I would rate Duolingo a five star.

3991,Megan Jayn Donkin,"March 19, 2020",5," Thoroughly enjoyable. It is more interactive than I realised, which is great. It's one thing to pair words and select translations, but being able to hear and speak phrases is extremely helpful!"

3996,Tom V,"February 8, 2020",5, Love the app! It's such a nice way to playfully start to learn a new language. The only downside is that grammar isn't being explained although you can find it on the web. Definitely recommend!
3997,Maleigha Elliott,"February 11, 2020",5, It is so much fun with great goals to reach for. And a leader board to fight to get to the top of. Its fun to compet with friends. I have learned a lot and look forward to playing/learning more.
3998,Gene Cole,"February 13, 2020",5, An exceptional way to learn a learn a new language. If I had one complaint it's that there's not nearly enough audial playback on the Navajo course and I find myself reading and guessing the pronunciation of an otherwise only spoken language.
3999,Marek Stefański,"February 29, 2020",5," This is the best app for learning a language. Lessons are quick and efficient, there are many languages to pick from and adds aren't invasive at all. You can easily learn without paying a penny."
4000,David In Metroland,"April 24, 2020",1," Too many cheaters make this app's incentives useless and de-motivating. Despite many complaints, Duolingo appear to do nothing to fix. AVOID this app unless you enjoy cheating. 😟"
4001,William Read,"March 17, 2020",3," This is a great app to learn any language slowly, but if you just want to become conversation quickly or if you want to focus on grammar, you should use this as a supplement to a better learning source."
4002,Arwa Khan,"March 31, 2020",3, The app is fairly good but the complete the sentence exercise doesn't seem to work. I have had to start the lesson over again and then eventually move on to another skill. It would be great if that was fixed.

4004,Ashley Milligan,"February 15, 2020",2," Was a good app at first, but eventually has become all about nickle and diming. The streak repairs increased by ten dollars for no apparent reason, even for plus members. It has become more of a source of discouragement then anything else."
4005,Patricia Hillier,"March 23, 2020",5," I love learning languages, this app is brilliant, I am quickly being able to hear people speak Portuguese and understanding simple phrases. The repetition makes learning new vocabulary and grammar easier than classroom or book based learning."
4006,Rebecca Manski,"March 29, 2020",5, Surprisingly good for someone who only has a little experience with the Arabic alphabet. Starting to get the hang of it. Not as great for my purposes as far as pronunciation goes - think it might be Egyptian as opposed to Levantine Arabic?
4007,Thomas Billings,"April 4, 2020",5," This app is very handy in helping me retain what I have learned and continue increasing in my skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing. I recommend it, it'll do you good."

4009,Samiksha Sakhuja,"April 3, 2020",5, I can't tell you how good this app is. I wanted to learn Spanish just to pass time because I wanted to get out of my habit of playing games. But this app is super efficient! I love it! ¡Hola! Esta es una buena aplicación. Me encanta.❤️❤️
4010,Illidan 2099,"February 10, 2020",4," It's a good app, but it's been significantly worsened by the lives system and the fact that if you want to progress, you'll ""lose"" progress on your old ones that have been gold for over a year."
4011,Maria Krusteva,"March 15, 2020",5," I don't write reviews often, but I just couldn't write a thing about this app. This app is just amazing, I have no words. The other apps I've used have never taught me as much as yours. I really adore it. Sorry, my English is not very good."
4012,Ty Ley,"February 14, 2020",2, It's a good app to learn different languages. But I have used it in a while. Wanted to start where I left off and everything was gone. Had to start from the beginning. I had 3 languages I was learning. Only doing one this time.
4013,Arya Sunil,"March 18, 2020",5, I am satisfied with the experience. This app makes learning the basics of German easy. The tips are extremely helpful when it comes to remembering lessons. It is absolutely user friendly. Keep up the good work 👍
4014,Sonny Pham,"February 29, 2020",1, The feature that lets you jump to the next level when you've gone through the current level a few times without mistakes doesn't work properly in Japanese. It would jump me to the next level then all of a sudden goes back to the previous level. Please fix.
4015,alim al rajy,"April 21, 2020",5," It's outstanfing. I'm in love with this app and it's helping me a lot learning a new language. It is very simple, cute and effective!! Thanks@duolingo"
4016,FDTHNG,"March 26, 2020",5," Fun and easy. I would 100% buy a voice add on. $10 to change the voice to something more pleased? Easy day. Hell I'd throw em $20 for any other voice. I dont care if its smegel yelling at me in Norwegian, I'd buy it"
4017,Gareth Harker,"March 17, 2020",5," Absolutely love it. Although the lessons at times seem repetitive, this only adds to my ability to retain things. This is especially true as I advance to harder levels. My favourite app."
4018,wing yan chui,"April 13, 2020",5, Excellent apps with good design of content. Fun n intensive to learn french
4019,Ashira Benitez,"March 26, 2020",4, The app is easy to use fun & motivating. The Spanish is familiar but the Chinese I would prefer more explanation on the basic sounds & how to draw the characters. There's a lot of ads but some of them are authority worthwhile reviewing.
4020,Ezra Alexander,"April 15, 2020",5, Engaging and easy to use. Great motivation for the unmotivated

4024,M,"April 23, 2020",5, Great way to learn a new language. I also love that they offer so many languages!
4025,Zachary Larson,"March 24, 2020",5," I'm taking Swedish. Nice way to spend random moments of my day. Super easy learning method where you absorb rules of grammar, pronunciation and vocab osmotically, which I like. Very impressed that the app also tests your pronunciation by having speak into the phone."
4026,Camilo Villegas,"March 27, 2020",5," I paid for the app, some money goes to help fund education so I'm a good person. The paid version is great, practical, the activities are a great complement when trying to learn a language. Fast intuitive and fun to learn. No ""dónde está la biblioteca"" type of learning."
4027,Kobe Lai,"February 24, 2020",4, I have a suggestion. Sometimes I mistakenly tapped the check button before I finish typing the answers. I suggest putting the check button to the top of the screen so users won't tap it unintentionally.
4028,Martin Gallot,"March 16, 2020",5," Great app if you start a language from scraps. Easy, not boring and you really learn something. Little less interesting if you have good bases (in my opinion). Keep the good work."
4029,Jeff Pfeiffer,"March 5, 2020",5," Very useful for getting the basics of a language down. A neat idea for duo, would be to offer a match up for learners with each other for potential audio and/or video to practice with one another."
4030,Abigail Kane,"March 20, 2020",5, Really enjoyable. Loving all the different ways to learn. I'm currently learning French and my knowledge has really expanded from the basic things I already knew. I really recommend to download and give it a go!!
4031,Haneen Alali,"April 17, 2020",1, It was 5 star then i was so stupid and update it .. the new update sucks .. especially the Italian voice

4033,Karthikeyan Palanivel,"March 31, 2020",5," Awesome app. Really useful. At the end of all the lesson, (may be it will take one or two years to complete all the tasks) you can able to understand that language. Iam learning French. It is really useful"
4034,Sunflower P,"April 2, 2020",5, I love it ! It is amazing but it should be put to more languages. So that people can experience countrys with more than one language. Like India instead of just Hindi put Hindi Tamil and telagu .
4035,Lyn Murray,"April 18, 2020",5, Easy & flexible to use. Gaining vocabulary without revision
4036,Devansh Sharma,"April 13, 2020",5, The fact that it's so good and yet free is the best thing. Our is the best app ever.

4041,Kim Jones,"April 1, 2020",5," Very user friendly, I paid for the plus version to take away the adverts which is so much better but it's only around the same price as my netflix subscription & at least I'm actually learning something"
4042,shweta gupta,"April 4, 2020",5," A very useful app for anyone who wants to learn a new language. I personally use it a lot, right now to learn french, and I think learning on duolingo is fun and also it helps us to be consistent"

4046,Hugo Fetiza,"April 9, 2020",5, This is one of the more easy and seamless ways to learn languages.
4047,Willow Dunn,"March 8, 2020",4, So the app is usually great but I lost a 23 day streak despite earning 120 something xp in a day. It wouldn't be so frustrating if there weren't the gem wagers and rewards that go along with it. Please check this out.
4048,Samantha Otero,"February 14, 2020",5," Great intro to Spanish. I look forward to getting to a level that matches mine so I can grow in the subjunctive. Some odd pronunciations such as H in hamburgesa clearly pronounced by the man when it should be silent. The woman says it properly, mind you."
4049,Matthew Jordan,"February 15, 2020",4, This app is pretty easy to use and I like the learning style that it uses. The one downside is that you can only make so many mistakes. You only get 5 mistakes and then you have to wait for the hearts to refill.
4050,Sarah Cook,"February 20, 2020",3," Really good app for basics. Nice weird sentences so you remember the words better. although would really like to have the ""write"" option in the app to answer the questions instead of having to go online..."
4051,Bella Wilson,"February 25, 2020",3," It's a decent phrase guide. However, I really don't fancy that the languages don't start with the same basics. Also, it would be really helpful to know what dialects of these languages are being taught. Thank you."
4052,Kayla Williford,"March 11, 2020",5, Great app! I never review apps but I am extremely impressed with this one. I love that there are goals and leaderboards. I have learned so much and I know itll be very helpful once I start my spanish summer classes.
4053,Jo Bowden,"February 22, 2020",5," Brilliant app, I have gone from no German to being able to hold conversations in a few short months. Completing a few minutes each day is very achievable:) There's lots of repetition which really helps. Thanks Duolingo!"
4054,Farhang Shapouran,"April 15, 2020",2, Why in the latest update we must to cost 200 gems to skip levels😑😑 please return that to recent way
4055,Faith Acker,"February 9, 2020",4," Fun and quick way to increase foreign vocabulary. I do wish it included more explanations of the grammar (the desktop has a few, but they are not accessible in the Android app)."
4056,Noah Kimber,"February 26, 2020",3, Would be much better if the male speaker didn't mumble so much. I understand that people mumble when they talk sometimes but it's super unhelpful when you're trying to learn and you can't tell what word he's using.
4057,Sarah,"March 14, 2020",5, Such an amazing app makes learning a new language fun and addictive. You can learn a new language totally for free with limited ad interuptions or spring for the paid version with no ads but either way its fun and best of all it really works!
4058,Robert Vaughn,"February 11, 2020",5," Very enjoyable to use. Ease of use is great, the leader boards are fun and the ad free option is a nice touch. The fact the content is all free regardless is really amazing."
4059,DEVON MCDOWELL,"April 20, 2020",5, Great app !! Easy to follow instructions and games
4060,Sarah MacLean,"March 16, 2020",5, The app seems simple at first and then before I know it I am consistently using ther language creatively in my every day. The games make learning fun and the repetition is absolutely the key to retention. Wonderful app.
4061,Jeff Kapler,"February 21, 2020",5," Duolingo is a very portable and convenient app, allowing one to pick up and practice words and phrases anywhere you can have a tablet or phone! I like that it forces you to refresh chapters previously completed . Stories is also a good way to practice skills."
4062,Tiffany Nubern,"February 29, 2020",5, Very helpful and fun. The tips that have been added help so much. In just a few minutes my pronunciation of words was fixed as was my understanding of the language almost overnight.
4063,Sepideh jp,"March 2, 2020",4, I have trouble with listening sections. Some of the words are mute no matter how much i try and press to listen to them and its not just my problem i saw it on other devices. What should i do?

4065,Hiven Alkhateeb,"March 3, 2020",5, It's amazing 😍 there is stories they read to you in the language you want to learn and you answer questions as the story continues like true or false questions and most importantly your also learning at the same time!❤️ They should make more apps like this I absolutely love Duolingo.😊😍😍😍
4066,Navia Gutierrez,"March 4, 2020",5," I have been on duolingo for around 5 days now, and can i just say that i have gotten addicted to it! Im learning italian and its going very well. Though the ads are a bit annoying it really has helped me learn and practice a lot."

4082,Ayla Werrbach,"April 7, 2020",3, It stopped giving the repeat back option and only half the time repeats the french words when giving options of translation. Furthermore there should be more options of things to buy with Ruby's.
4083,Richard Lew,"April 4, 2020",4, I would give it 5 stars if you add in some pronunciations we can read in our own languages. It is very difficult to pick up the pronunciations for some of the audios

4085,B Cool,"April 24, 2020",5," A really good starting point for learning any language, me and my little one do a lesson a day, I do French she does Spanish most importantly it's fun and not too heavy so it helps you retain words, I recommend it 😃"

4099,Glenda Dowe,"March 1, 2020",5, Exciting! An amazing way to learn a language at your own pace! With encouragement that is very helpful. Learning is progressing. Duo is so patient. Some of the ads have been of use to me. Thank you!
4100,Pedro Galeano,"February 10, 2020",5," It turns out to be a very useful tool for learning a language. If you are persistent, study a bit every day and complement the app with other material, you can take in a very good deal of the language you want to learn"

I started to get somewhat annoyed when I couldn't just remove the ad and had to wait a countdown but ok is bearable. What is really making me want to ditch the app forever (and have been using it for years) is the ads with sound blasting through my headphones after I had to put the volume up to learn a language. Come on, this is just too much!"
4102,Brent Daniels,"February 21, 2020",5, Duolingo by far has kept me on track to learn the German language. The overall smartphone format allows you to learn a language virtually anywhere. I find it to be a much better alternative to the mindless viewing of social media.
4103,Sam McGuire,"February 23, 2020",4, I love it super easy to jump in on the living languages. The dead or fantasy languages tend to be much harder to learn in the start but thats my only complaint! And that could be do to the difficulty of the language not the lack of effort on part of duo lingo
4104,GROUP on,"March 24, 2020",5," Very good app. But in languages like korean, chinese, etc., this app is teaching letters also. It feels uncomfortable ☹️ to learn the language fully. It would be better if this app teaches only to speak and not to read and write. 😊"
4105,maj21093,"February 9, 2020",4, Overall a great App to learn the basics. I would consider buying the full version if the price wasn't as high. The rewards and Leaderboards are a decent motivator to continue daily usage.
4106,Colman Richards,"February 21, 2020",4," Pretty good: ads are unintrusive, ability to discuss with others from around the world makes learning the language easier as oftentimes you can get an explanation for anything you're confused on. It's a good app"
4107,Shalom Habonimana,"February 28, 2020",5, It is very helpful...I'm improving a lot..and I enjoy spending time learning in it.. u should also think about including lessons where we have to talk or repeat what we're reading and listening to so that we can also improve our pronounciations and tones...Thank you

4112,Itsumi - Chan,"April 17, 2020",5, Everything was perfectly fine with the app. I say it's similar to the website(expect the gems r different) I just feel like learning a language is more fun with this app
4113,Sheina Josias,"April 25, 2020",5, An amazing app! So easy to use and fun to learn!!
4114,David Ruiz,"April 26, 2020",5, Awesome keeps me on my toes and I love the repetition..keep up the great work
4115,Leenah yasser,"April 25, 2020",4, Actually Duolingo it is a good game but it has one problem that it needs hearts that take time . Leenah
4116,Georgia Miller,"April 11, 2020",5, I really never thought learning another language could be like this. I chose to learn Spanish. You can learn the very basics in days if you devote time to it. Duolingo makes it fun and accessible.
4117,Jonathan Teal,"April 10, 2020",5, The pattern in which they teach makes you learn the words easilybut if you are a slow learner like me then a little bit of exstra study may be required. And its addictive when you get going.
4118,Murtaza Ahmad,"April 26, 2020",5," To start and momorize languages, this is one of best app. Its takes time to upload new lesson."
4119,ArenaCraft Adk,"March 4, 2020",1, new update is the worst. they count as error on matching task sxreen now. in screen where you can simply missclick or just click on words to listen them. and added unskipable adds. and yea your streak button seems bugged now. working only once.
4120,beth beth,"April 19, 2020",4," Only nock is that it doesn't allow you to choose your starting point, in terms of previous knowledge."
4121,Stuart Rogers,"March 11, 2020",5," Useful learning app, nicely paced with the option to do as much or as little as you like or can each day. For the free version, ads aren't intrusive, either, which is great"
4122,Mew Mew,"March 20, 2020",4," Really easy to install. Love it and its very helpful but i dont like the ""having to wait SO long to play again"" thing. Like it just ruins the concept...Why cant you just let us play your game so we can give you free ad revenue like cmon man xd 😂"
4123,Anayeli Ortiz,"April 24, 2020",5, It really good at explaining the language you want to learn.
4124,Mena,"February 9, 2020",4," Definitely a GREAT language learning app!! you're definitely not going to become fluent using JUST Duolingo but if you stay committed, the further in you get the more you'll find good resources through the community. Also I'm competitive so the league helps keep me going. 😂🤣"
4125,Saleem Khan,"February 14, 2020",4, Some times answer selection buttons are not visible enough to be tapped. End up as incorrect answer results in loosing a heart.or two. Stoped learning Arabic just cuz I got stuck at that point. Where I can't even see the button. To select.
4126,drew kyser,"March 28, 2020",5," A nice, simple app that will help teach you the basics of a multitude of languages. Paired up with a few other programs or strategies, you'll be speaking basic sentences in no time."
4127,Karl Whitwam,"February 27, 2020",5," It really does seem to be working for me, always struggled to remember anything, but with daily sessions using duolingo this way makes it slowly become instinctive. Brilliant so far so good."
4128,Chic Ana,"February 12, 2020",5," I really do learn and like how it starts with basics, and let's you speak it. Also in my personal experience it's fun and makes me want to keep continuing to get to the next level almost like a game."
4129,kevin ferkowicz,"February 11, 2020",4, Lots of fun! I like the way you're challenged to learn from different perspectives. The story interpretations puts the language into context so you learn how to correctly form sentences.
4130,Garrett Stone,"February 11, 2020",5," I've been learning Danish for 130+ days at this point, and I can understand some song lyrics and movie dialogue. It's actually sticking in a way that languages never have before! I recommend this."
4131,Andrew Leggett,"March 4, 2020",4," A great aid for learning, and a great way to learn the basics. Could use some instructional or reference sections on grammar. And I'd love to see Old English or sign language added."
4132,Benjamin,"February 23, 2020",5," Incredible app, I've definitely learned more French on this app in a few months than I ever did in all my time at school, just 10-20 minutes a day on this app can teach you so much, and its an incredible feeling when you know you've learned so much.

If you're thinking about learning any language and don't know where to start, start with Duolingo!"
4133,Maria Melnikova,"April 4, 2020",5, I really like the simplicity of this app and the variety of the languages you can learn there. Amount of the adds seems reasonable for a free version.
4134,Socially Awkward Diva,"March 14, 2020",4, I really like Duolingo the only things I would change is that it should be optional if you want to join the leaderboard. Also I wish there was more of a speaking task with Japanese so I can learn to pronounce things
4135,Stephen Tamuno,"April 19, 2020",4, I love the app. I never thought learning Spanish would be this easy. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't provide the opportunity to interact with friends. It should really be considered. It'd make learning even more fun.
4136,Karla Bocardo,"April 21, 2020",5, Great app to give you a jump start at learning a language :)
4137,Roxie Fogarity,"April 25, 2020",3, good free app for learning. need the timed practice and dictionary feature on app not just desktop
4138,jungkook is my euphoria,"March 25, 2020",5," It is a great app. It teaches us a lot of languages. I am learning Korean language. It also teach us to write letters ,sentences etc. At first it was a bit hard but slowly it became easy to learn. I love this app."
4139,David Gubbels,"April 1, 2020",2, Good ideas but incredibly finicky and plays loose with English grammar at times for written answers. Extremely frustrating when the app encourages competition so much. Don't expect to get anywhere further than elementary level with this app.
4140,Loveleen Kaur,"March 21, 2020",4," Yes! Four stars only, because sometimes it takes alot of time to open a chapter amd it is really irritating, otherwise it's easy way to learn any language, hope developers will work on it."
4141,docmeech,"March 17, 2020",4," This app is very useful ,fun and easy to use. The only reason I knocked one star off is because of hearts. It limits your learning by restricting it if you get a certain amount of questions wrong."
4142,samruddhi _,"March 23, 2020",4, Too many ads....but useful application as it helps us to learn new things in audio- visual presentation and without any fees... Overall really a good and helpful app I recommend for students to in stall this application!!!!
4143,deborah steele,"April 19, 2020",5, It is fun and easy. Good to refresh my Indonesian language knowledge through this app.
4144,Suri Goenka,"April 25, 2020",5, It is a fun learning app where it helps you enjoy learning new languags inthe form of a game. I learn Hindi on the app.
4145,Rosyn War,"April 1, 2020",5, This is a wonderful easy to learn program with great encouragement that can be done on any schedule. The laungue really sticks no matter how long you break from it. Love this app and cant believe it's free. Thank you Doulingo!
4146,david innes,"April 4, 2020",5, I think being English the app is Great!!! Spelling is very difficult for me in English but in Polish it is a nightmare but this app gives you time to correct your mistakes . I feel that I have made excellent progress
4147,Zack Jenkins,"April 10, 2020",5, Very very good. Actually enjoying learning a language which is weird and it's going really well.
4148,Tracy Jardine,"February 7, 2020",5," Loving this app! Excellent variety of techniques getting you listening, speaking, reading, writing and translating. I feel like I am really making progress without too much effort."
4149,Jasmine Bowen,"February 8, 2020",5, It is a very entertaining and educational game. It is in most languages and includes fun stories in the two selected languages ( the main language and the one that you wish to learn).
4150,23autumnlp,"February 15, 2020",4, This is fun as well as educational. I've always found it hard to retain another language.This has made it real easy. I like it enough that I invite a couple of my friends to join. Love that it's free too. Thanks.

It is utterly ridiculous that linguistic app cannot get the most basics of English language correct. Also the bit that's meant to recognise what you're saying never giving you long enough to complete the sentence required it shots off way too damn fast
4152,Amy Hardy,"February 19, 2020",5, Fun to use and seems to work. Running out of hearts and going back to the basic level seems frustrating at first but is actually helpful as you keep practicing the basics as you progress.
4153,nibor reed,"February 17, 2020",4, It is very good. My French has improved. I think there should be plain listening questions. French doesn't sound the way it is written and it is spoken quite fast. Learners need to learn to hear it.
4154,Dan Martinez,"February 18, 2020",4," Great app, but there may be a few mistranslations. In Japanese food level 1 it asks you to translate ""excuse me, I am an apple"". Other than that I've not noticed any other problems so good app"

The very first lesson in Greetings has a question i cannot pass (sensei), as the right answer is obscured by the Check button and it wont let me select it!! It wont let me pass the lesson until i Get It Right! Any chance a fix to move the right answer to the front, or remove a third answer blocking the way?? If not, then i will have to uninstall.."
4156,Jane Smith,"March 13, 2020",5," Actually effective for language learning! Trying to keep up my streak / leaderboard position etc. has made it a daily habit which really helps learning. I'd love to see some more outfits for Duo, and of course more languages!"

4162,Lisa Harmer,"April 1, 2020",5, I actually love this! I would recommend this to anyone and have already recommended it to my friends for their kids to study language while they are home. I spend at least an hour on it a day and i have learned so much! I cant wait to start another language!
4163,Beauteous Skylie Sanchez,"April 26, 2020",5, Love this.! Wish Duolingo would add ASL (AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE) & BSL (BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE)

So it is rather difficult to try and learn a whole sub division of French whenever I say or type whatever the Canadian equivalent is in French. Only to get it wrong. Try and bunp up the settings so we can learn it in our dialect."
4165,Sophia Gabriel,"March 31, 2020",5, I'm learning Spanish on Duolingo and it's been smooth sailing from the onset. The app has all these wonderful features that can get you addicted. It's the best app for people who want to learn new languages. Easy to understand and user-friendly.
4166,Sandra Owens,"April 8, 2020",5, Excellent! Fun way to brush up or learn a new language.
4167,Leonardo Arce,"March 7, 2020",5," I love the convenience of accessing an effective language tutor anywhere, anytime! My language skills have improved with the daily use of Duolingo, not only my understanding of the spoken language but of the written language as well. Thank you! Leo"
4168,K Smith,"April 27, 2020",5, I love Duolingo. It's so easy to use and picks up on words that you aren't good at until you remember them. Go at my own pace too.
4169,Chris Krohn,"March 13, 2020",5, Love it! Been meaning to polish up my Spanish & then mov on to something new. Easy and even the Pro ver is only $7 a month with annual subscription. Worth every penny. Highly recommen it over other more expensive apps.
4170,Delfina Zažecke,"March 20, 2020",5, I really enjoy this app. I learn Spanish everyday for a year now. Stories made learning process so much easier and more fun. I also stared to listen to podcasts - I can feel that I made huge progress compared to where I started. Thank you for a great app!
4171,Aleigh R.,"February 26, 2020",5, I love this app. My kids love this app. I was so surprised by my own progress. I didn't realize how quick I was learning with just 15/20 minutes a day! My children are multingual and this has helped them get so much stronger in their languages.

The hearts system is unfair and aggravating. It is easy to make a simple mistake unrelated to your comprehension of a language. Do you know why it's really there, everyone? Not to get you to ""practice"". It's to get you more interested in Duolingo Plus. This especially rings true with unskippable ads. If the hearts system was reworked and certain languages were improved, it'd be an immediate 5 stars."
4173,whitterbug84,"February 24, 2020",5, This is app is very easy to use and builds your confidence as a new speaker by stepping you up gradually and building on your knowledge. I've learned so much from Duolingo and I highly recommend it!
4174,Helen Godfrey,"April 9, 2020",5," It's simple, easy to use and we love Duo's superhero outfit!"
4175,Jack,"March 7, 2020",1, The heart system is very different from the desktop version and doscourages learning the language once you run out completely. I definitely prefer the hearts being 3 tries per activity rather than being an overall time-based ordeal.
4176,Glynis D'SOUZA,"March 18, 2020",5, This app is amazing. I love that it awards you recognition along the way and rewards you for your work. It also keeps you accountable through reminders. All in all a very well designed app!
4177,Laurien habijanac,"March 19, 2020",5," I have studied languages several times and this is the most duccessful program for me, personally. The multiple ways of learning; visual, auditory and tactile options, sink in very effectively."
4178,Hua Kang,"March 20, 2020",5," The best language learning app for me. Though I'm using it for free, 5sec ads isn't a bother at all. When I'm out of hearts, I go to practice option and what's good is it also gives me additional xp. I'm currently learning Chinese and 我真的很喜欢它。"
4179,ScaredSmiles Yt,"March 21, 2020",5," I love how well it works with my music app, and it's so easy to use. The loss of hearts is slightly irritating, but you can always use your extra practice heart if you run out."
4180,Larry Klinkner,"March 26, 2020",4, Fun easy way to learn. Free to use too with an option to pay for unlimited hearts. Just practice if you run out to get more or just wait for the hearts to come back over time. Would recommend.
4181,J Nelson,"March 27, 2020",5," I have used Duolingo myself and loved it. Now that we are isolated for Covid 19, it has been a great resource for my daughter who is in a Spanish bilingual program in her school. I can't help her with her Spanish so the app has been amazing."
4182,Shreevijai Sundar,"March 28, 2020",5, Super fun... Amazing assistance for language learning in a fun way. Both variety and substance in sufficient quantity. The images are also very cute and child-friendly. Thank you so much.
4183,Bonaventure Tofit,"April 6, 2020",5, This is a very wonderful App. But why did you remove the vocal input feature. It really helps when trying to get the best pronunciations.
4184,Jay Tsai,"April 7, 2020",3, Enjoyed initially using the app but it abruptly stopped working. Tried a re-install but it keeps failing at 96% repeatedly so I'm giving up. Also not a huge fan of the hearts system.
4185,Thomas Sherman,"April 25, 2020",4, Started off slow but things are coming together nicely now Been working with this app now for about three weeks I have to say it is themost effective way to learn a language. I am hooked.
4186,Kate Scott,"April 5, 2020",5," I love it! Yes, the lessons start off easy and are pretty repetitive, but that's what helps the language sink in. I definitely recommend it."

4191,Audrey Alcaide,"April 23, 2020",5, Perfect way to learn a new language. Easy yo use. Try Duolingo plus to learn with more intensity. Cheaper than regular course. I recommend it.
4192,atousa nezami,"April 21, 2020",5, It's nearly The BEST learning app I've ever seen; easy to use and hi-fi and it obeys an intellectual algorithm to stick the words in your mind.I love it and highly recommend it!

4199,ashraf saafan,"February 13, 2020",5," Amazing experience something unique of kind like never before. It really worth the time and effort. Very simple, easy and funny way of learning a language. Better than wasting time on social media."
4200,Eliza Loweecey,"March 6, 2020",2, Every update brings more ads! Now there are full screen ads for TikTok that are questionably safe for work. I remember when this was completely free... Guess Duolingo has fallen victim to their own success. What a shame.
4201,Nicole Canonizado,"March 6, 2020",5, It really gives you an in-depth practice on the language you're learning. Not to mention there are a lot of languages to choose from! The ads are super super short it doesnt bother me as much as other apps.
4202,Katie Ruddy,"March 14, 2020",5, Really fun and easy way to learn a new language. It teaches you useful words & phrases and repeats so you retain what you learn. More of a game than a lesson. Love it!

If it included more content from intermediate and fluent levels, I would be impressed and would use it more often. Please add these levels, as I don't yet think it's enough to reach fluency. If you do, this would be my primary source of language learning. Thank you again! I'm very happy that it includes all six L"
4204,Chris Jarvis,"April 6, 2020",5, Excellent tool for learning a language. Very interactive and enjoyable. I find it much better than learning in a class or from other apps.
4205,Iwona Wilczek,"April 20, 2020",4, It is very helpful app to learn new language by nice and easy way
4206,Kannagi,"March 7, 2020",4, A good free app for vocab and basic grammar. Poor replacement for a good textbook or course. Strictly supplementary but very fun to have as a little motivator. Could do with more individual control and intensive grammar drills.
4207,Murray ix,"February 20, 2020",5," Great tool for learning a new language. Would reccomend using multiple apps for serious study, but dulingo is a must have! The frequent positive reinforcement is very effective, and gives the app a game feel. A great app all around."
4208,Michelle Simpson,"February 21, 2020",5," I really enjoy the fun way of learning a new language. The free version has many advertisements, but it keeps it affordable for everyone. Besides the ads give you a moment to absorb what you have learned."
4209,Debora Simchayoff,"February 25, 2020",2," Its an ok app because when u get a question wring it just goes backwaords rather than training u on what to do to memorize, and than u have to do the same thing over and over and over, but i continue to use it because im in desperate need of learning hebrew in tine for my bas mitzvah"
4210,Anjali Tagalpallewar,"April 7, 2020",5, Best and fantabulous app.I loved it very much n its very interesting to learn the international languages and have fun😀. Best way of learning any language. It is the fantastic and fabulous app ever seen by me.

4213,Bunny 10944,"March 11, 2020",4, Geat for learning new languages or even just doing a fresh up to get back into it only complaint is that they have this one ad that never goes away it just sits on the screen without giving you an option to close it.
4214,F Frouzesh,"April 28, 2020",4," This app was very useful but recently many errors occurred when I use this app,please fix it"
4215,Theresa Pueringer,"March 25, 2020",5," This is an amazing program! It breaks things down and makes you feel so accomplished when you do it right! On top of that, you can practice multiple language. It's neat!!!!!!"
4216,Shannon Swanson,"April 29, 2020",5," Free, minimal adds, gradual increase in learning, fun"
4217,Mary Udo,"April 7, 2020",5, I love it. This makes learning languages so much fun. I would prefer a dialogue section where two friends can interact verbally to improve speaking.
4218,Danvir Ramesar,"April 7, 2020",5, It made learning German absolutely easy and easy to commit to it daily. I think this app is a way in the right direction for learning a different language.
4219,John A,"February 21, 2020",5, I'm learning so much more through this app tha I ever did in language class. Honestly the app attacks language learning from many different ways that an in class experience doesn't accomplish and in a very efficient way. Truly worth every penny!!!!
4220,haki ni maisha,"February 13, 2020",5, This app is amazing and easy to use the content is relevant and user friendly. I have learnt to speak Spanish in less than a month and every day I am learning new things courtesy of this free learning app which gives you the freedom to learn at your own pace

Are these, I am a woman, I am a girl, I am Anna, I am Julia, or something along those lines. It doesn't seem to matter what gender identity you are and what you're name is. If I am a Male the first phrases I should learn are I am a man, I am ""my name"". Not some generic wording I won't be using."
4222,No one important,"March 7, 2020",3, Great app however dislike the fact you have limited amount of lives unless you pay monthly for premium which I am unable to pay for as a student and sure others may feel the same about the price. Feels more like a game with the lives instead of it being educational
4223,Anna Belle,"February 29, 2020",2, I loved it until you cut literally over half of the exercises. I paid pro version and I regret it. Once it expires I will remove the app fully (unless you guys decide to get it back to normal).
4224,J N,"March 4, 2020",5, Good free learning! Occassional ads are understandable because it helps keep the price of the app at zero. Lots of options plus leaderboards and boosts to keep things interesting. Makes learning seem kind of like a game
4225,Eric Beaudoin,"March 23, 2020",5," The most fun app game I've played during this quarantine. Few intrusive adds, lots of options, even the ability to follow your friends. Best part is, I'm actually learning something. Highly recommended"
4226,Jack Tanner,"March 31, 2020",3," It does a good job of teaching a certain language but it gets to the point where if you mess up one time no matter how small the mistake you must go through several ""warm up"" questions just to restart that whole lesson you were just in."
4227,Dolola Ava,"March 28, 2020",5," Pretty nice and straightforward. My biggest recommendation is having a notebook nearby you, so you can write down things you struggle with. When learning Spanish the word bolígrafo (pen) kept throwing me off."
4228,Julie Smith,"April 22, 2020",5, I am surprised to talk in sentences in another language so quickly.
4229,Nicolai Alexis Mina,"April 9, 2020",5," It is very helpful, if you are going to download it, may i suggest that you subscribe to pro on your first week. You will not get disappointed. Enjoy learning"
4230,Aleksandra Pavic Panic,"April 17, 2020",5, I am very satisfied with this app and I would like to recommend it as a great way to learn a foreign language.
4231,Tooba Iqbal,"April 19, 2020",1," Why app stucked without nay reason, i was learning from it rely fast and then it stop by showing loading n loadimg, kindly fix it"
4232,Lyndis Swinden,"April 22, 2020",5," Easy, pleasant and fun. I like the way it encourages me as I go, like a friend or teacher, but without pressure."
4233,Briana Taylor,"March 24, 2020",4," It's a good language app. I'm a bit bummed that you need WiFi for it, but it's still awesome. I'm much better at German now and still continue to learn on Duolingo! I hope you find it as great as I do!"
4234,Magaret Bih,"February 8, 2020",5, The app is so good. I started with Spanish and have learn a lot already. It is simple and very easy to use. I like the corrections you get and the explanations too. Great work...
4235,kasey cook,"February 19, 2020",5," This is a very good app if you want to learn a new language for any reason. It's easy to understand and very interesting. They make multiple ways to further engage you, even if just a competition. This is a very useful app."
4236,CowLoverMatt,"February 20, 2020",2, Great way to learn. Horrible user experience. The ad styles and the way they push premium down your throat. The notifications that guilt you 3 times a day. Theres just a lot wrong with this app compared to when it was a total Chad a couple years ago.
4237,Yaki Meller,"February 18, 2020",5," This is a good app for learning a language, though it's not that great when it comes to teaching the ABC of a language. There are various exercises one can practice and there is a forum one can consult with."
4238,jj whocares,"February 19, 2020",4, It's very good and helps you learn but they need to add a reset button because for example what if you stop for awhile and get back into without knowing much and your so far already it's very hard so if they added a reset button it would be alot better I'd say
4239,Anna Pilipovic,"February 27, 2020",4, Still love the app but I don't like it as much as I did before it was updated. Like now we can only do things on the paid version that we were able to do before when the paid version and update didn't exist
4240,Elaine Todd,"February 16, 2020",3," Good app, but is for South Wales. This is not made clear and is no good if you want speak the North Wales dialect as it is completely different. There needs to be a North Wales version."
4241,Emnet mehari,"February 21, 2020",4, Been having quite a lot of layout issues lately with some choices overlapping each other or just getting underneath the buttons but the app is good and these are issues I can usually work around. Though à fix would be pretty great.
4242,Christian Sjöstedt,"April 11, 2020",5," Fun and learning combined in a ""memory""-esque type learning experience"
4243,Simon Robbins,"March 7, 2020",5, Really good way to learn but would be even better with a British option so underground would be accepted instead of subway and petrol instead of gas etc. It's a bit annoying to keep getting things wrong because I forget to speak American.
4244,Neetu Sharma,"March 11, 2020",4, Very nice app to learn any language. It's fun and easy. 👌👌👌But one thing is only not good in this app is that the achievement section Doesn't load when I open the app. Please work on that.
4245,Ruth Thomas,"March 4, 2020",5," Easy to use. Works in small steps so I can easily fit it into every day. A good amount of reading writing listening and speaking, giving an all round learning experience."
4246,Raymond Griffin,"March 9, 2020",4," Very easy to use, just needs to adjust for level a little better. I took an entry test and got a perfect score, so it should have started me at intermediate to advanced."
4247,Bhavin Sarvaiya,"April 17, 2020",5, Best app I've come across. I am learning french. It's easy to learn. The concept is very good. I love it.
4248,Kevin Hill,"March 6, 2020",5," Very good,I'm just starting to learn the German language and it's so easy with everything explained. And it's hints that help masculine and feminine and nutral understanding of the same word"

Mostly have been learning a lot. I do have a little trouble hearing the sounds we don't have in English. My only other challenges are that the sight words and new vocabulary are almost mutually exclusive and that at my level there are a few letters they haven't gotten to yet.
4250,Jennifer R,"March 10, 2020",4," Easy to learn, hard to master. This app helps you learn a language though some of it appears to be incorrect, and sometimes the pronunciation is off. But all around an okay way to learn conversational language skills"
4251,Joe Whittheo,"March 13, 2020",5," Lots of interest, still not sure if it's really good for conversational since I'm only starting the intro but its diverse with reading , speaking, and listening activities. Great job."
4252,Paschal Ssebbowa,"March 18, 2020",4, Very good and fun. Thanks. I wish you could do offline modules. And also I wish we could connect and be able to chat/talk with the friends we meet in the leaderboards to practice the languages
4253,Carpus Thorsix,"March 14, 2020",5," I find the aggressive messages to study, charming. Great app though with a very good balance. Make sure to read the tips before starting a lesson to establish the building blocks."

An older version of the app was orally based and the words would appear on the scream, you got formula with the spelling as you progressed. This version is asking you to spell from the start, and if your spelling is slightly out your failing that test. Apart from that fact it is a good app and only one of a very few that is promoting Welsh."
4255,Johannes Xu,"March 16, 2020",4, Best language learning app I have come across. Ads are pretty balanced and nonintrusive. Would wish for the listening snippets to be higher in quality in many langauges. Hopefully offline learning could be made more accessible.
4256,Nkechi Oguno,"March 11, 2020",4," Duolingo drips awesomeness. I have learned a lot in a short while. It's vast, pronounces the French words correctly as well. I just wished there could be extra lessons for those that are not using Duolingo plus. It's a great app trust me."

I tried reporting the problem everytime i get these questions, but still nothing happened. Fix it!"
4258,FarAway1990,"March 17, 2020",5, Amazing app. Love using it. Learned so much so far. What's more important I am able practice two languages at once by learning the Spanish in English where my native language is neither one of them:) its an option for the ones liking challenge:)
4259,Parker Erich,"March 24, 2020",3, The content is really good but the heart system is frustrating to navigate. I can't tell if it will be worth investing in the premium version because the free version has been irritating.
4260,mckinis lache,"March 19, 2020",1, They act like they don't want to refund me my money I cancelled the subscription on the same day that the trial ended. It's ashame a good app I'll never use again because its money hungry. All this going on in the world do you think I want to spend $90 on an app???????
4261,Thomas Ordway,"March 24, 2020",5," Smooth interface, very polished. Makes learning quick and easy. Free version has ads but they are only 5 seconds and don't effect the experience. Enjoying myself so far and learning along the way."
4262,Patricia Round,"March 26, 2020",4, Pros: Great app to keep motivated and engaged with language learning. Tons of different languages to choose from. Free! Cons: Not great for understanding and acquiring grammatical structures. Correct word order seems to equal comprehension.
4263,Roxxy Geisenheimer,"March 24, 2020",5, Best app to learn Greek. Hands down. ♥️ I've tried so many programs over the years and nothing compares. Ads are minimal and unobtrusive. All necessary functions to learn are available in the free version. Thank you.
4264,Akash Kharote,"March 26, 2020",5, This is the most effective and easy to use app to learn any language. I've been using deolingo since past week now and my confidence has boosted a lot!! plus the UI of the app is really attractive. Thumbs up for the makers!!
4265,David Howdle,"March 27, 2020",4," It's good for basic training, especially the way it encourages you to review past learning. However I with there was a straightforward vocabulary trainer and something to help me learn about nuances such as cases etc."
4266,Don & Cheri Kruse,"March 30, 2020",5, For a free opportunity to learn Spanish I love it!! I wish I could do more practice sessions though when I run out of hearts for the day. The ads aren't disruptive for me since the course is free.
4267,Jacob McDonald,"March 28, 2020",4," Great app, but please add our own XP back to the friends list so we can easily compare and compete with friends! This seems to have been removed in the March update. Otherwise loving the app."
4268,Niloofar Zare,"March 27, 2020",5," I love it, it's so useful and entertaining. Lots of practices make it such a game for everyone to learn a new language. The only annoying thing is all those advertisements between lessons..."
4269,Molly Sarver,"April 1, 2020",5, Good for beginners or people looking to practice/maintain what they learned in school. Makes it a game so it isn't a chore to practice each day.
4270,S Pepper,"April 4, 2020",1," Very raw app with a tons of ads. UX are awful, i need to roll up and down a keyboard every time when i need to press button, and why i need to confirm continue? Arrrrgh! So angry!"
4271,Charles Monaghan,"April 2, 2020",3, Very happy to learn with duo. More simple explanations would ge good. Some of the speakers are not very clear. It would be good to put stories in more languages eg Italian.
4272,Nelson,"April 7, 2020",2, Broken sound lessons. Often say the wrong words. Too easy and more of memory based learning. Not very useful in the long run.
4273,Sky Glimmer,"April 8, 2020",5, This app is one the best educational apps at the market. I genially recommend this app to all beginners and advanced-ones!
4274,Juan Vargas,"April 8, 2020",4, All is good. It may be more difficult because have a lot of help in the exercises. Also a good idea is to make us have conversations.
4275,Terina Archargee,"April 11, 2020",5, This app is very good and it helped me to understand French a lot easier in a Fun and exciting way. Best language learning app I have came across 😊❤️
4276,Michael Aldridge,"April 11, 2020",5, Duo lingo is perfect to learn a language if you can afford to go premium it's worth it for no adverts

4280,Holly Clarke,"April 9, 2020",5, It is a great way to learn different languages for free and it encourages children to learn
4281,red m0th,"April 10, 2020",5," Best way to learn a new language. Obviously you should use supplemental resources, but daily exercises will make you more than capable if you make it to the end."
4282,Maritza Sanchez,"April 11, 2020",5, It's very helpful to have Doulingo teaching for free. And now that we are having difficulty with the corb19 it's a good way to get through this
4283,Steven Sim,"April 12, 2020",5, Excellent app. Used it for a week and I'm thoroughly impressed.
4284,Brianna Stephanie,"April 13, 2020",4, This app is amazing. I love how I can learn multiple languages at a time.
4285,Mike Kutz,"April 16, 2020",5, Excellent language app ... encouraging short lessons .. whets your appetite to learn more
4286,TechPro 35,"April 16, 2020",3," I liked this sooo mucchhh..... but now how would you learn languages if you can do only 5 mistakes andduo will say before: ""you learn on mistakes"" but now it does not make sense please put it back to normal!🙏"
4287,kayla t,"April 18, 2020",5," Its really easy to follow, barley any ads, gives reminders and have short stories u can read in the language you're trying to learn. I really enjoy this app"
4288,Lisa Davies,"April 20, 2020",4," Brilliant for learning, although easy to loose your lives quick, so you have to wait a while before continuing."
4289,D H,"April 16, 2020",4, Great app but I lose sound on some Korean lessons and makes some lessons more difficult
4290,Zuzana Hoeppner,"April 23, 2020",5," Love using this app. Even my 8year old loves ""playing"" on it. And we're learning together while having great fun."

4296,Vesna Zarak,"April 29, 2020",5, Exellent way to learn various languages at your own pace.
4297,Mmedara Affia,"February 28, 2020",5, It's not possible to stop learning a language or restart the program of one. The sound doesn't work properly. And it'll be lovely if you add African languages. It would also be helpful if there are writing lessons for languages with their own characters.
4298,Liudmila Mitsevich,"March 31, 2020",5," Excellent friendly training. If to use some additional theory the learning process would be perfect. I learned English, now get started German with Duo. Happy and excited by reading and understanding a joke in German in a few days after the very beginning!"
4299,Shyama Prosad Banerjee,"March 15, 2020",3," Earlier I had given it a 5 star but now after the recent updates, the tips are missing and the exercises with suggestions are not working properly. Please fix these two issues."
4300,YuYu,"March 22, 2020",5, I have a problem dealing with microphone it doesn't work I uninstalled the app and installed it again I didn't work please try to solve this problem. Why you didn't solve my problem???!
4301,Or Solomon,"March 12, 2020",5," best learning app, the only thing that I see enquires improvement is that after any checkpoint there is no need to practice every few days about previous lessons. It should stay ""gold"" for much more time."
4302,Zack,"February 15, 2020",1, 2020: idk what happened but this app won't use my microphone even tho it has permissions and I did a fresh install. I know my mic works because I just made a phone call. Now I can't use it anymore. 😔
4303,Jordan Gibbard,"February 9, 2020",5," Wonderful tool for learning a language (or more than one if you're feeling bold). If you're serious about learning a language, this is certainly worth a try to have a great learning experience especially if you're on the go."
4304,THE LONE WOLF WOLFGANG,"February 29, 2020",1, The app is good but all there is too many ads and why is there hearts when you miss a question it makes no sense to have that then they want you to wait to get your hearts back or use gems how are am I supposed to spend gems on hearts if I want play because of hearts it's stupid
4305,Ryan,"March 3, 2020",1," Nice audio ads. Garbage app, pushed it over the edge. The app has always had missing audio, incorrect audio, general mistakes and typos. And you'll never master a language with how shallow the material is."
4306,Lisa Ferris,"March 12, 2020",4," Very helpful, and the continual review is great to reinforce learning. Only complaint is the broken levels if you miss a few days, which is bound to happen."
4307,Jesse Campbell,"March 18, 2020",5, Love this app! I used the free version for about a year and learned to comprehend Russian and speak supplementary because of their teaching dynamic! I have used 3 other language applications and didn't learn nearly as much. I would %100 recommend the paid for version.
4308,Ysabelle Garcia,"March 25, 2020",5," this was probably the most helpful app for me. It has many courses for me to learn, and I really like it. You can invite a friend and you both can achieve rewards and be rivals in leaderboard lol"
4309,Chenoa'z Drawingz,"April 25, 2020",5, This app is perfect for the people that want to learn a new language. Its easy and fun to use. I highly recommend you use this app to learn any language. Rifhr now im learnin spanish and i have been on a 16 day streak! Its very easy to use. Definitly worth five stars 👏
4310,Brooke Farley,"March 19, 2020",5," Probably the best app to start learning a language. It's also good how even though there are hearts that you loose when you make a mistake you can earn them back by practising , so you'll get more practice where you need it."
4311,Curtis Shaw,"March 14, 2020",4," Enjoying the app so far. I would like a way to review the vocabulary within the app, such as a list of nouns with their articles in German, but still a great app. I definitely recommend."

When the 4th level hits, they start using vocabulary they never touched base on before. The most frustrating, ridiculous system if you're actually trying to learn a language... To be docked from your only 5 allowed mistakes for the day. On words you didn't have a chance with. Seriously considering other apps.. And ditching this one. Do you guys even test?.."
4313,Joy B,"March 30, 2020",5," I love this app, I use it every day for a quick lesson and I am learning a lot! The only thing i wish is that there were more things to do with my accumulated lingots, I have so many and nothing to spend them on 💜"
4314,Jessica Conley,"February 17, 2020",5," I love this app. I learn a lot and the ads are not too annoying. I knew a little Spanish going into this, but grammar always tripped me up. This app has helped with that."
4315,Jeromaya Ada,"March 23, 2020",5," Love this language learning app, one of the best out there. Always loved using duolingo, but the reason for the 5 stars is because of the customer support center which replies via email ASAP. Great customer service always wins."
4316,Joshua Owens,"February 25, 2020",5," It is very user friendly, kind of like a game, although retaining your hearts and earning them when the time is right causes even more memory retention for your chosen language."
4317,Sunayan Mukherjee,"March 11, 2020",5, Wonderful app to learn any new language. It has numerous exercises to enhance the skills. The listening and speaking tasks too give us a better way to understand the language.
4318,TimBee100,"March 15, 2020",3," It's free so you can get started but eventually, you find you are just guessing what word to use. It doesn't explain when to use one word and when to use another so it gets frustrating."
4319,Jacqueline Burns,"April 26, 2020",5," Great all, especially if you want to brush up on a language you may have learnt previously."
4320,km im,"April 29, 2020",1," Incomplete App: More over 15 billion people speaks world's oldest classical language Tamil, is not included in this app is unfortunate. No option to choose English language. Tamil is official language in many countries including India."

4322,Shannon Fox,"April 14, 2020",5, So many languages and in an awesome user friendly format!
4323,Srimoyee Maiti,"February 23, 2020",5," I have been using it for years. But some times right answers are shown as wrong. They have a option ""My answer should have been accepted"". But I think this particular matter should be looked after."
4324,Matt Bizzle,"March 4, 2020",4, The only problem I have is that my progress for the sharpshooter challenge is not updating. I am stuck on 10/20 lessons completed with no mistakes and I definitely have done more than that.

4326,Lena Raffa,"March 3, 2020",5, A great fun app. I love the reminders and the learning process is fun. I like the way you can go back for revision. All Up i use it regularly and the only app ive stuck with.
4327,Ryan Michael,"March 8, 2020",5," Very good for freshening up on prior language skills, and perfect for learning a new language from the ground up. The right amount of repition and variety in exercises is great. Would recommend!"
4328,Jessica Ross,"March 28, 2020",5," I don't really care for it being like a game (you have to earn hearts and gems), but otherwise it's great. Very easy to use and to learn from. I might try a few different languages from this app."
4329,Andrew Hur,"March 27, 2020",5," How can you not love the app. All the features are free, it's comprehensive with a plethora of languages, and the best part, is the cute green owl! He definitely did not get me to write this review! Enjoy the app!!!"
4330,Theresa Rose-Chambers,"April 6, 2020",5, I love it. My experience with it was amazing. For I was given the assignment to learn French and it helped a lot. I am almost fluent in French and I have been using it for A month or 2 now. Download it for you won't regret it.
4331,Nathaniel Parker,"April 4, 2020",5," The app is used friendly. It makes learning gradual and easy, so sticking with learning a language is practical for a working person with not a lot of time."
4332,Will Sutherland,"March 28, 2020",3," I really enjoy using it however I dislike having to earn hearts to keep learning. I don't even mind the ads, but having to wait to earn more hearts and having to wait out gets annoying."

4340,kalpana bhargava,"April 24, 2020",5," Great. Promotes competitive learning, you may get dangerously hooked if not careful."
4341,mark lepka,"February 6, 2020",3, I like it a lot. But if you have a limit of how much lessons you can do in a row or a limit of how many times you can get the answer wrong don't you think that would be really annoying if you are just really bad a learning that language
4342,JEFF H,"February 8, 2020",5," It helps me a lot with learning. But i would say if you want to actually take in the information, you should write it down and take your time. I don't really like the hearts but it's understandable. But still a very good app! :)"

4344,Giovanni Coronado,"February 12, 2020",1," Doesn't include the ""tips"" for each lesson that go over critical grammatical points needed to understand the lessons. The tips are available on the website but not in the app, making the app mostly useless, and this has apparently been a known issue for over four years."
4345,fullma Gilla,"February 19, 2020",4, Makes language learning into a bit of a game so that's addictive and probably a good thing. It would be nice to have an option to decide whether you actually got it wrong or whether you just made an error when you were typing.
4346,Sneha,"February 15, 2020",4," The app is great. I am learning French and Korean both. I wish they would give an option to mute the "" ting"" sound after every correct answer that really is loud for my ears."
4347,Justin Pierce,"February 14, 2020",5," It's a great service, but much better on a tablet. The tablet highlights new words, and is a much more open experience. I struggled to type in answers on my phone"
4348,Kene,"February 12, 2020",4," Can you guys make a pronunciation search tab, where we can look for specific words and practice pronouncing them perfectly. It could even have a auto play function where the specific word would play 10x times or something like that. Please consider this"

The multiple choice questions tend to guide you to the right answers. The speaking exercises feel unforgiving at times... like... I know my accent is bad, however there are times that I knooooow they know what I'm saying"
4350,Louisa Burnell,"February 19, 2020",5, Excellent app!! I have only been doing this for 11 days (learning Italian) and I am SO amazed with my progress! Duolingo makes learning languages really fun and simple to learn. I would definitely recommend to everyone who wants to learn a new language. LOVE IT! Thank u Duolingo
4351,Alan Perry,"February 23, 2020",4," Easy and fast way to learn any language. There are a lot of ads, but they are not intrusive and one is awarded gems for watching them anyways. Overall, very good!"
4352,Haroun Varden,"February 15, 2020",3," This application has lots of potential. My main annoyance for this application is the lack of languages. I would rate this app 5 stars if it had a variety of different languages to choose from, like Thai."
4353,Rys,"February 26, 2020",5," Super easy to use. Gives a good mixture of listening, reading, typing and translating both ways. Lots of different languages and language imputs and free to boot! Top notch app!!!"
4354,Richard Pennenga,"February 23, 2020",4, I'm grateful for this app; I think the repetition is perfect. I'm disappointed with the ads but I acknowledge that right now I'm getting a pretty terrific something for almost nothing.
4355,Juri Etto,"February 23, 2020",5," Good tool to get started and especially alongside other language studies. Keeping the habit is easier with having this in the schedule, even if it isn't enough by itself in the long term."
4356,Evan Bland,"February 23, 2020",5," This program is great. Even with only 10 minutes a day, I find myself recalling my previous lessons and words already learned. The lessons are enjoyable and easy; if you want a new language skill, this is your app"
4357,Kael Standeven,"February 25, 2020",4," Great app! Lots of languages and great progressive stages! I am having a weird bug though, the oral questions are not coming up anymore and my settings tab wont open for me to turn them back on. Thoughts?"
4358,Preethi Dechamma,"February 28, 2020",5, This app is really good. I love to learn languages and this app is very useful for me. It helps us to learn and practice how many ever times we want. Very happy to use this app. And it's totally freeeeeee
4359,Flavour Month,"April 14, 2020",3," Duolingo is super good! Learning German is so nice! But it automatically uninstalls itself , pls fix it, so not 5 stars but not 1 or 2"
4360,Stella Fairy,"March 12, 2020",5," I just bought a new tablet (samsung A10.1) and I have a problem with hearing voices, I do not know weather it is because of my TTS engine, would you please help me? I can not learn anything while I hear nothing:("
4361,Alexander Galejev,"February 12, 2020",5," If you want to learn a new language, this app is definitely the way to go. Its free and teaches very well, with basic phrases at the start and then slowly beginning to add more complex grammar."
4362,TJSanson ActorModel,"February 23, 2020",5, Great way to learn languages. The 'multiple choice' method of translating words and sentences helps you to learn and remember much easier than standard language learning. A++++++++
4363,Julie Cresap,"February 26, 2020",3," I like it, but don't like to be forced to type out what is said. My brain struggles with spelling, and I just give up on the lesson all together because of, there is no option to skip."
4364,Benjamin Holt,"March 4, 2020",1, Recently began running LOUD video ads that automatically play with the volume up. Ads I understand and can deal with. Automatically playing sounds during them is total garbage and I'm done until that is corrected.
4365,Sam Miles,"March 9, 2020",4," Fun app, would definitely like an option to listen to the language before the written words are shown. Other than that, it is a great way to get an introduction to learning a language."
4366,Jenni Bekker,"February 21, 2020",4," So many languages yet it doesn't offer Portuguese, only Brazilian. Such a disappointment and hard to understand why? A beautiful app otherwise, and I love the edition of the stories. If only it was available in my target language, Portuguese.... from Portugal."
4367,Kevin Mitchell,"March 1, 2020",5," An excellent and entertaining way of learning a language. It teaches the language comprehensively teaching reading, writing, pronunciation and listening. Really impressive."
4368,Justin Poole,"February 13, 2020",4," I'm learning German just for fun and Duolingo has made it enjoyable and easy. I can learn at my own pace wherever and whenever I want. However, the price for the paid membership is slightly steep."
4369,Cesar Hernandez,"March 21, 2020",5," I have three days using this tool and I think that It's excellent for to lesrn English. It''s the first time that I find to a very different and effective method. I hope to learn to speak fluently as soon as possible. God Bless Luis anda Duolingo Team , creator of this great idea."
4370,Nay Htet Phyo,"April 23, 2020",5, Very helpful to me. I learn Spanish as an absolute beginner with this app and it's a great app.
4371,Stu Puppy,"March 21, 2020",4," Liking the app, as of writing this review I'm only learning French and is difficult, but liking it. But it would be better if Duo wouldn't pop out when I'm learning, it screws with my pace."
4372,Shaun Fernandes,"April 24, 2020",5, Real learning. Totally free. Great interface.
4373,Mark de Waal,"April 25, 2020",4, It's fun...seems like the free lessons do not keep your progress well documented however
4374,Michelle Ramsdell,"March 10, 2020",5," I love this app. It makes learning fun and easy. I learned about it from my son, whose wife and both kids are learning new languages along with him. It's awesome seeing my grandchildren having fun and learning at the same time. And it doesn't matter how old you are, it's still easy to learn."
4375,YEGANEH MOUSAVI,"March 30, 2020",4," It's an excellent app to learn new languages easy and fun. I learned basic French very well so far. But in Arabic some letters such as ""و"" have two sounds ; for ""و"" they are ""w"" and ""ou"". Some times when it's ""ou"" Duolingo speaks it as ""w""."
4376,M Hogan,"April 3, 2020",2," Good to help learn but neglect important info to learn such as first, second, and third person's lingo or adds new words at random with punctuation that isn't explained. Makes it hard to really learn new language."
4377,Kitty Noir,"April 9, 2020",5," So, I had this app before, and I liked it, but I saw too many memes and thought the owl was out to get me, so I got rid of it. I re-downloaded it recently, and I absolutely love it! It let me pick up where I left off, and it's much easier than my school's French program."
4378,Juan Peralez,"April 10, 2020",5, Its seems like a great way to learn a new language and there are so many to choose from.
4379,Ethanrobyn@gmail.com Ethan,"April 9, 2020",4, I enjoyed it and it is really helping me but I don't like the hearts feature.
4380,Jan Svoboda,"March 12, 2020",4, The lessons are sorted extremely badly because for example when i want to practice colours i cant. I have to go to shopping where there are red green and white and then just search for colours in random lessons its just really unpractical the same is for numbers
4381,scarlett Bergman,"April 19, 2020",3, It would be nice if it had .pre verbal pronunciation sections
4382,Muskaan Shaikh,"April 16, 2020",5, It's one of the best apps I have ever come across .. everything is free and makes language learning so much more easier and funn..I love this app ❤️
4383,Kerim Kolberg,"April 19, 2020",5, Cool app for learning but sometimes you need more explanation for the Grammer and so on.
4384,Jeremy Thatcher,"March 30, 2020",5," Yes, it language learning at it's most basic... that's where one has to start!😉 It offers so much for free. I find the ""Tip"" section before each language the most beneficial part."
4385,Clint No Last,"March 28, 2020",5," This is a great app!

I have recommended it to all my friends, one friend and I currently planning on both learning french, I'm already taking it, so we can prank a mutual friend by randomly speaking French and pretending nothing happened. If you're looking for an app to learn a new language, it's right here."
4386,Saurabh Nikhare,"April 25, 2020",5, Learning made easy.. need to include more spoken language experience within the levels
4387,Eve Miaris,"April 23, 2020",3, I'm enjoying it but keep running out of hearts and don't know how to fix that.
4388,Evie Dean,"February 18, 2020",3," Good. Helps learning basic phrases in many languages (I'm currently doing French, Italian and Greek). Lags badly and crashes sometimes but overall positive experience. Weekly reports are helpful too."
4389,Elizaveta Micallef,"March 6, 2020",5," Very good app, makes you repeat new words and sentences in new language and a specially those where you made mistake, to make sure you learned. I wish there was an option to study Maltese language."
4390,Luis Green,"March 27, 2020",5," Duolingo is probably the best app you can find to learn a new language, it makes learning a new language fun and easy and it's free, being someone who decided to get the premium for it I gotta say I highly recommend it as it's at a reasonable price."
4391,Anghellic Gamer,"March 27, 2020",4, I like this app. But its a little repetative. Not that it shouldnt be. But sometimes the same test i took for lesson 1 is pretty much the exact test for lesson 5. And you should give 10 hearts for free instead of 5.
4392,Nour andalebha,"March 30, 2020",5, I think it's a very good app but i hope when i first start to learn the test should be at the end of each step not at the begining because i learn the language for my first time so of course i don't know the letters to test me at the begining
4393,PartyFac3,"April 5, 2020",5," Great app and barely any ads but i wanted to add a fictional language its from skyrim :elder scrolls and in the previous series its in the game in books and spoken by powerful dragons and dragonborns its called ""dragon tongue"""
4394,Stephen Green,"April 5, 2020",4, Overall this is a good learning app so far. It could use more speaking opportunities as most students want to speak the language rather than write it.
4395,Yael Zuravel,"March 21, 2020",5, Its very fun to learn another language using this app. You dont get ads every 5 seconds but there are ads because its free. I recomend it to anyone who is trying to learn another language as youre stuck at home.
4396,Kyl barry,"March 18, 2020",1," Rushed app with a poor approach to learning languages, plentiful mistakes, no customer service, too much focus on useless outside of language things I.e leaderboards, harsh check algorithm and quantity over quality in terms of trying to cater to so many languages."
4397,TonKumaTsu,"March 24, 2020",5," Not only teaches new vocabulary, it teaches it in a way that the lesson you learned back in level 1 will be applied to levels 2, 3 and so on. Very methodical, and very well crafted."
4398,Jon,"March 5, 2020",3, Its good and helps you learn from scratch. It is buggy when it comes to gems and might take some and not give you the reward. Has a heart system which is unnecessary. Small misspellings are punished.
4399,vishal sapkal,"March 22, 2020",5, Awesome!! it is a really fun app and totally free !!!! I have a streak of 124 days as of writing this review and frankly it's the best thing I have come across on play store !
4400,Asma Manzoor,"April 7, 2020",5, Awesome app to learn any language. Gives special focus to grammer.Lessons are repeated several times to better learn the words. Love to use it. Highly recommended.
4401,Kartiki Bhandari,"April 2, 2020",4," Really great & informative app for language learning. Just one suggestion, please try to provide certificates as well after completion of learning of any language."
4402,Nathalie Borejon,"March 29, 2020",5, It is very easy to use and fun at the same time. I can learn new languages easily while not getting bored. I've learned a lot from this app! So I highly recommend this to everyone if you want to learn a language♡.
4403,Abby's K-POP Corner,"March 31, 2020",5, Very helpful. I just want to request to enable users to drag the words around esp for beginner level. Sometimes I prefer to put in the words I already know and put the verb last when translating korean to english.
4404,Kyle Tyson,"April 17, 2020",4, It crashed three times in 8 minutes. Can u guys fix it asap thank u in advance.
4405,Hữu Hiệp Production,"April 29, 2020",5," Duolingo is very user friendly, it has a big language pool, i personally like it :D"
4406,Halima Sani,"April 9, 2020",4, I really like this app. It helps learn languages. The only problem is that with the Arabic language there are some faults. Other than that I really like it as I am learning Spanish. 😊
4407,Vince Forrester,"April 9, 2020",5, Really easy to use and understand it makes it fun to learn.
4408,arandomsanti,"April 10, 2020",5, Amazing. It got better since my last duolingo adventure too. So easy to learn through
4409,Rachel S,"February 15, 2020",3, Would be fantastically helpful to have an English based pronunciation with words that don't use the English alphabet. It's very difficult to hear the correct pronunciation of a lot of words and phrases.
4410,Charlie Gray,"April 25, 2020",4, So its great but to be able to speak the language in full sentences to people is something you should work on.
4411,Bo Downey,"February 13, 2020",5," If you're starting out and feel clueless about a language, you wont find a better free option. Easy to fit into a packed schedule, no in app purchases shoved in your face, and good ad spacing."
4412,Noor ul Huda,"February 20, 2020",4," I started using this app a few days ago, and I'm enjoying it. It provides convenient ways to learn a desired language. Also I like this Owl❤ it's kind of cute and unique and I like this concept too when it appears and boost up your courage."
4413,Daniel Richardson,"February 20, 2020",4," The gamification of duolingo makes it easier to put more time into it every day than alternatives. Using it on PC you learn to read a bit faster than speak, and on your phone the opposite is true."
4414,Alett-Marie Burger,"February 19, 2020",4," I used it previously and found the lack of explanations of some language structure points frustrating, but now it has been really greatly improved and I feel I'm learning a lot more!"
4415,Richard Castro,"February 10, 2020",5, I appreciate having this outlet to expand my pursuits of language comprehension at the ease of an app. Love the competition features and the fact that the courses are well broken up to equally incentivize completion and practice.
4416,Claire Gregowicz,"February 11, 2020",5, I have been using this app daily for 230 days so far and I absolutely enjoy it. My comprehension is improving everyday. I moved from the free app version to Duolingo Plus and think the progress quizzes and other features are worth it.
4417,David W,"February 10, 2020",4," Still a beginner, but better than others overall, especially for sound and character- recognition so far. And free as long as you don't mind the free-quent nags."
4418,Stuart Watt,"February 12, 2020",5, Fun and addictive learning for everyone. Simple short quizzes with rewards to keep you coming back for more. Its amazing how much vocabulary you can build with a few minutes a day.
4419,Jonas Cooper,"February 25, 2020",2," This is a poorly made learning app, as it will changes the defenation of the words it ""teaches"" you without explaination, and spams you with ads for doulingo plus, qnd that is just the normal service but ad free, and expensive as hell for a free app."
4420,Jai Prakash Verma,"April 20, 2020",4, It is good but it may be better. It is helpful to learn other languages.
4421,Trevor C,"February 24, 2020",2," Wanted to learn Russian.

The problem with Duolingo is that it doesn't 'teach' anything, it just quizzes you over and over and you are supposed to learn from your mistakes. Which is a problem when you don't understand the basic rules of conjugation for a language. For instance, the Russian word for 'mother' can change depending on... something, but I don't know what that something is, and there is no instruction being given as to what it is. I just know that sometimes I get it wrong in the quiz."

I had an unbroken number of days built up using the weekend or single day to bridge the gaps in have gone on to do my lesson this evening and it first said I was back to 0 then it said I was on 97 days I also know that yesterday I had 176 lingots and today I have 250+ lingots I have no idea where they came from its also saying that it thinks I am on Saturday studying when it's still Friday clearly something has gone wrong and it's not from my end. I hope bug gets fixed
4423,Nico Gilbert-Igelsrud,"February 23, 2020",1," The app added loud, autoplaying, and unskippable ads. People are likely listening with the sound up to hear the language and the ads are often much louder than the voices. This is absolutely dispicable behavior."
4424,Paul Parker,"February 29, 2020",4, Wish there was more practice speaking. As well the male and female speaker pronounce words differently. That aside it's great as you can practice as much as you like.
4425,Betty Carilla,"February 20, 2020",5," I love the simple and fun experience in learning Japanese. Even when I couldn't practice for weeks, I get to easily remember the lessons because of their colorful and attractive visuals."
4426,Krissy,"February 28, 2020",1, Translations are not accurate. The developers literally admit in the discussion section that the system needs to be updated and is not accurate. Not to mention it constantly begs you to pay
4427,AgusCM,"February 23, 2020",5," Most useful app I have found for learning new languages. I'd still suggest writing all the tips down and regular study though, there is also a lot of tips in the online web that the app doesn't have and I recommend checking."
4428,Yogesh Maheshwari,"March 6, 2020",5," It's been a good experience so far, love the structured course and the leaderboards. I would love to see a community for folks at the same level on a language to discuss topics and learn faster together."
4429,robert wootton,"March 8, 2020",5, Amazing app. Have fun while you learn another language. Once you get about half way thru the first level you unlock ranked and it's cool to compete. Again amazing app.
4430,Марија Сидоренко,"March 4, 2020",5," amazing app. motivates you to learn a language. it is better if you have same very basic knowledge in the language you are trying to learn, but i think it might be doable anyway."
4431,Madeleine Bromley,"April 28, 2020",5, Good level language skill the daily reminder is helpful and I'm enjoying the sessions
4432,Mikey,"March 15, 2020",5, Feels natural to learn in this way. You find yourself remembering words automatically. By far the best method I've used so far and I have tried various other ones like Babbel Fish and Rosetta stone.
4433,Claire Conway,"March 11, 2020",5, Based on repetition so that you never have to make an effort to commit the words to memory. You feel like it's too easy and you're not learning anything but then you look at the list of words you now know and realise you've learned a lot.
4434,Arpita Tripathi,"March 17, 2020",5," This app makes learning so easy. For anyone who wishes to start learning a new language, this app takes you smoothly through the lessons, explaining words through listening, speaking and writing skills. Thanks Duo!"
4435,George Smith,"March 20, 2020",5," Brilliant app, totally different approach to learning languages from the way I was taught at school. A bit unnerving to get a new word without the meaning! Emphasis is on listening to get the sound"
4436,Pauline Irving,"April 2, 2020",4, This app makes the learning interesting and if your into goal setting go for it. I cannot always hear correctly the French pronunciation otherwise it would be a 5 star.
4437,Roya Eskandari,"April 1, 2020",3," Hi, Unfortunately I have a big problem with your app. On level up it doesn't work correctly. I don't have any sound!!!"
4438,S Dub Projects,"March 29, 2020",1, App is great but my partner has the iPhone version which constantly offers xp boosts and ramp up games making it impossible to enjoy competing together. Android users get no XP boost or ramp up games. The iPhone game rewards 40xp a game!!
4439,Susie Scott,"April 3, 2020",5," A very clear, steady way to learn from the start. Compounded information. A logical step, by step steady process. Easy to follow."
4440,Namita Chandra,"March 31, 2020",4, Really nice app if you want to learn a new language... Never forgets to remind ( in very creative ways actually) you to come back and rake 15 mins off from life to do something new... Will highly recommend it to you.😊

4442,SadLettuce,"April 19, 2020",4, Good learning environment. The mobile app needs improvment. I'm looking forward to it in the future!
4443,Madeleine Dupee,"April 5, 2020",4, I love this app and am learning Gaelic really quickly but I would like to say that please could you add in a list of words you've learnt just as a separate bit. It would really help in learning the language.
4444,Lalita Devi,"April 10, 2020",5," It is such a helful app for me.there are almost every language in it.if you want to learn any language with fun,just download it!"

4452,Sumaiya N,"April 3, 2020",4, It is a great app but the only thing keeping it from a 5 star is that when ever you make a mistake u lose a heart then u have to wait a long period of time for more hearts so u can practice again
4453,Matt Bowden,"April 3, 2020",5, Just using the free version and still finding it hugely helpful. Doesn't contain as much regional variations as I would like (I'm learning Spanish) but still very helpful

4456,Jessye Basham,"April 18, 2020",5, Very easy to learn how to use the app learning some languages on the other hand can be a challenge but they vlbreak it down quite well
4457,Ashley Stoltz,"April 27, 2020",4, I like it but it makes you feel like a monster when Duo says he misses you and you can't do your lesson that day
4458,Chintan Rasadiya,"April 24, 2020",5, Best app for new language learners... And Add chat feature for talk to other countries people .....

This app is helping me remember and recall all that I learned previously. It's excellent since it uses numerous different ways to help you remember words and how they are used. They take about 20 words/sectionand mix them into several sentences and questions. They have you take those words and match them and write them and speak them. You have to translate from Spanish to English and from English to Spanish. I really like this app on the go in my pocket.

The lessons jump past any alphabet pronunciation of each hangul and which are consonants vs vowels and how they're arranged (side by side or top bottom). Then once pronunciation is introduced for words/syllables the English letter sound associations don't match an English speakers fundamental understanding or use of English (ie ""we"" does not sound like ""weh"" to English speakers but Duolingo uses it instead of tried and true IPA)"

4586,HELLO it's me,"March 30, 2020",5," Its completely free,they have such and amazing languages to learn,personally I am learning Japanese and it's great. It's a whole new word and lettering system, but duolingo makes it easy and fun to learn"
4587,Kristian O'Neill,"March 22, 2020",5, Great app...doing it with my daughter as she's just started in an Irish school and so far working really well to make learning Irish together fun . Very different to when I was in school. A perfect example of technology well applied!
4588,Darla Saorsa,"April 2, 2020",4," It's an amazing app to learn languages on,but there is some issues with some of the audio, other than that it's a great app!"
4589,Paige Murray-Pearce,"April 8, 2020",5," It's really fun to do as it's set out like a game with different levels but, I've definitely leant more from this than I did when I was at school for GCSE."
4590,Megan Bray,"April 2, 2020",4, Very helpful however you have to notice key patterns yourself as it doesnt explain the differences between masculine and feminine words very easily. However very enjoyable
4591,elaine cain,"April 6, 2020",4, Easy to use. Needed to get the hang of 'hearts' system but lots of practice options to keep going on free version. Finding 10-15mins a day good ok.
4592,Rohan Mandal,"April 10, 2020",5, Very good language app! Teaching method is very Good!
4593,Dhruv Tandon,"April 20, 2020",5, It's amazing.... Just the thing I want that they should use different words also..
4594,Rachel Elizabeth,"March 17, 2020",5," I've enjoyed this app for a few years of part-time studies in Spanish and French. The interface is easy to use, the stories are a fun challenge and the leaderboard keeps me motivated to learn each day."
4595,Adrian Bermudez,"March 19, 2020",5, This makes learning a new language fun and I love that you can do it anywhere anytime and the comments that people can make are so useful. I'm sure there are things the app can improve but none come to mind for me.
4596,Linda Gaal,"March 22, 2020",4," Basically a good program, but for a novice some direction on the rules of grammar and tense of verb would help understanding. The after the fact discussions and explanations are moderately helpful."
4597,Katy Clough,"April 24, 2020",4, 10 minutes a day of easy fun vocabulary. We (1 adult & 2 children) have enjoyed learning Spanish and have gained a very basic level of conversation in just 4 weeks.
4598,Marjorie Gadue,"February 19, 2020",5," The repetition of grammar and vocabulary, in small phrases and sentences, is very helpful in learning a language. The app is easy to use and genuinely fun."
4599,akiko alexander,"February 15, 2020",3, Good because it is free. Does contain a lot of words you won't use. Also contains a lot of phrases that the Japanese wouldn't say or would say differently.
4600,Paula Jay,"February 22, 2020",5, Great app you can learn at your own pace and if you need to refresh existing skills you can jump straight to the test sections. Very good easy to use and you only need a few minutes.
4601,Kyle Grace,"February 19, 2020",5, It works! I'm 67 years old and did not believe I could learn a different language with my lousy memory; but I am! I probably have to practice more then most...but practice is free😊
4602,Marco Ramos,"February 23, 2020",4, Ssooo far it's been pretty easy. It's convenient to be able to just do a few minutes whenever i have time. Only thing I'm not keen on is the heart refill for mistakes.
4603,Negar Sardari,"February 25, 2020",5," I got the pro version, and it helps a lot with putting the fun in learning a language. It gets a bit repetitive at times, but that only means you'll actually remember the content."
4604,Jay 502i4,"February 25, 2020",5, Although not perfect it is a great app to get started in if you are wanting to learn a new language I give it 5 instead of 4 because even thought it has some flaws they are easily over thrown by the good things and the potential of this app
4605,Princess Mimi The Pug,"February 15, 2020",1," Could be really good but unfortunately the hearts system is extremely restrictive to your learning, there's no way of actually purchasing more lives unless it's with gems that take ages to build up."

It may start out difficult, but with partice you will learn to master the laguague of your choice, and right now it's free. I had tried other Spanish language course in the past, the kind of courses or progarms that expects you to jump right on the first day. With Duolingo, this app. Give you a small amount of words then, it incorporates those words into basic everyday sentences, often repeating those new words. I really love it"
4607,Kelly Vitiritti,"February 22, 2020",5, Absolutely love this app. Ads are infrequent and don't interrupt lessons. Very addictive! The stories are a lot of fun and help me check my learning.
4608,Chacko Cherackal,"February 25, 2020",1, It's a decent app but the latest update autoplays video advertisements *with* loud audio and forces you to wait several seconds before allowing you to exit. That's a deal breaker for me.
4609,Cameron Penner,"February 27, 2020",5," Very fun and helpful. I like the short lessons and how it makes me type, choose, listen to and say French throughout the lessons. Perfect for a beginner like me!"

I'm really satisfacted with it. I know it's about the language but I really like the possibility to change what my dear owl wear on the screen. May a few more option can make it more fun to pull back day bye day the person who not rly feel pressure to learn. Example a room for the owl and changeable decorations or buildable house for it."
4611,OvACoNfIDeNt,"March 22, 2020",1, Since latest update app crashes if phone screen goes to screensaver. Very frustrating!!!! Also pushes you to play every day. Don't fall for this. Learning anything needs a break.

It has been created so that anyone, regardless of their cognitive grade, can learn to speak a foreign language quickly. Its division in themes gives freedom to the apprentice. Its simple and enjoyable content push the student towards the conquest of the language. Their repetitions set and consolidate the content ... I am fascinated with this study program called Duolingo. Many CONGRATULATIONS to its creators. I am indebted to all of them."
4613,Colt,"February 28, 2020",5, Repetition is the key way to learning & this goes over different areas multiple times in different ways in order for you to learn a certain word and use them in sentences in a way to understand each one. Love this app
4614,Jason S,"February 24, 2020",3," It is a good app for learning grammar in a language. Unfortunately the volume level is a little too low, and when an ad comes on it blasts your ears off."
4615,Janet Fouweather,"February 24, 2020",4, I love the lessons. It's a great way to learn. I like the chance to have another go when you get things wrong. I don't understand the relevance of the XPs and why I sometimes get an email and sometimes don't.
4616,Robert Scott,"April 13, 2020",5, I love the easy availability and method of teaching.
4617,Aida Phelops,"March 3, 2020",5," Very well organized. As well as helping you progress, it keeps going over old stuff so you don't forget anything. Only criticism is that the last word sometimes gets cut off when listening."
4618,TUPA TUPA,"February 29, 2020",3, It's good but for beginners only.. if your level is intermediate it is not going anywhere. Also I think some of the sentences are a bit useless to know...
4619,Nystyler,"March 5, 2020",1," Pretty disappoint how easy it is. e.g. I know how to read Korean but in the excercise, it read the answer out loud. Or showing the picture of what the question asked for. Plus I had to start over at the level 1 even though I have chosen that I already know basic of that language."
4620,Wonk,"March 4, 2020",5," I think it's a great app, the way they do there adds is perfect, if it were any other way I would delete the app right away. I like that you have the option to have reminders on/off because I hate app reminders."
4621,Grace Cudjoe,"April 23, 2020",3, It's really awesome. My only problem is at some point I don't hear the sound of the word

4625,Dylan Heisler,"March 7, 2020",5," Great app, great program, easy to use and the ads are not intrusive. Use this to replace your time on social media and you'll be fluent in no time."
4626,Maryam Hoseini,"March 12, 2020",2, I used to love this app it was perfect but since few months ago I noticed that it no longer has any sound and it's compeletly mute and I wondered no one seems to care about this!!!!
4627,Tatiana DP,"March 15, 2020",5, Awesome. I enjoy the feedback every time you make a mistake. It repeats the question until you get it right. It is a very educational tool. Great job Duolingo!
4628,Andrew Kirigaya,"March 20, 2020",5," Such a good app, I use plus and I'll be honest its really worth it. I'm learning so fast and I didn't think k it would be possible, the methods within this app work so well. I'd honestly recommend it."
4629,Daniel Becerra,"March 22, 2020",5," Great app to invest time in! During this quarantine season, it's a great time to learn another language. Duolingo's free content is more than enough, well organized and hpful to keep a routine."
4630,John Fields,"March 24, 2020",5," It teaches you ANY language you want! It starts with the easy ones, then as you go on, it gets a bit harder. If you are a plain stranger, just reading the comments, I truly encourage you to BUY THIS APP!!"
4631,웰 어웨이Wellaway,"March 24, 2020",5, This is the best language learning app. Thank you for the developer for making this app. The ads you put on it is not irritating because it is the only you could earn from us. Awesome 5 star

I don't know when the experience will come to use, but I learned new words and it's only up to me to make use of them. However, just for fun, I looked into the mandarin chinese language, one I knew but wasn't very good at, and noticed that their pronounciation is definitely off. The speakers have an accent that sometimes makes it hard to identify what exactly they're saying. I should know, my whole family is Chinese. I suck at Chinese, but not THAT much."
4634,Daniel Bagwell,"March 24, 2020",5," I adore this game!! I love the different languages and how to learn them. My top two languanges are Spanish and Japanese, and I am loving it!! 😄 The little owl is sooo cute and encouraging! I love that when your out of lives you can practice a language for more! AMAZING GAME!!!!💖"
4635,Kirsty Dennistoun,"March 27, 2020",5, I use duolingo every day and it has helped me learn many languages. The ads are after lessons so they aren't disruptive. Overall really recommend as they have a large variety of languages to learn.
4636,Taybrook,"March 26, 2020",5, Wow! How can an app this good be free? At first I knew about it but I thought it costed money. I think I might be addicted to this app. It makes me so desperate to learn and compete against everyone in my league. This was just supposed to be homework but it turned into way more.

4638,Yashika Sangwan,"April 1, 2020",5," It's such a nice app. I love it It helped me learn French, German , and Korean! I love it it also got those books(short stories) you can read."
4639,Hecate202,"April 2, 2020",5," I love Duolingo! The interface is so user-friendly, and the way it teaches you is incredibly effective! I've taken book courses on a few languages, but none of them have taught me a language as fast as this app. Please download it and see for yourself!"

4641,lisa ogido,"April 6, 2020",4, This is a really good app to use when you want to learn a new language. This app is like a little quiz that teaches you then tests you on the thing they taught you
4642,Marcela Eu Mesma,"April 7, 2020",5, Amazing resource! I've used it for different languages and I loved all of them. It's easy and short and you'll learn if you stick with it.
4643,Mike Wilson,"April 7, 2020",5, Amazing! Constantly updated and a great review/learning tool. The German program alone with some online instruction in grammar was enough to get a B2 certificate.
4644,Ross Hunt,"April 13, 2020",4," I like everything about the app except the reminders to log in. They are more annoying than inspiring. That aside, I am really enjoying using the app."
4645,Patrick van der Linden,"April 8, 2020",1," The heart system is really annoying and discourages me from actually trying to learn anything, because Im too afraid of making mistakes. Wanted to buy the plus edition but not anymore, this is just ridiculously annoying bait"

4648,Me Myself,"April 4, 2020",2, I used to like this app before they updated it so you have to pay if you want to learn it downloaded. Now you have to be on the internet which eats up data and is a big problem if you have limited data.
4649,Jackie Moffat,"April 5, 2020",5, Nice pace. Teaching written word and how to pronounce words. Perfect. It popped up that someone was 'following me' which is not something I expected and disconcerting!!
4650,Abrar Adib,"April 6, 2020",5, Really good app. It makes learning languages really easy. I hope they would add more different languages in the future.

4670,Cem Sağıroğlu,"March 9, 2020",5," Good platform for self development. I remember when I watch ted talk of duoling a decade ago and I was impressed about the approach. To be consistent with its vision, Duolingo should consider providing scholarship for serious hardworking users to make a difference among other similar apps."
4671,Alicia Tur,"April 20, 2020",2," Well now out of the blue, my account is all goofed up! The speaking exercises are not working. Since I use the languages on my job, that's the most important part for me! I pay for plus but if this is not addressed, I won't anymore. I'm so disappointed!"
4672,Maleeka Albarran,"March 15, 2020",1, I can't hear the Arabic audio parts. The part where they say the word or whatever and you have to choose which one they are saying. It is just a guessing game because I can't hear anything!!

4690,Katrina Combs,"April 16, 2020",5," I thought I'd brush up on my Spanish from HS and I must say, it's a great layout, and fun to learn on. The lessons get harder as you go and it's relatively easy to stay the course. I'm on a 50+ day streak."
4691,Melissa Clerc,"March 13, 2020",4," Would be better if there were the option of watching ads and continuing to work. The ""hearts"" and ""plus"" aspects feel like a lot of pressure to purchase. ""Free"" seems like false advertising imo."

4697,Alex Mai,"February 9, 2020",1, Not useful after 5 hours. In Italian app doesn't explain anything. new words come and go and you get to the point when you have to translate every word because it all gone too quick. Also expamples are meaningless in many lesssons and just confuse you
4698,Patricia Ellis,"February 8, 2020",4," Its pretty darn good.!, Although at first it was weird to Me. Now i am getting used to the ? Format. It is a mental adjustment. I need to concentrate more. Probably buy a notebook."
4699,Lorraine Thornton,"February 20, 2020",5, Love it. It is set up in a game format making it fun. If you run out of hearts you just need to practice to get more! It touches on different learning styles.

4704,Michael Bertosa,"March 4, 2020",1," I didn't mind the forced ads until they started playing sound recently, and since I'm wearing headphones while I use this they're deafening, they're probably trying to drive people to the paid version"
4705,Keasar Saghir,"February 12, 2020",5," I'm learning Arabic on here and I'm amazed at how fast I'm picking the language up. The lessons are fun, almost like I'm playing a game. The leader boards encourage you to keep learning. Brilliant app, can't fault it."
4706,Julian Free,"April 3, 2020",5," This is one of the best language apps out there, as I came to it after having tried a few others..... the fact that it's completely free as well, makes it all the more impressive."
4707,Mathu Krish,"February 18, 2020",5," Love the vividness of the learning content. Navigation is smooth. wld be great if the tips are more comprehensive, particularly for french. also wishing numbers would be taught before checkpoint 1."
4708,Grant Barrett,"February 25, 2020",4," A decent app that helps build vocabulary, the updates are improving it but it is still a bit basic. Would recommend as a part of anyone trying to learn a language."
4709,Brandon Carboni,"February 28, 2020",4, Only thing I don't like is some of the questions you just have to guess on because they don't give you enough information leading up to it so it can break your streak through no fault of your own. Kind of annoying
4710,Sarah Catherine Teixeira,"February 20, 2020",5, So easy and fun. I love that Duo wants to make language learning free and enjoyable. The simple challenges push me to keep practicing...or is that just me being competitive? Hm .. best language app out there!

The user Q&A (comments) is a fantastic feature; I've learned so much just reading that. I LOVE reading the stories.

4715,wendy tylor-smith,"March 1, 2020",5, I like all the encouragement and reminders that mistakes are also opportunities to learn. Love this app. Only thing is my key board doesnt have accents. Luckily there are not many accents in Italuan.
4716,Aricks1,"March 8, 2020",5," Great app. It allows you to learn a language at your own pace, a little at a time. It's easy to use, and l like rhe reminders that it sends you to keep you on track."
4717,mau,"March 9, 2020",5," Awesome This is really helpful to learn new languages. And I love the how if you lose hearts by making a mistake, you have to regain them by practicing material which helps you learn a language and not forget. 10/10 would recommend to everyone learning a new language."
4718,arezoo gholami,"March 11, 2020",3," The app is nice and teaches you new tips of a language you'd like to learn. I like the app, it's just that sometimes I face an issue with a lesson which I don't know how to report it. Wish there was some options for reporting it to community"
4719,Aidan Anderson,"March 11, 2020",4," Overall good experience with nice lessons. If you're on for a long time the ads after every lesson do get a bit annoying, but it's a small price to pay to be taught a new language."
4720,William Riley,"February 13, 2020",5, The app is great and I want to give it 5 stars. Sadly when you try to use the offline learning feature it randomly erases your progress and very often freezes and refuses to work no matter what I do
4721,A Google user,"March 7, 2020",5," excellent interface, good content and moreover content is free( with ads) which is great for a student like me.... Kindly do not remove the feature of short notes on concept and grammar, for a beginner like me these are very useful!!"

4723,Danny Maness,"February 10, 2020",4, It's nice and easy and a good pace. Its starts with random numbers and colors which is ok but I hoping for a little more of a functional foundation.
4724,Pattie Breyer,"March 14, 2020",5, Love this app. I've tried audiobooks and the (very) old standard 3×5 cards. This puts it all together for me and makes it entertaining.
4725,Tina Mitra,"March 17, 2020",5, I totally love this app. You don't need to worry if you have never learnt or even heard the language earlier. It will start teaching from a scratch. I totally recommend it.
4726,Jaburdles,"March 24, 2020",4," It's rad, but it tends to repeat the same phrases in a lot of the lessons. Sometimes it makes me feel like I've just memorized the phrase instead of learning the language."
4727,Natalie Jessemy,"April 10, 2020",5, The app makes learning interesting. It's like a game that you can actually accomplish something that would benefit you at some time in your life.
4728,Tracey Wotring,"March 7, 2020",4," Enjoy the activities... bummer is having to wait for more hearts at times. The free portion I would recommend unless you really want to spend.lots of time on the app, then I think ya might have to upgrade."

4730,Nika 4,"March 14, 2020",5," It honestly teaches so mush. Not only can you press the word to see what it means if your not sure, they have a slow version for the audio so it easier to hear and get the correct answer"
4731,Jeremiah Davis,"February 12, 2020",5," Duolingo makes learning a new language fun. Most apps say that, but this is true. They offer different methods of learning and problem solving that makes it interesting. I actually WANT to use this app."
4732,Free Bird,"February 11, 2020",4," overall very good, it does takes awhile to get to numbers and you can't look up what you want to say. Otherwise the app makes learning easy."
4733,Andy Lawson,"February 22, 2020",4," Very good app ""So far."" You get so many chance then it stops for the day. To continue you have to pay for more lives. Hence why four star."

4736,Death Scythe,"March 2, 2020",5, This is my favorite app. Esperanto is the universal language and I am learning it rapidly with this app. Just wish they would add quenya or sandarin (elfish). Preferably quenya since it is more complete. Otherwise an amazing app.
4737,Melissa Bell,"March 2, 2020",5," Duo is very educational for me and other people ots good for studying and if you just want to learn a new language, but duo has a lot of ads so if u don't like ads don't install, but over all good app 10/10 nice for parents, teens, and even kids!"

4740,Carol Cunningham,"March 31, 2020",5, Tried a few different learning apps. Found Duolingo matches your progress. It repeats the items you struggled with. Fun and interesting was to learn. Especially love that it makes you pronounce the words as you learn.
4741,Alice Morrow,"April 6, 2020",5," I have tried books, DVDs, cassettes in the car, college courses. I struggled with all of those. This is definitely the best so far. Duo helps me understand what languages I actually like to speak and express myself with. Thank you!"

4748,Brady Thomas,"March 14, 2020",3, This app would get 5 stars from me if it weren't for the hearts. The heart system makes it extremely inconvenient to learn anything or make progress when you constantly have to restart your lessons.
4749,Rakhi Oyewole,"March 18, 2020",4, Been really learning a lot and enjoying at the same time. However I am starting to experience glitches that mean I can't go further on that level. Not sure how this will be resolved.
4750,Laenna Trujillo,"April 24, 2020",3, The app should say first what the word is in english then in Spanish most times I have to go off of what I already know. For beginners it wouldn't help them.

Read an article about the Duolingo founder and was convinced to try it; so glad I did! Who knew learning a new language could not only be fun but even addictive?!

Very well thought out, I'm extremely happy to recommend."
4755,Kamijo Natsuko,"February 12, 2020",5," I came back to Duolingo after tried several methods. After all, Duolingo is the most effective tool that I encountered. I like the simplicity of it. Using Duolingo combined with Memrise is my favorite way to learn Spanish."

4757,CHELSEACRAFT PHOTOGRAPHY,"February 18, 2020",4, This app is excellent for beginners. There isn't much content for higher levels of fluency. Could use more graphics and some pronunciation checks in the Hawaiian content.
4758,Anne Clark,"February 15, 2020",5," Very thorough, sometimes a little slow maybe, but I've jumped forward via the assessment and it is really stretching me now. Very important that you can hear correct Italian."

The hearts are the most anoying thing about this app. This is an app that teaches you a laugage. So why the @$!# does it not let you make a mastake. Even the app says mastakes help you learn. There is a version of the app that does not have the barfy hearts but I can't my hands on it. So if your not using this app for fun , I have four words for you. DON'T F******* DOWNLOAD THIS. Sorry that I cussed."
4824,Aileen Stephens,"March 2, 2020",4, Repeats often so you remember things. Fairly basic so far but hoping it will progress. Could use more opportunity to speak phrases in direct translation from english - need more conversational french.
4825,Lisa Halton,"April 3, 2020",4," Interesting. Clever. Achievable. I like this app and an trying to learn two languages at once. Because they are very different, it is going well."

4830,Shrishti,"March 10, 2020",5," Best language app ever. I am learning Spanish with the help of this app and it really helped me a lot.

4835,Christian T,"April 19, 2020",5," So this app is very useful and has helped me learn other languages, although they could take out how you have lives and if you run out you cannot learn. I just feel that it is restricting on learning"

4841,Natalie MacDonald,"April 13, 2020",3, Wish it was a faster process. I'm only learning the writing by memory. I need a more basic approach. Also more free time would be great.
4842,Kevin Mullen,"February 10, 2020",2, Good app. Shame about the notifications. It needs notifications to encourage usage and learning. But at 5:20 in the morning? How ridiculous is that!!!
4843,Ayman el nashar,"February 16, 2020",5," Duolingo is amazing and easy to use, I'velearned alot since instarted using it. However, I am facing problems since I download the last update. The app keeps crashing in the middle of lessons."

4851,Alex Tigchelaar,"February 25, 2020",4," Really happy with this app. You can learn a fairly large amount of languages, and some can be learned from Dutch, French, German etc. Great app, but there's a lot of languages still missing. Not sure if this is the place, but could you add Latvian?"
4852,Berlin Hiller,"February 15, 2020",4," I gave it a four because I've been having a bit of trouble signing in. It's been taking so long and I still haven't been able to sign in yet. But, amazing job on this app and I feel like I've learned a lot within two days."
4853,Jaalle Mohamed Siad Barre,"February 29, 2020",5," This app is very useful. The positive Notifications and the algorithm for triggering Mental Memory storwge of phrases. And giving other phrases the same Sounds and words to trigger it again. Wonderful app, 5/5"
4854,Kiki Kiki,"February 29, 2020",5, Fantastic! I'm really enjoying it and after only a couple of days I feel I'm picking it up quite well. If you have the willingness to learn then this will help you or if you studying it at school it may help you improve your skills and excel
4855,Jason McLean,"February 19, 2020",5, I love this app it makes it really easy to jump back into a language. I studied Spanish 20 years ago and within 10 minutes I just brushed up on most of the phrases I needed for a recent week long vacation in Mexico. Highly recommend it!
4856,Frank R. Tramp,"March 1, 2020",5, The method is how you would naturally learn to talk. I appreciate the return to previous lessons to refresh and reinforce. Consistency is always best.
4857,steve justin,"April 4, 2020",5, Best app for learning languages. The best there is. Upgrading to pro soon. Gets totally better with every update 💯💯. Keep up the good work👏👏
4858,NiaCatPlayz,"March 17, 2020",4, Good for learning. I do not like the millions of notifications they send to my Gmail. Half of my Gmail is Duolingo. Of course now I realize that you can change the settings on that.
4859,Paradoxx,"February 25, 2020",5," Add aren't annoying or unavoidable, fun competition to keep you focused, though may I reccomend making flashcards with languages that don't use the roman alphabet so you can practice drawing the symbols and words"
4860,Damyan Obreshkov,"February 25, 2020",3," Well the app is good but Duolingo plus is too expensive. And when you run out of hearts it is really annoying. And you say ""Our mission is to make learning languages free and fun"""

4863,Jared David May,"March 6, 2020",4," Much fun, but not really serious. It's missing: Aphabet form languages Typing Alternatves for Keyboards Controls/settings are very limited Can't turn off seperately listening options But it is fun, & you do learn something!"
4864,Sergio Bustamante,"March 6, 2020",3, I'm using the Plus free trial version which allows you to download the lessons for offline use. However on my subway commute this morning the app was still pausing in between stations. Pls advise or will have to cancel before the trial has expired. Thanks.
4865,Karen Chad,"March 10, 2020",5," It's great to help learn new languages but the only thing I would nitpick about it is that it doesn't have ""BAHASA MELAYU"" or Malay language which is my countries main language so other than that everything is fantastic!"
4866,aria torabikhah,"March 1, 2020",3, used to work with sound and pronounce the words and sentences but now there is no sound i dobl cheked every thing cleared data downloaded it again nothing.. i love the way this app works but i want the pronounciation part back i even used vpn and again nothing

4869,Dariya Dzh,"March 19, 2020",4," I believe the app is very good, but it would be amazing if there is a feature that can check your level of the language and you can start from there, instead of having to go through everything that you already know."
4870,Lucas Wade,"March 20, 2020",4, It's great for learning languages! But you have give lives and it is very frustrating and they take more than three hours to regenerate! Or you could take the long practice to get ONLY ONE FLIPPEN HEART!
4871,A Wright,"March 23, 2020",5," Very very trust worthy and easy for people who need to learn basic greetings fast and easy, of course just takes time to memorize everything but it makes it very easy to do so"
4872,tsr tsr,"March 25, 2020",5, Each crown (awarded for a lesson or goal completed) is worth going for. The language teaches you by sight and hearing the sounds/words/phrases ... the league set up motivates you to keep going!
4873,Mustak Ahmed,"March 27, 2020",1, I stopped practicing on this app because of the heart feature. A new person on new language must make mistake and than you are asking to purchase those hearts. Previous version was good now it's annoying. You guys started push sell instead of spreading knowledge.
4874,Dan Stott,"March 27, 2020",4," The lessons seem clear and organized, based on principles of language learning. I wish there were more ways to go back and review each lesson. But still a good app."

4881,Major Tom,"April 10, 2020",4, Easy to use and fun interface. A small number of sound/character 'anomalies'.
4882,Mich Okinyi,"April 15, 2020",4, Extremely helpful but I doubt whether someone with no background at allwith a foreign language will find it helpful.I think they should work on the package for starters better.
4883,Keila Lopes,"April 14, 2020",4, Very good to memorise vocabulary and sentence structure. The free version lacks a bit of variety though.
4884,Evan W.,"April 7, 2020",3," There's consistency issues: sometimes it'll accept an answer that isn't entered correctly (proper accents), other times it will."
4885,Chamila Priyadarshani,"April 10, 2020",5, This app is really great. This best ever language learning app I have everseen. Je aime cette duolingo app. See now I can speak French it took me only 2 weeks. I really love this app

4897,Huwage,"February 24, 2020",1, It's hard to complete a goal when the app keeps erasing my progress towards it. This has happened every day for over a week. Please fix this bug.
4898,Edward Gutierrez,"February 11, 2020",3, Great app i Love it so far. Not a fan of the spelling part. Wish there was a simple path for basic reading and speaking. I dont plan on writting a papper but i would live to conversate at dinner.
4899,Cheri Stevenson,"February 20, 2020",4, An impressive learning tool. Listening and speaking sections are excellent. The introduction of new vocabulary could be more rapid.
4900,tony rowley,"February 21, 2020",4, Great app. Idea for improvement: add a vocab sheet for / before / after each lesson available from the Android app. The ability to review the / new vocabulary would greatly improve my retention.

4904,Joanne Petter,"March 8, 2020",5," Repetition is the key to learning a language, and that is prioritised in Duolingo. It also doesn't spoon-feed with all the answers or rules, we are encouraged to seek references elsewhere and to take charge of the learning process."
4905,Moudai Kilmog,"March 21, 2020",5, I like how the pace is flexible for all levels of language learning. I'm having an easier time putting together words in a few languages after only a couple of weeks.

Yet here I am about a year later still opening Duolingo almost every night to do some Spanish lessons. I haven't spent a dime. It has all been free. Minimal unobtrusive (some silly) ads.

4942,Marcus Ehinger,"March 5, 2020",1," Major bug problems with this app... I'm following the directions and translating the sentences and it tells me that I'm wrong, when in fact I'm right.... so frustrating. Now I've no hearts and have to buy crystals.... sounds like a scam😡"
4943,Auuugaaa Tv,"March 6, 2020",5, The best language learning app. It so easy to learn any language that you wish. It gives you constant lessons that teach you the basics to eventually advanced. Just do not miss a lesson or the owl will get you. Loving the app totally recommend

But over 25 years ago! I've always been good at being able 2 read and pronounce the words, but interpreting when I hear it? I thought it proper to take another college SP class 10 yrs ago cuz I moved from NY to CA (widely spoken here). It helped 2 refresh my memory but unless I'd have a one-on-one I still couldn't hear it. Duolingo's encouraged me to practice every day and has helped me to hear it"

A lot of work must have gone into creating this app as it provides a variety of learning styles for the many but sadly the few still moan. C'est la vie!"
4948,Paul Corcoran,"February 19, 2020",5, Duolingo has improved so much since it was first introduced.they really do meet the mission of making learning fun and free. Clickbait ads are a minor annoyance in the free version.
4949,Guy Andrew,"February 12, 2020",4," So far, pretty good. Could be improved by record and playback of student's spoken response so he/she can make comparisons with teacher's correct pronunciation."
4950,Robert Jansen,"February 13, 2020",5, Great app for learning the basics. Would still recommend actual lessons on the side to understand the grammar better as only Duolingo will not be sufficient once you reach longer or more complicated sentences.
4951,Cindy Katjijeko,"February 13, 2020",5," I really love this app. Its simple and easy to use, it's easy to understand and learn because their translation is in English . Instructions are very clear and very helpful."

4954,Matthew Jones,"February 25, 2020",4," I've used this app for ages, the only issue is how expensive premium is for what you actually get. Although it's nice not having to deal with adverts."
4955,Weird Demon Thing,"February 26, 2020",5, Helped Immensely in learning the basics but features such as indicating formality for Korean as an example would make it more in depth and easier as at the moment it requires outside research to fully grasp the language.
4956,Arthur,"February 23, 2020",5," The method of teaching of Duolingo works far better than the one used in school, from my experience.

It is a really fun way to learn things from home (it is 2020 and corona time), and the app rewards you for finishing lessons, reading stories, and more.

5058,Danielle Christian,"April 15, 2020",5, I've been using this app for about two weeks now and I really like it so far. The repetition of the words and lessons really help the language to stick.
5059,A Google user,"April 20, 2020",4, Very repetetive. Not a lot of vocabulary. I dont think fluency can be achieved.
5060,Jonathan Kropp,"February 27, 2020",5, Great app so far. I'm two weeks in and still enjoy it. I use it a lot and am already learning quite a bit and there is still a ton of material left for me to go through

5094,David Junk,"March 3, 2020",1, The introduction of the heart system is the worst idea ever. 5 mistakes and you cannot learn anymore until you wait multiple hours or pay up. Was great up until this change.
5095,Zyyk Zyyk,"March 8, 2020",5," I like the app, but some phrases are a bit different from what I've learned. I'll continue studying and interacting with native speakers to regain and retain my skill set."

5097,Anastasia,"March 31, 2020",3, For some reason the lessons take unusually long time to load lately. It's not the greatest user experience having to stare at loading screen for more than a minute...
5098,David Ball,"March 26, 2020",4," It's a great app and it is really helping me learn Portuguese. The only bad thing so far is just when I was trying to make my account it was all messed up and wouldn't let me make one, but it eventually all worked out. I highly reccomend this app for anyone who is trying to learn a new language."
5099,kristi anderson,"February 7, 2020",3, It's confusing to me week after week after week that some people are able to get huge numbers of XP. How can they do that without cheating some how? What is being done to prevent this and to level the playing field?
5100,Laura Schofield,"February 16, 2020",5, I'm currently learning 5 new languages. I really love this app. I've left and come back to it multiple times because life happens and you think you don't have time. 🤷🏼‍♀️ It will send you reminders and all it takes is 5 minutes a day.

Use it every day, get into the ""streak"" function and try not to skip. Don't expect to learn a language using this alone! Once Duolingo gives you a solid vocabulary, watch movies and TV in your target language, change your Facebook/ phone language, try and speak to native speakers. Duolingo won't get you to fluency by itself, but it's the best, easiest, most user-friendly way to get started"

5115,Faith B,"February 26, 2020",3," I really like the app but they need a conjugation list. And when they put up verbs, they should put the word up before its conjugation. Then you learn the verb and learn the proper way to form it based on the subject of the sentence."
5116,Aida Zukic,"February 29, 2020",5," Me and almost my whole family are quite excited about this app. Learning a language doesn't seem like learning, but contagious fun. And, you keep constantly working on improvement. Great job, thank you."

5193,Rowan maged,"April 28, 2020",5," Amazing app, easy to use.. Very rich with benefits"
5194,edyta wozniak,"February 10, 2020",1, When application changed the rules with collecting blue gems instead of red lingots this game is not that attractive anymore. Perhaps it's time to find another similar app.
5195,Ana Taylhardat,"February 25, 2020",5, Absolutally wonderful!! Love this app It's a magnificent tool to practice pronunciation grammar and understanding all at the same time in a very simple manner.
5196,Rachel,"March 3, 2020",4, It's a fantastic app but I'm not getting ANY push notifications whatsoever so I keep losing my streak... I have all my notifications switched on and I've checked the permissions on my phone and I'm getting nothing
5197,Wanda Walker,"March 4, 2020",5," Exceptionally structured! Content rich. Touches on all linguistic parameters for easy learning and retention. And, I've recommended it to others."
5198,Ky King,"March 5, 2020",5," Amazingly easy to use and I am surprised at how fast I am picking things up. That's what happens when learning is straight forward, and fun!!"
5199,Matt Kay,"February 24, 2020",2, Love this app but recently it's buggy. You do lessons and it doesnt register them. I've used the double xp selection and it not counted half of the points. Bit of a shame as it was great.
5200,Jessica Antoine,"April 5, 2020",3, I like the app but it keeps deleting my progress randomly and it takes forever to load lessons sometimes to the point where it will just quit.
5201,Mariano Estrada,"March 6, 2020",4," I like it. I think the learning curve is a bit steep, but once you get the rythm, you can get better at your own pace. 😁 I'm learning Chinese now, but I think I'll try something different later."
5202,Mel Zimmer,"March 5, 2020",5," Best language learning App I've tried by far, out of about ten! Doesn't become so heavy with ads that it is unusable. Great job. Thanks so much."

5204,Penny Staines,"March 11, 2020",5, I access the App every day and am over 300 days in. I don't throw loads of time at it though so I'm still working on a basic level but its surprising how much a repetition of simple phrases improves your understanding.
5205,Ellenia Awesome,"March 16, 2020",5," Very helpful. Before long you can read and write another language. Speaking is harder, hearing is kind of easy."
5206,Squats-With-Brave,"February 12, 2020",5, Genuinely love this app. It is set up in a way that tracks and rewards your progress and achievements. I genuinely feel like im pkaying a videogame.
5207,Joe Norris,"February 10, 2020",5," Nice app, only one advert to sit through and only lasts a second or two. Easy to use, user friendly. I like it!"
5208,James Chu,"February 18, 2020",5, Some languages have more content than others. Spanish has lots of literature that read like lessons while others like Korean don't. I think it's great for learning more Spanish and practicing and Korean.
5209,Hanna Lee,"April 1, 2020",4, Awesome emerging app. I learned a lot. Slow in progress though. Repeats lot. Lack of grammar explanation.

5221,Jonathan Eymann,"March 23, 2020",5," Nice, flexible approach to learning. I wish there was a tutorial explaining features and procedures. I am still discovering things after a year of use."
5222,Judy-Lee Gilbert,"March 31, 2020",4, Love learning French on duo! Would love it if there was an algorithm where it didn't ask questions if you kept getting the answer correct. Then it would be 5 stars!
5223,Mark Clausen,"March 30, 2020",1, I signed up for a one week trial of the plus version. Did not care for it. Could not figure out how to turn plus off on the app. Got charged $90. Currently in dispute.
5224,ABS Soul,"April 26, 2020",5, Its great because you can learn different languages in a amount of time

5228,Vicki Beacham,"March 4, 2020",5," I love the repetition and the second and third chances. I just wish I, myself, were better at the clarity in speech. A work in progress."
5229,Flare,"February 22, 2020",5," Going well so far, the free version isn't even that intrusive. May upgrade if learning becomes more than just a hobby."
5230,Ben Johnson,"February 26, 2020",5, Very useful app for learning a second language. Sometimes makes leaps in vocabulary you haven't yet learnt but that helps make the brain make work using the bits you already know.
5231,Martyn Findley,"March 19, 2020",5, This is a far better learning experience for me than other apps that I have tried. I like the differing learning techniques it uses and I do like the positive messages from the cute animated owl.
5232,EvilKittie,"March 11, 2020",5," It's pretty useful. The lessons aren't pressuring with time limits and even if I made a mistake, it helps me understand where I went wrong and to learn for next time."

5235,Connor Nielsen,"April 2, 2020",5, Wildly helpful. The process is efficient and is apt in locking things down before moving you to more challenging material.

5242,Irene ODU,"April 20, 2020",3, My friend was not rewarded for inviting me. Even after I installed and started using the App. She was hoping to get her free 7 day trial. But I guess the developers lack integrity. I might as well uninstall it.
5243,Carmen VanHollebeke,"April 28, 2020",5," I love this app. I am using it for school, my spanish class during lockdown and it works amazing! Im definatly learning more on this app than in the classroom!!"

5255,Trenda Reid,"February 22, 2020",5, It is awsome! I am currently learning French and is helping a LOT.I have had no issues with ads popping up or the app itself glitching or closing out by its self. Thank you duolingo!

5257,MomOfMany,"February 28, 2020",5, A fun way to get practice in another language! It works best in conjunction with another language course.... although just by itself is fairly useful also.
5258,Kathryn Rivera,"February 29, 2020",1," This app is absolutely terrible, and not because it is not a good application for learning but because even after I canceled the subscription I was still charged 80 dollars for something I do not want and now I am fighting to get my money back."
5259,Steven Pietrosanti,"February 28, 2020",3," Different than Duolingo on PC, takes many less sessions to complete a unit on the App, still doesn't have timed practice. So I would recommend doing it on PC, not here"
5260,Susie Bennett,"February 25, 2020",2," The linguot store is super-limited, they ignore cheating in the leagues, there's no good way to really learn and understand grammar and pronunciation, and you can't practice conversation. But it's free."
5261,Elijia Lapie,"March 1, 2020",5, Easy and helpful. On the free version the ads can get annoying but if you pay to upgrade they stop. Real content and it helps with actually sentence structure.
5262,Naghmeh Razazan,"February 28, 2020",2, I liked it before but now the listening part is not working! So I can't practice listening! I update it but my problem still is!

5267,Dylan,"March 16, 2020",5, I love using this app to either learn a new language or continue learning one you already know. It's a great way to get introduced to a language without the payment.
5268,J.P. S.,"March 10, 2020",2," Great app until you hit a glitch. I'm trying to learn Hindi and I have to match two words which are literally impossible to match, making it impossible for me to move forward in the lesson."
5269,Hanna Berchtold,"March 16, 2020",4," Well, so far fun but with the number segment I find it for some reason confusing and I normally do not have problems learning languages. We shall see as I progress."

5271,Pauly Rosaly,"March 15, 2020",5, I thought this was going to be typical repetitive learning experience. I was incredibly surprised to find it's more like immersive video. Lots of fun 😄🤠
5272,Adam Rennison,"March 13, 2020",4," I've only been using the app for a few days, wanting to learn gaelic, and the only negative point I can find so far is that you can't go back and do a level again. Apart from that I can't praise it enough."
5273,Grace Scott,"March 23, 2020",2, This is a really great app and has helped to expand my Spanish vocabulary but I do not like the new update with a heart system as it makes it extremely hard to pass new levels

5327,Heather Hope Harmony,"April 28, 2020",5," Learning Español on this app is actually quite fun, and easy! Last time I tried to learn Spanish, it was hard, but now with this app, it's easy! Very happy to have found and tried this app!"
5328,Jupiter 888,"April 28, 2020",5, I think it's a great way to learn a new language and more people should check it out!
5329,Joan Frix,"April 10, 2020",4," Great app to help speak, read, and write spanish. User friendly."
5330,Jo Fenner,"February 14, 2020",4," Easy to use and has visual clues to help you learn and remember words, also gives online rewards and incentives to encourage you to practice regularly"
5331,Tested And Trusted,"March 23, 2020",5," I'm new with the App. But so far, it's amazing. I'm learning new words day in day out.. Wish some features can work fine without the internet."
5332,Toby Dunn,"March 1, 2020",2, Hearts system makes this useless for learning. Until hearts were introduced making mistakes helped you learn. Now making mistakes blocks you from progressing until hearts have refilled or you pay. You can't teach a student by excluding them from the class.
5333,Kevin Pearson,"February 16, 2020",5, Great app. My mom referred me here and I enjoy improving my Spanish skills. Easy app to use as well. The ads that show the games are deceptive though.
5334,Nicole Bester,"March 22, 2020",4, Great... Except sometimes it gives you a multiple choice in things that you have not learnt yet. It would be great if the app could explain to you when to use certain words in what context
5335,Natalie Wittmeier,"March 21, 2020",5, This is a great free app. Really useful and easy to do. I often use it to learn Japanese and kill time while learning something useful on the trains in Japan.
5336,Yazan Kh,"March 9, 2020",2, Good application but too basic and slow to progress. There should be an assessment at the beginning to decide your level and learn accordingly.
5337,Miguel Gonzalez,"March 23, 2020",5, I'm learning english with this app and i think that is is very good app for learn lenguages i'm study portuguece and English. But then of this app my tips are that you all need to see series and movies in the lenguage that you all are studing.😂😋 I'm doing that.
5338,Abdullah Rauf,"March 30, 2020",3, I like the app over all but there is no option of urdu languauge in learning or known languages list . I think you should also add urdu as it is also one of the mostly spoken languages in asia However learning languages on duolingo is good and easy
5339,jasmine lebrun,"March 29, 2020",3," It's a good app, but if your level is not properly assessed, the material becomes too easy, repetitive, and boring."
5340,Gursach44,"March 31, 2020",5," No problems at all! It at least feels like it's working for me, and it makes learning rewarding, and practicing fun and useful."
5341,mickey glantz,"April 14, 2020",5, Excellent. Studied Russian in 1958 and Duolingo is helping me to recall it. Especially vocabulary. Mickey
5342,Zeke D,"April 23, 2020",5," It was amazing and I learned so much, I finished the entire Spanish course and I feel pretty client know. I am now going to start a new language. This is the best language learning app I have done, and you can log on from anywhere online. I LOVE IT."
5343,henrique rodrigues,"April 25, 2020",5, Best language learning app that I've used so far. Easy and effective.
5344,Willa Wolfe,"February 18, 2020",5," I love Duolingo. I love that it has old languages, rare languages, sci-fi languages, I love the variety. There are so many that I want to learn. But it really does make it quite easy, almost like a game."
5345,Fran Stevens,"March 9, 2020",5, Love this app. I like the visual help and that minor spelling errors are not an issue. I have picked up the language very quickly.
5346,Patricia Jordan,"March 12, 2020",5," Very well thought out method that helps you remember words. Really enjoying it, challenging yet fun. The vocal pronunciation is brilliant."
5347,SAMUEL KIM,"April 28, 2020",5, This is a great app for learning foreign languages!!!
5348,TheMarioMPA,"February 7, 2020",5," This is a great app, especially if you subscribe for Duolingo Plus! The Only Thing I Could Think Of To Make The App Better, Is To Add Skins For Duo! It's A Part Of What Makes The Practice Fun!"
5349,Cameron Webb,"February 7, 2020",4," Lessons are quick and painless, and if even just 5% sticks, it's working. In my case some is sticking and I'm thrilled with the results."
5350,Kate Pryor,"February 11, 2020",5," Easy and addictive!!! I worry that the heart countdown isn't accurate though, but other than that I love this!"
5351,Gary Campbell,"February 13, 2020",5, My only problem is the font size on some of the ARABIC examples. The small accents and dots are at the edge for reading. A small increase in size would make life SO MUCH EASER.
5352,Miriam Novelo,"February 10, 2020",5," This app is really easy to use, I have never had problems with this app. Learning a new language is hard. Doulingo just makes everything easier. I love how you can read the stories, they are so much fun."
5353,Mariachiara Mottarella,"February 9, 2020",3, I think some exercises are quite repetitive and would like it to be slightly harder for the level I feel I need. Sometimes it gets kind of boring.
5354,David Halling,"February 13, 2020",4," Generally a very good learning tool, but limited vocabulary, and some languages do not use speech recognition for oral exercises."
5355,Rupesh Patel,"February 26, 2020",5," Such an amazing supplement to learning a new language. Great fun, well made and the new story mode is a nice addition!"
5356,Bronwyn Jones,"February 21, 2020",5, Massive respect to Duolingo for making language learning so accessible to everyone. Completely free unless you want to buy plus (which is overpriced but I feel it is worth it to pay to support free language learning for those who cannot afford it)
5357,Bridgette Williams,"February 15, 2020",4, This is great.. Im learning irish for history and my daughter is learning spanish to better talk with friends with her speach problems this app makes it easy fof her...I would give a full 5 starts if getting your hearts refilled time was shorter she cant play as much as she wants
5358,Freedom 1,"February 27, 2020",3, Please add a delete button for when you selected a word but realized to translate and you see that it was in the wrong order...you get marked wrong. The delete button would give you a chance to correct your mistake.
5359,Siani Barkway-Fox,"February 22, 2020",5," Really fun and useful and I feel like I'm learning a lot. But oh wait...I've run out of hearts? Cool, now I can't use it for the rest of the day. Please get rid of this childish function, trying to learn, not play a game."
5360,natural mermaid,"February 19, 2020",5, Absolutely love this easy language learning app. I have learned a great deal of conversational and travel Spanish as well as brushing up on my French and learning Italian for the first time. I tell all my friends and co-workers to use this app
5361,Alec Straub,"February 26, 2020",4, Excellent app. My only issue is that the speech volume is not loud enough compared to the other sound effects.
5362,J Eduardo Mucino,"March 7, 2020",4," I'm not sure the paid plan is worth anything beyond getting rid of the ads. But overall, it's a good tool to supplement learning a new language."
5363,Simon UK,"March 9, 2020",5," Wish it had the option to revert status so ypu coul go back to recap, and doesn't mention that coul can click words in the UI for more info, but it's a solid language app. Recommended."
5364,Dylan Strong,"March 10, 2020",3," I hate this app layout and the way it looks. It looks so fuzzy and cheap. Wayyy to simplistic. Great app, used to love it, but the current UI makes me want to vomit."
5365,Gabriele Coneybeare,"March 12, 2020",5, This app is excellent. Not only does it teach you the language it provides incentives to continue learning on a daily basis. The stories are also a wonderful way to learn.
5366,Pedro Nogueira,"March 11, 2020",5," Really cool app for language learning, sometimes I just wish that there were more explanation before the lessons. Overall, nice app."
5367,Verito Dominguez,"February 16, 2020",4, Good but it will be better if you will also have the option to lean Portuguese from Portugal the pronunciation it's completely different and I am more interesting to lean Portuguese from Portugal.
5368,Liza Urban,"February 17, 2020",4," It's free and stays on the same words for a bit, but if you answer wrong five times you have to start the round all over and do a practice round to get more hearts"
5369,Misty Varco,"February 13, 2020",5," Trying to learn a new language is hard but I know adventually I will get it. I like that I have to see it, repeat it, type it, and all of these different repeated is helping me learn it a little better. Thanks for making this a little easy to learn."

5373,Leya Shawa,"February 15, 2020",4, Very helpful and doesn't occupy too much space on my phone. Although I believe it's more effective when used in conjunction with other lessons or learning materials.
5374,Marthisha D,"April 20, 2020",5, I love duolingo this game can teach you how to talk in any language you want to learn I absolutely love it.
5375,Angela Ciccarelli,"February 24, 2020",5," Brilliant app, allows you to learn a little every day, there are ads but if it really bothers you then you can pay for an upgrade."
5376,Tara Welsman,"February 25, 2020",5," A great app! I'm learning so much, and really enjoy the experience! Really easy to use, so satisfying it borders on addictive!"
5377,Mn Jn,"March 20, 2020",4," Great for the basics, but advanced stuff (genitive, cases, etc) suffer from the limited mobile format. I'll keep at it, though!"
5378,hawkbow777,"March 1, 2020",5," Super fun and step by step. Great way to learn! I love it. Some of the speach is wierd but other then that, great app! Thank you duo!"

5380,gor mak,"April 16, 2020",2, I can't open the “Intro” in German language
5381,Hannah Blackburn-Turner,"April 5, 2020",2," I like the idea of the app but for some reason I have lives and my mum's version of the app doesn't?

It also keeps stealing my lives, i paid to get a refill and it stole my gems and didn't give me the lives. I also closed dowb the app on 1 life, opened it up again and had none. Makes it pretty difficult to continue playing."
5382,udith madu,"April 4, 2020",5, This app is well done. But I need to learn in english with in my language( Shinhala).I'm from Srilanka my language Not available here. How can I fix about. If Anybody could help me? I'm poor in english language.

5385,Nigel Cartwright,"April 8, 2020",5, Great app to use whenever you have a spare 10 minutes. Teaches vocabulary and phrases.
5386,brian birkland,"April 17, 2020",5," Wonderful so far. It's a good mix of reading, saying, and listening."
5387,Urvashi Bhatia,"April 27, 2020",1, Not able to use microphone and hence cant practice speaking exercises. Useless app
5388,Mike Singer,"April 7, 2020",2," Trivial unfocused words, no grammar instruction other than repetitive discovery learning. This references the free app, can't believe the idiots wouldn't show better routines if part of the paid app."
5389,Aditya Tyagi,"April 22, 2020",4, Much improved on European languages. Others need work
5390,None None,"April 12, 2020",5," Fun, easy, and useful. You can use it while on the toilette to meet daily goals."

5393,THE magical elf,"March 21, 2020",3," I think that it's kind of stupid how you have hearts because, if you are starting a new language like Japanese where the only thing you know how to say is hello then you are going to make alot of mistakes"
5394,Shivam Yadav,"April 28, 2020",5, Glad to say Duolingo not only made learning easy but free as well and that's the best thing bout this app
5395,Michael Hochman,"February 8, 2020",5," Although repetition is necessary, there is a good mix of different exercises making the learning experience fun while appearing less repetitive."
5396,Razieh Shahverdi,"March 22, 2020",5, This is not the best app for learning a new language; but it is surely the most fun app. You would enjoy and learn the basics or at least be familiar with the language.

5399,panthsquid,"February 10, 2020",4, I would rate it 5 star but u have to pay for offline learning which kind of sucks and the 5 hearts thing also you lose hearts pretty quick and have to be either online or wait 4 hours for them to completely regenerate
5400,Shubhra Apurve,"March 8, 2020",5, This app is definitely the best language teaching apps I have used. The structure of the courses are amazing. I just wish they had writing practice as well.

I would always recommend duolingo to new learners of a language and linguistic enthusiasts."
5403,ReviewerSpot347,"February 15, 2020",5," Nice, it's free to use it. But it's only the ads, it keeps on spreading everywhere. But five stars as always"
5404,ML Starlight,"March 11, 2020",4, It's cool. But it has many troubles in the order of them exercises. Sometimes it show you words what doesn't teach you before.
5405,Akstudio,"March 25, 2020",3, I like this app very much but one thing that annoys me is pronunciations sometimes they are completely wrong. Like waa in arabic language is not pronounced as wi. But in this app yes.
5406,Janine Spowage,"March 29, 2020",4, Good app but trying to continue to learn Spanish and French (from school) and Welsh but the new running out of hearts annoying as I am trying ten minutes of each. Sometimes cant finish all languages before I run out of hearts

5427,mike crump,"February 10, 2020",4," Excellent app, would be 5 stars if it wasn't so American English biased. Especially words that just aren't used outside the US. E.g. cookies, cell phone etc."
5428,Eugenio Bonanno,"February 12, 2020",2," The app its self is pretty good, but they keep making it less desirable to learn without paying regards of how many adds you watch. Considering they pride themselves on enabling people to learn for free it's a bit annoying to see."
5429,Sean Walker,"April 18, 2020",3, Good but keeps crashing if I get the answer wrong and doesn't sort its self out i have to quit and lose my progress
5430,Petah Batten,"February 20, 2020",5, Really worthwhile and helpful in teaching me the basics (so far) in languages. There are so many languages to choose from too.

5433,Dack alack,"March 5, 2020",3, Good app but be careful to choose if you want the app before you download it. Downloaded to try it out then ended up buying a full years worth by accident. $130 down for 1 weeks use
5434,Kiarash Shahbaz,"March 10, 2020",2, The app begins to have many many problems. Many of it's listening exercises are without voices. When you click on voice icon you hear nothing.
5435,Linda Moore,"March 8, 2020",5, I love this app. If I don't get something right they test me several different ways until I get it. It's almost as if I have a teacher in front me. It's really great !

5438,Genie Donley,"April 20, 2020",4, This app would be perfect if it had you type out translations instead of using the word bank when practicing past lessons. Please make this change!
5439,Nancy Babayco,"March 19, 2020",2, I have enjoyed learning my chosen language since downloading Duolingo. I will update when leaderboards are not an option! I enjoy having privacy without my friends knowing what I am doing. Please remove this function! I will give more stars after removed!

5441,Sarah Pittman,"April 26, 2020",4," I took french many years ago in college. The program has been great for reviewing grammar rules. The extra course on flirting was a bit strange, in that it wasn't for teaching grammar or new vocabulary, it was purely about rote memorization."
5442,L Williams,"February 10, 2020",5, Great app. I'm learning lots of useful words. I like that you can practice your pronunciation too. Thoroughly recommended

5483,Carlotta Boulton Ramos,"March 25, 2020",3, It is very helpful until it tells you to make a profile. I can not continue until I make one however when I try to it does nothing after pressing create profile.

But for all the advantages of the app and set up, the Navajo course is riddled with typos and basic errors no one with exposure to the language would make. Just a complete disaster. It's unusable. Misconjugated postpositions, messed up word order, misuse and deletion of obligatory possessive affixes, and a truly absurd number of typos. And it's in nearly every lesson."

5592,Stuart McWhinney,"March 14, 2020",5, Always check the tips before starting a lesson. Duolingo is more helpful now than before and I feel like it gives sufficient explanation before testing the user.

5598,Charbel Haddad,"March 22, 2020",5," This app is very similar to one that I used to learn Mandarin effectively while I was in China (Hellochinese). In terms of free apps with least pervasive adds, these are as good as they come!"

I would give it 5 stars but the Navajo coarse is very frustrating. I wish there were more sound bytes because I don't really know how to pronounce Navajo, and I can't complete some lessons and practices because typing in Navajo is extremely frustrating, and the app won't let you skip those. Also no explanation for ""shiprock"". It's used all through one of the Navajo lessons with no explanation about it. Seems very irrelevant. Latin is next!!!"
5602,Ilias Triantos,"March 31, 2020",5, Great app. I started Russian in the free version and its going great. I recommend the app to anyone that wants to learn a new language. Its great!

5606,Dale & Marcia Erickson,"April 2, 2020",4, Thought it was too slow at first but then realized that repetition helps the words stick better. Sometimes the high school French I learned eons ago suddenly shows up and confuses things. Enjoy the program.

5619,Lils King,"April 7, 2020",2, Conned me to keep paying £9 a month without me noticing. Literally charged from my card. Really cheeky from such a respected company.
5620,hiba mohd,"April 2, 2020",1, The audio in this app doesnt work and this app doesn't help in learning a language if the audio doesnt work....
5621,Josh Boudreau,"February 26, 2020",5, Everyone should use Duolingo! Great and effective app. I have learnt multiple languages to the level of being able to converse with native speakers using almost only this app as a resource. Way better use of your time than a phone game and far more rewarding. Get it.
5622,Shahir Saad,"February 7, 2020",2, Technical problems keep happening lately. I can't even do the training because the app refuse to load. My streak is gone now.

5627,K Steege,"March 7, 2020",5," I find this very easy to use. I have studied my chosen language in the past, so I can't say how it is if you're starting from scratch, but I am thinking of trying it with a new language."
5628,mhs last,"March 17, 2020",4, I think it's a good program but persion as an old language should be added to this(some odd language like game of thrones are in but persion not :| ) please add this language it's not going far way:)

5637,Mishelle Andrade,"March 4, 2020",5," This app is the best in the world, apart from being very extensive it has most of the languages including some dialects that have been lost."
5638,Christina F,"March 10, 2020",5," Thank you for making the Arabic character/word matching larger (possibly the same for other script languages), and for making the harder lessons solely in the language being learned."
5639,Abhijeet Swain,"March 4, 2020",3," After 3-4 days of use, it is simply loading although I have got a fast internet connection here. It sometimes shows no internet connection too"

5644,Lol. camprage,"February 17, 2020",5," I like that there is a huge variety, and it gives you the perfct amount of time to learn things. Im learning russian and so far i've memorized evrything ive been taught."
5645,Desmond Malusi,"February 25, 2020",4, The only thing that I dont like about the new update is the heart system. It discourages me from continuing to use the app and learn. Other than that its great.

5651,Christopher Dørum,"April 1, 2020",5," Awesome app, tho you need to actually go out there in the real world, read, talk and just get a real world experience of the languages to really learn it. But I'm gonna say I learned more in this app than 3 years at school"
5652,Craig Potter,"April 1, 2020",5," Really useful tool, fun and helping me learn a new skill in quarantine. Half hour a day on week days and hour or 2 on weekends"
5653,mishay morar,"April 1, 2020",5, Very fun and interactive! I feel enabled to self study languages thanks to duo. They make it feel like a joy and not a chore :)
5654,Tracy-Ann Lamont,"April 13, 2020",5, Engaging and entertaining way to learn a language!

5656,Tammy Hiltz,"April 25, 2020",4, It seems made for children but I appreciate the reassurance of moving forward easily. I am learning!
5657,Vincent Smith,"February 14, 2020",5," Pretty fun, kind of addicting and if you keep at it, a good hand held way to learn a new language for free."

5660,the flaming gecko,"March 9, 2020",5, This is a great app for learning languages for free with very few ads and no negatives (except when you don't do your daily lessons then dwo finds you you wouldn't want that)
5661,Dorly Wick,"April 2, 2020",4," Duolingo is addictive, but I prefer using it on my pc as I advance faster, and don't keep loosing hearts, as well as no problem with typos."
5662,Samruddhi Pataskar,"April 3, 2020",5," Every single aspect of learning a new language is covered: vocabulary, pronounciation, spelling and lots more. Repetition in exercises serves the purpose of better retention. This is my favourite app on Play Store so far! Also, Duo is a very cute mascot ♥️"
5663,Amanda Sheard,"April 11, 2020",5," Excellent app: superior to any others I've tried. I've used Muzzy and several other apps or online courses in the past, but only this one is actually teaching me Spanish. In a week, I'm speaking Spanish roughly as well as I did 18+ years ago, just after Spanish class in high school."
5664,Allison Blake,"April 6, 2020",5, It is a great way to learn many different languages while away from school. It is extremely helpful in these times where we have to do school from home.
5665,Swole Foods,"April 17, 2020",3," I love Duolingo, and I used it to learn most of the languages I speak today. But ever since they added the 5 hearts feature, I've lost motivation to try learning. It makes it feel like I have to pay to learn the language that I chose. Everyone makes mistakes, why should they be punished for it?"
5666,Karen Newman,"March 10, 2020",4, Love using this app. I just wish that you could still get points with Tinycards as I liked how they worked together.
5667,Samira Madadi,"March 11, 2020",4, 4 stars because the AUDIO IS GONE!😱 I updated the app only because you finally added Latin! Before this update everything was right. Please please please fix it. Thanks. I love the app!💛🧡
5668,cornelia williams,"April 19, 2020",5," Only problem I have with duolingo is, for french they do not teach the alphabet so it is very difficult to learn sounds of words if they had taught it from the beginning it would make understanding French alot easier. J'aime duolingo"
5669,Ms. E,"March 23, 2020",4," Great variety of practice/skills and encouraging words! The ads can be annoying, but they don't last long."
5670,Adrienne MacDonald,"February 7, 2020",4, Pretty easy learning. No real complaints. Minimal issues; most issues have been with the app being able to process my verbal answers.
5671,Saeede Barzegar,"March 30, 2020",4, This is a great app. But I have a problem with pronunciations. there is nothing to hear and answer the questions. I hope it will be solved soon..

5674,Amelia Dean,"February 9, 2020",5," It's like they made learning a language into a game, and this has made it easier to pick up the language. I have tried other apps with less success than this one."
5675,sakura jen,"February 19, 2020",3," It would be best if you also includes der, die, das for each German noun in all level because Articles are important to form sentences. So far it's good."
5676,Lally Mackie,"April 2, 2020",5, Love this app. Makes it fun and easy. Addictive. Wish it explained more about formal and informal etc.
5677,Sarah Khan,"February 13, 2020",5, Its awesome! I am learning Korean and I am getting better at it! Totally reccomend! Except if u don't know how to speak English properly than plz do add Urdu. It would make it so much easier for my mum! Otherwise great app!
5678,Laura Laslett,"February 19, 2020",5," I find it easy to find time to do this app daily, i can do it in quick bites or longer sessions and i helps me to be more consistant."
5679,Krisztina Simon,"February 9, 2020",5, I believe this is a good app to start and practice a new language. It can give a really strong basement for the next levels of the studying.I recommend it :)
5680,Stefan Radic,"February 14, 2020",1, I don't like these new pictures of people next to the text. Inclusion in pop culture is annoying. Remove the illustrations!
5681,Arthur Brown,"February 19, 2020",5," Great app. Easy to navigate, with various learning options, and increased difficulty."
5682,Angi Inch,"February 12, 2020",5, Straightforward and easy to use. Great to use a mixture of translation/speaking/comprehending. May even pay for the plus!
5683,Jayesh Bathija,"February 17, 2020",4, so far so good for the people who know the language little bit in advance otherwise I think it can be a little problem for new comers :-)

5687,Andrei Zavada,"February 21, 2020",5, I think this is one of those must-have apps for a global citizen :) Keep up the good work!! And keep the browser version in sync with the mobile one :)
5688,Ailene Markham,"February 25, 2020",4," I really like the repetition. It sounds crazy, but It's exactly what I need to increase my spontaneous conversation."

5694,Scott Mossman,"March 21, 2020",1," Used to be fun, but the hearts make learning less fun. Whatever happened to mistakes are how you learn! I dont want a stupid $13 a month duolingo plus!!! Please get rid of this garbage new feature."
5695,Mr Auchwitz,"March 16, 2020",2, It's good but even for beginner they are not good at making things stick and I find that I have to use google translate to review for the next day.

5697,Nabiza Elias,"March 16, 2020",5," With interactive stories and a cute green called Duo, this app really helps boost your love of languages and I love this app to bits. Best of all, it's free! DEFINITELY worth its five stars. Keep it up with the work Duolingo!"
5698,Firoz Alam,"March 21, 2020",3, It's a good app to learn new languages. I am learning Arabic and Japanese. But I think you should bring back the option in which we can have conversations with other learners.
5699,Paul Little,"March 18, 2020",4, The app is good but it is not really the way german is spoken in Germany. I lived in Deutschland for 7 years and it is much less formal. Good app though
5700,Winnie Mak,"March 22, 2020",5," Have been using this app to learn French for a few years now and appreciate how they add new content, stories and podcast over the time. Amazing app for learning foreign language!"

5702,Alaina Houghteling,"March 23, 2020",4, It's really helping me learn Russian! I really like the pronunciation classes. I don't like the gems and hearts though. People should be able to learn languages whenever they please. This really would help with the quarentine.
5703,Chanchal Agrawal,"March 24, 2020",5, This app is great It is really helpful and you can even run 4 to 5 courses at the same time. Really informative too.
5704,Brian Napier,"March 24, 2020",5," Absolutely awesome! It is nice to see the ""Tips"" were added since my 1st experience with Duolingo. Love it!"
5705,Sarbhanu Saha,"March 24, 2020",5," Provides a very efficient way to learn new languages, that too free. This app is very good for beginners who are starting from a scratch."
5706,Bonnie McAllister,"March 30, 2020",3, It's good but very very buggy. When I go to choose the answer It says it's wrong and shows me the correct answer but it's the exact same as what I have chosen 🤔
5707,Richard Sledge,"March 28, 2020",5," Amazing, although it does feel like more of a mobile game then a learning app, but hey, it's free."
5708,Tamara Lawrence,"March 27, 2020",3," I like it, but at times it just goes off line and make me lose my streak. Then, after almost 300 days, the entire app RESETS!!! I've lost all motivation to continue"

However, to get plus, you can either pay or have somebody download duolingo, because you referred them, yet it will let the other people download it, but it won't give me plus. The reason I want plus is because I get unlimited hearts. If i don't have unlimited hearts, i only get 5. After you run out of hearts, you cant continue learning for a while, and really makes it less fun."
5710,Rivka Lavi,"April 6, 2020",5, Amazing! In just a week I can already recite a full new paragraph fluently in another language! Never seen anything like it!
5711,Jeff Carver,"April 4, 2020",4, Good app. Some flaws but helps in getting a grasp on a new language.
5712,gaxly playz 12347,"April 2, 2020",4, Very helpful I recommend! Only bad thing is if you run out of hearts you have to wait for more.

5714,Firet111,"April 3, 2020",5, Enjoying the Japanese courses so far; learning at a descent rate since I've been listening to Japanese anime/songs for 10 1/2 decades so most words I understand the meaning to.
5715,Natalie Medina,"April 6, 2020",5, Great app. The repetition of the exercises enhances the learning experience.
5716,Ryan Woodruff,"April 7, 2020",5," Great app, can't fault it. Good for ages and a great way to learn whilst relaxing with 15mins to spare"
5717,Sarah Almeida,"April 8, 2020",4," Love the way it teaches, pretty natural. How ever if you want to learn fast you have to get some verbs and vocabulary outside to enrich your knowledge."
5718,Brenda Anselme,"April 6, 2020",5, Love the updates. It gives you checks and stores to help reinforce what I gave learned and to test conversation knowledge.
5719,Abhishek Sarkar,"April 7, 2020",5, Great for learning...but the progress is very slow....you just need a little bit of patience !!🌸🌸💗

I've since been informed that what I am learning is Brazilian Portuguese instead of Continental Portuguese and there's stark differences between the two, both in how words are translated and in the way you say it. Despite enjoying my learning experience from this app, this really dampened my learning as I've had to relearn words in Continental Portuguese."
