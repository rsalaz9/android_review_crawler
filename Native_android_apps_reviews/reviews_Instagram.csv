Because about few months I can use this app, now I can't, also when I was trying to delete this, it seems to delete FOREVER! I really don't know why, this is really pissed me off. So I have to view it on website, it is sad for me. I rate it one star, everything has shortcomings, although it has 1 billion downloads."

But for some reason, it doesn't let my like anything a lot of times. And today, now it won't let me post or comment anything. I've reported it many times but nothing seems to be happening. Please fix this Instagram, I spend a lot of time on this app! Pushing that aside, Instagram is a fun app to explore fandoms, share interests, and make new friends!"

Could you maybe add an option where we can choose which account we want to enter the app with if there are multiple accounts registered in a particular device? Because sometimes we are not mindful enough and post something meant for another account in the account that the app has opened up with. Obviously this feature won't be required for people who have signed in with just one account, it is mostly for people who have signed in with multiple accounts."
8,Michelle Lonergan,"April 29, 2020",2," I have been having a problem all day with this app. I can post something but my caption, none of my tags or location will show up with the picture. I hope this can be fixed. I only gave two stars because I really wish that you would get rid of all the nude/pornographic accounts on your site."

I'm constantly getting action blocked for interacting with people who interact with me, and for some reason, Instagram has been logging the comments in as some sort of spam. I've tried to reach out to them MULTIPLE times to resolve the issue, but I still remain blocked. The app has become far more restrictive of user behavior and I can't begin to express my disappointment. :("

15,moonwalkinator,"April 29, 2020",4," It's am amazing app and I really enjoy using it the only thing that buggs me a little is that you can't see the viewer count on stories in your archive, which leads to not being able to see replies to the question box or votes on the polls. Would be great if you could change that up again❤"

You can't interact much or grow your account because you constantly get action block! Which social media app which is made to socialize blocks you from using its features? There is no organic reach at all so its very hard to grow on the app. Action block has no duration. Really frustrating, at this rate Instagram will be replaced very soon. Keep up your good work, you will lose all your users if you don't change it soon!"

22,Geetika Gopi,"April 29, 2020",3, The new update has made sharing posts difficult. Earlier the recent DM contacts used to be displayed while clicking on the share button. Now one has to physically type the names of the people to whom the post have to be shared to. Please bring back the old way.

But my main issue is that it automatically crops your photos due to limited sizing(not a problem on Twitter btw). This can often force you to crop your photos or resize them on other apps/size.

Sadly my phone sometimes got a super delay in updates and took a year sometimes to receive updates other people already had for a year. As example the pinch zoom feature. Also still many bugs in the story. When I unhide stories for people they always go back to status 'hidden' even when in settings the story isn't hidden for anyone. Also, when you like something and save right away, the like disappears sometimes.."

Apparently I posted too frequently in a short amount of time and it sent up red flag spam alerts. I didn't know the protocol on posting/commenting.
