0,491Nlyra,"February 10, 2020",5,"Best thing ever. Because I Recently moved to a new area with no friends or any idea were anything is, I cried many tears believing I had made a major mistake. Thank goodness for Meetup. It takes time to learn each groups rules and I have incurred a couple nasty people for breaking a rule I was not aware of. You can’t make a reservation and be late from work, or you are there but u don’t know them and they  don’t know you so you are armed as a no show even though you pay for your membership in advance. I always try to be courteous and am willing to pay for a meal when I can’t find the location. I also got kicked out of a group for cancelling a happy hour when a close family member died unexpectedly. But those are only growing pains. These people go to a lot of work and time to make these opportunities available for us. I don’t fault them, I just wish they would treat new members as a new customer to their business. I have met some of the nicest people. "
1,Itendtozoneout,"May 21, 2018",1,"I've only just made an account. Is this normal? Sign up was pretty bad on a purely UX perspective. Why is there no exit/done option for users when they're inputting their information? I tapped to enter my age and gender and had no way of finalizing an input, thus couldn't move on to the next field. If I scrolled down to my age, I couldn't hit ""ok"" or ""done"" or even a ""x"" to move to the next section of the sign up form. I opted to just tapping back and forth between things and the screen needed to jump around constantly for me to even be able to reach the ""gender"" input from underneath the scrolling pop-up for the age input. "
2,Jhawary,"September 11, 2019",1,"Not Safe!!! I have an impersonator on this app! There is someone with my same name, in my same groups and same community with my same likes. Please note that my name is uncommon. You won’t anyone with my first and last name combined. I caught a screenshot of of this other profile with a photo. It is definitely not me, but right after I took the screenshot, the profile photo was removed. I reported this a number of times. At first, I thought I may have had established an account at an earlier time and had just forgotten about it. I checked my other emails but found nothing to confirm that. Now, I have proof that this is an imposter! I want this account deleted and I want a response to my complaint! Otherwise, I have to say that the people managing this app are doing nothing to keep the people who want to enjoy this app safe! I have a valid complaint and I have been ignored! The app is a great idea but I need to feel safe. Is this imposter staking me? Do I need to feel afraid to “meet up” with any of the social groups I’m interested in? I need this imposter removed and investigated! What is going on here? How can this be allowed and after I’ve made complaints? Developers (or whomever) pease, contact me further so that I may send the screenshot. I think I might have to report this to the authorities for my safety concerns... I’m only asking that the developers do their part."
3,n_a_t_2,"June 14, 2019",1,"Terrible App Several issues. The app crashes a lot, especially when I try to look at photos. I always see error messages—right now I am trying to see some events for groups I am a member of, but I am getting a message that the content is not available. Events are listed multiple times on the upcoming events section. The app doesn’t allow you to customize the push notifications you receive enough; for example I kept getting alerts every time there was a discussion in a group I’m a member of, which got annoying, so I had to turn off all push notifications from the group. When you look through events coming up, get out of the app, and come back, you have to start scrolling all the way from the beginning. I would like to be able to hide events from groups I don’t want to see. The app allows group organizers to put a so-called number of guests that are coming, which is often inflated by organizers to make it seem like more people are coming then there really are. A lot of the groups were created by club promoters in order to bring people to clubs and aren’t actually real groups. Meetup needs to crack down on groups that are using Meetup to promote clubs/people’s paid events. Like 30 grounds will all list the same event, and you have to scroll through all of that."
4,Plybrook,"September 23, 2019",5,What a god-send for people in situations where they are lonely or want to meet new people! The app lets you search for groups or activities or events by key word....or just scroll through all the events that meet-up groups have planned for the week and just click to join and get the info!
5,Bll711,"August 22, 2019",5,"Needed to find a place and some friends! Are used to Meetup as a recommendation from my sister who lives in Tulsa. She moved there and knew no one, so she got the Meetup app and found some things to do and people to meet, so she recommended it to me. I live in a different State and city and my circumstances are different. I stopped going out or doing anything and got depressed, so I use the app to get myself undepressed. I started out by just going to one yoga class and I just kept going and meeting new people and finding more more things to do and now I’m happy. I have also use the app to look up things for people in different cities and states that I care about and want them to find interesting things to do and people to hang out with. This app gives me the opportunity to check their area and make suggestions and tell them to use the Meetup app."
6,RugPilot,"January 7, 2020",4,"Pretty user friendly I’m new to Meetup and have only attended two events and have enjoyed both outings. The people are amazingly friendly, organized and very helpful. Especially to newcomers! I like the app and would give them a 5 star, except that it could use a couple more tweaks to further optimize it. For example, it doesn’t give us an option to provide feedback (such as volunteering to drive or asking for carpooling), during the RSVP stage. Only after having RSVP’d, we must go into the general comments. Another feature would be to allow folks to see the event description without having to RSVP first. Also, being new to the area, most people don’t know the acronyms which the event hosts use in describing or the names of areas. It would be helpful to have a little more descriptions (such as the level of difficulty, etc.) for the event. The State of Washington’s Mountaineering Organization has a very good system which could be used as a model. Overall, I’m very pleased and thankful for this organization. Thank you!"
7,Salinas0214,"January 27, 2020",5,Great App... better people!! This app is easy to navigate. I like that you can go in and take yourself off an even you have RSVPd for if you have something come up. The reminders are also great to your email because we are all so busy already it’s hard to keep up with so many added events. 
8,Frustrated mom-to-be,"August 15, 2018",5,"Great for travel 3 years after becoming a first time mom, MEETUP has jump started my social life again!!!  I relocated from NYC to south Florida when I was 8 months pregnant with my little one... needless to say, between being a new mom and moving to city with a MUCH slower pace, my social life pretty much took a deep dive then careened to the floor... when I was ready to start going out again, I had less than a handful of friends in my area who wanted to do the same things and were available at the same time. This led to constant cancellations and a few awkward solo outings. With meetup, I was able to connect with Like-minded women who were doing the kinds of things I liked to do so I could go out without the stress of having to do almost EVERYTHING alone. I also really like that I can send messages to the event hostess in advance if I have questions! Nowadays, I’ve been traveling to different states and I like to use MEETUP to find cool things happening in other places before I go!"
9,Littleirishtroll,"December 3, 2018",5,"Fun times, great friends, new horizons When I unexpectedly moved to the city to take care of my mother-in-law I did not know a soul. I started going hiking with a really good friend in Griffith Park through something called “Meetup” "
10,Ben Jiles,"May 9, 2018",4,"Good but navigation is confusing and redundant I honestly don’t understand the quick-to-hate for this version of the app. However, they are right when they say this new version is not intuitive and doesn’t make sense. For example, let me go over the bottom 5 tabs are for navigation of critical aspects of meet ups: 1) find new meet ups (like an advanced search feature), 2) card view of current meetup groups and you’re able to browse new ones (honestly 1 and 2 should be combined. It’s redundant and is confusing), 3) the “check mark” icon tab is for your upcoming or past meet ups. This is where you go to see them. However the check mark symbol is a little unintuitive and confusing. It would make more sense to make it some sort of calendar icon., 4) group and meet up notifications, and 5) profile. "
11,Jayenooooogain,"June 17, 2018",5,"An App to Meet People I love MeetUp. It's safe and definitely more effective than dating apps that offer connections for friends. You get to see what events are close to you, join the group and then the event. I was in a new area, didn't know anybody and through this app I've met a lot of great people. We're buddies ever since and if it wasn't for Meetup, I wouldn't have had such wonderful experiences. I'm a homebody and this app is very eye opening and thankfully the people using the app are genuine outgoing people who have a zest for life and a heart for more friends. So yes definitely pleased. On that note, my only suggestion would be to fix the notifications! Since the last update, my icon badge doesn't show anything and when I tap I see I have notifications."
12,Ekael77$,"November 5, 2018",4,"Great but $$$$$ to start a group I like this app. I’ve been able to meet people and while some didn’t work out as I hoped, I feel confident that I have a good group of people for what I want. "
13,SAS0629,"March 11, 2019",4,"Still Learning My husband and I are fairly new to the area. We hoped to utilize this app to find more activities and people with similar likes and activity level. We like to golf, bowl, bike ride, walk, we’re dog owners, we aren’t musicians, artists, or historians, but we like enjoy concerts, theater, art, and history. My husband is prior military, which helped bring us together over 35 years ago. In the military communities we always had at least one person there who could recommend things and we did as well. We want to find a good community/group and enjoy participating in activities and getting to know others through this App. We’re interested in “meetup” groups who aren’t trying to network to sell something or hook-up. Just build real ‘old-fashion’ friendships and have fun. I do recommend this app. It is up to the individual and his/her time and trust level to be willing too venture out and meet and do new things."
14,BelljarFairy,"April 18, 2019",5,"Great for the Spiritual Community I have found incredible Meetups in different cities across the country for spiritual events that I may not have found otherwise. In particular, I love how many people who host Reiki circles utilize Meetup. I have enjoyed the many yoga instructors who post on Meetup and host their sessions outside of yoga studios in parks, beaches and chapels. I have enjoyed the hikes and philosophical Meetups and the vast array of groups that I can Meetup with and connect on shared passions no matter where I am. "
15,A-Dubb_DC,"July 12, 2019",5,"What an awesome way to connect It’s hard to find other Blacks in tech and this app has given me the ability to do that as well as connect with all the other great engineers around the world that represent their respective ethnicities. All of my hobbies can be exercised on this app. Photography, software engineering/web development, Nature, sports, science, happy hour, socializing, you name it! You get a little bit of everything on meetup. And no one is here to tell you that something is or is not a good idea. Whatever you are passionate about can be pursued unabated and free or regulation and micromanagement. That’s the beauty of it all. Your imagination can take you and others that share it to the same corners of the Earth. So find out what you desire and what you’re into and are passionate about then go for it! Skies the limit people let’s all love and support each other to the best of our abilities. World peace, solidarity, equality, and freedom...meetup (no pressure by the way)!"
16,ToxicKandie,"October 26, 2019",5,So far so good. I am a new user of meetup. But I have been impressed so far.. This app is great for business owners to be on to inform people in your area about your services and or classes; extra. It’s also great for any and everyone of all ages to use. We all at some point look for something to do while we are out of the office or home; this app is a great tool to help you find something to do. 
17,Slightly Bummed!,"June 28, 2019",1,"Portrait only view...very impractical...not for tablet audience. I HATE this app for one very significant reason. It’s portrait only. Desktops, laptops, even TVs are landscape. I have a new 2019 iPad Pro 12.9” screen, with split screen capabilities, which I use a bluetooth keyboard with. Turning my device on it’s side, which isn’t even supported by most cases or stands, just to view the few apps that are only available in portrait mode is a huge inconvenience and disruption to my workflow. "
18,Adriana S. S.,"September 22, 2019",5,"Love Meetup! I love the Meetup app! It’s pretty easy to use, it allows us to keep in touch with each other.  Activities’ information is clearly posted, we can comment and even download pictures! "
19,2scribes,"March 8, 2020",3,"Ok for members, coordinators, not yet. Easy for exploration and joining. Still needs some work for coordinators. Starting a group guidance could be clearer. I didn’t realize my preliminary group description and tags were to be published immediately upon approval. It would be nice to give a coordinator the option of deciding when to publish after approval. Could also make the iPad interface more easily maneuverable and manageable for coordinators. After a couple of weeks going in circles, finally deleted the app and went back to Safari. Better, but have some suggestions. Menu bars/options could be better organized. Members could be on one side bar with applicable menu items; and events could be on the other side. It would be nice to have option of msg board fixed to home page to see/reference along side discussions board. Unless new members know where this is hidden, the messages go unnoticed. Thanks for developing this app and continuing improvements."
20,Jfdexghffsgvhfdd,"May 16, 2018",3,"Clunky + Alert bugs First, this update has caused an insanely annoying bug where notifications won’t clear. Again! I hate having that red dot and so I’ve had to turn off notifications until it’s resolved again. There already was an issue where if you get one notification that you subscribe to, the number changes to include all alerts total and that includes the “suggested groups” that you can’t get rid of. "
21,SirAlecGuiness,"October 29, 2018",4,"Interesting! Recently found Meet up. While looking for ways to meet people and hopefully make friends. I have a tough time finding people with familiar interests. The more I dig into the app the more surprising the groups and certain interest I didn’t expect to see. There are so many possibilities. Interest in quantum physics, video game nerds, music, and just getting together to meet and have fun. I haven’t been able to go to any groups yet! But November seems to be a good start. I spend most of my time with headphones on and doing everything from car restoration to airbrush pieces and many types and styles of art, in general. I’m constantly looking for stimulation in learning. Right now I’m spending a lot of free time reading and questioning physics, especially Quantum physics! Anyways, I think this is a good place to start. I am hoping for a lot of interaction and conversations with Meetups. Thanks Joshua"
22,Kallisto80,"February 15, 2019",4,"I wish I would have known sooner I just discovered this app and I am writing a four-star due to the functionality of the user interface, amounts of people who actually participate on this website but I am short one star because I held a rally at the state capital not even two weeks ago and could have used so many of these people. I work with others who are trying to help people who are in pain, or pain medicine has been branded the new drug that will get you addicted. Literally, all you have to do is think about it or if you happen to see elicit the versions of it, law-enforcement swears it is the real thing and a prescription and you will be addicted. The sarcasm as my voice is real, you can’t hear it but it is there. I’m hoping that this website will benefit more in the future and it’s on a professional and personal level as well."
23,すばらしい app! Wonderful!,"March 5, 2019",2,"Hidden Fees and Bad Customer Service I only started to make a Meetup event on their website on my phone, and though I didn’t finalize it, Meetup still made me an organizer for a group which gave me an unexpected and unasked for $20/month subscription. I re-downloaded Meetup to make an event (unknowingly the app was $10), only after seeing that the event that I never even finalized, had gained members over 80 members in a few days. Didn’t know I’d be charged for anything out of this whole deal, and have lost $30 from thinking that this app could better my life. Though they collect money without explicitly saying it, they do not have a phone number to call when you find their unexpected charges in your bank statements. Much better to make meetups via a phone or email list instead of relying on these this fake and unethical service. I genuinely believe that they add members to peoples’ groups to rope them in and keep them subscribed and distracted long enough for their hidden charges to clear in you bank account."
24,Idea Jake,"May 18, 2019",3,"Review and feature idea - request Hey y’all, I’ve never done an app review before but this has been on my mind every time I use this app for months now. Whenever I browse for events it feels like the list is bloated and searching becomes disincentivized by repetition. I’d like to see a feature which enabled blocking of groups to eliminate things you don’t like and free up the bloat within searching. Seeing the same things over and over whenever I pick it up has me not wanting to pick it up. It feels like fresh things are buried and I just am not appealed to read titles and scroll events I’ve seen every time I open this that id never care about. This app has given me good memories, albeit few, but all felt like lucky breaks and it’s felt very dry for very long for me for these reasons here. I’m here to put this review because I do care about seeing new life within this app and I’m curious about the receptiveness of its caretakers. Cheers friends and adventurers, strive to be great"
25,Never Relent,"May 22, 2019",4,"Get connected with local events Meetup is great for local businesses and groups who use the app. It’s fairly easy to join a group, to get notified of upcoming events, and fortunately most, if not all, lead persons are understanding when you can’t attend an event. Response from lead persons has been quick, professional, and helpful/understanding."
26,Scott8007,"September 2, 2019",5,"Amazing app in many ways I love this app this is so much better than a dating site, after all life is about meeting people that have similar interest allowing us to build relationships and trust as we get to know people. I know the few groups I have been part of has provided such a comfortable envirment to talk with everyone and see what you have in common. "
27,cmspnc,"December 10, 2019",5,"Never sit home alone - unless you are exhausted! There are so many opportunities from or participation in things you love to do as well as activities you would like to try.  Depending on the population where you live - you may be required to travel to a bigger town - or you could start your own Meetup group.  I belong to three different Meetups - one in Philadelphia, one in Columbus, and one in Boston - so I am never home alone even when I go for extended visits to see my family.  Each area has a different set of activities that are not only for single people - there are many groups for moms of young children, homeschoolers, fine dining with or without a partner, hiking, travel, movies, book writing - even groups to learn to speak or practice speaking a foreign language or to play an instrument!  Check it out yourself!"
28,Catzpawz00,"November 19, 2019",5,"Meetup Over the Years My husband and I have moved a lot over the years. My first big move was devastating. I moved away from the family and friends I’d had for over 20 years. I couldn’t make friends because I didn’t work with anyone my age and the church we went to had older attendees as well. When we moved again I decided I was going to take action. I joined Meetup and joined a hiking group, an art group, and eventually a moms group. All have been fantastic groups. I’ve made lots of friends in my moms group because I’ve been a part of that one for 8 years now. It takes time to make friends, but sharing in an activity of mutual enjoyment makes the friendship even sweeter. Meetup has literally changed my life. What other website/app can I attribute that to? Not many. Thanks Meetup!"
29,MamaEvaUSA,"June 21, 2019",3,Great but Glitchy I fell in love with Meetup when we moved from FL to CA. Meetup wasn’t really a thing in FL but was big in CA. Met awesome people thru the different groups on Meetup.
30,GodfadaChef,"May 22, 2018",1,"Warning!! don’t pay for membership!! After purchasing i received an email from meetup stating that my subscription was not approved because Meetup does not support groups whose sole purpose is to sell or market goods, services, events, or event spaces. Really??? How many events have I seen on meetup that requires some form of payment. But what’s worst is that I’m offering free access to multiple events and I’m not approved."
31,Dayun123,"July 17, 2018",1,"Good Luck Trying to Deactivate Your Account There is no way to deactivate your account from the app itself or using the mobile version of the site. If you would like to deactivate your account, you have to use the desktop version. If you don’t have a desktop computer that means you have to look at the desktop version on mobile and try zooming in to figure out how to deactivate. Then, even if you are logged in on the desktop version of the site you will have to enter your password in order to deactivate, which if you had it saved somewhere or you were just logging in with Google seem to be impossible so you just have to change your password just to deactivate your account.

33,Chuckr101,"September 6, 2018",5,Great way to find fun events and meet people I’ve been using MeetUp for almost 2 Years now and it’s been great! I found it after moving to a new state where I didn’t know anyone and the people I’ve met through make up almost all the friends I hang out with at this point.
34,txobee,"November 13, 2018",5,"Fabulous girlfriends More than I expected, the ladies here in SA TX are wonderful, if you are looking for true, genuine heartfelt women than this is the group!  We have so much fun and the events will keep you laughing for days. I’ve learned different games and have laughed for hours after, Oh let me not forget to mention the good food that comes with some of the events. I’m so happy I joined and let me just tell you the hostess are off the the chain with their kindness. They open up their homes and receive you like family. 😘😘😘😘🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽. Pure kindness! "
35,pollyhasacracker,"March 17, 2019",5,Great app for meeting people in a new place. I've moved twice in the past two years and Meetup helped me a lot by finding people have common interests and in the same city. 
36,RoxiBluToo,"September 26, 2019",5,"A Must Have For Growing Groups! Meetup has an intuitive, easy to learn interface that is a must-have for small, local groups. I was hesitant to pay for the service, but decided that trying it out for one month could not hurt anything. Only after signing up and having my group approved did I learn about the “Announcement” feature that Meetup provides. This feature alone makes Meetup the best service of its kind. Without the group announcement feature it would take me quite some time to find potential members. Instead, in less than a week I had a considerable membership base and have already set up our first group event which is currently at 80% capacity. I can’t praise Meetup enough and highly recommend it to other group organizers."
37,Cvb177NoThanks,"October 18, 2019",5,"Connects you w Life, for Free! This app has no ads. (That Ive seen). It allows you to connect with similar people who have interests to yours, and find events or things to do based on your preferences. Its NOT for dating (unless you look for it). It sends you reminders for things to do, local, that you’d maybe enjoy. Some are free, some not. You can add that preference too. You can message people to ask details,  send payments, whatever. Im a single woman in my late 30s, no kids,  and I have a shortage of friends to do things with. This app is great, keeps me moving and feeling like the world isn't just zooming by when I get home, am tired from work, and have no ideas to do with life but veg. I really appreciate this app. Its got me out of my ‘me only’ zone on many a week night."
38,Thunder Dream,"January 27, 2020",2,"Disappointed, no connections I’m in a city (college town) of 121,000+ people, but I haven’t found a group that fits. It would be extremely difficult and probably fall to they wayside if I started a group because I have chronic health conditions. Once in awhile I’d like to meet with some folks and be a person. I’ve not made any acquaintances since I moved 7 months ago, but I don’t think it’s that unusual. People who already have connections stick to them."
39,itsmeraphael,"March 4, 2020",5,"Best tool to meet any type of people I have been using meetup since 2011. I used it when I move to a new state in the US and opened my real estate investing business. I have used this app to find investors, coaches, friends, etc. "
40,Vron1123,"November 7, 2018",5,"First time using MeetUp I just tried MeetUp for the first time this morning... I joined the Sports Basement Run Group that runs Taylor mountain for 60min every Wednesday at 7:30am. It was just me and the event host this morning and she was completely welcoming, friendly and encouraging that I go at my own pace as I need... same as in a larger group. I made it 4.2 miles... it was TOUGH up hill for me, but I feel so accomplished for me first run in the mountains. To be honest, I was nervous to join... new situation and all, but having pushed myself to get out there, it turned out to be a great experience that I want to continue. I can see how it’s an awesome way to meet people with common interests and goals, make new friends and find inspiration and encouragement."
41,Ava Jax,"November 12, 2018",4,"Meetup app is user-friendly. Would like profiles for users. The app is easy to use & very intuitive. I enjoy reading about Meetup events and connecting with other participants on the site. I wish there was a place to put a profile with some basic information-i.e. age, field of occupation, relationship status, & personal story (optional).  Certain Meetup groups list your answers to some questions about what activities or interests you have or like, but no real profile of the individual. Also there isn’t a group for beginner investors & some other interests that I have in my area, but that isn’t the fault of the app. Individuals just need to express an interest, & perhaps someone will organize such a Meetup. In general, I find it easy to find all upcoming Meetup events on the app & RSVP for them."
42,Wendy Knight,"March 2, 2019",5,"OC Meditation Group I have been exposed to many styles of meditation over the last 30 years and none compare to my experience the last two times I’ve attended this group. Daniel leads, what I describe as, a divinely guided meditation which allowed me to get back in touch with the REAL me and with purpose. That has been what I wanted all these years but was hit or miss with other meditations. "
43,Maxwell's Magnet,"March 8, 2019",5,"Perfect for my needs Considering that I'm new to big-city life and that I'm alone with no family or friends in my new home state, Meetup has been an outstanding service to me.

45,Shh0523,"May 19, 2019",4,"THE way to plug into your community Having moved around the country for the past 20 years with work, coming full circle back to my hometown, Meetup has been the very best way to find things to do and potential new friends to connect with.  Even being back where I grew up, 20 years away has changed so much that it’s still been hugely helpful to plug into a community I really didn’t know any more.  The app works well - search on things that interest you and scroll through the groups that match, tapping on each to read the synopsis of what they’re about and what kinds of activities to expect.  If you integrate your email it’s a pretty seamless experience to be informed about and respond to upcoming activities for groups you join."
46,Byzantine67,"January 20, 2020",5,"Great way to meet new friends I just relocated to a new area with my boyfriend and sister, and this app really helped me and my little sister find fun things to do and people to do it with. I’ve been able to make a couple great new friends in the area with this app. There’s so many people on it in my area that it’s hard to imagine someone not being able to find something they like to do and people they get along with. I also know a lot of the people in the meetup groups looking to meet new friends are not new to the area, it’s really an easy way to organize events with people. We are having a lot of fun being able to do tons of things we never would have had the opportunity to otherwise."
47,anuttybar,"November 23, 2019",5,"Great way to meet people I have never created an event but I have signed up for meet and I like the way it keeps everyone in the loop by sending you an email with any updates. The only thing is that as an organizer you take a chance in people not showing up, after they said they would. Not good if you have prepared food. The dynamics are a bit different from perhaps a gathering with friends and family. You are inviting complete strangers from all walks of life who may not realize the importance of letting you know that they're not coming after all.  You can wind up with a lot of left over food. I've seen that happen. But I suppose you can always donate it."
48,603hotmomma,"March 29, 2020",5,"Pleasantly surprised! This app is a legit way to meet new people who have similar interests. I expected it to be more like a dating app in disguise- but it’s not!!! I moved to a different state, was finishing up a two year long divorce and found myself at home alone a lot. This app was mentioned to me by someone who I shared that I was feeling sort of isolated- so I checked it out. I wish I’d done it sooner! Even during this horrible time- we had a happy hour zoom get together last night! And it was exactly what we all needed. It’s a wonderful way to connect with people and there is without question a group you will find here where you’ll fit in even if you worry you won’t. So great."

50,Battery Cleaner,"July 26, 2018",4,"Excited for the future!!! So happy to use the new options on the updated APP. Thrilled about the meeting rooms with WeWorks. I am so hoping that you can update the app to include where we can go back and retrieve declined members. This month I had begun a new medication and didn’t realize that my eyesight had been affected. I hit decline on 2 new requests. I later realized after medication had adjusted what I had done. We tried everything hoping there was a way to contact with them and nope :( not possible. Please see what can be done. Otherwise I understand all the ins and outs of growth, changes, and will faithfully continue to support MEETUP and BE PART of their network. What they do to help us all connect is awesome!!!"

52,LincolnNick,"December 26, 2018",4,"Multiple pic uploads? When? Keep hearing that the photo upload is improved including the ability to upload multiple pics at once. I’ve not been able to upload more than 2-3 at one time. Otherwise it uploads just a couple then gives the infamous ‘error’ message. With 15-20 pics for any event, and EACH pic taking 20-30 seconds to upload, it’s not hard to figure out why we’re leveraging Facebook events for more of our communications. Come on, Meetup, get with it!"
53,dnoveske,"January 22, 2019",4,"Great app with only one flaw — event reschedules If an event is created, and members signup and get a confirming their attendance email then for some reason the event sponsors must change the date or time of the event all the members are moved to the new date and time appears without a request to confirm they can still attend at the new date time, further no email notice of that change. Some sponsors cancel event and create new one ... that is unfair to those who have committed to the first event if there is limited attendance allowed. It is suggested that when a event is rescheduled a mandatory confirmation must be processed within ie 7 days to hold their reservation. Also there is no process if a user says post to my calendar to remove for cancellation or move for reschedules"
54,TexasRedSox,"January 24, 2019",5,"MeetUp is great I recently relocated from a Houston suburb into the city.  One problem I realized is all of my friends are 30 miles away. I was suddenly faced with finding new friends at age 53.  The reflex reaction is go hang out at a bar and meet people.  The problem is you start with base commonality of drinking. It’s not that healthy and particularly at my age!  This app allowed me to find other people with common interests and immediately be in a group.  The events are fun for me because they are customized to my interests.  Conversation is easily started because we all know we have at least on point of common ground, and I can build friends from there.  It’s a brilliant idea!!!"
55,TanditaFrancis,"April 9, 2019",3,"Where in the World?? I really like Meetup. I’m inspired to use it the most when I travel to meet new people / find real local experiences. It’s great. I’m a New Yorker and I’m sure there there are lots of interesting local meetups, But I find that I’m far less likely to use the app now because my messages are cluttered with out of town / out of country places I’d need to fly hours away to attended. I don’t want to start new accounts for each new city. It seems an easy fix to allow a menu option or location sensitivity so that you can let the app know where you are or where you might be when you travel. This way the app will show you events that you can actually attend. Really important for traveling users which, I’m assuming so many of us are. Please fix. Thanks!"
56,JacksterMyotis789,"April 18, 2019",5,"Great for building community This app is great for finding and building community. Overall the interface works pretty well, there are a couple of improvements I would like to see at some point : I would love to be able to email all attendees of a particular event (right now options only include the whole group) after a meetup and be able to provide a PowerPoint or other document as follow up to the meetup. I wish the number of characters was higher on the message board as well, it’s not totally great for collaborating right now. "
57,Pyroflame175,"January 25, 2020",5,"Great app for meeting people and doing fun activities I started using this app to find pickup soccer games and it has worked great and I have found so many fun games to play with friendly and competitive people who love to have fun. I have since found a meetup for people speaking a language and that has been amazing too. There really is a group for everything and you will find people who are willing and in to meeting people and doing the activities that they find fun. Great app, most of it is free, occasionally some groups will ask you to pay a small fee (maybe $1-2) just to cover expenses but it’s well worth it. Truly a great app and everyone should try it."
58,Glucosafiend,"September 4, 2019",5,"Great app and free Meetup is a really great way to find groups of similar interest. If you live in a larger city, then Meetup will likely find an endless variety of groups to get involved in from outdoor rock climbing to volunteering and anything in between. I have also used this app when living in a small town and was surprised to find that there were still a lot of active groups nearby."
59,SDAnthNY,"September 22, 2019",5,Great App! After breaking up with my partner after close to 4 years I found myself lost and lonely. I not only lost my relationship but the mutual friendships too which was very hard. I was going to pick up and move from this city because I thought I reached the end of an era but the universe showed me differently thanks to Meetup. I was able to join groups to get me out there and meet new people/ new energy that helped bring back the joy in my life. I joined several healing groups and it was fantastic. I totally recommend it if you are looking to meet new people with similar interests or are fresh out of a relationship and need to rediscover yourself!

62,Frustrated Cannon Captain,"February 23, 2019",2,Onerous and inefficient to find a meetup group Meet up seems to have cornered the market initially for an app that organizes and notifies people of group events. However this app is not user-friendly. It seems like the developers could greatly improve the user experience by creating a simple filter functions for Meetup notifications.
63,al_catraz,"April 18, 2019",4,"Needs Better Notifications I like Meetup a lot as a way to find new activities and organize groups, but it’s not a great way to communicate. The notifications are a jumble, especially if you’re a member of several groups. I feel like you should be able to sort notifications by group. I’d also like it if I was notified when someone posts in a Meetup group or when changes are made to an event, but it seems like the only way to find messages is to check your email or open the Meetup app. Does it not send push notifications? Actually, it would be REALLY great if you could turn on notifications only for certain groups."

66,Kenister,"January 11, 2020",1,Terrible App. No Cancelled Events Notifications I have used this app before the visual and interface update a couple years ago. I use it regularly to attend and occasionally setup events every week with my group. 
67,Zuptup,"November 23, 2019",5,"Great app to meet people in a new city I had used meet-up in a small town before, and it was pretty useless since there’s so little going on anyways, but it’s been such a great tool to see what’s happening as I get adjusted to living in a new place and meeting like-minded people. I would suggest going to a few workshops or established events first that has a structure. I’ve gone to a couple of casual “hang” meet ups and the pressure to connect with one or two people that you don’t necessarily jive with can be a bit off putting, especially if you’re already pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone."
68,YSSALCELLEB,"January 1, 2020",3,"Crashes This app is great to find different meetups in your area with people that have common interests in varying categories. However, you’re unable to view their profile (at least I can’t) when you click on their image in the messages . It would make it easier to find out more about the individuals prior to meeting up."
69,Cassandra_F.,"October 5, 2019",5,"Best way to meet new friends! The app and the concept is the best way to meet new friends! Plus, there are options for professional networking, dating, support groups, and more. So, this app is more like the best way to connect with new people for just about any purpose! If you’re interested in something and you don’t see a group for it, then create one and it’s more than likely others will join you. Sometimes, the quality of people whom you will meet might not be to your liking but you only need to make a few good connections anyway! I highly recommend this app!"
70,Free Spirit/Trail Blazer,"August 9, 2018",5,"Meetup Review As an organizer of two separate meet up groups, I find the new set up of meet up makes it easier to schedule events. One of the newest options with meet up is to actually tag the location of the meet up on a map and make it accurate. I also find that the new meet up set up is easier to isolate exact meet up events I am planning to attend in several individual meet up groups."

Crashes unexpectedly but not hard open it immediately and pick up where I left off. The concept is awesome. I’m in a few social minorities where I live. I haven’t even known where or how to find friends. Then I stumbled on this app. I selected my areas of interest and it pulled up types of groups & events that fit.  There are groups for most types of interests, e.g. techies, programmers, gamers (both tech & board), outdoorsies, yogis, athletes, nature buffs, entrepreneurs, self-helpers, exercise buddies, travelers, artists, musicians, ... Freak yes. My life is about to be enriched by awesome peeps!"

73,crimmas,"February 16, 2020",4,"Excellent service with notification issues Meetup is great, but being 2020 and all it has too many notifications and they’re too complicated to correct easily. If you don’t want notifications for reminders or comments, you have to select each individual group and turn those notifications off, one after another. At one point I turned off notifications for the app as a whole because I was too busy to dive deep into the app to fix it."
74,haroldT38,"January 23, 2020",1,"PC mentality is ruining Meetup I was recently let go from both the Boston Horror Society and the Boston Sci/ Fi group because the organizers of the groups do not share other people’s opinions and struggles. I joined these group three years ago because I because to wanted to meet people with a common interest.  I never PMed organizers with sexual harassment message or race discrimination, all I did was PM one of them about how I felt and it started a chain reaction where they conclude to ban me.  Its like they villianize me after building years of confidence with them and now I’m the worst person ever.  What a bunch of Snowflakes these organizers become considering the organizers of these groups tend to lean liberal left and are anti-Trump.

78,hoping fod better,"January 3, 2020",1,Wrong instructions in App Support App Support instructions are wrong in many ways. Someone in support should try all the instructions on each supported platform and open work a work ticket for each error. One defect example is changing profile photo on IPhone where the instructions claim there is a workaround for the defect where changing the profile photo does not show the new photo on existing group memberships. It states each group can be changed individually but there is no way to do that. It states the profile photo is used on all groups that do not have an overriding photo but that is false because it just leaves all groups with the photo that existed before the profile photo was changed and there is not way on an iPhone to override a photo for a single group.
79,AnishaBee,"February 4, 2020",5,"Works Great! I’ve been using this app for over 5 years. It serves its purpose to help people find whatever interest groups they may be into. I’ve used it for networking/career related meetups, vegan meetups, fitness meetups, and even happy hour meetups. It’s a good way to meet new people with shared interests or just a way of keeping your calendar full if you’re new to a city. Use it when traveling too if you are looking for random events to check out. It’s pretty fun and most of the events listed are free and if they’re not it’s not anything that’s going to break the bank."

You have to delete the app from your phone and re-enter your membership information. After 5 times freezing this app is not good or worth my time! You can’t create, organize, adjust or modify an event or send emails out all you can do is lookup events or opt in or out of an event and message someone within the app so they have open the app and go to message to get the message (worthless), so it’s not a true messaging capability?

Recently I’ve been using the Meetup app to schedule times for my groups to meet at one of the local WeWork offices. It is saving me so much time I thought I could at least slow down a moment and write this review. I used to have to secure a meet up location and sometimes make deposits before having commitments from the group.

You just join the Meet Up app and sign up for the days and times you want to play. The communication is responsive, and it’s an easy-going group who will play with beginners (who know how to play but may play slowly until they get more experience) and intermediate level players. There are more groups being developed at different locations, so, if you love the game, and want to make some new friends, please join us!"
85,simejs,"October 24, 2019",5,Awesome way to meet friends Perfect app to meet friends if you just moved to a new place or to find friends with same interests. I have used this app in different states in the USA and I have made great significant relationships through here. I even became a meetup organizer because I know it works to create relationships .. a lot of my members have said that thanks to my events they have made friends. I recommend this for anyone even if you are not a social person because this meetups members are all different and you will definitely hit it off with someone for sure.
86,Siskel14,"August 22, 2019",4,"Great with a few glitches This app works well for the most part. The two problems I can think of are 1) sometimes someone comments and when you hit show me from the alerts, it then is blank where the comment should be. You then have to back out and go the event itself to actually see the comment. 2) the alerts don’t always show up. I just randomly went in to check it and there were 10 events that were created since i last checked but weren’t showing as  notifications. Overall these things aren’t a big deal and I use the app often."

She really put a great event together. Everyone had the energy I was looking for, it wasn’t just about business but really just connecting on a level that eliminated the outside world. Life changing. I did not feel outside of the box or even like I was in it. I felt like it was just a place and time of belonging and filled with purpose to do something different but yet the same in a weird sense. All shout out to L.A Homsey!"

It’s difficult meeting new people as an adult if you don’t know where all the cool hang out spots are at but this app is helping me out A LOT. I would recommend you find your first group with a strong host that can communicate where exactly you can find them because nothing is more awkward than walking into an unfamiliar place not knowing who to look for. I can’t wait to see what kind of people I can meet here 😁
90,Thalia_LOL!,"August 11, 2018",4,"On-the-Go Action I am an active and organized person, and this app keeps up with me (better than people). When I am in the mood to be curious or wander, the Meet-up app allows me to choose from an array of activities on any given day.  What’s cool about using this app is its usefulness.  For instance when I am traveling I use it to see what’s happening in an area I am unfamiliar with, and venture out if I have time.  The events in this app are uber easy to locate by date, group, and location.  It’s my go-to activity app to search for events, save what interests me, and track what I have signed up for so I don’t miss a beat."

This has also been a great way to learn new things and find new hobbies. I only wish there were more younger people on the apps. A lot of the meetups are people around 30 which is not bad but I’d like to meet people closer to my age (21). There are groups that cater to people in their 20s but they tend to be much smaller and further away."

If you travel for work or often find yourself somewhere where you don’t know a lot of people the Meetup app is great for helping you find things to do.  When I moved cities many years ago I was able to build a new circle of friends who shared my interests.  I believe my quality of life is the best it’s ever been as a result of having Meetup to bring together people like me to quickly find shared interests.  Everyone needs to know about and use Meetup at times in their lives.
110,Plain Old Fun,"August 27, 2018",5,"Rose I'm impressed with the Fabulous Girl Friends’ Meetup!  After my second retirement, I needed something to do. My friend who had recently retired invited me to the hiking event.  I enjoyed the hiking and the ladies so I didn't hesitate to join the Meet-up on the spot.  The coordinator Frankie is awesome and one of her co-coordinator Barbette is adorable.  They are always looking for different and interesting events to add to schedule.  There are variety of activities to attend just about every day of the week that include days, evens and nights.  A place to meet new friends and have plain old fun!"
111,smilin808hapa,"August 28, 2018",5,"Great way to meet new people, network, do what you like & try new things! This is a great app (at least in Hawaii) to meet new people and try new things. It’s also a great way to kick yourself back into a good habit; remembering a lost second, third, or fourth language or exercising again. I would think the experience is the same all over the world where this app works and where groups meet but I haven’t had the opportunity to attest that statement however I’d be willing to test that statement given the opportunity."
112,Sally Starflower,"September 30, 2018",5,"Mountain Mama’s gathering at Arden Music Festival My first meetup ever!  I’m glad I came. Turned out to be nice to meet some new friends . I felt welcomed by all the group members who attended. I often attend events alone and was happy to sit and dance with other Mountain Mama’s for this one. I was greeted almost immediately, as I had posted info about my appearance to the group page before I arrived. I’ll probably attend other MM events if they fit my travel schedule The moon was a deep coral color as it rose in a clear sky! Thanks to no more rain for a couple days. "
113,Justcallme I am,"October 10, 2018",5,"Meetup I like hiking but not always by myself,  when I was told about Meetup I was curious about it. I really wanted to discover the different trails of Ohio and meet people who enjoy the outdoors. I’m on my 4th adventure now, I love Meetup because everyone can join, it’s free! But personally I think it is way cooler than most other apps, Meetup is where real people go, for me it reminds me of the days when people enjoyed the simple pleasures, the Meetup app gives opportunities for being, for doing, for the love of living, and what a joy it has been!"
114,chi town white sox,"December 13, 2018",5,"Meetup App This is a great way to meet people, or become a part of a group in a social setting.  The group consist of people from all walks of life but together we all have a common goal to get out with great people, make connections, and enjoy activities that may not have been thought of or possible.  Because you’ve joined an outstanding group of people anything is possible, and I almost forgot we always seems to end up eating at wonderful hidden gems.  If you join you won’t regret it."
115,joefilmmaker,"December 19, 2018",3,It's getting better but still plenty of rough spots Meetup is a great service but the app has been a barrier to using it. Looks like it's getting better though - especially in the search area. Hope they keep focusing on improving this part.
116,Steph033,"January 30, 2019",4,"Choose wisely Great idea for a social media app! But in the beginning when you add interests, be careful what you choose to come up in your feed because it doesn’t seem like you can delete them once chosen. For instance I added Chinese culture as an interest, but the kinds of things it brings up is gatherings for only-Chinese people....and I’m not. So just pick a few topics you like at first, then can always add more later after you get to see how it works. "
117,Lairie1992,"August 10, 2019",4,"Nice for people looking for new friends I was looking for an app that doesn’t revolve on dating only & this app is perfect for me, because I was able to meet new friends. Great experience, but on technical side there’s probably a glitch. Because I have notification all the time but I can never view them unless I go back to the group(only if I remember which notification is it for). I wish there’s like an attendance button as well, like you have button for who actually showed up. Because some people will say they are going, but they really aren’t."

And I want to be able to use all the characters I want while describing my meetup! Can you please rerender the escaped greater/less than characters please?  Basically this app is barely useable."
121,bettieann,"August 26, 2018",5,Meetup is a great way to get to know a new city I moved to LA from Miami 3 yrs ago knowing only my daughter and her family. Meet ups has been a great way to find my way around a new place from theGriffin Observatory to bowling with a bunch of slight drunk folk in Culver City it’s been fun. I’ve done the Venice Art Walk and Jazz on Main Street I’ve even taken my dog to some Yappy Hours. And it’s all been fun and stuff I would not have done if it hadn’t popped up on my phone and lured me out into the world. Thanks Meetup for giving me a real introduction to my new hometown!

I have 30+ role models to look up to every week, who guide me through even the most turbulent times. Growth is not easy. Growing while still maintaining the same level of quality service is even harder.

Just as I was deactivating my page, I noticed the upgrades they’ve made by partnering with WeWork to host events and reaching out to the organizers to get together to share ideas. I missed the meeting because I was cancelling my page but now that I’ve decided to give it another try, I’m anxious to see what more they have in store. I look forward to building my group...

I have enjoyed that, but I don’t really care about the app per se. I would be happy with using the web browser for the same purpose. Is the app an improvement? I can’t tell. But in many ways that is a good thing. This app isn’t totally lame. It’s like asking me to rate ice. It cold. It it were dirty or melting I would comment on those definite problems. But otherwise, it’s good that it’s cool."

Confusion on my part I thought I was signing up for a $10 charge for each month for six months and they charge me $60 and I really do not have the money right now. I did everything I could to try and get reimbursed I cannot find a contact number whatsoever. I can’t afford food on my table right now I should not beWasting money on a fun project."

127,Brielle578,"May 23, 2019",5,"Great App The app is impressive. It’s user friendly, easy, and responsive. It is easy to customize preferences and even saves settings on its own as you adjust things to your liking. Small things like this show the app was developed intentionally with user experience in mind. I appreciate the service meet-up provides and the app makes it easy to take advantage of the opportunity to learn new skills, enjoy experiences, and meet people. It’s excellent. I wish more apps were as well developed as this one."
128,TashGreen,"September 12, 2019",4,"Clear and easy to use. This app is better to use than the native site. Besides ease of use, it’s a fantastic application to get involved in social activities and finding others with same/similar interests. "
129,Azvyx,"November 27, 2019",3,Conceptually great! Could use some polish. Conceptually The app and it’s purpose is really cool. I love how it links together people of similar interest and shows a plethora of new interest for those who are looking to expand their interest and social groups. There are a few functionality and interface problems. Such as it can ONLY be used while on WiFi. The chat message and notification section can get a bit convoluted. It is easy to lose chat threads or have them go missing altogether. The way it archived and keeps chat threads is unreliable. The interface usage could use some further polishing.

The only problem is that I can only access it from a web browser and not from the app which makes it very unappealing at the moment. Every time I try logging in through the app it says my password/email is incorrect. I’ve double checked my email(it was correct of course) and I’ve reset the password to one I would never forget, still no access to the mobile app, I’ve become frustrated with continual tries and no results. Also I was unable to find a ‘contact support team’ link on the web browser which may have been user error or too hard to find."
131,Honey222666,"March 12, 2019",1,DO NOT use this app. You will never be able to use Meetup again if you do! This app is terrible - I wholeheartedly recommend just using their site. The only way to join groups is to search for them online.

Honestly it’s been a really helpful app n was my first foray into social media or any semblance thereof- I even had avoided my space n it was great too once I created another social media page n am running political page now and yet I still rely on and use daily my meetup app - muy bueno! And it is free. Can’t go wrong..... unless that’s your thing lol n then u can find others into your cup of t- sew too speak/write....😎
135,octbornguy,"August 6, 2019",5,"More of a breakthrough Meet Up allows others having similar goals and ideas to actually MEET and exchange thoughts, plans, and/or ideas. Even social movements are covered! Whether it be hobbies or innovative ideas this app allows people to collectively meet and move forward.. Its great! I use it all the time (being that I’m in Real Estate)..  There’s something in it for everyone! Social, Political, Industrial, etc... There’s literally no discrimination vs. any mindset, skill level, or field of practice! Good luck with your “innovation!”"
136,KCSsequeira,"December 13, 2019",5,"Meetup app streamlined user experience It’s a good app. If you are on here and don’t have the app, you’ll get 50,000 emails about events and have to scroll to find what you are looking for or worse- log in. Just breakdown and download one more app. Meetup is absolutely fantastic and tracking your events, & event logistics is just going to exponentially easier on the app. I put it off, b/c one one of those “I don’t need another app” people. But, let’s face it — I did. Meetup is cool and it’s even better on the app."

But if I could rate anything, apps, friends inviting me to parties, walking around trying to make friends all the time, meet up is so so so helpful. Just know what you’re looking for and have a mind open PLUS feel like you can socialize personally. You will get exactly what you’re looking for, only if you try to make an effort. :)"
138,Dustybella,"November 21, 2019",5,Great way to connect At the suggestion of my daughter who found a wonderful group of friends after she moved to a new location I tried it. Newly divorced after 40 years I did not know where to begin. I found a wonderful divorce support group that met regularly and several other groups for activities. The more I expanded my geographic area more was available. Thank you Meetup for helping me start a new phase of my life with many interests and activities to choose from.
139,pdr3vi3w3r,"September 24, 2019",5,Meetup Meetup is a great opportunity to meet new people! I have used it when moving to new cities and it’s been a lot of fun! You simply choose a group to join based off your interests and choose which events you would like to attend. You even have the option to host an event if you’d like. Some groups are public some are private but you just have to send a request if that is the case. It’s been a great way for me to explore this new city I’m living in and socialize!
140,RevSylvia,"October 4, 2018",5,"It’s a fantastic way to meet likeminded people I’m a member of three Meetup groups and in all three groups I’ve met amazing and interesting people. I’ve made friends with a few of the women and it’s been a lovely experience. There’s an easy camaraderie that develops quickly and a sense of fun and security even if it’s your first time. The variety of interests groups is staggering! Whatever you want to try, there’s probably a Meetup group that’s established. Or, you can start your own group! It’s easy!"

I think there’s one issue for me being in Central NJ there’s a lot of NYC meetups that I would love to be able to filter out of my search results. If the meetup group had the exact location more prominent that would be helpful as well. Great product, thanks for making it so great!"

I even became an organizer after some time and love it!"

Everyone on here is here to meet new friends. So the ice is broken.

It gets you to try new things, meet new people and have new experiences. Meet up has changed my life."
147,Tricarnetry,"April 26, 2020",5,"Great app with an efficient layout design. Meetup is a very great idea for those who want to narrow down their search pertaining to what appeals to them for both activities and just social environments in general. It takes time, effort, and some patience but with that in mind you can eventually find a group/collective of inidivudals going out to the movies, cafes to chat etc. to meet with. This app from Meetup makes this a more efficient reality to pursue from the palm of your hand. Well done Meetup!"
148,russgold,"February 28, 2020",1,"Asked for Password So I decided to create a MeetUp group and I clicked create a group and it kept asking for my AppleID password which I thought was off. Kept clicking cancel and create group again. Decided ok whatever enter password it’s not asking me to buy anything. Then it takes me to a page that would let me subscribe without entering my password again (depending on your settings of immediately require password, 15 minutes, etc) and gives me the option to pay $16-$23/month to create a group on this app. Ok bye Facebook creates free groups and over a billion people are on Facebook and they don’t try to trick you into subscribing. Jesus that’s like double the price of Netflix per month."

150,Dwordo,"September 26, 2018",4,"This Latest Release is Great The mobile app does a great job of staying in sync with the browser version. There are more options with the latter, but this app gives me access to what I need to see and change (as an Organizer) frequently. Messages, for example, are instant and allow me to switch back and forth from either platform in real-time. RSVPs are live as well. To me, this makes for a great mobile app because it’s not just statically displaying info. Rather it’s dynamically letting me interact with the info in real-time."

157,Julie Lillian,"December 4, 2019",5,Great! Depends on where though This is my third new city living in that I've used Meetup to meet people. It's definitely a great way to meet people based on mutual interests and to hear about events that perhaps you otherwise wouldn't have as a new person in town. Not every city uses meetup a lot though so it's better in slightly larger cities. But at the very least you can find some interesting places and cool people. All about what you put into it.

Meetup has been instrumental for me in getting out and enjoying life more."

Before the crashes I was getting push notifications (little red bubble with a number) but none of the notifications showed up in my feed when I opened the app. Even when I can see new events sometimes they don't show up until later (huge lag) or I miss messages entirely.

The only issue I have is that some people use it to promote their business and don’t share there is a fee to attend a class. You have to ask them specifically so you are not surprised. However, I don’t think that is the apps fault. I think it’s the individuals who create the group to disclose if they charge for their meet up."

I asked for a refund as I read in policy that they have 30 day cancelation fee. They answered me kindly, in a business like matter, and said I could not receive my money back. I do not want to waste my time going back and forth so I will bite the bullet and pay. I just moved to a new country and cannot be leader of a group as I don’t know anything about the area. I want to say that my experience using the app was not good and that their understanding of my situation was bad customer service by the company."

Got me out there and within time, now run my own Meetup group for those grieving losses and getting out for walks to be with like minded folks, no pressure to share your story of why in the group, something to look forward to, fresh air and get some good endorphins engaged to fight off the blahs."

It’s provided me with endless opportunities to golf, play cards, go out dancing and dining... you name it. Awesome website!  Whatever your interests, there are others out there who share those interests and, like yourself, are looking for others to enjoy those interests with. The meetup website provides the avenue to reach out to those people and plan things together."
175,Airohed,"March 26, 2019",5,Do what you like with others Downloaded the app to look for like-minded people to ride motorcycles with. Found what I was looking for quickly and easily. Lots of notifications for different kinds of meetups makes it easy to find other interests and even easier to stay in contact with multiple members for planning and/or questions. Public forums and ability to contact other members really simplifies meetup groups. Love the app!
176,Gail 12159,"April 5, 2019",5,Meetup This app enables individuals to look for groups that meet that are seeking to engage others in interests they share.  Because meetups are organized in a local area a participant has an opportunity to meet people with similar interests as well as participate in the planning of activities.
177,Kiera91,"May 1, 2019",1,"The notifications need work. I downloaded the app to keep tabs on updates surrounding events I’ve RSVPd to. I have turned off push notifications for one group multiple times now, and they still come up. I’ll get a push notification for one post, and then a few minutes later, I’ll get a second one for the same exact thing. Then the icon will tell me I’ll have 7+ things to look at. When I open the app to clear the number, it takes a long time for it to actually load the notices and go back to zero. Considering deleting the app and going back to checking my email for updates because this is incredibly frustrating."
178,anon 12987,"February 1, 2020",3,"One and the same event appears 50x in a roll Annoying app, one and the same event appears 50x in a roll, you keep scrolling for 5 minutes and nothing else beside one event you are even not interested in appears over and over again. Also some event organizers post their events 50x, slightly changing the name of the event to achieve more attendants. Some organizers tarn their events under interesting names, when you get there, you find yourself in some religious center, among people who try to establish a new religion and discus their new bible :) you end up reading their “bible”."
179,ron-naturist,"July 3, 2019",4,"Great way to find groups with your interests The Meetup group is a great tool to find groups in your area that have a common interest.  It is easy to use and while it does not provide all the same functionality as their website, it is very convenient to use when a PC is not handy.  Their messaging tool and notification alert you when their is an update.  Above all I appreciate their Customer Support staff and their open mindedness unlike Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Flickr, Pinterest, etc."
180,WhataburgerCrazy,"April 9, 2018",5,"Definitely Skeptical I decided I needed to meet new people even not being new to town. I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. To my absolute surprise I met a great group of girls and have been friends with some of them for over 2 years now. I was able to meet smart, funny, career-oriented women that have similar goals and interests as myself; I was able to surround myself with people that add value to my life. This experience gave me much more than I expected."
181,GoldengalGina,"June 20, 2018",5,Need more features! I would like to fully interact with my Facebook account because it’s much easier to create content outside of Meetup.
182,TravelingLadyBoss,"August 20, 2018",5,"Amazing way to build community I am a group leader on Meetup, as well as a member of several groups. I have great friends, but most of them are married with young kids, so it is a blessing that I have found Meetup groups!! I am able to maintain a very active lifestyle and continue self-improvement through various new groups! And making great friends/acquaintances along the way! You cannot complain that you are lonely when there are meetup groups!!"
183,Eklund32,"October 31, 2018",5,Great to get out of your comfort zone This app is awesome. Gets your out of your comfort zone and taps you into new communities no matter where you are at.  You can always dive into something completely new and find people to join you along the way with this app.  Helps to break current cycles you may be in or to just find Groups that are more aligned with what you enjoy.  It’s one of the better apps for well being in the world no doubt
184,Ahvdgbnmczddjkk. Bddybbcp,"November 28, 2018",5,"Great Resource for Expanding Networks Although this app is relatively new, there are still events being posted daily. The spectrum of events and groups continues to grow and grow. I was able to expand some of my professional networks with this app by reaching out to other women coders in the Los Angeles area. It is a wonderful tool not just for professionals but for those just wanting to explore a new city, meet new friends, exercise, eat, play board games and so so much more."
185,Clearlyliving,"January 30, 2019",5,"Great place to get acquainted! Looking for a special interest group? A new dance partner? Have you relocated and looking for new things to do and a friendship circle? This is your app! Easy to find what interests you. Join, attend and mingle. I travel a lot and use the app to find things to do where I go. Meet new people. Make new friends. I have relocated and this app was the perfect instrument to get me out in my new community, finding things I like to do with like minds. Perfect!"
186,SkiYogaChick,"January 19, 2020",4,Meetup I like meeting people interested in the same things I’m interested in thru meetup!  How can I add more then one picture so people can see a picture of me doing the sports that we do in common to build report before we go? There was also singles groups that wanted everyone to have a head shot. I used to be able to have seven pictures on my profile. Can you please add that feature back? Also I’m wondering for sports can you add something about skill level?  Thanks SkiYogaChick
187,rustycarey,"September 1, 2019",5,"Always been impressed This app is excellent across multiple platforms. Intuitive and easy to use. I don't personally care for the way it updates the last Meetup group I viewed, and sometimes when I view notifications, it doesn't update whatever the ""viewed"" flag is until the second notification. None of that is annoying enough to mark it down at all. Still a great app."
188,PBnVicki,"July 12, 2019",5,"Fun and Useful App I’ve really enjoyed using the Meetup app so far. I’ve already gone to some fun meetups and the app hasn’t caused me any trouble and is easy to use. The only thing I dislike about it has more to do with the groups and less to do with the app. I don’t like that some groups come off as accessible to all the. Only allow 4-6 people to attend each event. Anyhow, I’d recommend using this app to connect with people in your community."
189,Gc555,"July 1, 2019",5,"Excellent interaction I recently adopted a sweet pit mix that was afraid of other dogs.  We think she was isolated.  I have been working with Tasha for the last few months to get her to look but not react.  It has taken a bit of time but she is doing so good, I am a proud momma!  I am so happy that I was lucky enough to find Tasha, can’t even imagine where we would be today without the her guidance and support.  I highly recommend any of her classes or hikes. She is fantastic!"
190,ajboning2,"May 2, 2018",1,"Message Filter is too strong!!! I just downloaded this app today and I’ve been trying to send a message back to someone who reached out to me but I can’t send even send a single message because it keeps being flagged for not being creative enough! I understand the purpose of the filter, for sure, but the worst part is I can’t even tell what’s being flagged, so I have no idea what to fix."
191,patychics,"August 26, 2018",5,"You will find even what you are not looking for At the beginning I was weary of this app. One more online thing where, if you don’t have adventurous friends( like me) you are set to go blindly into an abyss. "
192,Erinnae123,"September 2, 2018",1,Took my money for subscription will not let me start group So I was super excited about this app but after paid my subscription fee to start a group it will not let me complete the group with absolutely no explanation. When I tried emailing for help and eventually a refund. I got an email saying they were too busy to personally answer my emails and referred me to frequently asked questions section. Just stinks because I am new to the area and was kinda excited about starting a group! Still waiting for help/refund whatever comes first I guess. Seems like people who want to start groups have the most complaints in reviews. I see why now.
193,Letys03,"January 9, 2019",5,"Great way to meet people I’ve been a member since 2015. Being single and dedicating with life to work and going to the gym ,I didn’t have time to socialize or engage in activities I enjoy. It has given me the opportunity to meet people with similar interests. "
194,Minnesota Mad Man,"December 25, 2019",5,"Great Network and BI Resource I have enjoyed the local meet up events in the Twin Cities. The original used email updates and was alright. Once the app came, it added a lot of useful tools. For one, you can organize better."
195,LisaIXOYE,"September 7, 2019",5,"Connect w/ like minds, ideas, learning, events, humans Love this app! Wish every group, planner, open event, city, church, organization, school, or committee used it! When you want to do something (anything) and you don’t know where to find people to do it with.... look here! "
196,Fachad,"June 27, 2019",4,antidote to the isolation inherent in modern life. This is a great app that allows you to meet with like-minded people and discuss topics that you’re all enjoying.
197,laughteryogini,"January 7, 2020",4,"MeetUp app much improved I started using MeetUp about 6years ago. It was not intuitive or user friendly. I’m so glad to see the improvements made. I enjoy the different reach it has from FB & IG. MeetUp still has some catching up to do to these other social media platforms particularly in sharing events to other groups. Yes, there should always be admin approval, but it is cumbersome to have the group admin re-do an event (that has already been created) just to get it onto another group."
198,Flor d'Luna,"June 17, 2019",5,"Moving to a new place? This is my second time moving cross country and meet up has been a perfect outlet for me to dig my feet in and try new and different activities. The people are always welcoming and friendly. This app has helped expedite the often painful process of getting out there as the newbie. Highly recommend for anyone thinking of trying a new activity, skill, practicing old talents or moving to a new place!"
199,Carolea5,"October 16, 2019",5,Awesome app and site Love Meet Up. Have found all kinds of activities to do and met wonderful new friends from this site. The app makes it super convenient to sign up and keep track of what I’m doing or may want to do. Getting notifications helps make sure I see quickly what is scheduled so I can sign up before the activity fills up. Have had no issues with the app. Much easier to use than the webpage.
200,TracieMarie77,"April 15, 2018",1,"Absolutely terrible changes. I used to use this app about 3-4 years ago but stopped for a bit. I have moved out of the area and figured I’d reconfigure my settings and give it another try since I stay at home with my toddler and am always looking for new things to do. You can’t even make changes to your interests without doing it on the desktop version. And since when did groups start having to charge a fee to join? Definitely going to be getting onto the desktop version and deactivating my account completely, because again, can’t do that within the app either.  Thanks for ruining what used to be a good thing."
201,Sheeb@10,"June 6, 2018",1,"Extremely Frustrated!!! The new features has destroyed this app! No longer user friendly, can’t get assistance when you need it. Group emails not being received by members. I canceled an event just to see it pop back up onto my calendar and have members show up to a cancelled event. Ugh!! Deleted members reappear!! Can’t upload photos. I’m so done! I’m here now looking for a new app. It’s not worth the money anymore. They administrators promise you they are working on your issue... they never get back to you. it’s been a year and still having the same issues. The one thing that never fails and is always on time... is the deduction of your payments."
202,mindaika,"January 1, 2019",2,"Intrusive UX You are required to sign up for an account to enter the app. It’s 2019, people. Pay attention to the endless Facebook scandals"
203,Bushdog06,"March 12, 2019",2,Support site can’t solve problem with profile picture Help! I’ve already tried the support website and no luck. I tried to change my profile picture on my iPhone 6 and it wouldn’t change it. I then tried deleting my photo to add another and now I have no photo. It will not upload a photo. I went through the support site with no luck. I tried a ticket and it literally took me back to the basic instructions which didn’t work in the first place. I tried it on my son’s Galaxy with no luck. I’m about to be kicked out of a group because I have no picture.
204,JLLMJ,"May 1, 2019",5,Great Experience So Far! I used MeetUp to connect with a local occupational group. The app had many different meetUp groups to choose from so I was able to pick one that meets right near my house which was very helpful because I don’t have a lot of extra time to give. The group I met was super friendly and very helpful in answering some of the questions I had. I’ll definitely be going again next month!
205,msrravlr4u,"October 9, 2019",5,"Meetup gives opportunities The Meetup app is really great because it customizes opportunities and possibilities for each individual person. When I moved to the area I was able to look up walking, but not just walking but walking for people over 50. I also like that I don’t have to join something forever, I can try it out and see if the group is for me. Thanks to meet up for organizing these opportunities!"
206,RainbearNJ,"September 13, 2019",3,"Constant notifications I am constantly getting notifications of messages in meetup groups. Messages I’ve already read. Messages that haven’t changed or been replied to. Just “oh we thought maybe you didn’t see the prior four notifications of this same damned message in the same damned group since we're not sure you saw it, even though you’ve clicked on the message notification to read the message already, so here’s your fifth notification in 15 minutes!!!"
207,StinaWinapita,"January 31, 2020",5,Never an excuse to be alone I find that there are always so many meetup options on here.  I’ve really enjoyed it.  I have not made it to too many events-Just a few but it’s so nice to have the option to meetup with other likeminded people. There really is no excuse to stay home or to not make more friends.  It just takes some courage and determination to put yourself out there and meet new people.
208,clpru,"October 27, 2019",5,"Domestic violence I’m always impressed that even in 2019 people don’t want to participate in domestic violence training. Domestic violence occurs to the rich and the poor yet Women and men would rather keep it in a closet. I hope next time more people come. I was very impressed with the speaker she has gone through a lot, yet she wants to help others in the community. Domestic violence occurs more now than ever and I wish more people would attend these meetings."
209,Murzaliev,"June 15, 2019",4,"Needs improvements Selective push notifications don’t work for some groups. And the worst thing for me is an annoying feedback popup after meetups, it came with a recent update. I guess this feature should be switchable in settings. "
210,Mushin9282,"August 22, 2018",5,"Great place to connect I have changed my life through this service. There was a time I found support during my Divorce. There was a time I found my way to a group of people that became my family. There is also a group that led me to like minded gamers. The app makes this mobile. I connected with the desktop version . I also prescribe it to my patients in my Substance Use Treatment facility, as I am a Counselor for the last 19 yrs."
211,MEB reviews,"August 25, 2018",4,"Great way to try something new Place that connects people from all of around the country. You can look through the meets according to date, according to location, or according to interest. My only complaint is that sometimes groups are created for the sake of creating a group and they really never put any events. You get excited about it and then you click to realize there’s no events. That’s not the apps fault. That’s not the apps fault; the app is good."
212,zeeekk,"August 28, 2018",3,"Accurate time Time efficiency, is overlooked with this app when trying to make plans. "
213,thejoshkdavis,"December 23, 2018",5,"It’s all about the people! I found drawing group with Meetup and it has been wonderful to share some good conversations with other artistic minds and create a few fun sketches along the way. If you don’t have many groups that interest you in your area try taking the courageous step of making your own! The app is just a medium to initiate a get together, it’s up to you to show up and put your best foot forward."
214,Live Vibrantly,"January 18, 2019",5,Great for the organizers of MeetUps I really like the improvements on this app for organizers of MeetUps.    I can now make edits and photos and schedule events more easily on the go.   (I wish I could announce the meet ups from the app.  It would also be cool if we could have a schedule option to make announcements) 
215,teeda165,"February 17, 2019",5,"It is about time! I am love there is this app for people who are in their mid-singles. It gives us a chance to learn from really terrific people, but also gives us a chance to meet interact with friends who have common interests. Thank you so much for those who have made groups and provided spots for meet up sessions. I only hope that someday I can be clever and thoughtful enough to come up with my own meet up group!"
216,Becky_Socal,"April 7, 2019",5,"Excellent way to meet new people while traveling I’ve been using Meetup off and on since 2007! I’ve found that depending on the country, some people are more active on meetup than others. I have used it in LA, Mexico City, London and Barcelona with good success. However, I found it wasn’t really used in Hamburg. Just depends on the city/country but is an excellent way to find new activities, meet like-minded people and learn new things!"
217,Christine Sunny,"January 19, 2020",4,"Connections to great groups and activities I enjoy the Meetup app to explore and find groups of interest, see what events and activities I might want to join, and be reminded of those I am involved with. I can find events to do with others and make new connections."
218,npwphoto,"November 20, 2019",3,Meetup App So let me start by saying I have been an organizer for 2 photography groups for the past 6 years. We are at over 4000 members between the two groups. I really liked the layout of the original site because I could show sponsors and images with my base text. I hope Meetup can find a way to add my sponsors links to the app.
219,briansgate,"August 16, 2019",5,"Straightforward group connections for like-minded folks Great place to find folks who share the same interests! I’ve found three valuable meetups already, and the app is only just starting to be discovered by the general public. It’s like Facebook, but only for groups and events, streamlining the ability to connect diverse people. And of course, the more people get involved, the more diversity and specificity there will be."
220,dmstevens,"May 18, 2018",4,Completely unusable **update: The problem seems to be resolved. I now have no issues with the app. 
221,MYGAMEALWAYZCRASHEZ,"July 20, 2018",1,Worst Customer Service The idea of the app is great and the app itself is great...until you encounter a problem. They are definitely trying to scam you and take your money. If you have a problem or they overcharge you there is no way to contact them. They have no phone number they just tell you to send an email. When you send an email they take about 3+ weeks to respond. I am being overcharged every month and am not receiving what I am paying for and yet there’s nothing I can do because they will not answer my emails. I will be deleting this app and discontinuing their service and having all of my members do so as well.
222,Hersson Martin,"September 21, 2018",5,Amazing If you are a business owner trying to expose yourself to new individuals. MEETUP is a great place to start. Not only do you have the ability to join Events and network. But you also have that great piece of mind knowing that you can be part of groups with like minded individuals who already share a topic your part of. It makes it a lot easier to talk to people when you have a common interest.
223,BelgianBeerMonk,"October 2, 2018",4,"Needs a little work but good app overall This app has undergone several changes over the years. I can’t say that those changes have drastically improved much and I still find it fairly confusing to navigate, but I can usually find what I’m looking for. Getting to a calendar can be challenging though. I use this app almost daily and overall I’m happy with it. 2 stars for ease of use, 4.5 stars for information available to the user."
224,angellsmith,"October 2, 2018",5,"Easy to use, easy to connect Meetup makes it easy to find like-minded folks, build a community, and get-together."
225,jewelsco,"February 28, 2019",5,Finding my tribe I am fairly new to the area and have not found many like-minded friends to explore ideas with. Meetup is a great tool to gain new experiences and perspectives through activities of interest. My favorite feature allows you to look at activities in the area at various times of the weekend. I did a wonderful group meditation in the morning and screened a powerful documentary in the afternoon all using meetup!
226,trilla696969,"June 5, 2019",5,Meet Ups I wanted to personally thank this app for it has made me become very successful in my career! I started using this app during college and continued to meet up with like minded individuals in my local areas and helped me network and grow with my goals. 
227,chalee137,"November 18, 2019",5,"Meetup app is essential I am on the go enough that it is much too inconvenient to conduct meetup activity on my pc(s). In fact, I no longer do any meetup activity there anymore. The app is too convenient. I still spend hours each day on my pc, but for work related activity or streaming music and movies on my home stereo system. Ear pods are great but they really are no substitute for a large screen TV and a good home entertainment center."
228,Hildagard,"February 22, 2020",5,Meetup I was just introduced to this app by a grief counselor as a way to meet friends following my husband’s death. I am new to the area and very lonely.  I was able to find a group immediately and two hours later was enjoying happy hour at Bonefish with a meal while visiting with my new group!  I would not have gone out alone!  It was just the medicine l needed to find a way to meet people and get on with my life.
229,C O P,"February 17, 2020",1,"Good grief!  And I am paying a monthly fee for this? I have been a MeetUp organizer for over 2 years.  I use a Safari browser on an up to date iPad. There have always been problems with the website but the last month is even worse than usual.  The website will no longer copy an event.  Photos will not upload. (And yes, I know how to do this.) The map will not let me change the address.  I tried the new app to see if it was any better and the app will NOT rotate to landscape so that I cannot use my iPad keyboard!  To top it all off, my credit card is being charged each month for this frustration."
230,Nikkilove928,"December 7, 2018",5,"Amazing app I adore the meet up app. I was looking for a social group that suffers from chronic pain. I was skeptical at first to go but after attending, I’m so happy I did! I’ve met amazing people who experience the same pain I go through on a daily basis. I’m learning so much from attend the support group. I’m forming lifelong friendships that are very rare in this day in age. There are so many social group on Meet Up. I plan on attending other groups as well."
231,Qscgtredfrybv,"February 12, 2019",2,"It’s kinda okay The app has a nice interface. I wish there was a way to edit any and all of my profile in the app. I’ve also had a bug pop up where I write a post or message to someone and it just doesn’t show up after I write it all out and post it, so I had to write it all again. I also have an issue where when someone wrote back to me, and the post was long enough to warrant a ‘read more’ selection so you can expand their message, it wasn’t actually linked to anything, so I can’t see the rest of their message. It’s just regular text."
232,sleeperdaydreamer,"April 25, 2019",4,"Meetup brings us together The meetup app makes being social doing what already interests me seem as natural as if it all happened by chance. There’s a wonderful amount of groups here so that everyone can find their place. It can take searching to find the right ones, but I think it has been and will continue to be well worth the effort. The app has allowed me to abandon my comfort zone and share my life with others who want to do the same."
233,KaiiDeniese,"January 25, 2020",3,Small things Some Organizers have such pride about them that they can’t stand to see 1k members and only 30 attendees (which is a success btw) so they charge membership fees.... Huge CON ; had to leave a few groups bc of that. I just find that very selfish and greedy and it kills my passion. I would be more receptive if they charged a small fee per event. At least I can still participate; ppl can’t just make every event to deny them membership how is that meetup-meet people-network friendly??? these creators are delusional
234,Houdafuq,"January 17, 2020",5,Exactly what I was looking for! Moving to a new country can be challenging. You leave friends and family behind and start a new adventure. You feel a little disoriented and don’t know where to go for new activities and to meet new people. Meetup is such a well thought concept. It makes your life easier and it’s also easy to navigate and convenient. Very grateful for this app!
235,K Holt,"January 15, 2020",5,"Great app Sometimes when I think to myself I have nothing to do , I’ll check the app  activities happing around me and just pop in provided space is available.   This is very good for me because of my work schedule.  Someday I may work 3 hrs and others I might work 10 hrs so it always hard to plan.    Meet up makes it so easy to always have something to do with like minded people."
236,XM053,"December 26, 2019",5,"Finally! A breath of fresh air! Excellent app that gives one the chance to join groups and meet people. Finally! You can send chat messages too but mainly you pick a group you like, check out their events and rsvp letting the event organizer your going. You also see others that are going too. Navigation is effortless and I’m so happy that I found this app! Now time to explore the city!"

238,Courtneybxny,"October 12, 2019",4,"Excellent Way to Meet New People Meetup is a great way to meet new people with similar interests. Meetup was integral in my transition to Atlanta and meeting fellow Yankee fans with whom I've become permanent friends beyond catching games. Meetup has also been unexpectedly effective in furthering my career with UX meetups. Next, I'm thinking about starting a suburban dad basketball league through Meetup. If you have an interest in expanding your horizons and making new friends socially or professionally, Meetup is an option not to be ignored."
239,davenpod16,"July 24, 2019",5,"Great app, opens up opportunities I wouldn’t have known about Where else would I find out about something so specific as “Gay Men Over 40 Hiking Group”? Meetup makes it easy to find and join events in your area, or where you’re traveling. Check it out, download and get started meeting new friends and having new experiences! I’ve been to dozens of events with 7 different groups so far, more to come!"
240,cmandy9,"June 6, 2018",1,"Push notifications options The latest update added push notifications whenever a group that I’m a part of posts a new Meetup. I don’t want push notifications for all the new meet ups. However, I do want push notifications whenever I receive a message through the app or reminders that a Meetup is about to start. That is actually helpful. "
241,24x7x365+leap days mom,"August 30, 2018",4,"Laura This has been so helpful! Not just in finding people that have the same concept of fun, but finding things to do has become simple. If you’re a scheduler, you could schedule your days away. If you’re a last minuter, you can rsvp that day and pop up. Perfect for all levels of activity and commitment. Only issue is that site can make details a bit cumbersome and clumsy to change and charges for groups limit possibilities."
242,Lizzmatic,"September 12, 2018",5,Dope app. My friend told me about this app cause I wanted to get into comedy and I just didn’t know where I could find some comedy friends... downloaded it and followed different group around town I didn't even think I would be interested in but hey... we all need new friends to expand our life experience and this app help you find new things to do with a group of people that want that new experience feeling as well.

244,Coppertop1234,"October 11, 2018",4,"Meetup Ap Review Great ap for keeping us informed of available meetups and groups. Great about sending reminders, based on your account feedback. Would like more distance and/or specific location options for groups before being forced to join a group and then find out the meeting place is quite a distance away. Also, some age related options might also be of use. You don’t want to be the only one there over 50, etc."
245,LaQuoia,"January 21, 2020",5,"Love this app for making meaningful connections I’ve made meaningful connections with people no matter where I’ve stayed through this app. I met a friend in 2013 and we are still friends to this day having lived in several different states over the last 7 years. You do get what you put in, but I highly recommend it if you are willing to get out of your comfort zone."
246,DennisSJ,"January 12, 2020",1,"Flaw in Version 8.1.12 If you are attempting to attend a Meetup of which you are a member and there is a preset time to hit the “attend” button, the usual practice of refreshing the screen at the appointed time will FAIL to create an “attend button”. You must exit the event and reload which loses important seconds if the order of the sign-in determines an important aspect of the meeting. The creation of the lower window for the “attend” button defeats the primary purpose of Meetup, which is to sign-in for a meeting. This version is less responsive, less effective, and less useful. A version that decreases the functionality of an application’s primary purpose is a failure."
247,lauren91818,"December 1, 2019",5,"Love it! This app is helping me keep my head up while going through one of the biggest shifts in my life- I’ve cut off all on my (fake) friends, and I left my abusive boyfriend. I am alone, but meetup is helping me keep from becoming an isolate and staying alone. Socializing with the awesome, high-vibing, positive people through yoga meetups, toast masters, and brunches is really invigorating! I am excited to continue exploring the app and finding more magic. :)"
248,BjornAcampada,"August 27, 2019",5,"Clear, Concise and Very Fun MeetUp is the perfect mix of getting  enough information about a huge variety of community events. You know just enough to be able to decide whether or not to go, but you can also ask questions and connected with others to know more. I’ve practiced Spanish, jammed with local musicians, spoken at open mics, created art, gone to dating events and so much more."

So many of my very interested I have been enjoying any sort of “bubble“ for too long, now I have the added benefit of being able to participate in them with groups of like-minded people. Wonderful app, and wonderful communities to discover."
250,TrackSol,"June 24, 2018",4,"Minor issues I like the app. The design is standard fare for current iOS, though I appreciate the light grey bars to seperate sections. It looks great on my iPhone X. The only problem for me is that push notifications don't seem to be working. The app won't have any badges or popups/history yet when I go in the app there will be new updates/comments/likes etc. I have everything turned in both the phone and app settings and both are updated."
251,Sheriwine,"August 17, 2018",5,Meetup I’ve met some great folks! There are groups for every interest and they’re always doing fun things. I wish I’d discovered Meetup sooner. I’ve been a widow for 13 years and have spent most of that time alone and wishing I could meet people with whom I would have common interests. My social calendar is definitely a busy one now! There’s always something fun to do and great people to enjoy those fun times with you!
252,SDB136,"August 26, 2018",4,I recommend Meetup app I’ve had positive experiences meeting people with similar interests.  Work keeps me pretty busy and Meetup has been a safe and fun way to be more social. 
253,Kingmc727,"October 20, 2018",5,Great app for new activities with friends and making new friends. I recently returned from Asia and it’s nice to meet people who have similar interests and or want to try new things. I’ve gone to a great card game meetup as well as soccer events. It’s great because I can plan or choose planned around my work schedule. I hope to continue to meet more great people. I’ll continue playing soccer with new people for sure.

255,tjradar,"February 7, 2020",5,"Great app to meet others in your area of interest Whether it’s crafts, eating out or hiking this app is a fantastic find. You pick your hobby or area of interest and the app will point you to like-minded people. If for some reason you can’t find your area of interest, you can start your own group. I had a lot of fun meeting up with about 15 people in my age group for breakfast at a local restaurant."
256,JWagener,"January 14, 2020",5,Great way to meet people I have used the Meetup app for about 6 years now. It is a great way to meet people and find out about things to do around my area and places to go. Only problem I have with it is that when I open a link in Meetup's emails they always take me to the Meetup website rather than to the Meetup app which would be more useful. Other than that it is all good.
257,Mdaley77,"October 12, 2019",5,"Homeschool parent’s best friend The Meetup app has been extremely helpful in our homeschool group. We are brand new to homeschooling and didn’t know any other families in the area. I heard about the app from a Facebook group and really like the added privacy of planning our activities in Meetup. For a community of busy home educators, this app is a great way to stay updated and informed about all of the events."
258,"Jordan, Cary, NC","October 10, 2019",4,"Good to start groups of people with similar interests or goals. I live in an area far away from family and most of my friends, and this has been a great app to help connect me with real people and to start to develop real networks and friendships with others with common interests.  This truly is social media, unlike the anti-social media we call social media.  A great way to get out and meet new people without needing to have any previous connection."
259,Meka0521,"October 2, 2019",5,Great Network of Professional’s This app makes networking simplistic! Not only are you capable of meeting professionals to build your business and increase your customer base but you’re doing so by personal networking! This app also gives you the opportunity to meet people that share the same interest as you so that you’re not so alone in this world doing things by yourself!
260,Brittbee4,"September 9, 2018",5,"Fantastic App I love the community that Meetup creates, from all areas of the spectrum. You can find anything that interests you or that appeals to your curiosity, all surrounded by others who enjoy the same enthusiasm and connection that these groups bring. The app is very user friendly and allows plenty of options when searching for your particular “tribe.” I’ll continue using it for sure."
261,Vox populi152,"September 16, 2018",5,"My favorite app I love meet up. You get to get out and meet people in your own area that have the same interests as you do. Or if you want to learn something new or get involved in something else, you can find people interested in those things as well. And it’s free! I always tell people about meet up when they’re looking for new friends or looking for something to do."
262,DaveRamseyStep7,"March 5, 2019",5,"Great app, great meetups! The app is solid. It lets us all communicate in real-time before the meetups which saved my bacon one time when I was running late. Lots of nice features for finding and participating in meetups: picture sharing, blogging, likes, etc. Let’s people participate without sharing personal info if that’s what they want. Nothing bad to say here and I’ve been using it a long time (2+ years)."

I am glad to say I did find a group that meet up at local cafe every Wednesday at 7PM and I when whenever I could I loved it. I am happy to have found an app to connect me when new people with the same goals quite easily.
265,Rokkergirl,"February 8, 2020",4,"Needs an update When some posts a new event, I do not get notified, even though my settings are correct. I miss a lot of new events, because I don't get notified. I get notified when someone messages me or comments on something I'm a part of .....but that's it. Also..the app seems sluggish when uploading pics. It would be nice if we could upload multiple pics instead of one at a time. Takes forever. "

This is one event I have every month that I always thoroughly enjoy and look forward to.  So very thankful to meet up for creating this platform which lends itself to meaningful connection with wonderful people.
267,andrewvenegas,"September 13, 2019",2,Simple functions missing. This is a great concept. There are many great things about MeetUp. This app is in my opinion a little lacking. One can easily get a stupid ridiculous number of notices per day if one doesn’t manage their notifications properly. One’s message box fils with these notifications of events. They also fail your email address’s junk folder.
268,LOLGEVOS,"December 29, 2019",1,"User interface is Terrible Almost everything is a button. Just wanted to scroll down? Nope, you put your finger there, and it happened to be a button/link although it’s not obviously such, and you are now sent to a section that you may have been before already. This is like the app equivalent of a mid 90s web blog where every word is a link, except in this app, every title and even the white space is a hidden button leading somewhere 😡"

This is a great app after you’ve experienced a quarter or mid-life crisis where you realize the places you’ve been spending your time no longer feeds your personal nor soul needs.

Great way to try to new things and meet new people have have similar interests!"
271,edwhug,"September 9, 2018",5,"Never a stranger wherever you go I just love what Meetup has done. It’s very much unlike meeting people and trade up sites. It’s meeting people face-to-face in real time over subjects of deep interest to you and them. Sometimes social, sometimes or engaging topics of deep interest. For me it has been French, Italian, Mythology. Wherever you happen to be in this world it’s a way of reaching out to others who share your interests in life."
272,Rknnrobyn2,"September 16, 2018",5,"So easy I am a member of several groups in Meetup. Have been for over a decade now. This app is so easy to use and I can check in effortlessly weeks in advance to schedule a Meetup, to check in minutes to verify the location where I am supposed to meeting my new friends or even check in after the Meetup to tell all my new friends it was great to meet them! The app does it all!"
273,Koagurl,"December 15, 2018",5,"The app everyone needs on their phone I love this app so much! I have met so many people & found so many wonderful things to do that I never would have known about otherwise. From yoga classes, meditation/chakra groups, to pagan/shaman & witchy fun- there is literally so much going on around you. Meetup allows you to get out & explore everything! Everyone should have this app on their phone. 💕"
274,DanAppIphone6,"March 16, 2019",5,"The best social networking app period. This is the first time that I’m ratting an app, and it’s because it worth it to do it. For me this app represent more than an app, is more than an social network, more than a networking site, more than a date app, it’s is how all the social media apps should be, with more than one purpose. This app represent a life style , a way to have friends with common interests, to be more social IN THE REAL WORLD."

277,Slojog,"November 20, 2019",3,Great Opportunities but comments heavily censored Only one use for me and I appreciate the multitude of events available but I notice that that any feedback that is less than stellar is censored.  That is something to keep in mind whenever you choose an event - that comments can evidently be erased by the organizer.  Having run some very small community web pages I understand the need for censorship but only accepting saccharine posts can portray an experience not shared by many and the potential for being deceptive.

I keep using it bc it’s quite utilitarian, but never, and I do mean NEVER have I encountered a decent app so hampered by extraordinarily terrible creative choices. Make it white and black. Do everything in helvetica, but for god sake, stop with the bizarre pics of old people in body paint and wigs doing strange things. Stop with the infantile font and paint splatters. Restore default settings. Save yourself! Sack your creative director. Immediately. Godspeed."

Also would be great to be able to upload multiple profile pics like on Yelp to show more interests and personality"
282,Messenger User Ticked,"December 26, 2018",1,Horrible The app doesn’t work half the time.  The service via the App or computer is awful. As an organizer meeting notices and messages would sit in limbo and not be delivered.  You can’t even quit Meetup via the app and good luck trying to do it via computer.  If I could give this negative stars I would. Use Facebook. It’s free and reliable. Meetup is not! If you try to cancel your subscription as an organizer they charge your card even if you put your group as do not renew. Then you have to fight to get your money and they troll your members trying to sucker one of them to step up and pay their fees to take over.
283,BethanyRK,"April 3, 2019",1,"Why do I have to pay to be an organizer? The developers need to speak with an economist about the incentives that they’ve set up. I would love to be an organizer, but I’m not about to pay to do extra work. I’d love to organize meeting and start a new group, but I’m not going to pay to do that. Since I’m not going to pay to create a group in Laramie, Wyoming and nobody else is, there aren’t any groups here. You’re preventing people from using your app because of the way incentives are set up. I’d much rather pay $2 for the app and be able to be an organizer or not than pay ridiculous sums of money just to start a group."

So I end up having to delete the app to add a member as moderator and then redownload the app. To be honest, I don’t know why I even bother redownloading the app, there is nothing I can do on it that I can’t do in the browser, and the app only interferes with stuff I need to do in the browser. I guess I’m realizing right now that I need to stop downloading this app, it’s less than useless, it’s a hinderance."
287,Puchaz,"June 13, 2019",5,What is happening around me? The meet up app is an excellent way to get introduced to things that may be of interest to me. I simply fill in my areas of interest and almost magically events With those parameters that are happening in my area appear on my computer. Then I get to choose what I want to attend. A very basic and simple way to become more aware of what is available.

316,DaveKnoxville,"July 26, 2019",5,Meetup App This app allows me to stay connected to the 36 groups I participate in weekly events.
317,love pats,"June 26, 2019",5,"Great App - Sometimes Tricky to Navigate This app is awesome! Helping me to meet new people as I move to a new city. Definitely comforting to know there are others out there meeting up with similar interests. Sometimes when I go too deep into the links at the bottom of meetups, the “tags” I have a hard time making my way back to home. Otherwise, great UX/UI it’s a beautifully done app!"
318,kpdesign,"August 13, 2019",5,"Great for Meeting a New Friend Great app, I discovered after moving to a new city where I didn’t know anyone and needed to find some friends and see what was what in the area. Each group is very different and great for various interests. It allows you to participate as much or as little as you like, which is great flexibility for me! I’ve met some great new friends through this app!"
319,Nicksterness,"July 23, 2019",4,Great for networking I love this app for the simple fact I can look up any area for meetups as I travel a lot through out New Jersey. I like that I can find like minded people in social groups as well as professional use. I use this to leverage meet ups with potential clients I’m looking to work with and is a great way to meet them in a social setting and discuss business while networking with other people in the real estate industry.
320,tinkertaz,"August 14, 2018",5,"MeetUp is my workout “partner”! I’m not the one who enjoys going to the gym, nor did I ever have to. But the only way I’m consistent is to essentially have a partner that can drag me to the gym."
321,DallasTennisnut,"August 21, 2018",5,Making new friends Love this APP✨moving to a new city like myself Meet-up makes it possible to stay connected with the activities & hobbies you enjoy. It’s great for traveling either personal or work related; there is always something going on I enjoy playing tennis wherever I travel to. Meet up hands down keeps you in the loop it’s also great for networking.
322,basketcax,"August 27, 2018",4,"Great way to meet like-minded people This app is for everyone. There’s so many groups and ways to reach out. This allows neighborhoods to publish local events, social groups to meet about an interest, networking opportunities for business owners, and a fun way to meet new friends. It’s really easy to make a group of you don’t find one that suits you. I just wish this app has the ability to have access to Google Calendar."
323,Yackadus,"August 29, 2018",5,Easy app and healthy way to get involved. This app is very easy to navigate. It’s a great way to meet like minded people in a healthy and safe environment.
324,Patti28L,"January 28, 2019",5,"Meetup provides new opportunities This app gives me an opportunity to find new things to do in the area, and meet new people that have my interests. It makes some suggestions, but allows me to do a lot of the search myself. I like that. Haven’t seen a lot of problems, but every app has some, so I hope everyone else is enjoying it the way I am!"
325,SVJ65,"January 17, 2020",5,"There’s a group for everyone I saw one comment I agree with. There have been several times I showed up at a function and could never find the group, or only 1 or 2 people showed compared to the 20-30 that signed up. But for the most part the people I’ve met have very easy to talk to and I’ve had a good experience."
326,DJN1E,"January 5, 2020",5,"Love the app I didn’t do much activities posted to MeetUp app, but I have had it for a couple of years and I enjoyed browsing all of the events going on and well informed if I’m in the mood of going.  Best of all, it’s free to use the app.  Certain activities do cost a few bucks for membership, but they are for the benefit of the members.  I would recommend to anyone."
327,ZenNP,"December 26, 2019",5,Great way to connect I’ve lived in my area for 4 years and have found it hard to find new friends since I’m not a church goer and I work a lot. This app has offered no risk and presented specific groups with which I share similar interests. I’ve signed up for several and have 2 activities I will be attending within a week of each other.
328,un-defined,"November 13, 2019",5,"Keeps me social I don’t have a built-in tendency to remember to socialize, at least not in real life.  The meetup app helps me to discover new opportunities to do real-life socializing (as opposed to only online) and helps me keep in touch with new friends I’ve met at the meetups.  Slowly I see I am building up a tendency to get out and meet people more which is so important for me.  Thank you meetup!"
329,Lexy🍄,"June 18, 2019",5,Meetup review I’ve only been in Washington for a couple of months and this app is helping everything get put into place!! I joined yesterday and went to a Zumba class today and tomorrow there’s an essential oil discussion/workshop. It keeps my life full and interesting and I can’t wait to see what else I find. I hope to get some advice on environmental jobs in the area.
330,Christidel,"August 11, 2018",5,"Great Idea! MeetUp is fantastic!  I recently moved and this provides me a way to meet people with the same interests as myself and allows the opportunity to explore new interests. I find it to be safe since we need a photo, there’s a record of attendees, you’re with a group and locations are clearly visible.  I’ve experienced some great events, trails and new people with this app, so I’m very appreciative to MeetUp."
331,das_navy,"August 26, 2018",5,Meetup - simple but effective way to enjoy common interest I joined a literature group and Meetup has made it so easy to get together and discuss great works.  The invitation/RSVP system works flawlessly with my on-line calendar and notifications keep me alert to conversations and shared ideas before and after we meet.  I really enjoy the support this app provides our group - thanks!
332,Crue Knight,"April 9, 2019",5,"Great for professional or fun meetups It’s like finding a church but for anything, even for atheists (I am one). You can find professionals like investment groups or fun hangouts with people in your area to surf, ski, play games or even eat dinner together. I find that motivation for everything is just better when you are together with many people who have similar goals."
333,msworldtraveler,"April 11, 2019",5,Great app to meet new people This is a great app to meet people with common hobbies and interests. I went yesterday to an Italian meetup at Roma Cafe in Rutherford NJ and had a wonderful time practicing my Italian language and meeting new and interesting people. I plan on doing more meet ups here. I highly recommend this app for people who want to socialize more and meet new people or simple enjoy a hobby or interest of their choice.
334,Linda loves books,"April 14, 2019",4,"Excellent way to find activities I’ve been using Meetup for a few years and am very pleased with its ease of use. I’m an avid reader and knitter. With Meetup, I’m able to find people to knit with or a book club to participate in no matter where I am. "
335,cram.com user,"January 29, 2020",4,Very useful So far meetup has been very useful ad an advertising source. I like how our groups show up on Google search engine and has the events listed in an easy to follow arrangement. 
336,Zombeaero,"October 14, 2019",1,"Change to Paid Sign Ups I have been using this app for awhile and have always meant to come on to give 5 stars, but I just saw the announcement on the website for having to pay to join each meetup event. You have just killed the app, the entire drive is that it is free to sign up for things. We’ll probably have to start posting on Meetup with a link to a Facebook event to prevent our group from dying. Please cancel the change, it is a bad idea that is probably some MBA on a spreadsheet and not someone actually thinking about how this app fundamentally draws and holds users."
337,FB MarketPlace is Better,"August 15, 2019",5,"Better than any social media! Joined for a kayaking group I saw posted in TwoGoods and am loving it!  It’s kind of like social media but it’s all about meeting online, signing up for a group then actually going to the events. The whole idea is not to sit looking at your screen but getting out and physically doing something with people who have similar interests. It’s great!"
338,echo dog,"June 26, 2019",5,"Great way to find friends As a frequent mover 16 moves across 9 cities and 5 countries in 20 years, I always find it takes such a long time to get to know new people. The meetup app has helped me to connect with others - both like-minded and in a way that stretches me beyond my comfort zone. What a wonderful technological service to address our somewhat impersonal world."
339,Cest le Shah,"June 26, 2019",5,"Easy to navigate - and a community which sustains it! I appreciate the scheduling and ease of exploring activities, but most importantly there is an active community!"
340,mikecornwell,"July 23, 2018",3,"Pretty good app, but... This is a pretty good app, they try to sell you on more meetups by pushing other Meetup groups onto your feed. You can select a drop down to eliminate them, but you have to do that every time you use the app. I don’t want to litter my upcoming meetups with groups that I don’t care about. At least give me a setting that lets me say whether or not I want to see other groups and remember my setting so I don’t have to set it every time. Less selling and more serving. Thanks."
341,AshleySD,"September 9, 2018",5,"Great for finding whatever you’re into to Living in a new place or just trying to get out of your comfort zone? Both for me, I’ve been finding great fun things to do near by and meeting some cool people along the way. I like that you can also search by your area if you don’t want to just look up an activity or specific date!"
342,fashionh,"October 8, 2018",5,"User I have been utilizing Meet Up for a while now. I have been member of a Chamber and a member of the local Rotary club, this helps stay connected. I recently moved locations and found this a great way to find like minded people. I love the networking and community service aspect of this tool."
343,Pine Bark,"March 5, 2019",5,"Great Way to Connect I’ve used Meetup for years.  It’s great to be able to get all the info you need in one place: cancellations, time changes, etc.  it takes the guessing out of how much food to bring, how to get there and who is coming.  The best part is that everyone can post their photos and you have an instant history of every event."
344,IloceGod1!,"March 16, 2019",5,"Meet Up I have had this on my phone for sometime now and have used it occasionally! I think it is a great way to be connected to other people that have the same interests which is to go out meet people and have a great time. I appreciate knowing about the different events that are going on all around me, and it’s free. Thank you Meet Up!"
345,Mar in Chicago,"March 6, 2020",4,"Useful tool for hobbies, networking and learning Easy enough app to use and a useful tool to meet and learn from other groups with same interests."
346,susie2cue,"February 24, 2020",5,"Great idea, rather than dating. I just started this upon the death of my partner, but so far I have been impressed with the offerings. It is so much more valuable to me to meet with people who have like interests. Instead of online dating, which is fraught with all sorts of problems for serious-minded individuals, one can participate in pressure-free gatherings that focus on an activity or a topic."
347,dougletts11,"December 10, 2019",5,"Good way to safely meet people This has been an excellent way to meet local people, share fun hobbies & keep my social life from totally withering. I’ve run meetup groups and participated in others groups around the country & the only real challenge I’ve found is getting up the motivation to go once I’ve signed up. "
348,boltefr,"August 14, 2019",4,"Meet up app This has been a very good way to meet new people. I still feel like I could find more groups that are in my interest areas but some groups have so much going on that I almost feel guilty if I don’t participate. Some groups even have “rules” about how many events you attend which I don’t appreciate. However,  I have managed to find some good friends among the many participants!"
349,Ethel Mertz,"July 30, 2019",5,"Great service, great app Meetup is fantastic, as you know. This app does everything you want it to do. I especially appreciate the messaging ability because it’s nice to be able to message with people you only just met up with without worrying about giving away your phone number or becoming friends on social media."
350,veg16,"September 13, 2018",5,Great App! Thanks to MeeUp I find friends of the same interest almost everywhere I move! I tend to live in new places every so often and I dislike going friend hunting!  MeetUp makes it easy for me to find a group where I’ll fit right in. I recommend it to everyone! I met the love of my life in one of the MeetUp groups. You just never know what could happen! Good luck!
351,Philosophie73,"October 15, 2018",4,"Meetup Greetup I have used the app to meet new people when I moved to Atlanta 6 years ago and when my son moved to a new city, I encouraged him to do the same. It has been great! Meetup has also been used to help me to learn about new places and different events — some of which I’ve visited or attended without a Meetup group. The app is intuitive and the information relevant to its user is readily accessible due to the clean format. I’m a fan!"
352,old city explorer,"January 19, 2019",5,"Good app I just started using this app. It gives lots of suggestions of things that might interest you and is pretty easy to use. At first, it was a little difficult to find what I was looking for until I figured out how to use it. But overall, is pretty user friendly. It’s been great finding fun things to do and meet others!"
353,Kimthorn,"January 26, 2019",4,"Great fun to be had by all I love this app because it's great when you're on the go! If you've committed to an event and not sure of the directions there's a feature that gets you there. I can upload moment by moment pictures and communicate safely with other members of my group without giving out my personal information. It allows me to say ""it was nice meeting you"" after an event. I love, love, love this app!"
354,ashleetherealtor,"April 9, 2019",5,Great App! I came across meet up not to long ago and I must say it’s the best app I have downloaded. I’m able to join groups and network with people from all over. I know when all events are happening and reminders are sent to me. This app is easy to use and has allowed me to expand my real estate business with potential partners. Great tool !
355,Gregoryx5,"May 27, 2019",5,Huge variety I’ve never seen such a variety of clubs and groups in one app before. I’ve joined at least 15 and am still joining! Highly recommend. Watch the events though; some groups haven’t been active in months and some are so popular that you need to reserve spots weeks in advance! Something for everyone for sure!
356,Nakita aka Nikkie,"June 4, 2019",5,Meetup I have made it to a few events with the 317 meetup group. Great group to connect with. Beautiful diversity. Very energetic and outgoing. I like that there is always something for everyone happening on every day of the week. The hosts Graham and Dana are great people to meet. They and other hosts do a great job at adding a variety of things so that you can get out and meet new people.
357,sallison1985,"April 9, 2020",5,"Very good notifications Pretty good app. The notifications are helpful especially for last minute updates to group events when you don’t have everyone’s cell number to text. I like browsing groups and events more easily on the desktop but the app is okay, maybe better for use on a tablet."
358,DannieLove85,"January 19, 2020",5,"Great app I’ve been a member of meetup for awhile, but just recently downloaded the app. The app makes it much easier to keep track of groups and events. The app is pretty user friendly too. I just wish they would add away to call organizers during a meet up. It can be difficult to find the group in certain venues."
359,Re-as,"January 9, 2020",4,"Great app! The app is fairly easy to use and you can keep track of all the meetups you are part of and Meetup gives you notifications on events you are attending and it lets you see the events you are attending. The only thing is if it could let you look at the calendar of events you have each month, that way you can go back and see what meetups you can’t attend."
360,spanishasl,"March 20, 2019",4,"Quite enjoyable It was very enjoyable. I really liked it and can’t wait till the next meetup. However, I wish it was at a quieter place. It was sometimes hard hearing everybody else at my table. And I wish there was a table for ASL because I need practice with my ASL."
361,AA never again,"April 2, 2019",5,"Great way to have fun This club is a great way to get out and do things that you don’t or shouldn’t do on your own.  I.e. I’m from WI but joined a Tucson hiking group.  I had a great time hiking trails with experienced people happy to have take beginners out and introduce them to hiking in AZ.  The group was a good mix of experienced, beginners, locals and visitors.  I saw sights I would never had seen without Meetup."
362,Kmbinga,"December 6, 2019",4,"Newby In the past I have tried Meet Up in a different city for business purposes.  I wasn’t impressed with the results.  This time I’m using Meet up for more social gatherings. I’m very impressed with the groups I’ve joined.  The people that have responded are fun and informative. the Meet up app makes it easy to keep track of events, dates, and messaging.   It has helped my transition to Savannah be less of a challenge."
363,cassket10,"September 25, 2019",5,Better than I even expected! I just started using the app to meet people since I am new to my city. It’s so wonderful! The suggestions for groups are great and even better is that it adds events to your calendar so when you open up waze for directions it already knows where you’re going!
364,Milci04,"September 23, 2019",4,"Great app Love this app so far. I’ve been to 2 meetups, one mixed and one all female. I recommend the all female meet up groups! No awkwardness and you get to meet so many interesting and fabulous ladies!! So excited to continue making new friends and going on new adventures. Took off one star because the app is a little complex to use and understand. Especially when trying to search for a specific group."
365,dianabetan,"September 10, 2019",5,"Easy to use and reliable I have been using the Meetup app for several years and it’s a great way to network, organize and maintain meetings without having to have the knowledge of a Web admin to manage the page. It’s great and super easy to use! I even gave it I stalked in my cell phone and use it often to look up meeting details."
366,Miamama7,"August 5, 2019",4,"Organizer As a homeschool group organizer this app makes things simple. I can collect payments ahead of an event, take attendance, make each person as paid, send private messages or group messages on the discussion board, the events link to the calendar, it gives announcements and reminders. Sometimes it’s hard to load pictures but most of times it works just fine."
367,Paul Rafanan,"July 18, 2019",4,Meh This app is great in theory. Biggest issues is that there aren’t that many groups to begin with. Want a chess club? None. Want to be on any blind date? None. Want an open mic? They have one group for open mic but they meet up 200 miles away. 
368,Mdfalcon,"June 27, 2019",5,"Great way to find friends We were wondering how to make friends in a new place.  So we created an event. Within 12 hours we had a full guest list for our event and dozens of people in our “group”. We just hosted our game night event, had a great time and are going to make it a weekly thing and now have 60 plus members in one week"
369,McKenna C.,"June 16, 2019",5,"Great App Joined to meet people and make friends. I have met people and made friends. It’s a great solution if you don’t happen to connect with anyone at work, are new in town, or just need to some new people in your life."
370,EJ6256,"September 2, 2018",1,"Ever present problems The basic premise and functionality of Meetup is solid, but the usability and features of both the app and the site have slowly declined, with more and more bugs, glitches, and problems with their app and system. I am constantly emailing support to tell them about issues but nothing ever seems to get fixed. Meetup feels like a half finished project that no one is working on. It’s a real shame too, because I have been paying ever increasing amounts for services that seem to be declining. Who knows when they’ll get their act together, very disappointing."
371,asid77,"September 7, 2018",3,"lack of help for app/wen functionality issues despite certain usability issues including  constant non-intuitive interface changes, this used to still be pretty good, esp for a free app, and the developers were responsive to user issues and even ideas for improvement (i’ve had one of mine implemented!), which i thought was amazing and much appreciated. however there are some persistent bugs, and nowadays contacting developers for help is utterly useless as “tickets” submitted through the app just disappear without a trace, without resolution, and without any response. i’m not even sure they really go through. it’s been like this for quite a while. the “contact” aspect needs to be fixed or removed altogether so that people aren’t wasting their time writing to no one."
372,Newatyoga,"October 4, 2018",5,"Grace Yoga Studio I found Grace studio on Meetup and started going to classes this summer. They have yoga and Pilates classes. The instruction has been outstanding and the studio has a wonderful, warm, embracing feeling tone. Everyone who works there, including the owners, Katie and Jody, are lovely and caring people. This is a place where everyone can feel comfortable and at home. I am so glad I have discovered this studio!"

375,work2travel,"February 16, 2020",4,"Nice but get rid of continual pop up I like the app but after going to an event I get asked every time if I want to review the event with a pop up. It is very annoying to have to close it every single time. If I want to give a review the first time I will, but hate being constantly asked!  Make an option so I can choose not to be asked again. Or better yet, take the feature out!"
376,HKshane,"December 20, 2019",5,"Perfect for organizing events Have been using Meetup since maybe 2011. Wish it was as popular here in USA as my experience with Hong Kong Hiking Meetup and Hong Kong Trail Runners while I lived there. You can put the one entire ‘who, what, when, how, why, where and more’ on the way events you organize. So people just have to read the info and click as going. So simple."

380,Little Pooobah,"April 6, 2018",3,"Frustrating User Interface This app is more useful for me in my role as a member of someone else’s Meetup group than in my role as an organizer. Unfortunately, however, it’s not letting me find a new Meetup group I need. When I do a search on “grief,” it shows me only events offered by groups of which I am already a member. To find a group ABOUT grief, I have to browse through hundreds and hundreds of groups on myriad unrelated subjects. Therefore, I have not found the kind of group I need."
381,Morgaine816,"August 9, 2018",5,Helps me get out of the house I’m disabled and most of my friends from work and other areas of my life seemed to drop off when I had to quit my job 12 years ago and go on disability. The Meetup app helps me find other local people who are interested in the same things I am and makes me want to go out and try new things.
382,momellen3,"August 21, 2018",5,"Great app for meeting likeminded people! I am new to the Portland Oregon area and didn’t know anyone here. I signed up for a couple of groups and found an instant community of people who like to do the things I like. Now that Fall is coming, I will be looking to add a couple of groups that are more suited to indoor activities such as a book club and perhaps crafts. So happy I found this app!"

The sky is the limit the people I’ve met are high caliber."
384,Jomaba432165,"November 26, 2018",4,"Great app for traveling This app is great for me since I’m in a new state and city every 3-6 months. It really helps me get out and be social and meet new people and make new friends all while doing something fun and I enjoy! If you are a traveling medical professional or just on a lengthy vacation, this app helps you to discover what’s going on around the area one is residing in. I tell all my friends and such about this app!"
385,stormshadow13,"January 19, 2019",1,"One of the worst apps! I wish someone else would step up and make an improved app- meetup is consistently garbage. My profile never works, I’m not able to see any events for groups that I belong to, every time I try to search for new groups it says ‘nothing available’ and now I can’t even sign in?!?!? Trying to sign in the login button isn’t working at all. Why won’t someone fix this app? Lots of people are just using Facebook to set up groups because this is so terrible and expects people to pay to set up groups on top of it all!! Insult to injury. Forget it."
386,DaniR998,"March 31, 2019",4,"Great App with great people I'm really enjoying the Meetups I've attended and looking forward to ones in the future. The only issues I've found with the app are the sketchy iPad compatibility and the inability to sort Meetup locations more thoroughly. I live next to a city which distance-wise is very close, but functionally is often an hour or more away. It'd be nice to be able to sort by state or travel time."
387,Ramone4now,"April 7, 2019",4,"Cool app!!! Gets ‘Er done. I have found the Meetup app to be useful and very user friendly. It sends notifications of upcoming events and keeps you in the loop on any comments or changes to the events. I love the fact that it automatically add the events to my calendar when I indicate that I am attending. It also allows you to forward the Meetup to a friend which is pretty cool. Overall, I think it’s a great app. Give it a try!"
388,EmkayM77,"March 1, 2020",5,Great app! I have been using this app for a couple weeks now after recently moving to a different state and it’s been really great at finding and meeting new people. My husband and I are in our 40’s and it’s hard to meet new friends. This app has made that a much easier task. Very easy to use and very helpful. Thank you!
389,RNstrangebrew,"January 27, 2020",5,"So easy to use I love Meetup! The app works great. It’s easy to scroll and find groups, to sign up and to remove myself from a list when I change my mind. Easy to communicate with organizers and ask questions. It’s a great way to find things you might like or try new things. Or just find people with similar interests."
390,Tabuteau,"July 15, 2018",2,"App ignores push notification settings I’ve turned off the push notification settings for one of my groups that always has chatter in the discussions.  The app doesn’t respect my settings - global settings are off and individual discussion post settings are off yet I still get tons of notifications.

I have yet to attend a meet up event, but I appreciate the organizers of the various groups who take the time to lay out guidelines for specific expectations at the events and declare what the group’s purpose is right up front. You still have to be a courageous person to take that step and actually go to an event! Unfortunately for me, many of the events are in the bigger cities. That’s just how it goes!"
393,Klatu1969,"September 14, 2018",4,Great for the most part I think Meetup is great for the most part. You get to meet people who have similar interests and I’ve made friends through it. 
394,Sweetnothin',"September 15, 2018",5,"Meetup has introduced me to fantastic friends Meetup is an ideal place to make new friends with common interests. It’s a great venue (especially for those new to the area in our Portland,OR and surrounding cities). Hiking is a big one, concerts in the park, dancing, live music in the hundreds of clubs here), fantastic dining, and any number of activities. Meetup has forever changed my life in a positive way. Thank you"
395,Pinkgold87,"March 11, 2019",5,Meetup is a great way to network with people I have been using the meetup app for quite sometime now and it is amazing. Meetup is a great way to meet new people and network. I love that it gives you reminders on the calendar and notification on what time the events start. If you are looking for an app to meet new people and network then try Meetup.
396,DTSunshine,"October 10, 2019",5,"Public Speaking: Outside the Comfort Zone It is the perfect place to get comfortable and improve your public speaking skills. The feedback from other great speakers is invaluable. It forces me to step out of my comfort zone. You know you are growing and improving your talents when you take that step outside your comfort zone. Lookout world, here comes the new and improved model of me."
397,Ladywithphone,"August 25, 2019",4,A bit buggy but good overall There’s some annoying quirks between the app and the emails you receive but overall I have enjoyed it. I’ve been using meetup for a couple years and attended some amazing events I wouldn’t have found out about any other way. Even if you don’t join a group you can still browse to find out what’s going on in your city.
398,Princess Grace,"August 8, 2019",5,"Awesome way to meet peeps! Yall, whoever came up w meetup is genius. I have been a member for several years and I dont see myself deleting this app soon. I got friends but sometimes I like to go out and meet new people. This is where it comes in. I pply attend about 2-4 events per year. Some are good some are just nah. Still, I enjoy it because it creates a sense of community."
399,normallypossitive,"July 28, 2019",5,"Technology bringing strangers together What a fantastic way to meet like minded people! Pick a group that you’re interested in joining, keep notifications on so you can be notified of events to go to, and show up! Some gatherings are free, and other events vary on the venue. This app can be great if you are new to an area, in town for the weekend or enjoy meeting new people."
400,Prava16,"August 11, 2018",5,"Great App. Easy To Navigate This is a really good app. It’s extremely helpful to people who have relocated to places where they don’t know people and are looking for things to do. Nothing bad to say about the app; only about the cities. If you move someplace where people don’t do much, you can start a new group or, sadly,  hope for the best like I do."
401,SineWaveFL,"October 7, 2018",5,"Easy, useful, reliable The meetup app is easy to use and always reliable. The format is excellent. I never need my laptop for the full site. I can accomplish anything through this app: RSVP, messaging, etc. It keeps me organized! I’m in so many different meetups (yay!) so it’s necessary for me to have this app. Meetup is a great way to meet new people who share your interests!"
402,very useful and convenient,"December 19, 2018",5,"Relevant now more than ever Meetup reminds me of old technology when you used to have chat rooms and you got a sense of a micro community within which you can make friends at the most gentlest pace. In a city as big as LA, it’s nice to have a platform where you can make connections with a group of people who share similar interests. It’s wonderful."
403,mxx1993,"April 11, 2019",3,"Great content, poor searchability and multiple crashes I've been using meetup via web for a while and just decided to download the app."
404,Lucyisthecutest1,"May 21, 2019",5,Meet Up Is Great! I just joined a few groups in Meet Up. I wanted to meet others to go hiking with and I also want to join a group of Doodle owners to meet and take our doggies on outings. I am so impressed with the many different interest groups available. What a great way in which to make friends who have common interests and enjoy similar experiences.
405,Yazz Is Jazz,"November 3, 2019",5,"A great place to speak Italian and about Italy We all have our stories about the magical place. In this meet up all love sharing and listening to each other’s stories, as well as work on our Italian for past and future visits. I’ve enjoyed getting to know people in the group, and love the stories of each person’s visits."
406,questioneverything59,"October 2, 2019",5,"Try it out Great app, most groups are free, some have membership fees which is fine if worth it. Variety of groups and subjects available. Seems a bit weird to show up to something and you have no connection to anyone but it’s a great way to get out and see the city as well as meet new interesting people."
407,Al3xaSmith,"August 25, 2019",5,"Great Way To Make New Friends Whenever I move to a new city the first thing I do is update my new city so I can see what new things I can get into. I’m still very thankful for the co-worker who suggested it years ago. I’ve gone from by-stander to participant and host. It’s a great way to delve into all that’s around you, and most groups are free or very affordable to join."
408,calicat0925,"June 29, 2019",4,"Great concept The meetup app is great, but there are a couple of features that I wish were available as a group organizer. Group chat features (voluntary for interested group members only) and the ability to poll members. We would love to gauge where our members live, what event days/times work best, and get feedback on events they’d like to see but I think additional organizer features would help."
409,Speechgal1,"June 19, 2019",3,"User Friendly? The coordinator of the Meetup group that I have been attending has had ongoing issues with the functionality of the post.  It always lists our location as TBD, even when the location has been entered multiple times, and participants in the group are not allowed to send an RSVP until they are within 24 hours of the start time.  Perhaps the instructions for use should be made a bit clearer."
410,Raji Nair,"August 11, 2018",4,"Great! Scope for improvement. I think it’s a great app but with recent updates, the past user friendliness has reduced. It has become more confusing and difficult to navigate through the different pages of the app. I takes time to figure out to go back to a particular page you were on. If this can be fixed I think it would be the best app meet up events."
411,People Roman,"April 4, 2019",5,Important part of my life I’ve attended roughly 20 meetups before I started hosting my own. Sacramento Web and Mobile Developers has become a place where I hang out with my friends and enjoy life as a software developer. Meetup helps make that possible. But that’s not where it ends. This app enables and facilitates so much meaningful human interaction. Give it a try!
412,Embee37568,"March 1, 2020",5,"Great app A great way to get to know new people you probably would never have met otherwise, to always have people to do fun stuff with and to try new things from volunteering, to sports to all sorts of hobbies, restaurants and live shows, outdoor adventures, meditation classes, shooting range, golf, etc, etc. niche groups for political causes, ages groups, etc."
413,Skrappi69,"February 27, 2020",4,"Lots of fun people I’ve met lots of fun and interesting people do new and different experiences. If I were to have any one suggestion it would be to have broader groups for things outside the normal for this area. Mostly hiking , board game potluck, some dance classes. All of which are great but I’ve found little for other outdoor activities such as target shooting (archery or firearms), motorcycle rides, things like that."
414,Younggyrl,"February 13, 2020",4,"Finally getting good use from app I recently moved and in my new location, the app has been instrumental in meeting new people that share similar interests. However, there are a few meetups that feel catfish-like, people looking for something, what exactly I don’t know and I didn’t stick around long enough to find out. Other than that, I find the app very useful."
415,Edcapone72,"November 16, 2019",5,"Expense is prohibitive but the format is great! Group organizers are required to pay to use the site, which has led to the disbanding of several groups I’ve been a part of. I’m sure this could be handled differently through many alternatives. But I love the format of the app and enjoy the opportunity to meet new people who have common interests."
416,Amber CS,"October 10, 2019",5,Such a great way to connect with community Love this app! It makes it so easy to see all the upcoming events in a phone-friendly way do I don’t even have to get on my computer to look it up. Can be handy if I’m on the way to an event and just need to look up some quick info on it such as the address.
417,GoluBaba,"September 3, 2019",5,"Great tool to get connected I have been using this to get connected to technical groups/forums and it’s works great. Most of the workshops and training session offered in the technical groups are well represented, you can see current, future and past events. Signing for them is super easy, with just one click."
418,sarahdox,"August 3, 2019",5,"Easy to use; lots of ways to use MEETUP is easy to use. It has a good search capability, offers useful sharing of meetup details and participant comments, and gives timely updates. If details or location of the event change, notifications of same are quickly sent and received."
419,19dmk67,"July 27, 2019",5,Perfect for someone trying to get out more I found this app through a hiking group. I’ve met some fascinating people at each activity. This is a nice way to get more social without having a bunch of strangers in your personal business. I met a lady who travels for work and uses the app to get out of her hotel. I think that’s an awesome idea!
420,Welcome2U,"August 24, 2018",5,"Great selection of activities, great people! I adore the people that I have met through Meet-Up! I wish I had known about it sooner. There are clubs and groups for every interest. If there is not one for yours, you can start your own. It is very user-friendly. Privacy is protected, and you will find many new things to do in your area!"
421,Carol.Rocky,"August 25, 2018",5,"New app less user friendly. Prior to upgrade app was fairly easy to navigate. Now, not so much. In addition, not all future meet up dates appear on the app on the phone. Wanted to sign up for a December 3 meet up from my phone but the Meetup did not appear. I had to wait until I got home to my laptop to sign up for the event. Not helpful."
422,Rach_Worst,"August 26, 2018",5,Great way to meet people I’ve had this app for awhile now and it is great! It is easy to meet people who have similar interests and hobbies. The last few adventures I have been on were because of this app and I’ve made some really amazing friends though it. I definitely recommend this app to anyone trying to meet new people.
423,Jessarhan,"January 7, 2019",5,Excellent App I joined Meetup a few months ago to meet new friends and get more active. I love this App because It’s so easy to use and I’m able to find what I’m interested in quickly. It also lets me know when there are are new meetups in my area and that’s how I found one I really enjoy. Met some wonderful new friends with common interest.
424,Noah-Mykal,"May 31, 2019",4,"Core Functions Rock! Please Fix small bugs. I love this app. It's helped a lil' isolated introvert like me meet a whole bunch of cool, loving, supportive people that are productive and passionate about what they do."
425,Healthy@62,"November 5, 2019",5,"Best App for newcomers We’ve known about Meetup for sometime now but never used it, we’re now traveling in Nova Scotia and decided to settle in Halifax for a few months, we looked in Meetup for activities and we’ve found a plethora of options.  I attended my first activity last week and was welcomed into the group as if I was an old acquaintance, certainly a GREAT APP."
426,Alib2445,"July 8, 2019",5,The antidote to social media I am absolutely in love with Meetup. This website / app brings people together in conversation and social activity based on their interests and hobbies. Find something cool to do in your area this week. Don’t see anything? Start a group!
427,suzie1964,"July 6, 2019",5,"Meetup App Is Awesome Meetup App was suggested by a friend to me so that I would stop working all the time and get out more.  So far I’ve gone to a craft project group where I met some great people. Then I went to a Comedy show with old friends, that I would have never called if it wasn’t for the show.  The apps been great so far.  Definitely recommend."
428,mzsporty1,"June 17, 2019",5,"Great Place to Meet There are so many ways to meet on social media and this one stands apart from the rest because it’s focus is to bring people together in real time and space to actually connect. I like that the meetup groups are centered around a common theme. Also, I appreciate the messenger feature within the app. It’s convenient."
429,Y B Dir,"June 14, 2019",5,New friend opportunities made easy I’m really enjoying this app. It is a wonderful fount of information of what’s going on locally for women over 50 in Suffolk County!  I’ve been looking for a beginners Mah Jongg game for a while now and who would think the app helped me find one so close in Whole Foods !! So much more activities to track. Happy I was introduced to this app!!
430,Samantha Ellison,"May 5, 2018",5,"Wonderful app I’ve never organized an event, so I’m only reviewing the other side. It’s very easy to find events that you are interested in because of the interest categories you’ve choose. Contacting an admin is easy, if they are in a current group. Some groups seem to disband but still have their meet ups posted."
431,113rs321,"December 30, 2018",1,"WORST APP EVER!! DO NOT GET!! I downloaded this miserable app, and it immediately glitched. I can’t even get to the home screen. It will not recognize my password, and the process to reset is almost impossible to follow. After FOUR attempts to reset my password, it finally worked. Then I went into the app to cancel my subscription. Guess what? There are no obvious links to do that. I’ve been sitting here screaming at my phone for about half an hour. I have NEVER regretted downloading an app more than I regret downloading this useless piece of crap. "
432,8-2kxx,"March 5, 2019",4,"I think you should un-hide the “Add to calendar” feature This app lets you instantly add an event to your phone calendar.  Nice... right?  But, it doesn’t have the words “Add to Calendar.”  Instead, there’s this tiny greyed-out clock next to the date and time.  I basically only found out by accident."
433,prabhu ramaswamy,"March 6, 2019",5,"Great way to meet new friends and stay connected I’ve been using Meetup since 2011 for meeting new people, exchanging business contact info, and exploring new hobbies. I’ve been able to generate a lot of positive feedback regarding my personal endeavors. It’s an outstanding tool that I use pretty much every week. I highly recommend it."
434,photostorm,"April 17, 2019",5,Provides great opportunities especially for a newcomer to the area! Great app for finding things to do and getting to know people with similar interests. I’m just getting started with two groups but am excited to find more things and opportunities I want to explore. So far very user friendly for an older gal! Definitely 5 stars!
435,Q.O.Lewis,"April 20, 2019",5,Works just as explained I was a bit skeptical about the app at first but once I downloaded and joined a few groups and started RSVPing for events I got the hang of it. Well done with this app and it’s a great way for people just getting started in their careers to network and even for people who just want to try new and different stuff.
436,vbbxvvxcbvbnjcv,"April 2, 2020",5,"Always awesome This group consist of a welcoming community and great individuals. Eric is very professional, fun and embracing to all.  I’m new to Maryland from NY and this group has been one of the experiences that has lessened being home sick.    It’s a great place for business opportunities and services and products as well.  I definitely recommend this meet up group."
437,Chiefy143,"February 9, 2020",5,Sharing Vision Being made aware of various opportunities to gather among persons with similar interests is a gift!  Talking about what is seen and how it is seen is wonderful.  The most effective way of learning is by doing.  Lessons learned in the classroom setting is defined and learned while doing together. All photographers gather in the same place and each photograph is singularly quique!

439,Gardner310,"November 25, 2019",5,Meet Up app I started using Meet Up about a year ago and am enjoying it. I’ve found some groups I joined and  now have a new face to face social network. The app seems to work well for communicating on upcoming events and then follow ups as well. I’ll continue exploring in the app for even more groups as I get more leisure time
440,BethanyRoseman,"August 9, 2018",5,"Creating My Own Community It's become apparent to me that positive community and environment are paramount to my happiness. Since I haven't managed to stumble upon the types of influences and ideas that add value to my life, it's become necessary to create environments where people can flourish. I feel like this app lets me do that in a way that is easy for people to participate."

Take the first step and just go!"

444,Hugb,"January 29, 2019",3,Millions of Emails. Took hours to unsubscribe This is a good idea for an app and I have met people through it but the consistent emails that you receive gets ridiculous. I signed up to a lot of groups as I was prompted to do and received literally hundreds of emails. It is on clear when you sign up to receiving all of these emails and it’s a really long winded process and subscribe from settings. In fact I had to unsubscribe on a desktop
445,Baldyserrano,"October 27, 2019",5,"Get reconnected with the world as we know it We tend to be like turtles and stay within the safe confines of our shell. It is not until you reach out to groups within meetup, that you realize there is a safer and happier way to shell-ter yourself around genuinely fun loving people. So get off that couch and jump into a group. Live life to the fullest with like minded people!!!"
446,Speecher4,"August 24, 2019",5,Have loved Meetup since 2013 I discovered this wonderful app after moving from CA to WA.  It has enabled me to make many new friends and find people with whom I have things in common.

In doing so I saw other hiking groups throughout the Bay Area. Since I don’t like to hike alone for safety reasons I find this a great way to be able to hike and meet new people with similar interests. This is a great app for that purpose.

But overall a great app."

454,browniydgyrl,"April 23, 2019",4,"Good way to meet people with similar interests I’ve been using Meetup for about 5 years. When I lived in Southern California, it was great. While I wish there was a bit more  groups to chose from, I met a lot of wonderful people. Then I moved to rural Minnesota. I guess small town people don’t really have the need for Meetup. They already know each other! So, it’s not all that useful in a small town."
455,Bay Developer,"June 6, 2019",1,"Garbage on iPad When I opened this thing, I did a doubletake. I wad typing with an external keyboard and the signin screen did not swivel to landscape. Uh okayyy. No biggie, you only use the signin screen once so I’m sure the actual app is fine. Wrong! They didn’t even bother to make an ipad app. You just use the same app as the iphone. If you think using a phone app with phone dimensions on an ipad is a crappy experience then you would be correct. I don’t know what they are thinking. It’s not hard to change the dimensions of your iphone app and make an actual ipad app."
456,bsr33647,"January 4, 2020",5,"Perfect way to make new friends If you’re new in town or just an introvert who decides, yeah, some like-minded friends would be nice to have, Meetup will help you connect.

457,AluiseK,"September 1, 2019",5,"Love meeting people and doing fun activities! I’ve had some great experiences the past few years using Meetup.  I went to a LACMA and was guided by a retired docent. I’ve gone to dance clubs, book clubs and writing groups.  I’m sure I will continue to meet interesting people and take part in fun activities because of Meetup.  I recommend this app to anybody and everybody."
458,OntheJobHunt,"August 9, 2019",3,"Completely monetized I was under the impression this app was a platform where regular people could list interests and meet up. However at this point, the whole thing is just full of class/seminars from companies you have to pay to go to, and even reg people have to pay to set up a meeting. Not really the organic experience I was looking for (if I wanted classes, I’d just google it) and just overall not useful to me."
459,Dreamgirl102099,"July 31, 2019",5,Meetup This is a great app. I haven’t encountered any issues using it or with any of my groups of choice. There’re many groups to accommodate to everyone’s interests. I would say that most of the people that create these groups are legitimately doing it to help them selves while helping others. I hope that this helps. Enjoy

May many people come and use Meetup and be successful!!!"

471,cmhrunner,"September 1, 2018",4,Meet ups is great and easy to use. It updates your calendar for you and you can expand to view more information. Something I found was that not everyone posts that they are going to join. A lot of people just show up so don’t be dissuaded by low numbers. Quick install and it hasn’t had any problems to use so far.
472,VRBell,"October 5, 2018",5,Great app for finding group activities I used this app to find running groups. The people were always welcoming and friendly. I need that extra push of being expected to show up to make sure I get out the door and complete the runs. Great app hope it helps you as well.
473,Crafty Elaine,"December 30, 2018",5,"Meetup review I have been on meetup for 8 years this pass November. I started the meetup because I wanted to make friends that enjoy scrapbook and cards making. First month, I meet 2 new friends. 8 years later, I have over 200 members and meet between 25 to 40 each month. Thank You to the designers of MeetUp."
474,Cowboy90soldier,"March 2, 2019",5,Mountain biking I started mountain biking and was struggling to find people to ride with. Went to my local bike shop and they suggested meetup(at first thought it was a dating site and laughed) then realized they were serious and I downloaded it and now can look for rides within any distance I want and always have someone to ride with!
475,Brooksie2012,"March 12, 2019",5,"So many activities and groups to join! Useful app that offers an exhaustive list of local meetup groups. Could be a little easier to navigate and if you click on a group to investigate further, going back will kick you back up to activities you have already perused."
476,Michelle in Norcal,"May 11, 2019",5,The platform is awesome!! The platform is user friendly and instantly connects you with a community. I’m bringing quality women together who would have otherwise never met. Everyday I’m getting new members and can easily communicate with them via the app. So happy this is available and at a low cost too!!
477,Bev53,"June 9, 2019",5,"Great way to find group activities. I love Meetup for finding group activities I’m interested in. Once you sign up you can add events to your calendar, get reminders, get a map to the location, message other participants. And post reviews and photos afterwards. Excellent! Every activity club should use this."
478,Vegassassyone,"September 11, 2019",5,The meetup app is great. I really enjoy seeing the things happening around my town. I have gone to one event but I plan on going to many more in the future. 
479,Guel1,"July 19, 2019",4,"Amazing app for an amazing purpose In this day and age where we have all the ways to socialize nothing can ever beat meeting in person!! So how do you evaluate where to go and make sure it’s going to be worth you time??? Here is meetup!! Solves that issue!! Now I can plan where, why and who I would like to meetup with!! People are awesome and this app helps you find and connect with amazing people!!!"
480,Anj2383,"August 12, 2018",3,Difficult to find things in search The app used to be simpler and better but has become very difficult to customize and search to find things of interests. It shows too many irrelevant things. One has to scroll through stuff from past to get to current and future events . Going through each group works better but that’s a tedious process 
481,Adriannicus,"February 13, 2019",5,"A great way to get in on things happening in your area. The Papp integrates events into your schedule seemlessly, so it’s easy to see new events directly in your calendar. You can search events and groups by name, by subject matter, and by proximity. It even lets you know how many people have committed to the meet up."
482,Psychicmediumtree,"March 20, 2019",5,"Wonderful to Meet Likeminded Meet up if wonderful to find the activities you enjoy doing and meet likeminded friends.  Through meet up, I have tried many different activies with my husband and some by myself. There is no reason to feel alone in this world when you have a meet up app!"
483,jazzyp63,"April 8, 2019",5,Meet Up App I love love love this app! The meetup groups are very diverse & interesting . There is something for everyone to enjoy from A-Z including all adult ages. The app is extremely user friendly. It’s a great way to get out and meet people & to do things you may not have done before. It always feels good to be a part of something good.
484,Pallbearer67,"October 17, 2019",5,Meetup I have really enjoyed being a part of meetup! It is great to have such an organization that offers many types of activities for people to meet other people that they have something in common with! It just a great organization to help you meet & make new friends! I really felt very welcome at my first meeting!  Michael Allen
485,George Haas Photography,"October 15, 2019",5,"Making friends with Meetup When I talk to someone about a passion they have. I always ask them, “Have you heard of Meetup?” I’m happy to say I have a vast network of photographers, models and makeup artists that I consider friends. I met most of them through Meetup. If you don’t see a Meetup that fits your passion, start your own! It’s easy!"
486,Deamonasterios,"October 10, 2019",4,Great App but needs improvement This app gives you the opportunity to connect with groups of your interest.  It works really great. I’m giving it 4 stars because you can’t modify your list of interest. That is important because what I’m interested in could change and it actually changes every time I learn about something new
487,k_heisler,"August 8, 2019",5,"Fantastic app! Kind of new to the app, but I really like it! I’ve already found great organizations and groups in and around my area! Wish there were more, but who knows, maybe I’ll start one soon! "
488,mangoes!!,"July 6, 2019",5,"Much more ‘phone friendly’ than the website! I hate downloading apps, but I believe this one was actually worth it. It has drastically simplified following up with my meetup groups from my phone. The messages functionality feels similar to sending text messages!"
489,Ejgilbert,"June 24, 2019",4,"An app that actually lets me meet people, but isn’t creepy. I have noticed that a few of the buttons are on labeled. Since I use a voiceover, which is built into any Apple product, that’s a little surprising. Might want to fix that. Other than that though, I like the app. It’s fairly easy to use, and I enjoy getting to know more people in my area."
490,Saw It in DC,"August 6, 2018",3,"Ok Is there any way a filter can be added so we only get updates for certain days and/or within certain cities?  For example, I am generally only interested in meetups on the weekends, so I’d like to be able to set preferences so I only get notifications for those days. I also live in a large metropolitan area and though I set mileage preferences, I still get notifications for suburbs that I don’t want to travel to. Thanks!"
491,T-Bear & Buddy,"August 19, 2018",5,"Terrific A terrific app for those looking for like minded people interested in what you enjoy doing, seeing, exploring, learning about and more... I had no idea how many groups there were in Los Angeles open to broaden their member base and/or start up new groups.  Thanks “meet up” for bringing the people in our city and those from abroad together!"
492,notahrushi,"August 31, 2018",5,"Good app, but bad navigation Good app, but it’s really hard to find upcoming meetups since it’s not intuitive. You have to click the search tab and then try to adjust the settings to look for upcoming meetups. There should be a button or something. Other than that, works really well"
493,eatplaygo,"September 2, 2018",5,"Social Media Bringing Real People Together With Meetup you can meet people who share your passion and stop trying to convince your friends and family that: (choose one): hiking is fun, playing chess is fun, Lithuanian culture is fun, foraging is fun. The leaders find themselves and there is no advertising If there were more than 5 stars, this would be the place."
494,PeterLA81,"December 4, 2018",5,"Easy to use, great way to meet people Been going to various coding meet ups using this app. It feels well-optimized for the phone interface and offers just as much functionality as its web counterpart.  I recommend it for both newbies and experienced users of the website."
495,CLP14,"December 16, 2018",5,"Easy to Use The only downside is the fee to set up a Meet Up group but by requiring a fee to create and maintain a Meet Up group is far better than the ad heavy, data mining, privacy pirate that Facebook has become. The app is easy to use and has a clean, crisp appearance. There’s lots of various activity groups on Meet Up."
496,Dv1n,"December 28, 2018",5,"Helpful Awesome app, it’s helpful to someone new to a city or anyone that’s looking to branch out and explore possibilities among art, exploration, volunteering, meditation, dance, and so much more. The app categorizes the events in ways that make it easy to find something you’re interested in that fit your schedule. I recommend this app to everyone."
497,Wbzkjrd,"January 9, 2019",5,"Great way to get involved in things you enjoy! Great way to find people with like interests and enjoy the activity together. If your looking to do something but don't have someone to do it with, this app gives the chance to do the activity and meet new people who may soon be your friends."
498,Lifegoeswaterfllows,"January 13, 2019",5,MeetUp Grateful for this app giving perfect opportunities of meeting and gatherings of like-minded activities and groups to enjoy time and space in this great journey of life... love meeting up w Gals on a Journey 
499,xRADx,"January 20, 2019",4,"Interesting! Pretty cool app! Group/interest suggestions are so helpful. There is something for everyone. Easy to navigate. If you’re looking for new things to try, new ppl to befriend or date... this is the perfect app! The only negative thing is that the app crashes and you can only edit your interest on mobile web browser. But overall it’s great!"
500,zenfinoly,"September 14, 2018",4,"User App seemed to operate well be more recent, or last few 3 or so weeks, where it would drop out or lock up.  The screen may just go blank in bringing up the app.  Now it isn't operating so I have deleted it from my phone while now trying to down load a newer version, unsucessfully.  Keeping my peepers open for a workable version of the Meetup App"
501,dwswrw,"January 13, 2019",4,"Great app, clunky communication Has been great to use for finding pickup sports in LA for me, only thing I don’t trust the app so much for is the comments section for each event. I prefer to use the website to really check the whole event first, then just use the app for reference. 4 stars for having essentially everything still there and functioning on the app."
502,impossibletofindnewnickname,"March 1, 2019",5,"Great hiking! This is the perfect way to meet people who love to do what you do.  So there is an instant connection with other hikers. Everyone is always very friendly. You can take as much or as little as you like. The leaders are awesome!  The hike is challenging.  I love this at the end of a busy work week.  Relaxing, invigorating and a great workout."
503,Insanely Sane,"March 30, 2019",5,"Great app, easy to use to make connections! Great app, helps you easily connect with so many special-interest groups. Perfect for discovering new interests that you might not have thought about otherwise & finding exciting ways to get out & about while meeting new people along the way!"
504,Ablepraxis,"January 31, 2020",5,Great facilitator technology to personally connect without technology By facilitator technology I mean the app permits organization of humans finding humans to pursue (whatever it may be) common interest.  Social media ain’t social! (Really you only see screens/pictures but no actual people; doesn’t feel the same does it?)
505,C=D=Saved,"January 2, 2020",5,"Accountability I wish I could be one of those people that can put himself on the clock and get things done from the comfort of his home, but I can get easily distracted. Meetup helps me find people who get together and have a focused effort on whatever project you choose to master. I’ve found it very helpful."
506,Liberated1,"December 22, 2019",5,Why did I wait so long! This is a super resource.  I heard about it a while ago however did not take advantage of it.  I am so happy that I got moving using this wonderful app.  I have begun my journey to master the French language and now with meet up have made friends who are on the same journey. Thanks Meet up!
507,Aseals1004,"December 16, 2019",5,A great place to meet people with similar hobbies and aspirations I joined a mom’s group on meet up after moving to a new area and it has been an awesome tool to see what events are being planned and who is attending. This app has helped me join the community and has helped me to settle and feel more at home in a new environment!
508,Trauma Victim,"November 7, 2019",5,"Downriver Anxiety and Depression Support Group Although I am a new member, the group comes up with fun and imaginative activities, as well as a support group meeting. I plan to be more active in the group soon. I give the group for top marks for comments and activities which many depressed people struggle ( including me) to get out and socialize!"
509,Tara Schmitt,"August 24, 2019",5,San Mateo County Medical Association I love this group. I moved here a year ago from the East Coast and was looking for a group with whom I can walk to get in my steps and also meet people. I wish the group would meet at other times besides the summer months. Is there a possibility this could be extended to every weekend throughout the year?
510,Tinkertech,"August 10, 2018",5,"Easiest way to keep up with your groups If you haven’t joined Meetup, you are missing out.  There are groups for any taste.  Not only do you make new friends, you learn about the activities going on around you that would appeal to your interests. This app is the easiset way to interact with Meetup on a mobile device."
511,nwelthy,"August 14, 2018",5,Great way to connect with like minded people! I love the meet up app. There are so many great groups of people gathering for various reasons. You can even start your own group. There’s some overlap in groups which makes it fun. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people through this app. I’ve also got to do lots of fun activities.
512,amy wineclause,"August 17, 2018",5,"Very outstanding marketing and advertising conveyed through this app. This app has everything one could possibly want. From diverse meet up groups to an open variety of different choices, and options for people to come together and make something special."
513,@Sylvania,"January 20, 2020",5,"Something for everybody! This allow you to participate in activities with others who have similar interests. It offers a wide variety of activities and groups, and you can pick choose those of interest. I’ve met some really nice people, and had some good times."
514,2cats4dogs,"January 20, 2020",5,"Meet up app Very easy to navigate and search for new groups. Response times are quick. Only glitch is if you click on a photo it hangs there for a while as if you’ve locked out the App, but eventually it comes back to the beginning."
515,Paster Alistair Begg,"October 9, 2019",5,Sometimes change is not better This website is priceless!  EVERY non-profit would benefit from using this app to keep members informed and involved.  My only gripe is that occasionally Meetup eliminates a function I liked to use such as BOLD typeface to catch readers eye.  But thank you!! This is well worth the$.  Membership increased 150% 2nd year.
516,ParTaygal,"September 26, 2019",5,Bring the check in feature back Why did you take away the “I’m here” check in feature? Please bring that back! This is a great app but I think you charge to much for it. Maybe you could ease up on high cost if membership is low. 
517,usaveteran,"August 28, 2019",5,"Great app to connect with like minded individuals This app keeps one connected to groups/classes, etc., that interests you. It’s a great way to stay up to date with my Tai Chi lessons around the area. I always get a notification whenever the schedule changes or a new one is added. Very easy to navigate. Excellent!"
518,Rasha^.*,"July 1, 2019",3,"Profile updates I love the idea of the app, it’s brilliant!! There’s only one problem I have with it is that I can’t upload my profile picture and my information such as the gender and the age.. I tried to log out and even turned my iPhone off and on but it didn’t work.. I know it’s a minor thing but ppl care about these things.. thank you all for all of your hard work and effort 🙏🏼"
519,DrofLegend,"June 13, 2019",5,"The way of the future. I am a huge fan of platforms, such as MeetUp, that allow us to expand who we connect with online, but then bring people together in an in-person environment. Such a great concept that I hope more and more people take advantage of for years to come."
520,beestev,"October 12, 2018",5,"Super helpful! Love this app. It’s easy to customize your interests and be in the know about all the cool things happening around you. If you’re new to an area and want to find likeminded peeps, or you’re just looking for some different things to do or interesting activities to try, this is the app for you!"
521,le bon raconteur,"November 2, 2018",2,"Could be better Not easy to use this app if you’re the Organizer of a group. You can’t mass email from the app or approve new members. App crashes almost every time I try to create a Meetup event. In fact, I usually have to set the date, time, description and title, then save a barebones version of my Meetup event, then edit in additional details at a later time."
522,MBishop66,"December 2, 2018",5,Meet up makes Mongo happy Very happy to have discovered Meet Up. I love to draw but have been unwilling (ie: afraid) to show others my work. Joined a Sketching group and had my first Meetup yesterday. Great experience and was surprised to find a few others had the same trepidations. Overall a great experience. Highly recommended.
523,ActivelyYours,"January 30, 2019",5,"New beginnings I love this app. It’s allowed me to get out of the house, try new activities, and make new friends. I wish I had known about it sooner. I’ve really been missing out. I encourage everyone to browse and see what interests you. There’s no obligation to stay in a group. I promise you will find something to do."
524,Joliver332,"February 5, 2019",1,"Finally. A better layout, nevermind Stop asking me to rate Meetup every time I log in!!!! Update: back to no quality control. Are your developers all children? You update this program every other day and it's continually broken. This time it shows no upcoming events on any meetup or it says the content is unavailable… this development team is absolutely the worst I've ever encountered in the App Store. Please stop updating the program every 15 seconds, please start quality controlling your app so it's functional stable and intuitive."
525,Gbd640,"February 24, 2019",5,"Helped me master two sports! Meetup helped me conquer two sports that take time, dedication, and most importantly support from those more experienced. I was able to find groups that offered classes and a supportive community to help me progress without giving up on motorcycling and bicycling. Life wouldn’t be the same!"
526,Jaxson Extroidinary,"March 18, 2019",5,"Perfect! I am new to town and I had no clue of how I would find out about events and happens in my area until I came across Meet Up. It’s “perfect!” There’s a lot of different groups to join, so not only do I get a wide variety of things to do; but I also get to meet tons of new people! I recommend, Meet Up!"
527,Ear21,"March 27, 2019",5,Great way to meet people with similar interests The app has a great way to meet people who have similar interests. You can pick from many interests and find a group of people who like it too. I have found groups that I never knew existed and have started enjoying activities with them.
528,SandeepGoni,"April 26, 2019",5,Meetup App is great I have been using meetup since 2016 and has not been disappointed since then when it comes to signing up to a new group and scheduling meetups. The push notification works great and reminds me of future meetups even if I am very busy with work and other personal commitments.
529,laurane06,"May 28, 2019",5,Move this app! One of my daily apps I use This is an app I check nearly daily. It really helped me find the right events I was looking for. Having just moved cities 3 months ago I feel settled in and welcomed thanks to the events I have found on the app. It is really user friendly and resourceful.
530,Deboray Kieckhefer,"May 13, 2018",5,Connecting with your interests made easy Speaks for it self and you already kind of know what you're walking into so that makes it nice also knowing you already have something in common with a group of people that can help others or for Phil and further your interest
531,madam of monroe manor,"August 9, 2018",5,Love this app A couple years back I took a staycation for a week and wanted to experience some activities around my new city. Meet up allowed me to participate in a wealth of different kinds of activities. Things I would never have found on my own. I’ve been using it ever since. I absolutely love this app!
532,Dkitty007,"September 9, 2018",4,"I love it most of the time! Hi everyone I’m a MeetUp organizer, I don’t really have a complaint just some quirks I think App. If you started a new event he gets confused when you try to save it and then go back to at least for me. I have better luck using it on my iPad and I do on my iPhone that the going back-and-forth. But just me. Other than that it works really well!"
533,Vplady,"September 30, 2018",5,"Meet Up Fun Meet Up has allowed me to join a great group of people to participate in fun activities in our town. We have over 100 members now and sometimes there are as few as 3 or 4 who are interested in an activity, other times as many as 20+. A great way to find friends in a new place!"
534,pschmidtke,"January 26, 2020",5,Activities not by myself Great way for a single to join like minded active people in a safe setting of a group.
535,Believersberg,"December 9, 2019",4,"Great way to meet people If you’re looking to meet more people, MeetUp is a great place to start. The personal profile features could be a little more dynamic and the make-your-own group features are a little bit clunky. The experience of finding folks with similar interests for casual socializing or play makes up for all of that."
536,Vanessa A Q,"December 4, 2019",5,Great for a newcomer! I like the Meetup app’s versatile listing of groups and events. It really helps when you’ve just moved to a city or want to connect with people with similar interests. It’s fun to use and great to find new types of things I didn’t know about before. Give it a try and be open to the experiences!
537,Angelnapping,"October 19, 2019",5,Excellent App for Growing Learning & Making Longtime Friends I met longtime friends through this app when I was searching for a workout Bootcamp. Just recently attended an awesome Meetup where I got to see a demo for an application we may be getting at work and I got to meet other people and learn what they do and it was just amazing!
538,CoffeehouseFan,"October 14, 2019",5,"Happy Hiker Although I cannot take part in the some of the events, it’s great keeping you in the loop."
539,Purple Muse,"October 5, 2019",5,"Useful and fun I’ve been using Meetup both professionally to attract people to events in my business and also personally to find groups of likeminded people and activities to join. I’ve found it both useful and quite fun so far. Highly recommend this app—there are no cons, only pros!"
540,Nic J19,"August 14, 2018",5,Meetup app Love using this app to meet like minded people with common interests. The app is user friendly. It’s easy to change locations to find groups and activities in different areas. I would definitely recommend the app to anyone who is looking to meet great people in a safe and convenient manner.
541,Mmorocco,"February 19, 2019",5,Uplifting app This app is really cool and I love how many different categories and groups there are! It’s tough in the city to always make friends/keep friends with busy schedules so this app/ website is wonderful for me to branch out! I haven’t been to a meeting just yet but the support from other members and messaging is nice!
542,Gina b music,"May 19, 2019",5,Very open and welcoming group My social skills are limited to begin with. This group makes it easy to meet people and everyone I’ve met has been welcoming. I didn’t feel left out of conversation or activities. Thank you to all of you who organize this group!
543,Sajah M,"October 5, 2019",5,New to Town Meetup is a fantastic way to meet new people in your area. Been in my new home town for 4 years and still not many friends to speak of. Joined some fun groups on Meetup and my calendar is full again! The best part is connecting with others who share your interests and passions!
544,TBar Tim,"September 20, 2019",5,Meetup Meetup app is a great way to connect with people who share common interests with you. Whatever you like to do that requires more than yourself to do it search for a meetup in the app if that thing and if you don’t find one create it yourself and people will join. What can be cooler than that
545,Tgpico,"September 10, 2019",5,A great resource I really enjoy the information and resources I have been able to find on this app. It’s so nice to see something like this helping us create community in large cities where for some reason it has become so difficult to connect with like minded people!
546,K-squared44,"August 27, 2019",5,"Great App for finding events & groups If you’re looking for groups of people with interests similar to your own, or if you’re looking for new adventures and a way to break out of your comfort zone...this is the App!"
547,Dogboy1982,"August 25, 2019",5,"A story of friends Of course this app’s ability with differ according to where you are and who is around you. But when I moved from California to Washington, this is how I’ve made nearly all of my friends. Including my roommate. Great app. And I constantly recommend it to people who haven’t used it."
548,Staceymf,"June 28, 2019",5,"Love the convenience I find myself looking for things to do on the go. The Meetup app loads quickly and provides location-based meetups. I wish I can look for events in a wider radius. Even with that, I like the feature “send to calendar” where I can RSVP and put the event in my calendar with two clicks!"
549,GabrielNA,"June 12, 2019",1,"Faulty App This app is very frustrating at times... Every time I get a notification that there’s a new message in the app, when I tap on it eight times out of 10 I now get a message “oops, somethings gone wrong, please try again later“.   Of course, when I try again I get the same message. Sometimes I can still get in the app but the message keeps coming up. I’ve never experienced so many glitches in one single app (iPhone 7, iOS 12.3).  When it comes to meet up’s, I mainly just look for emails versus using the app."
550,visualUXphil,"March 24, 2019",5,"Keeping a pulse on Boston Tech with Meetup Meetup is a great app for creating opportunities to learn and be part of communities. In my case the Boston Tech communities, learning from many different teams on many different topics (performance, up and coming apps, frameworks, accessibility just to name a few). "
551,AirForce1,"March 29, 2019",5,MeetUp Review There is always something for someone.  Never any pressure to join in weekly activities - just lots of choices and I’ve met some pretty fantastic people.  A wide variety of interest groups only limited by the time you want to participate. Excellent way to meet people and learn new things.
552,GoGirl99!,"May 2, 2019",5,"Great Way to connect with people! My husband and I just moved to Spokane and found Meetup! It’s been so helpful for connecting with people who like the same things we do, and seeing events coming up...it would have taken us much longer to find groups of interest with out Meetup!"
553,Rocinte,"May 11, 2019",5,Cure for introversion My wife’s a social butterfly and I’m an introvert. We had our first dinner with our new MU group and I had a blast. Regardless to say that my wife was very pleased and happy that I came out of my shell and get out of my comfort zone. So I’m now looking for more opportunities for me to get out and find one or two groups for me.
554,panama258,"February 11, 2020",5,Community This app really makes it easy to stay engaged with community! Experiencing life with other people is in our nature and we don’t always know how to do that. This app has made that easy again. I’m meeting great people with the same interests as myself and I am having a fun time!
555,Hi-Mari,"December 15, 2019",5,"Great I’m really enjoying the app. I like that I can join in on activities that I like or go to meet people that share the same interest. I can go alone and just do the activities that I enjoy, like painting or meditating, not necessarily to talk or meet people. And I can also go with the intention of conversing and meeting people."
556,MamaFussyFangs,"October 13, 2019",5,"Great way to find your people! Moved to the Portland area knowing no one and with Meetup I’m doing what I like to do with people that share my focused interest. I highly recommend you try it whether you’re new to your area, new to the interest of the group or just looking for new friends."
557,Lyoness82,"July 27, 2019",4,"How do you get worse??? Like seriously I'm so furious! I use meetup for everything!!! And now it's barely functional. I demand that you go back to the old app! It wasn't even a choice to update, you had to or the app didn't work. It's a terrible up day and whoever redid it should be fired!"
558,Nishij,"June 27, 2019",5,"So far, not disappointed! When life throws you for a loop and puts you in a new state with no one you know.. this App has come to the rescue. I’ve been connecting with new people everyday and am yet to find myself feeling unsure about what options are available out there for me to do."
559,h0neybee77,"June 19, 2019",5,"Issue Starting New Group Hi, I didn’t want to rate low so I rated high but this is a suggestion..."
560,ChrissyVnailz,"August 10, 2018",5,Move and meet up. Meet up is great if your a very social person but have to move a-lot. I’ve used it in different cities and states and I have always had a great experience. It’s easy and fun especially if you keep in mind that everybody is looking for the same thing you are.
561,webbob42,"August 25, 2018",5,"Much Better Works smoothly, stable. I feel like both the “controls” and presentation of information organized in ways I can navigate are much improved since I last reviewed this app. iPhone Calendar ends up with invitations stuck in its Inbox, as a user this is harmless but untidy."
562,molloyrios,"September 4, 2018",5,Meetup I am loving the MeetUp app for both business and social .  With this app I have been able to attend some great lectures and group discussions by scheduling directly to me calendar.  I am also more active now that I have found organized sporting games to jump into.  My life is much fuller now and so is my calendar.
563,Stevebone88,"September 5, 2018",5,"A great app I've been using this app for a couple of years now, and it has worked flawlessly. I've never had to close the app out because it was stuck, and I've never had to delete then re-read load it because it was malfunctioning."
564,jbolden1517,"October 7, 2018",5,"Is the standard for a reason Many thousands of groups.  App works well, though i like the website better.  If you are looking for a meetings app and don’t have very unusual criteria this is likely the right first one.  It likely will be your main one and could be your only one."
565,happygcd,"November 24, 2018",5,"Highly Recommend! I had used the Meetup app years ago & it certainly has improved dramatically. It is extremely easy to navigate, I use it with the same ease as I do on my laptop. It is one of my most used apps. No glitches whatsoever, I attend fun events and make new friends along the way!"
566,Life can be fun,"January 26, 2019",5,"Making new friends This is a great app for crafts,wellness, having dinners with people you would have never met had it not been for this app. Explore a-little you just show up at the time for your event and everyone is new to what is going on "
567,Evelyn Renee,"February 3, 2019",5,"Perfect App For Those Who Move to a New City or Country! I have lived now in four countries and multiple cities and I’ve used this app to meet interesting people. For example, I never thought I would become a hiker but Ireland is the perfect place for such a sport. If you are an expat moving to a new city, try it out!"
568,BlackBeauty4Life,"March 19, 2019",5,Easy to use I enjoyed having immediate access to the group and receiving notifications. User friendly. And able to upload pics directly from my phone instead of waiting to access my laptop.
569,Terebella22,"March 21, 2019",5,"Great for making new friends If you want to get out more, try new activities or just enjoy familiar ones while making new friends then Meetup is the perfect venue for you.  I love it.  My only complaint is that I don’t have the time and stamina to do all the activities that interest me."
570,Ressaw2011,"May 10, 2018",1,Impossible to access messages Cartoony and unusable. Cannot see current events .mobile site is much better. The messages icon has disappeared in the app. It appears on the mobile site but when I click on it the app comes up. I'm deleting the app. The new pink and green  and fake bright colors are terrible and ugly. I'm not not downloading a version with no calendar. Can't do many organizer functions from app. The mobile website works better. Don't release bug filled versions without extensive testing!
571,hgdecker,"June 9, 2018",4,UI/UX I love Meetup. It’s the only way I’ve been able to find soccer games after moving to NYC without any sort of network! I’ve made some great friends and am SO glad this app exists. It is also really easy to pay for games through the app. (Nicer than always having to have the right amount of cash with me).
572,Use to be ur biggest app fan,"February 6, 2019",3,"Love this app but hate the incessant event rating pop-up I love the meetup app, I use it daily. HowevEr the last update now has a relentless pop-up asking you to rate the lastevent you attended and you cannot clear it unless you give a rating. You can exit out of it without giving a rating but the. Knute you reopen the app it pops up again. Pleasssssse make it STOP! This is so aggravating in a perfectly working app."
573,flurffmeister,"May 9, 2019",5,"Wish I'd found it sooner It makes it so easy to find groups in the area that get together to nerd out about some of my favorite stuff. I get so fired up by going to these events, learn so much about things and about how to give talks and how to interact with the group to answer questions."
574,singlesunite,"June 5, 2019",5,"Great app Instead of scrolling through websites, looking for things to do, this app has it all figured out for you. I especially like that it keeps track of all the events I plan to attend ! It's safe, does you who's going to each event and allows you to message the host of the event."
575,Naynaysun,"October 27, 2019",5,New to meet and Arizona I moved to Arizona from Chicago and didn’t know anything about the area. It shows you a lot of social events that I didn’t know existed close to my area. Also more events that I can travel to. So far it is helping me navigate through this new place I live in and I love it.
576,JasonHChicago,"October 1, 2019",5,Great app in an increasingly disconnected world! This app is great to find people with shared interests who get together as often as weekly or as infrequently as monthly. The search functions allow you to quickly find hobbies that you may or may not be doing today and peruse the folks that are participating.
577,Sue553,"July 17, 2019",5,"Great new format While running a piano Meetup, I appreciate the new format — more space, ability to keep messages organized, personal interests clear, notifications, etc.   And of course, the overall idea of putting people together based on activities they love!"
578,VHV_,"July 11, 2019",1,This app is impossible to use Meetup is great and the idea is brilliant. I enjoy the groups and participate often. 
579,Natrlnails,"July 10, 2019",5,Meetup app helps when away from desktop Sometimes I have to update meetings and I don’t have access to my desktop computer. Being able to use the app has been extremely helpful and easy to use!  I highly recommend it.
580,Mmj5981,"April 26, 2018",5,"Great app to meet people I've used Meetup in various cities to meet people who share common interests. The app is super easy to use, lets you quickly save the info in your calendar, message other members and browse various ways. I'm thankful for an easy way to find my people who enough what I do."
581,Rynrach,"August 16, 2018",5,Fun so far Haven’t met up with a group yet been busy. But the choices are amazing. I’m seeing things on here that I am ACTUALLY interested in. Can’t wait to get out a some hike or camp or explore. I also joined a group that will meet up and chat about things that I’m into. That makes me happy. Keep up the good work.
582,Living4me,"August 17, 2018",5,"Fantastic I have been looking for a way to meet other singles in the area and stumbled on this app. It is a fantastic way to meet other people. So easy to use as well. Just join whatever groups that speaks to you and see what they gave going on. Now, I have a full calendar of events 😊"
583,Bob Winnie,"September 4, 2018",4,Good but not real user friendly The app works about as well as the regular site. Like most apps it appears to lack some functionality. I can’t find where I can adjust member roles. So most likely that doesn’t exist. Since both the app and web page are not real user friendly to those who are organizers I have given 4 stars.
584,liannearatea,"October 8, 2018",5,"Awesome site to meet awesome folks! I downloaded this app after moving to a new city and wanting to make friends! I’ve had lots of fun just meeting up with people that have similar hobbies or even trying out new hobbies! For example, I made a group for local K-Pop fans and I joined a group for playing Ultimate Frisbee!!"
585,Eppie3225,"December 1, 2018",5,Great way to learn about local options As someone new to an area who travels constantly for work it is difficult to know what is happening at home when I do “drop in” for a few days between assignments. Meetup gives me lots of options and creates opportunities to meet people.
586,Mario031313,"December 21, 2018",1,Needs a lot of work Hi and thanks for making this app but needs a lot of fixes in order to work fluidly and be a tool refresh time is bad once yo open notifications or messages they all change status as if you have seen them not individually as they should badges don’t appear in real time in the app communication an posts are not easy with other members yo don’t get to send pic on the discussions etc guess you are all working in all this matters hope you put an update ASAP so this tool can work better
587,b0sh4ng,"January 25, 2020",5,"Best IRL meetup app, like student groups back in college but for adults! Extremely helpful for society because obviously we only learn from each other! Seriously meetup is the most publicly open non abusive social network by like so much! Thanks so much for helping to make the world a better place!"
588,R K G,"December 22, 2019",5,Awesome app to meet new people and groups It’s really Great platform with similar intrest when you’re new to any place by using this app you can meet different groups and share your thoughts and knowledge.
589,♪♫♪♫♪♫♪,"October 25, 2019",5,"Wow...it actually works! I’ve only been to one MeetUp so far, and I already have a group of friends to go do fun and try new things in our area."
590,Rose_Above,"December 2, 2018",5,"Connected This app is a huge help when moving to a new place. It gets you connected to the community of things you enjoy. Instead of wondering endlessly to find your tribe, with this app you can meet them today. (or whenever the next meet up is)"
591,Mensa Girl,"December 5, 2018",5,Up with Meet Up! A great app for keeping track of my Meetups and finding new ones. It's also well designed for following up with people I meet at Meetups and vice versa without divulging email addresses or phone #s right off the bat. The photos help as often you don't catch someone's full name.
592,Yogabusiness,"December 19, 2018",4,Great App to support the website. I like using this app because then I can easily message people. It also is really helpful to see upcoming events and meet up groups that I might like to attend. I think that it’s easy to use and great for my needs. I would recommend getting the app and getting out to have a good time doing stuff you love!!
593,Sacred Wombman,"January 11, 2019",5,"Love it!!! This app has allowed me to connect with the type of people I've been trying to connect with for years, right in my local area. This app has opened so many doors for me and helped me to connect with so many useful people in my life. This is truly a awesome app - if you use it right."
594,Charlie.$,"January 15, 2019",4,"Meet up. Happens. Happened. Meetup has a very effective formation/ layout & is very welcoming to the eyes! If I had the option to reformat the page however, I would include an option for a darker tonality overall. 😎 "
595,LM3875,"April 26, 2019",5,"Love this app I belong to only one Meet Up group and am so happy I found them. There are so many groups that engage in a multitude of activities....something for everyone. If one group isn’t right for you, keep looking. You are sure to find the right mix of friends or relationships on this app."
596,dscowan,"May 29, 2019",5,"Great way to find groups, whether social or professional This is a great app to let you know all the amazing groups and activities or meetings going on in your area.  It’s an amazingly easy way to find social or professional groups. No pressure, just easy access, details, and new adventures."
597,Lalah 1580,"October 17, 2019",5,Love Meetup! I’ve met some of my closest friends through this app! It has provided me a great way to meet people with common interests. I also love that it connects people in your area that you normally wouldn’t run across especially when you don’t have the opportunity to get out much.
598,SpencerCoronado,"October 3, 2019",5,A great tool. I used this app to find a local hiking group. It’s a messaging and actually connecting social media intended to help you meet others. Works way better than instagram or Facebook for MAKING friends. Highly recommend and hope it never goes away!
599,savannah monet,"July 17, 2019",5,"Like to dance like no ones watching, this is your place! If you’re into free dance of any kind or just want to move your body in an expressive way of whatever reason this is the place to go! I get so welcomed and comfortable to move, breathe and let my body lead the way in this safe space!"
600,Laproscope1,"August 9, 2018",4,Great app Great app.  I just started using it after a break up to meet new ppl and get out.  I would say check the app for cancellations bf you go bc sometimes organizers cancel events at the last minute and you may not get a notification from the app.  But other than that great idea for connecting and getting to know new ppl.  I wish it was my idea.
601,Mr B1LL,"August 18, 2018",4,"Good tool Meetup provides a good source tool for finding, and communicating with, any number of interest groups.  I’d rate it a five but sometimes it seems difficult to filter through to the specific interest groups I am interested in.   That could be my newness to the APP or a deficiency.  Overall I find it a helpful tool to seek out like minded/interest oriented people/groups."
602,D from Kansas City,"September 17, 2018",5,"Welcome. Come join us! This app has the potential to change lives, cure loneliness, and create a community again from the ashes of our technology immersed society. It gives you a reason to look up from your mobile phone screen and rejoin the real world. Meetup is a community revitalizer!"
603,AnybodyAnywhere,"September 21, 2018",1,"Each new update makes it worse and worse Now when you get an email notifying you of an event and you click on the event it doesn't take you to the event on the app, it takes you to any random page. The app is completely useless now, but the email notifications unfortunately are linked with the horrid app not the internet, so there's no relationship between links on the email and the app at all . For all the price increases you imposed you'd expect improvements of some sort."
604,?? Lives,"October 5, 2018",4,"Gotten better The app has improved leaps and bounds, as an Organizer (and assistant organizer of a second group) having this access be such a smooth experience has been amazing. I wish more people would actually use it lol"
605,Bambi240,"February 24, 2020",5,"Meet up Nice app, easy to use. I have only used it for a short time but have found many interesting groups and those I have contacted with questions have responded quickly. If you are looking for a group or activity this is good place to start."
606,Krissiedahl,"February 16, 2020",5,"“Life-changing” is bold... but true 🙂 I discovered the Meetup app 2 weeks ago, and it has already improved my life SO much. "
607,texasjay99,"January 2, 2020",4,"Great idea I love the Meetup app. It’s helped me identify groups of interest and similar professions. The events and reminders within the app are great, also the ability to transfer to my calendar. "
608,cuddlemuffinatl,"December 26, 2019",5,Great way to find like minded folks in a new place I’ve both looked for and created events on Meet up and the process is super easy. If you’re looking to try something new at a low cost you can find pretty much whatever you need OR create it yourself!
609,njsarma,"December 11, 2019",5,"Most useful app About 3 years ago I first used Meetup to find hiking groups and since then my life has changed! It has become my daily ritual to check the app for new hikes coming up. I have become much more active outdoors, have made great friends through meetup. It’s a great app."
610,Gdufbhd,"March 30, 2019",5,"🤙🏼🤙🏼 I lived about 2 hours away from the city and finally moved to the city. It has been the best way to get to meet new people who have similar interests. Everyone’s really welcoming and for someone who’s an introvert like me, made me comfortable to be able to go and meet them. The events are always fun"
611,Bean2193,"May 15, 2019",5,"Best app for spending free time wisely This app has offered so many amazing opportunities for growth, health, fun, meeting new people. It’s just an all-around awesome app offering one opportunity after another to get together with likeminded individuals. Highly recommend this app for all ages, especially if you’re new to an area."
612,OhSewCountry,"June 7, 2019",3,"Uploading Photos from OiS For whatever reason the new version of the app only recognizes 89 random photos of the over 350 photos on my phone. I deleted it and download it from the Cloud again, hoping that corrects the issue. It did not. "
613,pham-boy,"November 5, 2019",5,Educational and enlightening Had a great eye opening experience and the funny thing is I tried the techniques we practiced tonight and the response from my partner was just as negative as I expected. I’m going to need to practice this technique...a lot. I’ll be back. Thank you Elizabeth and Arturo for creating a safe space to be.
614,tyackc,"October 21, 2019",4,"Informative and easy to use This app has really helped align and made easy finding events near me, where I can continue to explore and meet new people. As a newly divorced person with no friends or family in the area, it’s challenging to meet groups of people with similar likes, especially when I work from home."
615,Traci !,"August 18, 2019",5,Great app I just downloaded this app. I joined a few groups. Yesterday I participated in two events. In the morning I went to a community outreach event where we fed and gave necessities to the homeless at Tempe Town Lakes. 
616,Blondie18a8,"July 26, 2019",5,Best app ever!!! I can’t thank the creators enough for this app! It makes socializing in new places so easy. Who doesn’t want to try thing and meet people but not be the only one alone. It’s a great way to make friends and try new things! Thank you so much for making adult socializing so easy!
617,AlyWoodstock,"July 13, 2019",5,"Cobb/Cherokee Hang Out Started out to be a beautiful day at the lake with fun, loving folks. Plenty of  hamburgers, hot dogs, potato, pasta and fruit salad for the taking.  Some people bathed and someone even brought his boat. There was a nice breeze and unfortunately after a few hours rain came down. Thank you everyone we had a nice time 🙂"
618,ARgrier,"July 12, 2019",4,Great way to meet people I’ve found a few great groups through here. It’s great for meeting people with similar interests. 
619,Jaszszy Jaz,"June 21, 2019",5,"Great way to meet new people and try new things I’ve made two big moves so far, and both times, Meetup has been my go-to for finding like-minded people to spend time with in a new city. I actually met one of my closest friends at a Meetup event a couple of years ago!"
620,DmanOriginal,"August 30, 2018",5,Great for finding people with shared interests. It can be difficult finding people who share mutual interests to do things with. This certainly helps and most everyone is in the same situation trying to get to know other people. I’ve had a lot of great experiences thanks to this app.
621,Ohthatgirltiffany,"September 19, 2018",3,"Good but could be better for organizers Overall, good app. It would be totally solid with a few improvements for group organizers. "
622,Donna U,"September 30, 2018",5,"Great website keeps me informed I’ve been using Meetup for about a year and it has afforded me the opportunity to select events that I can attend. It gives reminders on my calendar and lets me know upcoming events I can attend. I highly recommend it if you are a vendor or if you want o attend local events,"
623,Mel-MJ,"January 9, 2019",5,"Great App This App allows like minded or even diversified thinkers to congregate. It’s a one stop shop to allow one to explore interests and to add new interests without a lot of pressure. The various amount of groups and interests simplifies expanding a social life or passions, without the associated headaches that can accompany having only a set group of friends."
624,lauren2401nickname,"March 7, 2019",5,"Having Fun In a New City I would highly recommend the meetup app to anyone who just moved to a new place and is looking to meet people and get involved in community activities. It solves the problem of making friends as an adult, especially helpful if you work from home!"
625,Rit83,"March 1, 2020",5,Awesome way to get social! I am enjoying this app thus far. I’ve had only positive experiences with the groups that I’ve joined and the outings that I’ve participated. I’ve had a much better experience living nearer a larger city than I did when I was in a smaller city. There are a lot more opportunities.
626,bdubu52,"February 10, 2020",5,"Business owner/Golf coach I’m relatively new to Dallas after leaving here and spending 31 years as an entrepreneur in Los Angeles metroplex. This app is remarkable, I’ve only been introduced to it a day ago and have joined several groups already. I’ve had the opportunity also to refer others to the app.  Thank you"
627,Sunjames007,"January 1, 2020",4,Annoying and unnecessary reminder notification This app keep sending me unnecessary notification of the meetups that I probably checked out but didn’t bother to sign up or just not interested. This is so annoying to find the notifications every time I open the app. God knows what kind of developers they hire 😡
628,carpinkruler,"October 30, 2019",5,Good service I’ve had a great time meeting people here. The only problem I had a man found me in one of the meetups 
629,What it is.,"September 27, 2019",4,"Pretty sweet Like the app! My only reason for not five stars is there appears to be a slight bug where if you have a comment in your notifications and you click to go directly to the comment, it will not load that page. Other than that, easy to use and navigate. Also, meetup is great! Met pretty cool people on here."
630,OzzieOKC,"December 3, 2018",5,Great app for keeping social I have used this app for a few years and have been very happy with the app for the groups using it. My husband and I have enjoyed many different social experiences we would otherwise not have been aware of in our community.
631,brookie 12,"December 20, 2018",5,Amazing I’ve lived here for a year now and only heard of this app a month ago. I have made so many friends during that time. We get together outside of meet ups and still go to a bunch together! Highly recommended for everyone!!! Great way to meet people with similar interests!
632,Ngozi C,"January 2, 2019",5,"Very Helpful I love the app. Especially being from Boston, it’s a great and easy way to meet like minded people and helps to navigate your way in a new city (Like DC) for myself personally. I hope MeetUp keeps growing and creating different avenues to navigate our ways in different cities! Keep it up!😂"
633,Ms Coco Velvet,"April 3, 2019",5,"A positive app Meet up is a great app simply because you can pick your interests and meet with like minded ppl that can help you reach your goals. Also you get to discover new places and events that you didn’t know exist. I’m enjoying meeting new ppl, learning, and finding new places to go to."
634,gretalstix,"May 5, 2019",5,"Cool app I like this app a lot, it’s great to find groups of people doing activities you’re interested in, and have group discussions. I wish there were a calendar tab where you could see everything going on by day, but the event reminders are really helpful."
635,sup with style,"May 8, 2019",5,Great way to meet people who have the same interests I used meet up in the past to join paddle board events and met cool people and had a lot of fun. I am now a host for paddle boarding in Jupiter Fl. and look forward to having fun on the water with other paddle enthusiasts or those who want to try out the sport.
636,N00000007,"August 20, 2019",5,"So glad I discovered this app! I am newly into the fetish and kink worlds, and had NO IDEA that there was such an active community in my area! I’m so stoked to be offered so many classes and seminars in my area that appeal not only just to that, but to my extremely varied interests. It’s the greatest & I tell everyone I meet about it 🤘"
637,somebody on meet up,"July 22, 2019",4,"Great idea great app I love the amount of groups that are available. The notices keep me up to date with any new group formed, which makes it easy for me to decide quickly whether its for me or not. I still haven't had the balls to attend any of the meet ups, but im getting there. This app makes it easy for an introvert like myself find groups."
638,judithgigi,"July 21, 2019",5,Meetup I have only gone to two Meet-ups but can say each were fun.  It was great having new experiences and being with a group of very friendly people who are interested in the same.
639,Sailee123,"July 18, 2019",4,Good app It’s a good app to connect with local people with similar interest. I have given one less star because as organizer I don’t get access to all the features that are available on meetup website. So in Order to fully get control over to manage my meetup I need to use my laptop as it can’t be done over the app.
640,hitekbro,"April 25, 2018",4,"Good, but can use improvement I’d like to see a feature which helps users to understand any scheduling conflicts.  If I accept Meetups at the same time, on the same day, I’d like for this to be raised to my attention as an FYI.  "
641,AndrewS.Mpls,"August 8, 2018",1,"Not very good on iPad On an iPad this is an inconvenient app. There is no landscape mode, and it has a poor use of screen space. Meetup “Badges” size is a poor choice, as screen width only fits about 1 & 2/3rds badges. It gives you the feeling of searching through a straw."
642,YKL Artist,"August 10, 2018",5,"Great app for meeting people with common interests! I have joined a three meet-up groups, and within the first week, was able to enjoy three meet ups; drawing class, meditation group, and East Asian Studies group. You can even make public comments, or message other members of the meet-up group."
643,NJ True,"August 31, 2018",4,"Events The meet up app offers a vast array of opportunities for me to meet new people and enjoy fun activities. Working full time from home does not allow me to have much friendly conversation and it is always nice to meet others for good, friendly conversation while enjoying some kind of activity other than work!"
644,CiA D.,"November 15, 2018",5,Great for travelers & entrepreneurs! Being in the military I’ve traveled a lot. It was a lifesaver when I discovered Meetup back in 2011! I was interested in connecting with fellow queens on their natural hair journey to get tips and guidance as well as hiking experts to explore the outdoors with. I’ve had some great experiences and made some wonderful connections thanks to Meetup!
645,eglantina S,"March 1, 2020",5,"I love the variety of events / activities I really enjoy this app . Whatever is your cup of tea,  rest assured you’ll find it here . Do you prefer coffee? No worries: there are lots of groups that make coffee , talk about coffee , meet at a coffee place etc . Meet all kinds of people . This side it’s actually very appropriate for introverts."
646,LCech,"November 1, 2019",5,Easy to use I’ve just started using the meetup app. I’ve used the computer program over the years and find the app easy for browsing and checking my events. Much easier than logging onto the computer.
647,Crazidesi,"October 25, 2019",4,"Great App, but Missing Key Features Both on desktop and on the phone app, it would be amazing to have an event automatically go live if you set a date and time that it should be announced. That way, you can set an event and forget about posting yourself manually if you don't have access to Internet."
648,Ruawit,"October 14, 2019",5,"Meetup Is an excellent app. that supports all kinds of meetings and events.   For regulars it is a way to always sign up.  And for those new to the event. They can find those that appeal to their interest or fields.  I have truly met some of the most inspirational, talented and heartfelt, creative  business and healing professionals at meetup events."
649,Thauros1951,"August 12, 2019",4,"Great app, but no cigar The Meetup App works flawlessly. Wish I could say as much for their billing department. Have been trying to get a refund for several months double billing for over 2 months, with no success yet. Took me a days of emailing to break past their automated response barriers to finally get connected to a (I think) live person."
650,Mental runner,"August 9, 2018",5,New to an area and finding active people The meet up app has worked fantastic as part of my relocation. Four years ago my wife and I moved halfway across the country and knew nobody. Attending meet up groups running some has helped meet some very interesting people.
651,Crankykiss1,"October 1, 2018",5,Useful app I was shocked to find this app randomly in the last year. This is the answer to my need to find like minded people and activities to get me out. The first meeting i went to was gratifying as the people were inviting and easy to be with. I also enjoyed the activity. Thanks for MeetUps!
652,chico rob,"November 3, 2018",5,MeetUp great app to stay in touch with ppl who enjoy similar things
653,ShanaK101,"December 6, 2018",5,"Making Connections Meetup is a great way to learn about activities and get togethers with people who have similar interests. It’s a great way to explore your interests, learn new things and meet people. If you have a friend or partner, it’s a great way to get out of the house together and experience something new."
654,356128,"January 19, 2019",5,Great way to meet new friends Meetup groups are a nice way to meet people who have similar interests.  A lot of people think it is a dating app.  There are singles meetups but there are many more meetup groups available.  I surprisingly felt comfortable and had a great time at my very first meetup.  Everyone was warm and welcoming.
655,Pinkicec,"July 13, 2019",5,"Met great people! This is a great app to go outside and have fun and meet new people every week. To dance, talk, connect, eat, share, and much more! I highly recommend this app to make new friends and to just go out if you don’t want to be at home. I go out to meet new people by myself and it’s great."
656,Cboz21,"July 9, 2019",5,"Great app - give it time! I’ve had the app for a while and there wasn’t a nearby group like I wanted. Recently, a new group popped up that matched my interests and I joined immediately. The app has been great for pulling the group together, helping us to get started, and getting us organized."
657,Saratoganan,"July 6, 2019",5,"Meetup app I love the app but only one problem I've had with it.  For over a month, it would just shut down immediately when I opened it.  I sent a message to have this fixed and it's working so I hope they found the issue!"
658,tattlttale,"March 7, 2020",5,Great way to meet people This app is better than the dating app. Usually people are wanting just to do things with. People aren’t alway wanting more than a friendship. This websites allow for alternative and various activities with people of same interest.
659,PaulJune15tj,"December 18, 2019",5,"Great if you are having trouble meeting people because you don’t hang out in bars Just started, but found a lot of groups with different interests of mine. Looking forward to making more friends and perhaps finding that special lady."
660,Mark B in San Diego,"December 26, 2018",4,Easy way to let them know you are coming I’m part of a volleyball group who meets once or twice a week. It is so easy to let them know I will be there with or without a guest; see who else is coming; and start a short discussion if necessary 
661,skiing zebra,"January 4, 2019",5,"Very organized You can look up meet-ups by group or date (very convenient given my varying work schedule), and puts the events you RSVPd to at the top so you know exactly what you’re going to and can easily select it to review the details. Very user friendly."
662,Sheri and Winston,"January 22, 2019",5,"Puppy training with Angela This class was just awesome!!!!  Angela is amazing - so knowledgeable and informative, and she has a wonderful kindness toward both the dogs and their owners.  My little Winston loved it as well, and in only one class he already comes and sits very well. I highly recommend this company and Angela - just fantastic ❤️"
663,Insane Nurse,"February 3, 2019",5,"Great for everyone! Great way for meeting new friends, new experiences, and new places! Due to my job I move around a lot, in the states and overseas. Was able to found great groups with same interest. Highly recommend for a traveler or someone who just wants to get out of the house."
664,LuvinCali054,"March 27, 2019",5,Best idea ever! App is dependable Meetup is THE place to meet liked minded people and make new friends. ❤️ this app! It was recommended to me when I moved to a new area so I could get to know people. It has been 7 years now and we are still friends :) Step out of your comfort zone & Get connected!
665,Valerie LS,"November 23, 2019",5,"Meetup app This is a user friendly app that helps with making real in person connections with people in your area with similar interests, goals. etc. increasing your sense of belonging as well as opportunity to improve the community in which you live in."
666,Roy Allen Stagg,"October 30, 2019",5,"Great App for meeting & making new friends Love Meetup!  It is a great app for meeting and making new friends.  Just joined and already had a great discussion about art, collaboration, societal influence and more with fellow creatives, went to a premier of a new film not yet released, and have joined with other singles to help the homeless with food and clothing."
667,BillionaireBoss,"September 29, 2019",5,Hyped up on meetups I love the interface and functionality of the app. It makes it easy to find groups that I want to connect with and network with for future endeavors. I’ve met some pretty awesome people through this interface and it’s awesome to connect with like minded humans.
668,skakani1,"August 17, 2019",5,Perfect title Meetup is awesome in various different ways. Variety it brings to the table is unbelievable. I can meet group of people related to my profession as well as related to the game like Tennis. If you spend some time you can save lot of money for example going to boot camps etc .. I m enjoying it 😍😍😍
669,J Nuila,"July 1, 2019",5,Went to my first meeting! I've had the app for a long time and never went because of my anxiety. Finally got the courage to just go and it was a great time. The app is well laid out and if you're in a city you should have lots of options for groups.
670,MOMSClubSC,"May 7, 2018",1,"I wish I didn’t need this This is the worst, most glitchy app ever. I have to delete it and reinstall it EVERY time I use it. It is very frustrating when trying to keep a group of 50+ members organized. I once loved it when I started using it about 3 years ago. Since then, every update has gotten worse and becomes less user friendly each time. I actually have to give a tutorial for new members of our group on how to use it and they usually just give up. FIT IT ALREADY!!!"
671,jcfried,"May 31, 2018",3,"Functional but needs work Searches work most of the time, but sometimes they don’t and I have no idea what I’ve done wrong in choosing a particular search word or phrase. I recently added a comment that I needed to correct, but there isn’t a way to edit comments. There is no way I can find to change the announcing text of a Meetup I own for ALL occurrences, only one at a time."
672,Golfgayle,"August 16, 2018",5,Moved from New York I just moved to Houston from New York not knowing really anyone but my family. This has helped meet some incredible people here plus getting active in the community.
673,TTaylor401603,"September 11, 2018",5,"Great to find new activities and groups This app is great to find people outside of your current circle they have the same interests as you. Not only that you can find events, seminars and a lot of different activities that aren’t always easy to find."
674,KaylaJB,"October 8, 2018",5,Great way to meet new people I really enjoy this app. It’s easy to use and it’s a great way to meet new people with similar interest. As a Meetup organizer I find this app to be very efficient when’s it comes to setting up a meetup and keeping up with all the comments a details surround the meetup.
675,Jamn j,"October 29, 2018",5,"Meetup Great ap for connecting with likeminded people.  Whether you’re new in town or would like to find others to hang out with, go to a movie, or have dinner companions— this is the site to find out important info!  Check it out, there is something for everyone😀"
676,nashgirl007,"November 3, 2018",4,"Great way to make friends! The app is a great concept the only reason it lost a star is because the conversation piece on the app is really annoying. It doesn’t load new messages like a text, you have to exit the conversation, then go back in and scroll all the say down every time there is a new comment"
677,BrassDude,"November 13, 2018",5,"Great Way to Organize Groups Meetup is a great way to organize a group of like minded people.  The organization and app are created in a way to secure personal information. After each session, you will he asked if you felt welcomed.  I really enjoy the group I found.  Thank you!"
678,staceykelso,"December 8, 2018",5,Great way to find fun things to do The Meetup app offers a simply way to find fun activities and or groups to hangout with. I use this app to stay connected with my current two walking groups as well as for looking into new groups that I might want to join.
679,F Hogue,"March 4, 2020",5,Love This App! This Meetup app is very well-designed. Very user-friendly and makes life so much easier to signup for workshops and local events and allows one to get a glimpse of what’s happening in San Diego! Great way to meet interesting people who share your social interests and find like-minded friends.
680,Mark&Lynn,"March 3, 2020",5,"James River Hikers Being new to Richmond my wife and I wanted to get involved in a group that would allow us to meet new people while learning about our adopted city. James River Hikers fulfills our needs, great groups of people that share our yearnings for history coupled with exercise and camaraderie."
681,Migustaasi,"February 25, 2020",5,Instead of walking up to strangers... I don’t have an issue walking up to strangers.  But sometimes strangers don’t like it.  This allows me to meet my next friend without having to randomly strike up a convo at the store - my kids are constantly reminding me to not talk to strangers. 🤔✌🏼
682,Not a fitness geek,"February 12, 2020",5,"Awesome Can find anything you would like to do. The people in the groups I’ve attended are open and welcoming. The app works great and I’ve never had a glitch. You get reminders, directions and can view past, current or future events."
683,Kimmipie21,"February 8, 2020",5,Great way to explore new interests The app is great because before joining a group you can see how many others have joined and how active the group is. I’ve joined two groups so far and enjoyed both. The app makes it very easy to organize events.
684,Cantu2656,"February 7, 2020",5,Great connections I have been met an amazing group of women that do various activities. So many different walks of life coming together enjoying each other company. I would have never made so many friends and experienced great adventures if it weren’t for the app!!
685,x13Sam,"February 6, 2020",2,"Kinda lame on an Ipad I guess it would be okay for phone-only use. Annoying as hell on an Ipad, because it's locked at portrait angle - so if you're using a tablet, especially one with a detachable keyboard, it's ridiculous. And locked at a phone size and ratio. Give people the ability to rotate the app, it's nonsensical to have it locked like this. "
686,Smooshed strawberry,"January 21, 2020",5,"Easy to use Easy to browse for new groups, chat in events/discussions, and join events. Sends a moderate amount of notifications in groups which is kinda of odd. I use this a few times a week to look and for very basic use it’s great!"
687,Lambda2walk,"November 4, 2019",5,"Excellent interface and notification platform Very nicely done app. Easy to you, change reservations, and note upcoming events. Also get notifications through Stock and G Calendar along with functionality for other planning apps."
688,Tica1980,"October 30, 2019",5,Something for everyone This app is fantastic for connecting with people who share common interests. I check in every few weeks because there are always new groups and activities available.
689,photograhywalk,"October 8, 2019",5,"Meetup helps me with opportunities As a woman I have been able to find groups for photography and outdoor activities that because they are out far enough, at dark, or in the depths of the city I might not do on my own. I have also met nice people with similar interests."
690,BeautifulHB,"January 27, 2019",5,Meet up experience Thanks to meet up... I have met many incredible people and I have had opportunities to continue to grow my circle of like minded people and professionals. I definitely recommend you give it a try and experience something new. 
691,K1nglew,"February 8, 2019",5,Great This app is very useful and a great way for me to stay connected with individuals who share the same interest and mindset that I have. It’s been a great resources for me to find groups that fit my interest and I otherwise would have done hours of research to find. This is app is awesome!
692,Stewmania,"February 22, 2019",5,Meetup is a great App for networking I found Meetup about 8 years ago and have used mainly for business networking. But it has been very helpful for other social events like the 2019 VegFest. It is an easy way to setup reminders for local events in my area. I highly recommend it!
693,CCCBerquist,"February 26, 2019",5,"Wonderful opportunity to make new friends! A great setup for starting and joining in on gatherings of like minded folks. If you have an interest, a hobby or activity you want to share with others, you’ll be sure to find a group within Meetup. If not , start your own Meetup!"
694,ms veganista,"February 27, 2019",5,Nice! So many interest! We can search for what we are interested in and join to meet and socialize with others with same interest.
695,HoneyLavender,"March 5, 2019",5,Hiking I haven’t had a chance to go hiking yet but I like the fact that it’s offered. I do hope to start soon. I love to hike so I’m excited to start again. It’s wonderful that I have the opportunity to view the hikes that are available. I love the outdoors and nature. Thank you for this app.
696,J Bisono,"March 9, 2019",5,Meetup App This app is fantastic. I am able to connect and network with different groups. It’s also helped me create many connections needed for my business. If your looking to network this is the app if your looking to grow your group this is the app.
697,Very accomodating!,"March 31, 2019",5,Effortless way to meet people What a great way to meet others who share your same interests. Get involved in whatever you like and take a pass on the rest. So many options to choose from! Great for someone new to an area or recently on their own.
698,Frock this,"July 8, 2019",4,There’s something for everyone With the groups that I’ve found I’ve been able to connect with a network of individuals like myself; that alone makes it worth it! Wasn’t sure if there were others out there who like to do what I do but I guess there’s a group for everyone.
699,audreyalice09,"July 7, 2019",5,"Great app for newcomers and branching out I am growing weary of social media, but not this app! Finally a way to get back to meeting in person for fun and social activities. This is the answer to our issues with the rise of the internet. So far it’s had no technical issues for me as well."
700,Lov'n Fun,"August 18, 2018",5,Finally! Getting joining a group with common interests is easy. Finally! I’ve been trying to get people together to play games I like for years. Now I can just join an existing group and not have to do all the work of getting people to show up.
701,E rider,"October 6, 2018",5,Nice really nice This app gives you the privilege to meet people doing the same thing you want in your community I really give this app 100 stars. Because I moved to a new neighborhood and I had no friends or anything to do this app made it really easy to feel at home
702,BhartiSharma,"October 6, 2018",5,The only reason I have friends I moved to a new town and couldn’t find a way to meet like minded people. Meetups helped me finally find friends and gives me an opportunity to learn from people who have been involved in these activities for a long time.
703,Spyted,"November 2, 2018",5,"First time This is the first time I’ve used this app and I am very pleased with it.  I was a little unsure how the actual meetup would go, but I found it very pleasant.  The app is very helpful in not just finding meetups, but the added features of sharing and integration with my calendar is very nice."
704,BabsStGeorge,"November 9, 2018",5,Handy to Have I had problems with the app at first but I had learned that it is a way of communicating if I get lost!
705,Racerx90,"January 5, 2019",5,Perfect Great app for group/events.  Easy to keep updated for events/gatherings.  
706,Sklifosofskii,"January 13, 2019",5,"Good idea I like the whole idea but downloading pictures is hard, too slow, you never know right away if it is happening or not. Later I can see if they downloaded, or not. I give 5 stars in advance hoping it will improve."
707,Supremema83,"March 21, 2020",4,Good app but here is some suggestions It’s a very good app and i like it very much 
708,Hhgdfngf,"February 25, 2020",5,"FUN It’s a super way of meeting new people. Everyone is so friendly & kind. Discovering some great local musicians & food in the area. I’ve been developing some quality friendships through the different meetings. Lastly, I’m getting out & enjoying life more with this new set of friends."
709,SturtMcGurt,"January 21, 2020",5,Great way to network Started working immediately to improve my network. Found a bunch of nerds just like me who work in the same field and these groups have it going on! Thanks for making this such a breeze with your app.
710,TikaleSahil,"May 7, 2019",5,Keeps me updated and provides new suggestions Great app to keep up with the intellectual arena in the city like Boston where there is so much activity and congregation around.  different interest areas. 
711,Leeism2020,"January 12, 2020",5,Always a great meeting spot I have had great experiences through this app for years all over the US! I recommend it to anyone looking to stay motivated and connected. Just be safe and ask questions when you join a group. 🥰🥰
712,JohnnyPooPmouth,"December 11, 2019",5,"Perfect for meeting new people I just moved to a new city without knowing anyone. This app is a huge reason why I have a group of friends to hang out with now. Meeting people with similar interests as an adult is difficult to do, this app makes it a lot easier!"
713,dnt240,"November 7, 2019",5,Great App! I love using meetup. I have joined many groups and have made so many friends through it. A few months ago I made a group for dog lovers in my area and have had many great experiences through that and not only am I making friends but my dog is too!
714,Crystal Flower Phantom,"October 22, 2019",5,"Good stuff! Wonderful way to meet like minded people and a wonderful way to get out, get active and most importantly, to not feel lonely!!! It’s great for both young adults, middle agers and I would think, perfect for lonely elderly people!!! So glad I joined meetup so long ago. You don’t have to live life feeling lonely!!!"
715,T. A. Metz,"October 12, 2019",5,Grateful Due to my job I have lived in 6 cities in 2 years. I finally found Meetup and have already connected with a hiking group of women and made new friends. Being in a new city all the time can be very hard but this has helped me have a social life.
716,Dallas bhaskar,"August 7, 2019",5,"Smart, intuitive and convenient I just heard from a friend about this app. From downloading and making my choices it was just a breeze."
717,joe65490-098,"July 8, 2019",5,Meet up I am newly divorced after 22 years. I love people but was married to a person who did not like to be around people   At 52 I find myself alone and wanting to socialize but not at the younger bar scene.   Meetup is a great way for me to meet new people and find my voice.   Thank you
718,Sailul,"June 28, 2019",5,"App improved from before App improved over the years. I can do everything from app as Website. I am able to see the new and past meetups, rate them after attending, message others in meetup. Thanks for improving the app!!"
719,Jazzynfly504,"June 25, 2019",5,"Hopelessly in Boston! Been here for 3 yrs almost but this year started looking for venues to join. Meetup has been my life saver. Thanks to Meetup I am playing volleyball, met new friends possibly joining a movie goer group! Next adventure will be to find a spades game team of people. Thanks for adding a little adventure and excitement! ❤️"
720,Longhorn 83,"August 11, 2018",5,"Indispensable app for professional education & networking I use the Meetup app all the time. It helps me keep track of the many professional activities going on in the Austin, TX area. I find it indispensable for keeping my professional development active, and I recommend the app to everyone."
721,Mlle. Me,"August 17, 2018",5,Curious? Do you enjoy learning new things? Do you abhor boredom? ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
722,VG2512,"August 21, 2018",4,"Fun App ! Was looking to find some people to play tennis with after moving to a new city. Came across the Meetup app and found a really good bunch of people to play tennis and now we have become a regular bunch. Besides tennis and other sports, you can find wide range of groups to join depending on your interests. Also app is very easy to use."
723,Rose81569,"August 22, 2018",5,"Wonderful opportunities This is a really great way of getting out into the world and finding like minded people! Been to some amazing events and can easily find clubs, groups, and classes of things I am interested in. Wonderful passion people and fun things to do. Highly recommend!!"
724,AveAnt,"November 6, 2018",4,"A strong start in a new city. I’m new to Brooklyn, it’s been less than a week since moving from the Mid-West. Establishing connections with local communities always takes time and can often be unpredictable. With this app, I’m looking forward to an LGBTQ support group, drawing classes, and volunteer work. The Meetup app is great for establishing local connections."
725,Generalaesthetic,"November 9, 2018",5,"So far, so fun It seems pretty fun, and I’m enjoying it, but the app itself seems a little confusing because there are times when I reply and I get a prompt that says “invalid member” when I’m pretty sure I got “accepted”. Hopefully I’ll just get used to it and get better at it."
726,Moewynn,"March 9, 2019",5,Makes Meeting New People Easier I like to call myself a homebody and introvert. When I discovered meetup I didn’t know what to expect. Each time I go out with the groups I’ve joined I have an amazing time. It makes meeting people easier. Everyone has been so welcoming.
727,Sugarfairie,"March 14, 2019",5,Great App I’ve been using this app for about three years now. It centralizes and filters the events that are most relevant to me. I love that you can look through the attendees list and see if a familiar face is registered for the event. I also love that you can DM them. Its a great tool for networking.
728,Twiggy 1975,"April 22, 2019",5,"Great way to get out and meet people Tons of groups and opportunities to meet people. It’s as effective as you are willing to step out of your comfort zone. So get out there and meet new people, find groups that you have common interests in and just show up. Easy as that!!"
729,Unka Randy,"May 3, 2019",5,It’s good for a majority of people This is a great app for a vast majority of people. 
730,Kaiaim,"May 15, 2018",1,"Incredibly hard to navigate The information that this app needs to convey is really simple: A list of groups, the meetings associated with them, and the ones you belong too. It seems to have taken almost an intentional decision to make it so unintuitive to get around. Even when I get to places that are in theory where I want to be (the list of my groups for example) there’s no rhyme or reason to how they’re organized and There are always some that seem to be missing or somehow buried."
731,Jun Blaze,"December 22, 2019",3,"Pretty good but..... I like MeetUp. However, the current iPhone app does not allow me to Mark an event as not attending anymore unless I receive notification about it through email. Also I cannot decline membership to a group I run with an explanation. I have to use the full website to do it which is inconvenient if I have the app."
732,Glenn342674,"November 19, 2019",5,Intellectual Conversation Group One of the most intellectually inspiring group discussions available.  Great way to spend quality time when you can leave a discussion feeling empowered with more knowledge than when you arrived.  Learning is powerful and addictive.
733,JulianneOOOO,"September 18, 2019",5,Great for meeting people I have created multiple groups on meetup and they are all flourishing. The app is really easy to use and always functions properly. Highly recommend for people trying to make new friends with similar interests.
734,latinlover,"September 6, 2019",5,Great App Love this app for my phone. Not so great on my tablet as it has trouble adjusting for whatever reason. But the phone access helps out with navigation and messaging and photos of the event etc. Amazing! You can even find groups in other states And countries.
735,Zigma Tax Service,"September 6, 2019",5,"More Active Than Ever I’ve been wanting to play tennis for a while, I left my hometown and moved to a city where I was not familiar with any court or with any players. I found a group right away and was able to practice and enjoy a recreational time with some fellow aficionados! Love this app!"
736,Pom and Prague Ratter Lover,"August 15, 2019",5,Meetup I have been a member for over 10 years. This is a great way to meet people with similar interest. Safe and easy!  Signup and show up is all it requires.  Met some wonderful people. I have used it to attend events throughout the US when traveling for work.
737,Sinoeuth,"July 30, 2019",5,"never had the feeling i was alone anymore This app has many benefits for everyone who has an interest in sharing experiences together, even someone as anti-social as I had been for quite awhile reap the benefits of small get togethers. I feel safe with this app."
738,TGoodsell,"July 23, 2019",5,Meetup is awesome! I love you that it categorizes groups based on your location and interests. I’m most excited about the types of groups that are even available! The messaging system opens up communication and you can create or join a group easily!
739,dnewkid,"July 11, 2019",4,This app connects people! I am a member of a very active hiking group and this app has made it possible. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I am not getting notifications for when events are posted. I used to but for some reason they stopped coming a year ago.
740,aviaator,"September 19, 2018",4,"APP BLOAT! Like many apps, Meetup suffers from app bloat. What once was a manageable download has now become a 342MB monstrosity. Developers seem to think that modern apps must be a Swiss Army knife of capabilities for all users. Focus on the core needs of 80% of users, let the rest of the features fall on the website, and get this thing down to around 100MB where it belongs."
741,kimboshah,"October 26, 2018",5,Good experiences I moved to a new area and this has been a great way to meet new people with the same interests. The layout is good and I like that you can message through the app and not have to give out personal info until you are ready to.
742,Litzy1,"January 7, 2019",5,"Started with a 5 mile walk First 5 mile walk on moonlight beach with Hiking Addicts and it was fun. Large group came out, people were friendly, walking and talking the two hours flew by. Easy group to connect with. Looking forward to going on hikes and getting to know people."
743,trina.been,"February 12, 2019",5,Always Good It has been a great way to find people and activities to do in the area since my fiancé and I moved. We are not very extroverted people and just go out and do something random-we like having plans and Meet Up is a great way to have that.
744,abigail9609,"May 30, 2019",1,"Account Disabled, Meetup ignores my request for help!!! When I try to login to my account, I get an error message saying my account has been disabled. I have followed the steps several times to open a ticket and I have never received a response from Meetup Support. I am extremely frustrated that my requests have been ignored. Meanwhile, I cannot access any features on Meetup. Did all the Meetup customer support agents quit or something? It’s been two weeks and I haven’t heard anything."
745,Gratunzel,"June 26, 2019",5,Great for introverts! I don’t like putting myself out there with company I don’t know very well but this app has given me the opportunity to branch out to meet new people that at least have my same interests!
746,TeLaE,"June 19, 2019",5,"There is something for everyone! This is one of the best ways to meet new (or even old) friends whether you’re new to the LA area, or you’ve been here for awhile. Find something you like, or want to try for the first time, get out there and have fun!"
747,suzitunes...,"June 15, 2019",5,"Still the Best Meetup is still the best platform for finding your tribe. And, it’s easy to be an organizer and put out there whatever it is you want to find. I’ve always enjoyed events I’ve participated in and meet open, friendly people too."
748,YazzieLove,"June 15, 2019",5,Great App!! Perfect. Just wish I could attend the events more often. My work schedule doesn’t allow for me to attend of the events I’d like to on the app but is is still nice to learn about new places in Columbus to visit later. Great app for joining groups and for communicating about events.
749,Roland³,"June 12, 2019",5,"Dope App. Great for finding things to do in your city whether it be business or personal! Grow your business, find travel buddies. Might even find some people to play dodgeball with in you’re into that kind of thing (Denver’s got a dodgeball club). Download the app. You’ll be happy"
750,Catchows,"May 28, 2018",2,Not user friendly I wish I could click rsvp to see what it is I rsvp for. Sometimes I forget to add to calendar and can't go back. I have to click every group I'm in to check the events to see if I rsvp for them. Annoying
751,KCxStealth,"July 6, 2018",5,"Amazing way to make friends If you are moving to a new city, I highly recommend downloading this app. It is perfect for trying new things and connection with people who share similar interests. 10/10 would meet up again."
752,CianneMcG,"August 11, 2018",4,So happy to have found this app I’m new to meet up but I am enjoying it and look forward to making new friends. My only critique would be that it’s difficult for us to ask each other questions and write back-and-forth but maybe I just haven’t learned how to do that yet.
753,Titlemama,"August 26, 2018",5,"Organized Great app, easy to use and understand.  Managing information is well done and ability to move in and out makes this app a great resource and way to meet people interested in the same things that I am interested in!"
754,Laizsa_mehn,"January 25, 2020",5,Networking Opportunities ! This app is amazing. I love all the events that I find on here. I meet AMAZING people. Learn so much new things! It great! I’ve only used it for one month and I’m constantly looking for events to meet up with new people to connect and gain more knowledge in topics that I’m interested in. 💙
755,Dayejah,"January 14, 2020",5,Meet Up I love this app because it’s a great way to get yourself out there and network with a variety of people from different backgrounds and businesses. You never know who you will meet that might just change your life!!!!
756,simplyaps,"December 26, 2019",1,"Wont load After using the meet up app for months it won't load anymore. Only get a message saying “Sorry, somethings gone wrong. Please try again later.” Ive uninstalled it and downloaded it again on my iphone 7 numerous times. I messaged support on 12/14. I heard back in the form of an auto reply stating that the Community Support Team would be in touch ASAP. Nothing. Still cant access anything but I continue to get emails about events from my numerous groups. Totally lame."
757,OldLadyGadgetQueen,"December 20, 2019",5,Great for Connecting Meetup has helped me find people that like to do the same things I do. That made my move to DC so much easier; it is otherwise hard to find like-minded friends when one works long hours during the week.
758,DJSJD11,"December 7, 2019",5,"Opens new horizons Never before would I have found the opportunity to see a free piano concert at the Austrian embassy.  That and so much more are now highlighted and easy to join, for low to no cost. "
759,jason b belmont nc,"November 1, 2019",5,Easy to use and get started Downloaded the app and was already finding things to do and places to go within a few minutes. There was so much more organized to do in Charlotte than I thought!
760,Gma Marsh,"January 15, 2019",5,Stay Connected I wasn’t knowing what was happening on meetup till I got the app! The App so easy to manage and find the groups your interested in and being able to join them. Get the App so you can make new friends and have a blast!
761,MJ420024,"January 21, 2019",4,Great app but one improvement I love the app and what it offers the only thing I would like is a little better organization. It can be a little cluttered and disorganized to me. Maybe not a feed style but some other format. But that’s the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars but otherwise great. Reminders are great.
762,mrssheffler,"April 26, 2019",5,Great way to connect with people in a new community! I recently moved from the Midwest to the east coast and used Meetup to start a book club and a running club. It has been a great way to meet people in my new community. So glad to have this as an option!!
763,J Scr AFA,"April 27, 2019",5,Buddhist teachings at AFA gallery in Scranton. Our teacher provides us with many new ideas for achieving a better life for ourselves and achieving better relationships with others. I have found ways to enjoy universal love for other beings as well as appreciating the idea of loving myself.
764,La mi to,"May 17, 2019",5,"Incredible hosts! the two hosts were extremely welcoming and created a wonderful atmosphere. A very friendly warm meeting. The nakedness wasn’t really needed, because the personalities outshined the night. Was expecting a sexual experience and found something even more interesting"
765,Maggie Anaya,"May 24, 2019",5,Long time user This app has been great. In my experience I have relocated to a few states for work and meetup has always been a great platform to meet new people. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for local groups and events.
766,Sbstaples,"July 7, 2019",5,"Great app to find out what is going on I have to say that this group is fabulous! Letting me know where and when other like minded people are getting together. I have made friends, learned about others, and now have a full calendar!"
767,CassSMB,"July 6, 2019",5,Meet app A must app for any networker. 
768,Rho2.O,"June 15, 2019",3,White  only no Meetup I have Apple SE I can not see  anything just  white screen no nothing.   Nothing to transfer to my calendar I am missing events  Baaaddd for me since I organize. Did you terminated my phone with all the fancy new updates? ?????New  up date still white screen.  Every time you up deleted white screen  new version will not load.  Now I have no Meetup HELP!!!!!
769,porkchop54354,"June 14, 2019",5,Great app It’s really refreshing to use an app that’s to meet people in your area! I’ll use this app to find an activity to get out of the house and to meet new friends especially since I just moved to a new state. You’ll be able to meet like-minded people!
770,CarmelSan,"June 15, 2018",1,Latest update took us backwards So disappointed in what was once a smooth running and easy to use app. Now I can’t log in and if I try to exclusively use the site via chrome/safari and want to send a message to our guests it pushes me back to the app and I can’t get it to log-on so end up not being able to manage guests and meetups. Wish they would work harder to get the glitches out if this version and make this once again a lm actual management tool.
771,RabidAlienz,"July 5, 2018",4,"Helps me keep up w activities I’ve been on Meetup for years now and the app helps me stay connected to questions/updates happening for individual events, or make certain whose coming etc."
772,Bassnhauz,"August 12, 2018",5,"Easy and effective I love this app!! I just moved to NY and found a ton of friends. I found a group for frisbee and softball a group for clubbing, a group for Chinese, and that was just 3 weeks! So easy to use and would totally recommend if you like doing stuff and meeting like minded people."
773,Max!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"November 13, 2018",5,Good at making new friends! Really helpful in meeting new people. I just moved cross county and was looking for a way to meet new people outside of work and this definitely helped! There were a lot of groups for young people who had just moved so it was kinda perfect.
774,Frustrated Fons,"December 19, 2018",1,Unable to Edit Profile I created my account before my recent move to the gulf coast. Since then I have been unable to change my information to reflect my relocation so the app and service is completely useless to me. Anytime I go to edit my info the app immediately crashes and when I try to access via a web browser the  option isn’t provided to me since I’m accessing the info on a mobile device 😑. Come on. It shouldn’t be this difficult.
775,laughsoutloud,"December 30, 2018",5,Great way to recharge your artistic self If you took a few art courses way back or if you are currently into art and need more practice this is a great opportunity recharge or expand your practice. It’s a chance to draw humans and be drawn by humans and improve or explore at your own pace
776,Yo slap happy grandpappy,"January 6, 2019",5,"Great for Big Cities I used to live in a smaller city, and this app was all but useless. But find yourself a nice group in a major city and then it really shines! I’ve been using in for weeks nonstop now and I’ve met a lot of people and get to pass my free time with activities I enjoy."
777,wariopuff,"January 12, 2020",5,Actually surprised I do not like social media or social anything really. One day I got over myself and tried this ap. I was pleasantly surprised to find so many others with same interest who just kinda wanna stare at you and move their mouths. I like it
778,Psalm143:10,"January 4, 2020",5,Easy to use The app is easy to use and explore. Nice to be able to have events auto-added to your calendar and also to be able to directly upload pictures if wanted.
779,dancin peep,"December 2, 2019",5,Meet up groups for dance Hi we just formatted a meet up group for salsa and hustle dance.. we gather once or twice a week in different locations... I am so impressed with the draw and support we get from this app. We have been able to strengthen and grow our dance community
780,littlejnz,"April 25, 2019",5,Great place to foster new friendships Any interest you have it’s here.  You can join a group and go out by yourself.  The organizers are always welcoming and supportive of new members.  Try it!  Most are free or charge a minimal annual fee.  Any charges for events are advised beforehand and you can pay using PayPal.
781,flaGemGoddess,"April 28, 2019",5,"Meet up has helped me When I moved to Florida three years ago I didn’t know anybody. Someone suggested beat up? So I went to a couple of events and I stood around in the corner to staring and not engaging! LOL. Those days are over I recommend it highly, why waste time!"
782,Shedrumz,"September 20, 2019",5,Austin Drumz Community Drum Circle Excellent app! Highly recommend it for gathering folks together with special interests!very simple and easy to navigate and it really brings in the people! I really appreciate it a lot and feel it has been a great contributor in  building our community!
783,Laketa3,"September 20, 2019",5,New to a city? This is your app I found this app when I moved to a new city and it has provided safe events around my interests. I’ve made new friends. I stay entertained with all of the options it offers. I also network and learn new skills. Love this app.
784,MugsyMGB,"September 18, 2019",5,Great way to acclimate to a new city Have relocated twice from my DC base in the last year. Once to San Diego and the other to Mobile AL. Meetup has been invaluable in getting connected in both communities and finding people interested in the same activities and hobbies as me. Great app!
785,Purplish,"September 17, 2019",5,"Meetup This is the perfect social app. I left the media part out because you actually use this app to go out! It's great. Whatever you're into, you'll be able to find a group or start one, that addresses your interests and celebrates them."
786,practical potter,"August 27, 2019",5,"The Meet Up App works very well Helps me keep organized, find new events, sign up for them and remind me of the event and the details. Let’s you know who you will expect to see there, thus helping you know their name and ultimately getting to know them."
787,mpwinter,"August 6, 2019",5,Great way to broaden your horizons! The app is very user friendly. You can check on any events happening in your area or check out only the ones you are a member of. It’s easy to send and receive messages with the app too. Love this!
788,Frenchfry Fashionista,"June 24, 2019",5,Meet people doing the things you love!! I downloaded the app when my husband and I moved and it was a great way to meet people doing the things we love. We have met some truly amazing people and have had some great experiences we will never forget.
789,hobbes8calvn,"June 18, 2019",2,"App keeps getting worse Everything is cached wrong. I get notifications about new comments or photos uploaded, so I click and see nothing updated. Oops you have to manually pull down to refresh, such a bad UX."
790,Dylan Savoury,"August 12, 2018",5,"Meeting people with similar interests I really enjoy the meetup app. I was able to meet people that I normally would encounter online, in person. When I attend these meet ups everyone is  welcoming and positive. It’s a great atmosphere with liked minded individuals. Using the meetup app reminds me that I am not alone🙂."
791,MPE777,"August 13, 2018",5,"Meetup is a great tool. My only issue is that notifications don’t update frequently enough, so sometimes even though the app is not showing any notifications from the outside, once I open it I find several."
792,AprilR16,"August 20, 2018",5,Way better than the desktop version Whenever I am on the desktop version I am constantly logged off or told I cannot RSVP etc but so far the app is great and isn’t having any of those technical issues.
793,Henduism,"September 26, 2018",5,"Very Happy Highly recommend MeetUp as a way to connect with good people, usually doing the same things you enjoy and/or exposing you as the user to new things, activities and events you wouldn’t otherwise participate in or know about.  "
794,Mindset55,"October 14, 2018",5,"Great way to connect interests to community. I just finished recommending it to a young man who is trying to find his way in Chester County. He mentioned that he likes to play Cricket and I thought, well if there’s not a Meet Up for it he could start one! I have found great satisfaction with the Valley Forge National Park Alliance Tuesday Trail Walks."
795,Scotslad007,"November 23, 2018",1,"IPad, only works on Portrait, not Landscape? For this reason ALONE this app shows a lack of effort to be current.  App is obviously not actively worked on and if this is the case will drift into obscurity, which is disappointing as it had potential.  Still potential is a beginning and somebody will fill this space with app that is actively working on bringing groups of like minded people together on current devices that offer such basic functionality as flipping from portrait to landscape?"
796,Matza Ball,"December 21, 2018",4,Inconvenient It's hard to get to future events. It takes a long time to get to the date you need or even to find the particular group you want to look up. There should be a search feature to let you look up specific dates.
797,Alexios10,"January 10, 2019",3,"Wish there wasn’t a fee For something as organic as new connections amongst people and human interaction, would be nice if there wasn’t a 15 dollar fee just to create a group. I’m thinking of just creating my own group on Facebook with the same concept since that’s free. Beautiful concept. The cost is not so much, maybe even if it was cheaper I wouldn’t rate it 3 stars. But hey it is what it is."
798,Kelli BE,"January 12, 2019",3,"In theory In theory this is a great app - organizers form communities around various interests, and people meet in public to discuss or take part in activities in which they share a common interest."
799,Daves1975,"April 6, 2019",5,It’s good way to meet new people Never heard of Meetup until I joined a group at church that likes the outsides. I have met new people and have done things that I hear people talking about. I am not someone who does not like doing stuff by myself. I like a good way get out there.
800,pammysteiny,"April 28, 2020",4,Great communication vehicle I’ve found this app overall easy to use. One improvement would be to include a link to the sender rather than have to go to the website to look up the info.  Maybe just highlight the senders name with a link to their email address.
801,Jonnyhavs,"March 6, 2020",5,Meetup So glad I finally got involved. The only way you can get out of your house (and your comfort zone) is to try something new—or something you already know you enjoy—with new people. Meetup makes that possible!
802,Hood'lum 2013,"February 6, 2020",5,Great App!!! If you are trying to get out there and meet new people and see new places for little to no cost this app does exactly that. Its a very simple and easy app to use. In my opinion this is one of the best apps out there for people needing to get out of the house!
803,knojd,"January 3, 2020",1,"Poor customer service + “spam filters” make it impossible for use app properly I ran into multiple issues due the their “spam filters” erroneously flagging me as a spammer. I had help desk tickets open for literally 5 or 6 months. The only why I got a response was by repeatedly harassing the Meetup Support twitter account. When I finally did get a response, they acknowledged I did nothing wrong but that there was nothing they could do to override the spam filter. Ridiculous."
804,ScifiPrincess09,"December 21, 2019",5,"Meetup is Awesome I can’t tell you how helpful this app has been in my life. After moving to a new city, I quickly found like minded people for group outings in several hobbies! It is easy to use and there are a lot of others on the app!"
805,climbing susan,"December 2, 2019",5,Social networking I truly adore meetup.  It has served me well for 15 years.  It’s a great resource to network with people with similar interest and it has truly saved my life a couple of times that I can recall.  I encourage everyone to take advantage to this resource and help it grow.
806,Fructoid,"November 28, 2019",3,"Great service, mediocre app I love meetup and depend upon it. I’m grateful that it exists. The app and web page suffer from usability issues that continually frustrate me, an avid app user. It is slow to load and unintuitive. I do appreciate the apparent commitment to constancy represented by the slow rate of change in the app/page - this is not a backhanded complement - but perhaps major change is called for."
807,Ryebead29,"November 18, 2019",5,"Get out and become something I’ve been to two great Meet-ups in my area.  If your struggling in trying to get your business start, being a new mom, deal with school it’s a meet-up for you. Your community is here to help you grow."
808,Lady1718yess,"October 28, 2019",1,"Failure to address inappropriate sexual message Very cool app and I’ve enjoyed the groups I’ve found on here. Will continue to use app. However, I recently was sent a sexually inappropriate message by someone in a group and addressed it with group leader and it was resolved in that way. I also emailed meetup about this disgusting incident and there was no response. About a week later I followed up again. Disappointed that they did not respond about this or address this issue."
809,Victorious-Jesus,"September 13, 2019",5,"Great meet and do! My wife has been using this app longer than I have, I’m new to it but have been enjoying the benefits of it through her."
810,Sineponoy,"May 22, 2019",3,Idea good app okay Location settings should be able to change more flexible on the app. Especially a change in the distance to places. Can I even change my distance from the app? Everytime I clicked on something I had to search all over again instead of starting where I ended. But I like the app besides that.
811,Teni F,"August 8, 2019",4,"Good, but Notifications need tweaking I’ve had a great time using Meetup to coordinate with groups in the area. My only complaint is that I’m notified when new groups start, even if I only want notifications about the groups I’m currently in. It’s only a minor inconvenience, but one I think is worth addressing."
812,ShellyinSeattlearea,"August 4, 2019",5,Works as intended I’ve tried three meetups and indeed have met people who share my interests each time.  Everyone is very open to newcomers though you do get out what you put in.  So be open to new experiences and new people who differ from you.
813,Ms.Reluctant Tweeter,"August 3, 2019",2,"No calendar?? The app is still steps behind what it used to be in terms of functionality. Please bring back basic functions - like allowing users to search for events by date. If someone is only free 5 days from now, why would you make them scroll through all the days prior to find an event? Not user-friendly."
814,Drawnats,"July 30, 2019",5,"Very helpful I have found the MeetUp app to be super helpful for browsing meetup’s, conversations, and even some emergency communication on one particular meetup hike where we did not have peoples phone numbers but we were able to communicate via the Meetup app."
815,GrannieU,"July 27, 2019",5,Magnificent Meetups This app is an invaluable tool to assist you in personal growth and relationship building. I have never had one single problem with this app as a user and it is widely used. I highly recommend you make it part of your event planning!
816,KaysevenJay,"July 25, 2019",5,"Great Way To Meet This app has been a great way to get out and meet local people of like minds and common interest. It felt weird at first, but strangers can turn to friends in a very short time. I have been so blessed to meet so many music lovers, thanks meet up."
817,Djs302,"July 14, 2019",5,"Easy to Use I approached this type of app existing, makes it easier to meet locals with similar interest under one location. The simplicity in helping to find new things to try with other people."
818,Usotsuki1383953,"July 4, 2019",5,"Great app, works fine on my IPhone. This really is a great app. Enter your interests and search for groups of things you're interested in. Perfect way to find people to play sports, games, or go hiking with with; just about any activity. Highly recommended."
819,Wildzebra,"June 12, 2019",5,"A great place to meet people that share your interests So far a great app for all kinds of activities and hobbies in groups whether it is photography, hiking, language meet ups, dancing, single meet ups. Not a dating app but you can meet people that share your interests"
820,Nisey7,"October 23, 2018",5,I’ve built a good business with this meet up app When I moved across country from Tucson to Atlanta I was starting a whole new business and it keeps growing every year and I’m finally doing my holistic business now full-time thanks to meet up.
821,MariaBOTA,"October 24, 2018",5,Barter group friendly! Got my son a job! Our barter company uses Meetup and we love it. It’s a great way to invite members to our events. My family uses Meetup to learn about events too. Meetup is the reason my son met a recruiter and got his first professional job while still in college. Great app!
822,Flbabe48,"December 27, 2018",5,Wonderful way to form great friendships! I've been a member of Meetup for over 3.5 years now and cannot tell you how much fun we've had and continue to have ever since we joined. We've made lots of friends who have now become family ❤️ That's priceless!
823,Randy Musk,"January 1, 2019",5,Excellent App. Bulletin Board for activities. Intuitive function on the technical aspects of app. Very good software.  
824,MrsFXG12,"January 6, 2019",5,"Best way to schedule! I have not made it to any events yet, however since downloading the app it’s definitely easier to keep up with all of the events going on! Also puts them right on my calendar so I don’t miss one I want to attend."
825,Bamberlyrue,"April 3, 2019",5,Great way to connect I’m a stay at home mom who just moved to a new town and this app has been a life saver when it comes to making connections. All you have to do is find the courage to show up and put yourself out there :)
826,Cartwheel927,"April 11, 2019",5,"Great way to try new things, meet new people! Really like this app because you can find things that you can drop in On occasion or go to regularly. Everything from arts and crafts to hiking to dancing! Or just hanging out with people of like mind or like age."
827,NealeO,"April 13, 2019",5,Much better than in the past Several years ago when the app was first available it had issue but is now much improved. Very convenient for coordinating meeting people.
828,abusedtruestories,"April 21, 2019",5,Love meet up I never knew this app existed but am so grateful I came across this! This is an amazing way to meet like minded individuals or step outside your comfort zone and dive into new adventures that may be scary to you! I love love love these groups and these people that put themselves out there to engage in community ♥️
829,Briseymone,"May 11, 2019",5,"Love it!! I’m really enjoying the app. It’s easy to use and easy to find matches with certain groups. I definitely recommend meetup for those who just moved to new cities, like myself or those just looking to broaden their social lives."
830,Zippybk,"August 27, 2018",5,"Meetup app I am so happy to be in the loop through Meetup.  I have only been able to participate in a few events because I am in Oceanside and most of the events I would like to attend are in San Diego, but I hope to move this Fall and will already have a community to go to."
831,LK55mm,"September 25, 2018",4,"Good app. Just one thing..... The app syncs great on my iPhone, and it works wonderfully......but I wish that it would stay logged in until I log out manually."
832,Camille Nisich,"October 10, 2018",5,"Makes being an organizer so easy!!! Love the Meetup app!!! It makes being an organizer so easy. Welcome new members, answer questions, check RSVPS, upload event pictures. It does it everything you need on the go and is a great compliment to the desktop interface."
833,-Zemet,"February 12, 2020",5,"Make it happen I couldn’t find a group in my area for women in business, so I decided to take a chance and start one. This app has made it super easy to post events, communicate with the group, and invite others."
834,PurtyKitty,"January 24, 2020",5,"love it so much I thought this is going to Be just an average app, however, the range and diversity of interest blows me away. I love this app. Thanks, MEETUP, you are changing my life and I’m meeting all kinds of really cool people and exploring all of my new interests and my old ones too 😘"
835,81Bunnyfeet,"January 17, 2020",5,Great way to meet people I have met so many great people and made great friendships. I highly recommend it for anyone new and town or just wanting to get out and do stuff with like minded people. There are groups for everything. Best thing I ever did.
836,Brindler,"January 5, 2020",5,Great way to find things to do that interest you.... And to meet people!  You choose groups participating in your areas of interest and you receive a listing of events-if the group(s) are active. Wonderful people too!
837,Matt0077,"December 22, 2019",5,"Great for making friends and having fun. This app is great for people who want to make friends but don’t know where to start. I made friends from an event, before, I would not have known where to even find events like these. This app is a life saver! :D"
838,Cranky68,"October 29, 2019",5,Really changed my life I am a single empty nester and found myself wholes up in my apartment “existing”.  I heard about MeetUp but didn’t know what it was about.  Once I jumped in and started socializing with like minded people my life changed completely.  
839,Catny,"August 14, 2019",5,"Hard to find IPad app but googled it and found it App is great makes it easy to use Meetup and safe details and upcoming events.  Like that I can favorite events without having to commit to attending and the app saves my favorites so I can decide later,  recommend!,"
840,Vladakushnir721,"April 7, 2019",5,Great way to meet new people and communities! I have used this app to network for personal and professional needs. It has been a great way to learn and bond with people you may have not had a chance to meet otherwise.
841,Goodlooking,"April 11, 2019",5,"Awesome! I was a bit hesitant to check the events out, but I finally did and regret not doing so sooner. There’s definitely something for everyone and it’s a great way to meet new people, do group activities, and check places out!"
842,Loving Atlanta,"June 2, 2019",5,"Great App Although I prefer using the desktop version, sometimes the App is handy to use on my iPhone.  I don’t love the App layout, because it’s so different from the desktop layout version, but the App works as it should / as it is intended."
843,Bball3264,"June 3, 2019",5,Best of the rest!!! Sooooo much better than any other singles apps and gives quality individuals event planning which provides a better foundation for finding friendships (and/or more) with other quality people.
844,tinameador,"July 13, 2019",5,Meet up is great! I love there is a place where you can find people that have similar hobbies or interests. Or you can find people new to an area just as you are. I am grateful for this outlet. It’s hard to make friends and this is a great way to do it.
845,sonjashin,"July 10, 2019",4,"Love it! Great way to learn about fun events and connect with people, especially when moving to a new place. "
846,Fushilou,"July 6, 2019",5,"Easy to use All my meetups in one spot, and it’s easy to set up events as an organizer. The only downfall is that the requests to join are not in chronological order on the app like they are on the desktop. Otherwise I can’t complain!"
847,LisaRenne,"July 3, 2019",5,Search CRASHES the app (iOS) I’m not sure what happened. I downloaded the latest update to the app. Now when I select the search icon (magnifying glass) the app crashes. 
848,bpschoedel,"June 29, 2019",5,"Great app that could be more widely utilized. I like the app a lot. Would be great to see it more widely utilized, and to see more diversity of groups on it. For instance the religious Meetups all tends to be New Age, the political Meetups all tend to be progressive. It is strong for tech Meetups but these seem to only be well attended in large cities."
849,obasek,"June 28, 2019",5,Recently just moved to a new state Recently just moved to a new state this was a great way to network learn grow and meet fiends possibly all in one the app is sophisticated and extremely informative I love the integrations between syncing ur calendars and giving reminders and alerts
850,Hajara,"August 11, 2018",5,Excellent Social App This is an app that doesn’t try to make itself appealing by adding too many extra and unnecessary frills and features. It’s simply a way for you to find local things going on in the area and it’s easy to use and lovely!
851,Shpippy,"August 14, 2018",5,Meetup: Great App for a Great Service! I would not have been able to manage my professional Meetup activities nearly as well with any solution other than this wonderful Meetup app. This mobile app has become my primary dashboard for Meetups in the New York City area.
852,Ifmisterpossibleexits,"August 20, 2018",4,Great way to meet people I’m rating it as a 4 star right now just because I’ve only started doing this. So far I like the ideas behind it and definitely a great place to meet people whether for friendships or trying to find your best friend. I am looking forward to attending more future meet ups.
853,LCBery,"August 27, 2018",5,"Great app, have attended lots of events Love the idea of local community members coming together through common interests. Have gone on lots of hikes and kayaking trips through this app. Was especially great when I first moved to this state and didn’t know the local places to go."
854,Jagutie2,"September 9, 2018",5,Great way to expand your social circle I moved to Dallas two years ago and immediately got on this app to meet new people and network. At one event I networked with someone in the same industry and I was able to find a job fast and meet new people.
855,strawberryenvy,"September 23, 2018",3,It’s a good idea but.. I just moved across the country and was hoping to use this app for events I could go to to meet new people. I wish there was a way to chose the furthest away I’d want to drive for an event. I live almost 2 hours out of Atlanta and would really like to not see events from there. There’s so many from there it’s hard to find the closer ones.
856,texacote,"October 27, 2018",3,"App is great but back end needs work UI is very well laid out , but the back end needs a LOT of love.  Searching for a group is painful.  Am speaking as an organizer of DFW Data Science with over 3000 members - despite the back end problems."
857,kb929110,"February 10, 2019",5,"Great! I really like this app! It’s great for people who are new in town, looking for new people that share the same interest, or want to try a new hobby. The app is easy to use, and it will add events right to your calendar which is great. Definitely recommended!"
858,Catmankim,"February 10, 2019",4,Meeting people and having fun The concept is amazing. I wanted to start a group but it was too costly on a monthly basis for me. Thankfully someone started a group that I wanted to. 
859,Judge Melnyk,"March 10, 2019",5,"Easy, fun tool that brings people together I first joined Meetup to meet new people, and now I have started my own group. I love how easy it is to use the app. There is no other tool that can reach so many members of my community together in such a simple way."

862,Lovethedeals!,"January 18, 2020",5,"A great tool! I’ve been using the Meetup app for years. It’s a great way to find groups to join that match my interests. Very convenient to keep up on what events my group is having, sign up and communicate with others in the group."
863,jdunbaugh,"January 12, 2020",5,"Great app. Could be better I like better recommendations. There are also some strange limitations that seem unnecessary, like having to search for morning, afternoon, or evening, rather than giving my own time. Otherwise, meet-up is great."
864,SweetSinnocence,"December 31, 2019",5,Awesome App! I live that this app has introduced me to groups and people who share similar interests to me that I would never have met otherwise. I found events I love to attend that I might have never known existed without the convenience of this app. Thank you

867,Brendhan,"October 29, 2019",5,Need to find your people or people to help you out? I’ve found myself with time on my hands recently. MeetUp has been excellent in getting me in touch with the right groups and individuals to help me put that time to its greatest use!
868,DJnojoke,"October 11, 2019",5,"DJnojoke Great app. I have made several new friends and found several local groups with mutual interests. These are local people and local groups that I have met in person, not just an online thing like most social media."

872,Lyrickle,"May 8, 2019",5,"Didn’t realize how much I missed it! Perfect way to meet new people, explore passions/hobbies and try new activities. Gets you out of your head and changes your energy, if needed. I’d been gone a while but so glad to be back!"

875,plopez1995,"August 9, 2019",5,"Meetup Review I recently moved to Austin, TX and had no friends at all, after joining a couple of LBGTQ groups on meetup i love it here now. We meet up for dodgeball games or late night coffee hangouts. If your looking to make new friends and socialize, this is the app to download and start your new journey!!!"
876,cleeru,"July 26, 2019",5,Meetup app great! Nothing that has not been said many times but this app covers a wide variety of interest and helps me find like minded people to participate in activities of all sorts from trying new restaurants to hiking catching up on new technologies. What’s not to like!
877,mikeroch12,"July 12, 2019",4,Meet up I’m impressed so far by the sheer number of people that use this app. It’s popularity makes socializing with large groups of people a constant. The last time I tried a social app there were 2 to 3 people showing up at events and they were usually the same people.
878,Lyberry4Me,"July 2, 2019",5,"Easy peasy Quick push notifications (I organize two groups), group messages go out and members respond. Easy to post meetings and collect RSVPs. You can lead up to three groups with one membership; easy to toggle back & forth."

881,Skitten0069,"September 20, 2018",1,"Last update (bug report) After the last update a couple days ago I haven't been able to get the app to run. I start it up, it gets past the initial ""Meetup"" logo screen, then it crashes and closes as soon as it begins to open the next screen."
882,JanineDancinQueen,"October 11, 2018",5,"Referrals! Since I am in the beauty business I come into contact with a lot of people. I am CONSTANTLY tell them about Meetup! It is an amazing site and way to either network on the social side or just to explore new places, events and friends around You!"

884,jmormay,"November 11, 2018",4,"Updated UI Easier to Navigate I have been using the meetups app for a few years and have had some great experiences through Meetups that I wouldn’t have had otherwise. I don’t know which version it was, but the UI has improved noticeably within the last year."
885,Johnnymack7,"December 12, 2018",5,"MeetUp A great platform to stay connected.  We as human beings are unique and one of our abilities is to socialize.  Through socialization we form relationships.  This is where MeetUp bridges socialization and relationships. If you’re fortunate as I’ve been,I’ve able to incorporate exercise and healthy activity"

888,LB-Cbus,"February 28, 2019",4,"Love meeting new people! I really am enjoying the meetup app. What a great way to meet individuals from all walks of life! ❤️ Sometimes it is hard to locate a specific group within the app, but keep trying, they eventually pop up! Use the EXACT name. If you use just a portion of the name it often won’t work."
889,TDemjanec,"March 9, 2019",5,Easy to Use Easier to use than any mobile apps that came after their parent website. I think it may even be easier to use than the desktop version.
890,Racy Runner,"August 11, 2018",5,Good fun Good People If anybody ever says in life they are bored —they have to be crazy this app makes it so fun to connect with people of all ages for different reasons from sports to hanging out and having some wine to hiking up a hill get out live life have fun this app makes it possible!🏃🏻‍♀️🙏💪🏼🏋🏽‍♀️🍷👠🌊😎💃🏻🍾🏄🏻‍♀️🚣🏼‍♂️🎤🎯🎳🎸
891,Aprfooz,"August 13, 2018",3,"Slowly Improving It has gotten better than when this new app came out as far as looks and format but I like the old calendar better, don’t care the way the new calendar is set up and the pictures on the meet up is very slow moving when viewing them and when uploading I can only do one pic at time."
892,abesolves,"April 18, 2020",5,Really great app I have really enjoyed finding things to do and people to meet on this app. I’ve met a lot of great friends and had a lot of great adventures. I recommend this app to everyone. Every type of person in every type of situation.

894,Driftr777,"February 19, 2020",5,Want to Get Out of the House This app delivers exactly what it promises. I have found multiple communities full of people who enjoy the same hobbies and projects I do. From outdoor adventures to niche programming languages I have found other people doing what I love.
895,ADHDcoach,"February 8, 2020",5,"Great App I have gone to several types of meetups that I would never have known existed if it wasn’t for this app. The app is intuitive, The variety of things to do is amazing and when you RSVP for an event it automatically populates in your calendar."
896,TYsamurai,"February 2, 2020",5,Very much useful Found a nice meet up group that catered to my needs. Was actually very suspicious of the app but turned out liking it a lot. Can be a huge tool for people that want to go out and make new experiences. Meeting people is the icing on the cake.
897,elymay05,"February 1, 2020",4,"Great way to connect with ppl with like interests I’ve enjoyed most events I’ve attended, though there are a few inactive groups with recurring events... not fun to show up somewhere and no one to be there. Hint for users: make sure you’re not the only one who RSVP’d! Suggestion for meetup: remove/disable inactive groups."
898,Grace Wildflower,"January 31, 2020",1,"It won’t let me make an account This app was recommended to me and I was excited to try it but it seems not to like me.  When I tried to sign up with Facebook it didn’t work, constantly shuffling me between the same screens.  When I tried to use my email address it said that address was already taken.  Strange.  Now I have no way to use the app. I couldn’t even get to a help page because you have to log in to see that 😞"
899,Sal Leena,"January 13, 2020",5,"MeetUps! Especially Glendale knit n natter!

Crochet and knitting, by the way!!!"
900,homepursue,"January 1, 2020",5,Great alternative to events and adventures Better because you don’t have to pay so much to socialize and you’re able to have a variety of options. It just depends what you feel like doing.
901,NakiaBia,"October 28, 2019",5,I don’t know about you... But this app connected me to others who share my faith and really... a whole world of new possibilities. I probably had this app for a couple of years and tonight was the first time I actually went to a meetup. Grateful. Glory to God.
902,michanita,"September 24, 2019",5,"Great experiences & wonderful meetups I've had some profound experiences & participated in wonderful, fun meetups. "

910,Thourdin,"December 3, 2018",2,"Not full featured and awkward to use It’s somewhat hard to navigate and sometimes notifications don’t work properly. I may indicate that I want to receive no group updates from a forum, but I still get notification on my phone."
911,程序员之家,"January 18, 2019",4,"Better to improve communication function Great app! The only thing I think that should be improved is to develop more communication features that we can chat with each other or groups without such FB, WhatsApp or whatever you call them."
912,nyle07,"January 23, 2019",4,"Try it! Right now! There’s some discussion going but not as much expected cause it’s the lack of active users maybe but if everyone could use and put there inquiries and infos on this app, this can get big! Guys try it and make it big so you guys all can make it useful for you by yourself.."
913,RobBassWorld,"January 26, 2019",5,"Meetup Review This app has come along way. It’s easier to navigate, join groups and it gives you updated reminders of upcoming events. It also informs you of new groups that may interest you to join or attend a meeting."
914,SomeHotMess,"February 9, 2019",4,"Solid Networking💯 I think the potential this networking app is of great length! I’m still learning the roadmap of the community. So, I can’t quite speak of all in detail. However, the set up is fantastic! Messaging, calendars, and schedules are convenient. And the categories are vast and broad. There is something here for all preferences!"
915,Lynne's funtime,"February 20, 2019",5,Great app! Just joined Meetup and downloaded the app a few weeks ago. Can’t believe how many interesting and fun events I’ve been notified about via the app. It certainly makes it easy to ask the event host a question or reply to join the event.
916,MusicB2t,"February 25, 2019",5,"Great app to join different groups! I love how many opportunities meetup creates for someone who’s new in the town to join different interest groups and learn new things!

918,GCSFL,"March 12, 2019",4,Meetup review Great app. for finding others with the same interests. 4 stars because I’m receiving a couple group notifications from groups I haven’t joined and I can’t figure out how to stop those notifications. I’m sure there’s probably a simple way to do it but I haven’t figured it out.
919,JJUpdawg,"May 11, 2019",5,Limitless possibility Time and time again meet-up has brought me to finding like minded individuals & amazing groups of people. There are an endless amount of group that I would have never had known existed. I am extremely grateful for this App!
920,E.TeeAy,"April 10, 2018",2,"Really bad organization This app drives me nuts, I really loathe having to open it. It wants to show me all sorts of information about other groups and other events, instead of letting me view my group’s events alone and separately letting me browse other events. What are the silly icons at the bottom? What’s the major difference between the search and the M logo? They both appear to be browse/search pages. Bad design."
921,Fotoguyx,"August 21, 2018",3,"Good Service I like the service it provides. But if I haven’t committed to an event and want to insert a reminder on my calendar, transferring the information isn’t easy. There is no cut-n-paste option. I have to flip back and forth between apps as I type the content. I’m just saying that it would be an improvement to have that option."
922,transforming me,"September 5, 2018",5,Great way to meet people I have only done one activity so far but I really enjoyed it and it is so nice to know that something like this is out there where people can get to know people in their own community and surrounding areas.

927,angelicaaddeo,"March 11, 2020",2,"I LOVE the concept and website but the app doesn’t let me sign in I cannot log in through Facebook or even create a new account on the app. It keeps going through loops of pressing log in with Facebook, opening the Facebook app, going back to meetup app, then back again. I really want to use the app but it won’t let me log in. I really hope someone gets back to me on how to fix this."
928,shmeeloy,"March 7, 2020",5,Endless Opportunity Got on meetup two years ago. Best thing ever. I haven’t maximized the platform but I think the value this app can bring to ones life is infinite and should probably have to pay for such an app like this

943,Ozmirage,"September 25, 2019",4,"Apart from . . . . . . a clumsy approach to message handling (sometimes you can’t find the new message the app says you’ve got, other times you can’t find a message you’ve already read . . .), MeetUp is a marvelous way to interact with others over time.

997,Grouper2093,"November 28, 2018",1,"Crashes and fails to load anything This is one of the worst apps I’ve recently used. It fails to load any recent information. I frequently have to uninstall and redone load the app to load new info. When I recently joined a meetup group, the app notified me that I had been accepted but after opening the app multiple times, it would still show that my request was pending. I had to delete and reinstall it to get over that."
998,Username012005,"December 11, 2018",1,"Meetup needs an iPad App You guys need to put in the work into making an iPad app, the whole scaled up phone app is very lazy. The amount of money paid to have a group is hundreds of dollars and you could do more to improve the service, implement feedback and add features to the app. Or even if you can get your best minds on it, fix the “discussion” character count and make it more like a group wall where discussion can take place. "

Don’t even want to give it one star...

1340,Murmax238753257885213,"February 10, 2019",5,Great app! Your imagination is your only limit with this app.  So many groups to get involved in and if nothing interests you then you can start your own meetup. The only downfall is if you live in a small town.

1380,Ray ray 1967,"January 15, 2020",4,Needs a little improvement The app is great and I love finding new events and people to meet. One complaint is that I wish I could access more of my profile in the app instead of having to get on the big ol’ laptop.
1381,NopeDealer,"December 21, 2019",1,"No landscape mode on iPad = EPIC FAILURE Cause, you know, it would terrific to actually be able to USE the app. Not everyone is a hunch-shouldered, squinty-eyed, monkey-fingered iPhone addict. Some of us will only accept apps that don’t require us to be one. "

1395,Tinselbird,"July 26, 2019",4,Easy to use app The app was referred to me by a friend since I just moved to the area and didn’t have any friends. This app is very easy to maneuver and find out what’s happening in in the local area and surrounding areas as well. I think this app is here to stay for me.
1396,Amitramani,"July 21, 2019",5,Awesome app! Very handy This eliminates the need for checking on the computer/laptop. It saves a lot of time RSVPing on the app itself. Another bonus is the ability of the app to create a calendar event for each meetup.
1397,JulieSue704,"July 21, 2019",1,Terrible Customer Service The app is designed to make it practically impossible to deactivate your meetup to prevent automatic billing.
1398,J4142356,"July 9, 2019",3,Still glitchy Still have trouble with opening the browse section and viewing comments from the notification page.  When I click the comment notification it opens up the event but with a blank space below it.

1406,Shay Shay #1,"May 24, 2019",5,Meet Up App This app is amazing because there are so many people out there who are alone due to various reasons. It’s difficult finding friends with like interests on your own.
1407,Mary on Florida,"June 3, 2019",5,"Meetup great Nice to have means to meet new people that share your interests and since meetups can be found across USA, you can find groups in any area to sign up to learn about new places and share activities."
1408,PricelessWomanofGod,"June 8, 2019",5,Great way to connect I attended an event that I found on the app. The outing was fun. I enjoyed being able to do something new with a new community of people. I wouldn’t have found the group outside of the app.
1409,R.D. Bowen,"June 9, 2019",5,Review Good way to meet people. I know very few people in this area. This meetup gives each of us an opportunity to choose 1 or more group(s) to try and see what is to our liking. Great idea whomever started this app.
1410,Michael Fikes,"September 8, 2018",5,Found Friends Just recently moved to Vegas as an actor and had no clue where to find my group the thespians and even other circles I enjoy outside of my professional life and I found ALL of them plus more on MeetUp! I love this app.
1411,Jackruthless,"September 20, 2018",5,Awesome way to meet people I find this app very useful in helping me find things to do and to meet new people. The only downside is that not manny people show up and for my age there needs to be more options.
1412,Aidsprest,"December 25, 2018",1,UX is terrible and confusing I wish I knew how to articulate what exactly is wrong or how to fix it but this app is just...not intuitive! It’s hard to find new groups or understand what I’m looking at. I really don’t know but the whole thing just needs to be re-designed. It’s terrible to look at and now I can understand why so many of the groups haven’t been active. It’s sad. Make the app clearer and easier to use. 🤷🏽‍♂️
1413,centriclioness,"December 31, 2018",5,"Useful app This app runs smoothly and it’s not a headache to figure out. This, u spend the time using the app for its original purpose rather than spending your time figuring out its functions. No complaints here!"
1414,Val239,"January 4, 2019",5,"Great way to find people with similar interests! I’ve made some great friends through this app! I will be honest and say that I was super leary in the very, very beginning - but that  was quickly dispelled. I love meetup. I use it in AND out of town. Great app!"
1415,Dharmamama,"January 5, 2019",5,Makes setting up a meeting simple! It’s so helpful having my meeting info/notifications for the group I started plus announcements for other groups so easily accessible!
1416,The 909Sportsnerd,"January 11, 2019",5,"Take a chance Great way to meet people, but you must be willing to get out if your comfort zone. Low pressure environment. It’s all about finding your tribe. Some cool people and some maybe weird to you. Good luck and enjoy!"

1419,kahtonkatime,"January 26, 2019",5,Great App Meetup is a great app because it uses modern technology to bring people together in person which is more rare in this age of computers and media. It’s a great idea to create social events for like-minded interests that helps build community and encourage growth.
1420,Baewatchn,"May 2, 2018",1,"Where is my Meetup group. Two days ago, I started a Meetup, and it is not visible to any of my friends on the Meetup app. I can see it, but no one has gotten emails stating there is a new Meetup. I picked all the relatable ""topics"" to get new members but nothing. I have emailed tech support and two days later, still waiting. Why is there not a number. This is so frustrating, and the app is in the MySpace age. Shouldn't have to use your desk top to use Meetup. I'm so over it!"
1421,juliemharris02,"June 6, 2018",1,"Frustrating This app has never worked properly. I continually update it when there are updates available but it never works. I can’t even get into my messages, meetup groups or search for new groups. I’m getting over it and thinking about deleting my account completely. What’s the point of it if I can’t get it to work ever. Please fix your app or I’m out as well as many others I’m sure."
1422,XamNew,"August 13, 2018",4,Usability I like the Meetup App. There are some “Usability” tags I wish were available. One is I wish the app had the ability to delete notifications so after being read I don’t have to see them again when returning.
1423,Nature_Fairy_MI,"August 16, 2018",5,"Something for everyone! I got this thinking there wouldn’t be much offered along the lines of my hobbies, but there is so much! I love finding like minded people in my area 😊 thank you to whoever created this app it’s awesome!"

1449,P_Reviewer,"July 14, 2019",1,"Horrible - Meetup does not deserve even one star I used meetup for several years. Initially I loved it. When the app was updated, the new UI was horribly designed. Most of my meetup friends stopped using meetup as a result. I also experienced many meetups that were poorly organized with a lot of people attending that were quite rude. I stopped attending and using meetup. I am just now writing my review after not attending meetup for a while."

1464,KellyMichelle84,"January 10, 2019",3,"No websites Don’t try to send websites through MeetUp such as the exact location of an event, information on upcoming events online, or anything like that.

It does seem though that, for a group that just wants to build a community and is not looking to charge for attendance, that the cost of the service, for the host, seems a bit premium."

1689,Quagdarr,"June 9, 2019",1,Mobile app broken You download it you sign in with Facebook then understandably it asks you what are some interests... then you get to your profile and you just keep hitting next and it stays on the profile screen. You close it and repeat the cycle again and again and again and again and again and again. Not sure how they have users.

1709,Cooper Coupon,"November 11, 2018",2,"User Unfriendly :-( While there’s some pluses in terms of messaging and easy access to a calendar of events and search...however, the app doesn’t allow you to edit your email address nor double click on profile messenger photos to access a person’s basic profile page. It’s 2018 and the app behaves like its 2008."
1710,Gogirldrc,"August 16, 2018",4,Decent This app is a good one to find meet-ups near me. There are a few things that could be improved to make it a little easier to find information relevant to me and help me find my messages easier.

Got it down to just the stuff in town and nothing of interest there either. App was recommended by someone as a way to make friends and meet gay men with similar interests. Absolutely nothing. Lots of booze meet ups/ hook up meets for kids. Garbage app for me. Deleted and will never recommend this app to anyone.
1741,DMCMTC,"April 14, 2019",5,"Great App Great way to get connected to whatever interests you may have - rather it’s swing dancing, photography, or just hanging out. The meetup app has it all. Join and start enjoying what piques your interest and/or talents."

I frankly don’t care that a “new meetup” group entitled “60+ice cream social” has started in my city. Lots of updates to their user interface and yet none of them any better than the last.

1990,efrost1,"February 20, 2020",3,"No iPad version Great app for the phone, but I generally use my iPad in landscape mode with a Bluetooth keyboard (like a notebook computer).

2005,2Chilly,"December 14, 2019",4,"Very useful so far A good experience so far, except for the Notification alert, which does not indicate which item/post has the alert. Have to stumble around looking for it. That’s not very productive."

Chat feature send push alerts with no content; and can’t view threads in the app. Difficulty registering or viewing events in app. But GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!

I have a big Meetup and to not have the app working means I need to use web and its buggy to now because of the robot issues. Only with the IPhone 5. I hope you guys fix it.
2772,albrivrat,"January 26, 2019",2,Can't open app I had no problem with the app until a few days ago. Now it crashes and closes every time I try to open it. I've tried deleting and reinstalling it several times as well as shutting off and restarting my phone.

2777,gmini,"March 11, 2019",2,"Multiple upload continued to be a farce. For the amount of time it takes to simply scroll from one photo to the next, I’d appreciate a functioning multiple upload mechanism. Every upload returns an error message. An “Oops” alert doesn’t cut it when the bug repeats ubiquitously."

I’ve recently been trying to send a blast email to everyone from the app and no one is getting them. It would say email all members but after my most recent emails(3 total) I was informed no one got them. How can we resolve this
2811,artMonster,"June 13, 2018",1,"Downhill I seldom write negative reviews but this app deserves it. What once was an easy to use, very user friendly app is now simply junk. Not sure what the goal of the developer was, but they really messed it up. From messaging to finding meet ups, it’s a total crap shoot whether it works or not. Deleting it is the nicest thing I can think to do with this abomination."

Makes no sense I was charged May 10th, then June 10th, then June 30th, nothing for July and then August 7th and then supposed to be August 31st until I cancelled.

Cannot do many items on app that you can do on full site and can find no way to go to full site on phone.  It always goes to app even when sign in on web browser. I do not like it.
