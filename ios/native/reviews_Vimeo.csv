0,Francisco M Sosa,"October 28, 2019",2,"Developers, can you please consider these improvements? So I want to like the app, I think it’s a great platform, but the navigation is completely frustrating and even made me quit viewing my video to make this review. It’s frustrating because as a platform it seems to hold great promise, but being 2019 it’s hard to accept the lack of some very basic app navigation."
1,Icppicu123,"April 24, 2020",1,"Worst app ever doesn’t deserve a star I hate this app so much. It’s a waste of money and time and don’t even put down your card information for the free trial. They say you can cancel your subscription at any time but they lied. I put my card information in because you have to in order to do the free trial and I only watched one video for a class. When I tried to follow the instructions to cancel the subscription on computer, they were very inaccurate and what they claimed you would see is not there. I’ve been trying for weeks to cancel it and I even have seen that they have updated the so called “instruction to cancel a subscription” and they are still inaccurate. I have even left a message to the service center twice through email and I have still been ignored and unable to cancel. They’re basically trying to still money. I recommend no one get this app."
2,aileverte,"March 8, 2018",2,"For a viewer, a frustrating app There are a number of lecture cycles I want to watch, I ""liked"" all of them, hoping that this would somehow help me access them - there is no way of building watch lists here! -- but when I return to the app it tells me I have no likes. This is quite infuriating: is it so difficult to have a user-friendly viewing list where one could keep links for future viewing? My ipad doesn't have enough memory to download everything, and searching every time is tedious. In the end I've resorted to this primitive half-solution: keeping a list of titles in my notepad and pasting the searchword from there! But that's just defeats the purpose of even having an app!!!"
3,pokinsmot,"March 17, 2020",4,"4 stars Just a suggestion for a feature I’d like to see. I’ve back a few projects on Kickstarter that use Vimeo as their platform, and they don’t all use the On Demand feature to get you the video. Some use a private link and give you a password. I think when I use the password to gain access, it says something like its added to my library, but there’s no “library” feature on the app or the website. It would be nice if there was an area like that on my home page or in my profile that collected them all in one place."
4,Kathy@2020,"March 11, 2020",1,"Warning: Difficult to Cancel Warning! It’s terribly difficult to cancel this subscription, wasting money and time. "
5,Arturo Zaher,"June 16, 2018",1,"Not Worth The Money They want you to pay for what other social media platforms do for free. Yet the functionality doesn't even match what others do for free. So who would pay to ""upgrade""? I use it because a long time ago someone uploaded videos of me back when social media was in the Myspace days. So back then this made sense because it was all videos but now it doesn't. If they want people to ""upgrade"" then should give options to edit and format videos. This would be a paid service worth it. Almost like I Movies gives you those options. Take a look at what directorial options are out their for free and then both match it and beat it. Then you can charge."
6,Boofunkin',"August 4, 2019",2,Lame app! I can access and play ALL MY videos but other than that rather useless! No way to find my (or any other peoples) videos or collections. If you want to see the staff picks (I don't) it is great. Other wise rather pointless (this goes for the Roku and Andriod versions). And there is no way to shut off the stupid auto play next video (this seems to be resolved)!!
7,Walterrhonejr,"June 13, 2018",1,They keep  deleting my account because ofnudity So I'm having a problem with paid Vimeo account give me a claims that I have voluntarily violated their policies my videos continue he dear artsy and interesting and fun I thought I’ve gotten really quick responses from people on Vimeo I’d say about 30% of the videos on Vimeo continue to be in sexual sexual likes sex and his porn on there I believe their own fear with the policies and if you’re trying to create and be creative I would definitely find a different outlet I’m looking for one I’ll never use Vimeo again and I’m going to demand my money back is the second time they have deleted a very popular account in less than a month
8,dM1c,"May 7, 2019",5,Dependable Videography Phortfolio I’ve been using Vimeo’s streaming to dump all my finished/slightly unfinished Audio-Video exports from decades of personal and professional experience. 
9,JP_Trini,"August 26, 2018",5,"Professional Portable Portfolio Before using Vimeo, I would use Dropbox to send my clients their work. Not the most efficient because they would have to download locally, play it thru and then make their comments. Since the Review page facility it has made client feedback so much easier and way more efficient. I have faster turnaround time with my work. I luv it, wouldn’t change to another platform"
10,ben k r,"December 17, 2017",5,"Better content and community than that other one which Google is always updating to make it more restrictive. I find Vimeo very useful also for off-line video conversion. You never know what formats going to work on the other person’s machine. Sometimes I get really busy, so I don’t want to watch a full length TV show. I really prefer watching a Vimeo’s short staff picks"
11,reeggxd5,"April 17, 2018",2,"Serious quality loss for uploads The video quality of high resolution videos is seriously degraded. It is much better than Flickr, but still pathetic compared to the original 4K video. Interestingly enough, their “featured” videos play with exquisite quality. However, regular users never get their videos streamed at that high bitrate. This is a hidden form of bait-and-switch IMHO."
12,ticked off fan,"June 20, 2018",3,"It’s good. More features please. Good to great. My praise. Great vid quality on any of my devices and i can download and view offline. My criticisms. Said devices have to be on to watch or listen.  Add this feature please as i listen to a lot of lecturers on here.  I don’t always need to view but i always need to listen. Also add features that let me rewind, fast forward or do the same by 30sec to 120 sec intervals in either direction and you’ll get those 5 stars from me! Good app. Make it better."
13,nubbs88,"July 6, 2018",3,"No way to view group videos I’m in a private group and it’s pretty much impossible to access groups on this app. I’ve been using it for years now and I was hoping by now there would be a fix but there hasn’t been any afaik. The best workaround I’ve found was saving a group video for later on my desktop and then watching it from the watch later tab on the app, but even that hasn’t been working as of late. It’s disappointing to say the least."
14,dailybballer,"September 7, 2018",1,"Terrible user interface and integration I rarely write reviews and unfortunately it’s not because I’m blown away by this app.  I have an account through gmail, when I log in via desktop I don’t have access to my subscriptions.  On my phone I have access.  Finding information about my account and how to change my password is almost impossible and extremely frustrating.  I was subscribed to a channel and that disappeared so I had to refollow them.  The only reason I have this app is because it’s required to view game footage of my basketball team, if not, I would completely delete and never go back."

16,HoweJenny,"October 21, 2018",5,"Refreshing Vimeo is a great web site. It’s content has a number of videos that are different, new and all around amazing. Y..T... seems to geared up to not allow the options of different content than the main stream audience watch. Don’t get me wrong, YT is a great site but needs to expand possibilities of something to expand a persons experiences with variety."
17,1Yafa1,"November 21, 2018",1,"Selective/arbitrary Policy My favorite channel was banned recently. Looking further into the reason for the ban, Vimeo gave a generic response about policy violations without identifying specifically what policy had been violated or what content triggered the violation. As best as we can tell, the content wasn’t in violation of any of Vimeo’s policies, but rather, an arbitrary decision by Vimeo to simply remove content it didn’t like"
18,nelsalma,"December 11, 2018",5,"Lovely surprise I just joined and I’m finding it very much of a series of what we used to call “happenings”—still an excellent descriptor, but the challenge is to discipline myself to parcel these experiences on film out through the day rather than getting enraptured so much that nothing else gets done around here! Brilliant. "
19,KevinF1966,"February 7, 2019",1,"Absolute garbage app This is literally the worst app I’ve encountered on iOS. As a video app it has a couple of major flaws that defy belief and render it unusable. Namely, you cannot return and resume a video partway through. You have to restart the video every time and just remember where to fast-forward to. That’s if you can find the video. Unbelievably (again) there is nothing like a watchlist or a “resume watching” category. Hard to overstate what an abject Fail Vimeo is. Oh, and not just iOS but same problem on other platforms. Problem is Vimeo, not just this one app. Having made the mistake of renting some vids I will never use Vimeo again."
20,RDennard,"December 27, 2017",3,"Good app but have to pay to upload more First, Vimeo is a good app. To upload a semi-substantial amount of content you have to pay. I understand this. However, the app itself is not great for the content creators after uploading. You cannot see your stats in the app and have to actually use the website to view your data. This is poor. If I could,d see he stats in the app the review would be higher."
21,CometWaves,"April 9, 2018",3,"How do you exit from a video? I have done everything I can think of to exit a video. There is no exit button, swiping up/down/right/left, double clicking, 3d touch, nothing exits back to the list of videos on my iPhone 6s+. On a rare occasion a quick flick of a screen moves the video into a PIP view. IDK, this is so much harder than it needs to be. Just give me a return button please."
22,mattbtowny,"June 10, 2018",5,A Proud Platform Overall a great experience! Sometimes it’s a little hard to navigate your video content and know where they are going and what it’ll look like when it comes to posting to other social media platforms. But overall love the vision of Vimeo and we use this amazing platform proudly!
23,bull_crapp,"July 24, 2018",1,"Search There is no visible text field for search. I tried iOS keyboard and SwiftKey. I tried pressing anywhere to paste. Nothing. I can type and hit return and it will search, but I can't see what the heck I'm typing, nor can I paste a Vimeo link. And when it does search, I can only 'refine' the search that I couldn't view. I can't retype the search in the result page. AND, I have to close the app out completely to get back to the main page because there is no back button. Please tell me I'm just missing something. [iPhone 6s on iOS 10]"
24,blaizer1107,"November 5, 2018",4,"Small quirks, but great! I love the design of this app, but it would be awesome to be able to view detailed stats like you can on the website!"
25,Tambo1963,"March 19, 2019",5,"Needed missing videos I appreciate Vimeo going the extra mile to help me transfer my videos from my previous account to my new account.  I was worried I had lost them due to missing passwords, but they were able to help me.  Very grateful to have my videos again!"
26,Tijuana Jackson,"March 30, 2019",2,Changing Plan Nearly Impossible I purchased Premium Plan ($75) in good faith that the Live Stream feature would improve.  I paid $900 for annual subscription.  
27,ajr1437,"September 18, 2019",5,"Phenomenal! Couldn’t ask for more from this program than is already offered (though I imagine with more time, I could find a few things 😉). The use of ease in regards to the UI is great, you don’t have to be a pro to make the best of this app/platform, but if you are a pro, you won’t be disappointed at all!"
28,I never escaped even…,"September 14, 2019",4,Why I rated it 4 stars. I really love Vimeo but there’s a glitch which is making me frustrated.
29,yghdgujdbgshdbghshs,"January 25, 2020",4,"Rating this app It is great so far, it actually help me start posting videos and It is easy to upload videos and follow people. Just there this small little things, many people will not notice you if you haven’t been on a other app. People actually need to search for you or find you. It will not appear as most recently video uploaded."
30,Akcjjdejkdkdkxuc,"November 10, 2017",5,Just a suggestion I really love this app so I thought it would be cool if you added in a randomize button and it would just take you to a random video so you can be surprised and you won’t be scrolling forever on trying to find something to watch :)
31,xmantra,"December 20, 2017",4,"Nice but It's nice but it doesn't let you rearrange your videos on your library unless you pay & go Pro So you're stuck on the order you upload them and they have never giving you the option to do so for the longest. But other than that it's a nice video community.!!! Please fix it, thanks"
32,Linuxpng,"December 14, 2018",4,I have an unread notification badge with no notifications I just installed the app and had to turn off the badges because the app thinks i have 5 notifications.  If I click on the notification section within the app I am told I have no notifications.
33,patioD,"February 3, 2019",5,"No worries... I have a variety to post, everything ranging from Adobe Educator Exchange class info to, client work and my own practices....Vimeo has always made it easy to post, and offers the kind of program that works...Love the Staff Picks that offer glimpses of what the rest of the world is up to. Thanks."
34,Asin 23,"February 4, 2019",4,I am rooting for Vimeo Remember when youtobe started was a small website barely any ads on it ? 
35,killersidedish,"March 31, 2019",2,Eh I’m super frustrated. The videos I have paid for will not download so I can watch them offline. Also the video player does not bookmark where I leave off watching. I have to try and find my spot again. There is also not way to know if I have previously seen it before. The quality is good but I wish I could watch my lectures on almost any other service. Sorry guys keep working on it.
36,Marbhoff,"April 9, 2019",1,"Disappointing functionality First off, there is a specific person I follow (private page), and none of their videos show up to view from the app, even being logged in. I have to access the videos from the desktop site and then view them from there (and save for watch later). "
37,b3ttyb0nd,"April 11, 2020",5,"Simple and effective video platform Love how easy Vimeo makes it to upload, organize and share videos. User interface is clean, simple and easy to navigate. Security settings are also easy to configure. Best of all, my community finds it easy to use and so they do! Thank you, Vimeo!"
38,Teehee Sub Flamingo,"January 1, 2020",5,"Suggestion... This app is great! I just have a suggestion, maybe add a community tab. So creators can talk to their fans without having to make a video about it. And on that tab maybe we could put a picture as a sneak peak for the up coming video! Just an idea."
39,Vanimator,"July 30, 2019",3,"Great, but... The Mobil app is amazing. I would love it if they just did away with the annoying pause button that shows up in the middle of the screen when you start your video. If your video is short then you would have this thing you need to tap away every single time when you’re showing it to someone. A bit distracting."
40,cyclops.eyesonly,"January 2, 2018",5,A great app and even better content. I love the Vimeo app because they show many different types of film projects. It's an incredible window to the world. Most of the videos are very well done. It's a total pleasure to watch and discover talented people all over the world.
41,Lady.Stardust,"May 2, 2018",5,"Vimeo is Brilliant I love the site, which is light years ahead of “that other site” & also not quite so bogged down with so much trite, meaningless content. "
42,Schneidzs,"May 16, 2018",1,Missing Features There are so many missing features from the app compared to the desktop site. Most of the time I have to access the site via safari and request the desktop site to be able to finish changing settings. It doesn’t even have all of the privacy options or the ability to edit a thumbnail. Very frustrating especially because it has been like this for years.
43,Rainworks_02,"July 24, 2018",5,Perfect for Vine/IG Editors Hands down way better than Instagram for video editors because the quality doesn’t get butchered AT ALL! I highly recommend editors out there get this app and start using it more often to move over our community here!
44,Alpenglowjod,"September 22, 2018",4,"Love posting high quality videos on Vimeo I have been working on collecting and posting high quality videos and then doing post processing on them in Resolve and seeing if my viewing platform can handle it!  So far, Vimeo seems to be the best.  One always needs the best monitor to view them."
45,Mnijshg,"April 3, 2019",1,"Don’t waste your $ I was excited to find a documentary I’ve been wanting to watch and purchased it. Although I was charged, I was never able to watch it. I sent several messages to customer service but never received a reply. I found a phone number for customer service, but the message said to go online to contact customer service. Frustrating and a waste of not only money but also my time."
46,WeirdRaccoon,"April 15, 2019",3,"My Thoughts I like the idea behind Vimeo but I think what would really be nice is if the app was further modernized and there were categories for different types of people rather than just funny and animation. For example, if there were categories for aesthetic appeal and even one for Vimeo Original Content you couldn't find anywhere else."
47,ajefbbsiwth,"June 3, 2019",1,Not good Ok so I don’t really enjoy this app the only reason I have it is to support a creator I really like. Let’s dive into the problems. Whenever I go on Vimeo on my phone it says the creator (Joseph carter the mink man) has 21 videos when I try to view the videos only one shows up! Also I put notifications on for him and I don’t get them as well as they won’t show up in my feed. However when I go on my computer I can see all his videos. Please fix this.
48,2200 memorial,"February 27, 2020",2,"App not working for several months I have had the app for several years and our church pays a yearly subscription. I have not been able to log on to Vimeo via my app for a long time. I have deleted the app and reinstalled several times with no luck. When the app was working it was great, but now it frustrating because when I try to log on I get the message that something strange happen."
49,sstiavetti,"February 2, 2020",1,"Great... for the year 2010. It’s 2020. What kind of bonehead video app doesn’t include basic navigation? No forward or back buttons, to easily catch what you missed? No on the fly resolution adjustment, if your connection isn’t great in the moment? "
50,tah007,"February 2, 2018",5,Great app Makes uploading HD easy and easy to share.  I recommend this over Facebook any day. It’s real and has the real capabilities of making Facebook what it should have been; a self promoting video or picture platform
51,Jbaler,"March 16, 2018",3,"Waste of iPhone X Can’t zoom in to fill the screen. You’d think wide screen or letter boxed videos would fill the screen, but no, they just look even smaller. What’s worse is how insanely easy it would be for them to just add a double tap feature to fill the screen. Used to come on this app every day, now I don’t touch it."
52,Azzie Scott,"May 22, 2018",2,"Phantom notifications Yet again I’m getting a notification indicator that doesn’t disappear. It will show I have 2 notifications, so when I go to my notifications, I have no new notifications. It just constantly shows the number two and never disappears. It’s a little annoying. This happened before and was only corrected with a app update."
53,Marie345,"June 30, 2018",4,Vimeo is a great way to share videos I’m able to upload videos to Vimeo very easily and with good quality. Then I can share the link with whoever I want to. There are several ways to control who sees it. You can give it a title and add a description to each video.
54,Bobert Jr.,"September 16, 2018",2,"A Problem I’ve Been Having When I click the app, it crashes immediately and goes back to the home screen. I use Vimeo on my desktop more than my phone, so it’s not hindering my uploading experience. But it would be nice to view Vimeo on mobile. I’ve gone a couple months without using the app and redownloaded it and it does the same thing. I am also on a new phone."
55,DocOllie,"May 5, 2019",2,"Frustrating All Around Artsy, yes, and some good stuff.  For an artist wanting to sell videos, fine.  For the consumer wanting to cancel on demand subscription, good luck finding the proper screen.  Be wary.  For basic customer with on demand subscription, submitted question to tech support regarding cancelling on demand not assured for 3 days.  To cancel, which could be simple, becomes quite the process.  Will not subscribe again to on demand videos."
56,Erikasway,"April 30, 2020",5,"Quick, easy, effortless The app was simple to download and works perfectly. Buttons allow for easy navigation and overall the app is user friendly. Thanks!"
57,Christopherbrs,"January 19, 2020",5,Undeniable This app is so easy to us!  Whether you are a pro or a beginner it is a must have to look to manage your video content!  The best app I have ever used!  Thanks Vimeo Product Team!  Way to know what your customer journey is!
58,Bdkkevc,"November 22, 2019",1,"Embarrassing, Unprofessional, Unacceptable This site and the people behind it are garbage. After giving links out to several festivals and galleries my account was disabled without reason. I then received emails saying my links were not working. Thanks guys. Deleted my account and started a website. You’ll also only get a staff pick if you pay enough. I’ll never use or visit any page from this bs company again."

60,Steboner,"March 21, 2018",4,"Better than YT in many ways So far, Vimeo has been very easy to work with and provides great bandwidth when streaming content. YT was once a great platform but as they grew their infrastructure didn’t keep up with demand. Hope Vimeo takes not of that 😀"
61,XIII Exiles,"April 20, 2018",5,One of my favorite Apps I really enjoy this app. I really like the feature of downloading video to the phone to watch later when I do not have WiFi or service.
62,skatcook7,"May 26, 2018",5,"Art, for My, Layiah Cook: I, don’t know why, but the spirit of Lord, had me, to tap, this app.  And this is what I, didn’t expect to see, special need artist.

63,Mournblade7214,"September 2, 2018",1,"Awkward, clumsy & a ripoff Hate this app and hate the service. Hard to use, clunky and difficult. Another major bonus is rentals... if you don’t watch it right away it’s deleted. Why this would be the case I have no idea but you can imagine how frustrating it is to pay for a series and get delayed only to find you’ve lose your chance. There are better ways to stream than this junk."
64,Lolitamelt,"October 1, 2018",5,Love the excellent quality videos I love this site because of the excellent quality and the ability to connect with my favorite puppy sites. Thank you for this wonderful platform for dog lovers like me.
65,CharlieGirl3163,"December 17, 2018",4,Grate to view live stream and upload Sound quality is grate and no breakdown of videos. So far uploading and viewing streams is better quality than any app I seen or heard. Very pleased and will update after I view and hear many more.
66,CAT products.,"March 25, 2019",5,Exceptional High Class and very very elite. Everything on here is done with high style. The more mature content has absolutely no ghetto qualities at all. I am a customer for life! This is the most prolific short film channel on the internet.
67,Happy Kotek,"April 24, 2019",2,"Use Browser Player Instead For a player that’s geared towards video professionals, this app is lacking in the most fundamental playback control features: no way to jump back/forward, no keyboard commands available, etc. C’mon guys!"
68,GfromSLC,"July 29, 2019",5,My favorite place to watch videos Vimeo is the best place to watch and post your videos. A ton of my favorite filmmakers and artists publish here as well as my friends that make entertaining(to me) videos.
69,I is Noe,"September 13, 2019",2,One video!? I am very disappointed of the fact that I can only put one video when I upload a Vimeo video. I would like to be able to edit and upload more videos. I feel that you shouldn’t have to pay to have to be able to put more videos in. This is completely unfair to me and I wish to change this rule.
70,LongviewTX,"February 22, 2018",5,"Vimeo THE PREMIER VIDEO PLATFORM If you want to share videos in high quality, Vimeo is the BEST.

73,The frugal guru,"October 15, 2018",5,Awesome so far. Can I download here. I love the ease and professional look when sharing. So far so good. Four videos shared when I could not trod before without jumping thru hoops. Zero learning or sharing curve
74,No namespace,"December 10, 2018",1,"You should just use browser - app has no functions You might as well just use your browser. At least in a browser you can rewind and fast forward by 10-30 sec. The player in the app had no other features other than it plays the video. There is no 2x speed option, no quality option, and no rewind fast forward option."
75,WoodyB303,"January 30, 2019",2,"Casting doesn’t work I’m trying to watch a movie that I purchased on my Sony TV, but the casting feature does not work. The Vimeo logo comes up on screen, but the movie never starts. I’ve also tried going through my Apple TV, but the movie freezes after a minute or two while the audio continues. Very disappointed! iPhone XR."
76,PMac18,"June 4, 2019",1,"Fix Notifications This is one of the primary reasons I deleted this app in the past. Notifications always show up with red number, but nothing in the notifications list when you try to view / clear them. Deleting again until this gets addressed. I’m tired of seeing red numbers on the app that never go away. Will use website for time being."
77,15_amb,"March 20, 2020",1,"Get it right Vimeo has been around for sometime now and it baffles me that they still haven’t gotten the functions for the app on iPhone or Apple TV down. I have the latest Apple TV and bugs out every time. The app is finicky on my phone, some days it’s great others I just have to break out my computer. Even if you’ve got a small team of people at least make sure they can do the job."

79,Tibbs90,"March 20, 2020",4,"Great platform that needs UI improvements. I live Vimeo. But, it looks out of date. It also doesn’t support dark mode which is a shame. It’s really hard to watch a movie in a dark room when the UI is so bright."
80,EBhawaii,"February 9, 2018",5,View anywhere Awesome portable library. Can call up video from many years ago to yesterday to view in seconds.
81,Gwynda,"April 23, 2018",1,Where is the app Go to the App Store to download the app gives me the option to open but it’s nowhere on any of my screens? Usually when you download the app you actually have an app that you can click on each time it’s nowhere to be found on my phone instead I have to go back to the App Store each time and get to it from there that doesn’t make sense.

640,EPB65,"October 22, 2013",2,"Very Disappointing Overall the latest version of the Vimeo app is very disappointing. Vimeo boasts that version 4 is a complete re-write. The problem is that the previous version was far more functional. Gone is the ability to search, which is a fatal flaw (though Vimeo claims to have restored this feature in the latest version, which is not the case on the iPad). The app also lacks the ability to determine sort order, upload videos, and flag your likes."

650,Skeens04,"April 14, 2011",4,"Would give a 5 star rating if it had a search function I would give a five star rating if it had a search function. I gave it a 4, but was tempted to give a 3 because there is no general search option for videos. It is great for tracking your own videos and for the ones that Vimeo chooses to feature on include in the browse section of the app, but I really cannot understand the logic or a major mistake of not having the search functionality. I would really like to know the reasoning for that choice or if it was just a mistake????  Aside from all of that, thanks Vimeo for the app and because Vimeo is a good service provider and the app is good in what it does allow, I still give an overall of a 4 star rating, with high hopes that the search function and possibly other great features will follow in app updates. Vimeo thanks for the app!!!!!"
651,Xoxoforeigncinema,"June 6, 2011",1,"Don't bother till they roll out a better update I really liked this app when it first came out: how rad that you could easily edit and then upload video from my iPod touch, and it looked great as well. Sadly, good looks are the only thing this has going for it now. It worked decently at first and I was quite enthusiastic about it, and made so many little videos with it. But each successive update makes it more and more terrible. Now it's really buggy, freezes up constantly, loses all my work when it does, and is just a source of frustration and wasted time. It's really too bad because the first version had real potential, and each ""update"" squanders more and more of any good will the company's built up with me. If Vimeo is reading this: come on, guys, get it together! What is going on that each update makes the app worse and worse?!! Anyone else: don't bother with this for editing till they release a better update. Bona fide fail."
652,brayjason,"December 13, 2011",5,The best video app ever!!! I absolutely love this app for a few reasons. One it allows to watch all my videos conveniently on my iPhone. Two it has an amazing intuitive video editor with everything I want in a mobile video editor. It's way better than the iMovie app. Three it's very aesthetically pleasing. This is important to me as i like to work in a clean classy environment. The app is very clean and loads super quickly. Best of all it's free!!
653,GoRoderickGo,"October 17, 2012",5,"In desperate need of an update The app was novel when it first was released, with its integration of video editing and video consumption, but much like the Vimeo site itself, navigation is a huge issue."
654,mveras1972,"March 1, 2014",3,"Looking for the search feature? The interface is a bit unintuitive and takes a bit getting used to. Sometimes you feel stuck in a screen with no way out. Those of you frustrated thinking there is no search feature will be relieved to find out that there is a search feature, it is just hidden. To find the search you have to swipe down from any screen that has videos and once you reach the top of the video list, pull the screen down and it will reveal the Search field in all its glory! An essential and important core feature nicely hidden from the main interface! "
655,vfxman222,"June 4, 2014",1,"Updated review Wow, the latest version is even worse. Now I absolutely get nothing but the UI telling me what could be there. Every page is white. Not one single video of any kind visible, downloadable, playable. Nothing exists. I've done reinstalls, reboots, nothing makes this app show me anything. No feed videos show, none of my Pro Account videos OR my local iPhone 5s videos show. Just an icon saying I can send my videos to vimeo and vice versa. Absolutely useless app. Sorry, but I'm sticking with desktop. The mobile Vimeo app has been a worthless experience the last few releases for me."
656,Randie B.,"June 26, 2014",1,"A clean look not always a good thing... I really like Vimeo offerings, higher quality, more sophisticated, etc. So I figured the app would make access easier. Um... What am I looking at? Yes videos, obviously, a huge range of 'staff picks' but what is it?? There are no titles unless it's on the first frame. No created by or directed by. No descriptions at all unless you tap to watch, quickly tap again so you can see the pause, then pause it, find the icon with all the little lines, and tap that just to find out what the heck your watching. Want to search for something more specific? Sure you'll get a list of pictures, but you won't have a clue if it's really what your looking for unless you click and open each, hit pause, and open the hidden description. Why not have a menu with staff picks, then on the video the caption could be the actual title instead of the words staff picks along with a small description icon there so you don't have to waste your time. The app is supposed to be more convenient then the web site or why have one at all?"

"

The video editing capabilities are simple yet powerful. the library as well as other features from the desktop version are already there. The app actually complements the experience."

665,crosstied,"February 6, 2014",2,"Sigh. Update 4.0.7.  I really like Vimeo, so I just don't get it.

666,Joe Kir,"August 19, 2014",4,"A Fantastic App for any film aficionado Personally, I love watching student made films from all corners of the world. I’ve also been a part of many college level films all of which our director and film editor have uploaded strictly to Vimeo. Vimeo is the premiere place to upload fantastically written and original work in comparison to other video upload sites. Their iOS app is visually stunning, has an intuitive new “feed” function that allows you to see the phenomenal works in Staff Picks along with your own videos or  “watched later”. It makes sharing your interest with close friends easier and more susceptible."
667,diggeyeleven,"August 20, 2014",5,"Looks so good Love the look of this app, it can be a stock app with how smooth it functions. While I don't see myself loading too much of my own videos I do love the high quality settings and the fact that I can save videos for later viewing without internet. They play real smooth too and the selection is huge which just makes it even better. Some other apps some big competition with this one. A great app for long hours of entertainment. Love the reviews too that can be left for videos, it goes so well with the rest of the interface."
668,bportaro,"January 4, 2015",4,"Update Help I figured out the problem with the recent update. I hope someone from Vimeo reads this. The problem is when you are logged into Vimeo directly on your iPhone through ""Settings"" that login wasn't updated, it is still essentially under the old app version and then when you update the actual app to the new version, it is conflicting with the direct login. Here's the fix.  Simply delete the app, until it is fixed, and still directly login to Vimeo through ""Settings"" and then open up Safari and go to the Vimeo website and login.  Save this web link to your iphone desktop and use that link as your app until Vimeo fixes their update.  Your welcome."
669,AliciaHollywood,"August 14, 2015",1,"Stops every 3 seconds, unwatchable Below is an earlier review for iPad Air. Now I tried on an iPhone 6+ and most of the videos can only be seen in portrait mode which makes it impossible to view VR videos in a VR viewer which makes them pointless... Only found one video that would rotate into landscape after trying several. In full screen mode they are just long stretched out videos in portrait mode. Why can't it do something simple like go into landscape when you rotate the phone??? Is there some trick to this? "
670,bazzoonboy,"March 30, 2011",5,"Long-awaited, better than expected! This is such a high quality, powerful, yet still very intuitive app. I was already expecting an awesome app from you guys & gals, but this (especially the video editor) is way more than what I expected. I also expected it to have major features limited to Plus members, but thank you for making it available to all Vimeo members!"
671,aJetJockey,"April 12, 2011",3,"Marginal on an iPad To claim this is ""compatible"" with the iPad is a stretch. It  works if you double the size of the app, but then it's ugly and inconvenient to use. The main problem is that the app only works in landscape mode while viewing a video. Otherwise, the user is restricted to portrait mode for all functions. This isn't terribly bad on the iPhone because of its small size, but it is down right awkward on the iPad. It feels like you're turning a car's steering wheel rotating the iPad from portrait to landscape and back again in the Vimeo app. Personally, I find it more convenient on the iPad to just log in to the Vimeo web site and view my videos there as I would on my Macbook Pro."
672,Jock_Itch,"December 29, 2012",1,"Epic disappointment Not only does the new app *strip away* many features (bye bye statistics, bye bye editor, bye bye downloading your videos to your iDevice), but it undergoes a major facelift they are claiming is a *good thing*, AND they haven't eliminated a huge, huge bug that has carried over from my iPhone 4 to my spankin' new iPhone 5: uh, it won't even play your videos. I ADORED Vimeo, but I've watched their overzealous developers stretch the patience of their userbase wide & thin by trying to take on too much, and leaving behind the detritus of unforgivable bugs. When you're a video site, it's a good thing if your App actually •plays videos•. I once chalked it up to it being a fluke on my specific iPhone config, but now with an iPhone 5 (64GB), it's apparent. Vimeo? Massive fail guys, and it breaks my heart to say it."
673,Avid vimeo-er,"October 1, 2013",1,"Terrifying - most basic functions nil Not only am I a paying customer, but a proud supporter - been for years. However their development, or lack there of, into the realm of mobile apps has been increasingly terrifying. I find myself unable to load and play my own videos, the most basic and primary functions of a site who solely dedicates themselves to video hosting. This should be first and foremost, beyond anything else. This is a given, it should not be something that is questioned when I touch the play button. Hopefully this equally embarrassing and disrespectful mishap is fixed soon - this mishap being the entire service they are built around and provide. In short, my videos do not load, nor do they play unless I remove then reinstall the app for every play."
674,Do it for johnny!!!,"February 9, 2014",4,Much better than before Videos seem to load up almost instantly when connected to wifi. Used to have issues with it not starting at all. Cell network takes a little bit but is expected. Downloading your videos to the app for quick playback is easy and actually works now. Just wish they would add being able to see the video description. I can live without commenting on the app but those two features would make it complete for me. Glad to see they are working on it. They are getting closer. Vimeo FTW!
675,Sven Jobenson,"May 27, 2014",1,Aren't they Embarrased? Updated Review:
676,dbjn,"May 28, 2014",3,"Finally! A version worth using! The first useable version. If you gotten in the habit of ignoring this app, it's time to download it and give it another shot. The only major thing missing is access to subscribed channels and groups. By sliding the pictures left or right, you are able to like, send a link to others, and download, etc. I use the like button as an indicator that I've seen a video, so it's easy to check if I've seen the video before by sliding to the right.  I can also unlike it by sliding until it changes color and then releasing. Also very fast. I've not had a freeze yet, unlike previous versions."
677,Gus86tavo,"June 5, 2014",4,"Love the easy layout to watch videos but... Aside from the video scrolling, which is a fantastic way to click a video after click after click, the only problem that bothers me is that the video buffering is very slow. I would have to wait a minute for a 1/4 of a 4 minute video to load when I should be able to watch the constant stream without buffering. My wifi is the standard 10-14 mbs of download speed and most of the people using this app, im assuming. Besides the delays, the quality of the app and the user experience is easy and fun to use."
678,Doug Maguire,"January 14, 2015",3,"Privacy settings... The glitch is that I made a video ""private with password"" by uploading on a laptop. Now I'm on a phone. Can't seem to figure out how to make the video ""public"" -- even when I try to open Safari, it takes me to a more enhanced version of this app. Safari has a tab to edit the privacy settings, however, once the new setting is checked (from private to public), you are given an option to save new settings and once refreshed, video is still ""private with password""."

683,BThunda,"September 20, 2013",1,"Limited functionality leaves this app useless While the design and UI of this app beautiful, it's not even worth mentioning and honestly carries no merit. You can't discover content in this app. You cannot search for content, follow new channels or users, or access a users page for additional content by that user. You can only view your previously established feed and likes, etc. If you want to perform any of these BASIC functions from your device, you must log into the site. I expect more from Vimeo! Why can't they provide an app that actually allows you to discover and explore the quality user content the network is known for? It makes no sense. Absolutely pointless."
684,CarGuy777,"December 6, 2013",1,"Great Website, Horrible App!!! Vimeo is a wonderful video sharing website, but this app is horrendous.  It has tons of bugs and glitches that keep shutting down the app on me.  It can't do everything you can do on the website which is a major downside.  You can't even search for videos!!! All you have is a staff picks feed and your feed.  This app is barely worth downloading if that.  Vimeo needs to step it up and come out with a fully functional app that can do everything the website can do and not have so many glitches either.  If you like the website then just pass on this app unless you truly want an app that can only just play your feed on a mobile app."
685,Danbro,"December 27, 2013",1,"A Huge Step Backwards Vimeo is a great service, but this app is terrible. It would be better for Vimeo to not have an app than to publish this garbage. The single biggest complaint you see over and over again in these reviews is the complete lack of any ability to search. This means you will only see a very small number of videos somehow curated for you - however, I am not interested in almost anything presented to me in my feed. Vimeo could take this app from 1 star to 4 with the addition of search. When will companies learn that users are not interested in apps with extremely limited functionality versus their web counterparts. It's a shame, IMHO Vimeo should fire their app developers and start over."
686,mobilemike,"August 6, 2014",2,"Slick ideas poorly implemented The Vimeo site works very well in mobile Safari. So, why an app then? I came looking for a better experience and was pleasantly surprised to find offline viewing as a bonus feature. Sounds great!"
687,Lialiakicks,"September 27, 2014",4,"How to Upload a Video w/o crashing I mainly got this app to occasionally upload videos. After failing several times to upload a short (under 1 mintue) video, I discovered the trick. You need to temporarily TURN OFF AUTO-LOCK while you're uploading a video. Also, don't do anything else on your iPhone while the video uploads. PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN AND DON'T TOUCH IT AS VIMEO UPLOADS THE VIDEO. (That's right, this app requires a bit of patience from the user.) For my 4G cellular data iPhone 5S with IOS8 update2, my video uploaded in about 2 minutes. "

691,good4jake,"January 31, 2012",1,"How Disappointing Finally had a project to work with that had more than one or two clips. OMG the app continually crashes. Worse, it never saved any of the work before it crashed. I have several clips with a few stills that total might be a minute 30 in length. This is just a real great disappointment. I have done everything suggested, clear cache, reset app, clear memory of all apps, hard reboot of phone and even reinstall. All it has gotten me is major frustration with the same end result...crash. Finally had to resort to iMovie to output the movie. Didn't have the control but then it didn't crash and I got a movie out."

Everything looks like it's working okay however it seems to cache files in the app storage and the ""clear cache"" in ""Settings"" does not address this.  I had over 5GB used before I realized it and the only way I could dump it (after it began crashing) is to uninstall the app and re-install.   First noticed the problem when the videos were failing to upload without explanation.   Like the look/feel, however I want it to work right!

Search results seem severely limited; for example, I only get about 20 results for ""kinetic typography"" but searching on the website yields over 4,000 results. Finally, the ability to update your profile picture would be a handy addition."

Once I start playing a video from my own account it's impossible to restart it. Every time I try really strange things happen. The video freezes on a frame but the soundtrack keeps going or the video fast forwards for a few seconds (and that's unstoppable) and then resumes playback from a random frame within the content range that was played before. Accessing stats for a video ends with one message only: ""technical difficulties"" and it's always the same. I have fast wireless at home and fast Verizon Fios so these problems are NOT network related. This app is a MAJOR FAIL!"

You can only watch your videos, the feed and the watch later(s). No video searching. You cannot even read the description of any video you want to watch. Not an improvement. It does look nice, but you guys down graded this app. Not that the previous version was the best ( it needed to be improved) and it wasn't, but still significantly better than the latest. PS: mobile sites have always been a horrible idea, please do not encourage us to use them they are not user friendly even though they are practically forced on us."
697,epapz,"June 25, 2014",1,"Watch video from Facebook link is broken I was excited to download the vimeo app to watch a video of my friend's wedding which she shared on Facebook. I clicked the link to watch, downloaded the app, and created my FB account. However I was never able to get to the video. Please fix deep linking of videos in app. Otherwise the app is beautifully designed other than the fact that the vimeo team obfuscated search functionality. Also searching for my friends video by name also did not prove successful so maybe there's some hidden video permissions. Just confused but hope the vimeo team can resolve these key usability issues so I can use their app since it's pretty."
698,Dccbcm,"August 28, 2014",1,Not compatible with website My universal settings on Vimeo are for videos to be set to private and require a password. I just realized the videos I've been uploading from my phone are defaulting to public and I see no way to change this without also logging into the website.  I am trying to share videos of my child with her grandparents and not have them public.    Once I realized this I logged in and changed them all to private and set a password. Now I can't share any of them from my phone. What is the point of the app if I also have to login on my computer?  The settings for the videos should be the same no matter how they are uploaded.
699,Nikster_K,"May 7, 2015",1,"Very buggy Offline videos don't always playback when offline - airplane mode or not connectivity. But, if the video has trouble playing back, it disappears when you are online. I list all of my offline videos this way. The feed is also limited and does not show all the items you see on the Web version. Share strongly encourages you to share to other video users by hiding the usual share options. Most people I share with are on other networks and I would think that's good since it my shares would bring them to video. The video playback is better than past versions that could not hand any fast forward activity."
700,SensibleMadman,"March 29, 2011",5,"A Dream Realized Vimeo is the best place to host your videos on the internet. Finally with the Vimeo application you can shoot, edit and upload directly to Vimeo all on your iPhone.  I would have been satisfied with only the ability to upload to their service but Vimeo took it a step farther adding editing software and the ability to share your video on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Wordpress.  Great job. A really solid application."
701,acharles,"April 22, 2011",5,"Vimeo app rocks Thank you Vimeo for releasing an app. The Staff Picks list shows talented works you may have missed out on. Very clean layout to navigate through. In future releases it would be great to see a search function and comments on the videos. I haven't used capture or edit tools much but this seems like a feature you would expect in a pay-for program, so kudos to you for releasing this app to us at no cost!"
702,Mark Adkins,"July 29, 2011",5,Works for me Not really sure what everyone else is saying how it doesnt work for them.  Works perfectly for me. I don't use it for video editing but for managing my stuff that's already on vimeo and watching videos it works fine.  I guess it's hit or miss if it works for you or not.  Suggestion for users: videos might load faster if you're connected to wi-fi. 3G can be slow when loading videos.

As someone else stated about iphone app, I have to power off and restart ipad to get it to work again.  Why wouldn't there be a specific app for the ipad instead of just for iphone.  Haven't used it enough on my iphone to know if the same problem occurs but I really need to use it on the ipad.  Also would like to be able to access my contacts.  If there is a way to do that I haven't found it.  Please make a specific version for ipad!!!!"

Even something as simple as sharing a link on Facebook or Twitter has failed for me."
705,bazaar apparatus,"September 9, 2012",2,"Glitchy This app is frustratingly bad, especially given the quality of their usual work. The entire point of Vimeo is watching videos, and yet the video player in the app is so terrible that you can never skip to a certain time or even, heaven forbid, PAUSE the video without it freaking out. Once you pause it, that's it. Game over, man. Hope you're wanting to watch the video all over again, because that's your only option unless you want to sit and watch while it fails to continue playback and just skips back and forth by a few seconds until you quit the app."

I have searched for videos that I can actually see on the site, but the app will not find them."
708,jenjen06100,"March 25, 2014",5,Better than others that are similar! I really love this app compared to others that are similar. When connected to wifi the videos load instantly and require no buffering. The videos are easy to close out of once opened and I feel like the upgrades make it better than it Once was. Would definitely recommend to others! Fast and user friendly!
709,South_FL,"March 31, 2014",5,"Amazing Since the date of it's inception, (which wasn't very good), this app has continued to evolve. The UI design is gorgeous and intuitive and the functionality is not only up to par, but continues to grow with each update. Hats off to the developers who made this happen. This is exactly what an app should be. It's clear that the team behind this utilized all of their resources and creative energy for this app. Keep up the good work."
710,Sahadeva,"August 8, 2011",3,Great but undependable. I took my new iPhone 4 to Paris for two weeks and took a lot of video thinking I could just upload it to vimeo when my phone filled up. Sadly even the smallest videos I tried to upload via many different wifi connections failed about 85 percent of the time. You can imagine how frustrating this is when your phone is full. Granted Flickr's video uploader was even worse and this must be a hard technical problem but if you're planning on traveling and depending on Vimeo think twice.
711,kylethebrownie,"October 21, 2012",5,"Great App! The reason why I like this app so much is that you can easily click the camera button on the home page, then it goes straight to the camera on your phone and you can snap a shot from there and then update it to your Vimeo account. You can also easily like videos, you can favorite them, and you can also easily post a video from your phone on the go!  Great app!"
712,Nic biz,"October 25, 2013",3,"Looks great for browsing but.... Not much here for the content creators. Now way to upload, manage,comment. So this is missing some features I would like. "

Honestly, to me, without an upload function or a search, I don't see what the point of this app is when I can just view the site in Safari.  I've noticed other commenters say there is a search but it's nowhere I can find it.  But I was hoping to upload from this app.  And what about the content we can pay to watch? I like the simple design of the app but the simple features make for a weak experience. :/"
714,Camille Sharoni,"December 28, 2013",5,"Yes, there is a search option. I don't truly feel that this is an app that deserves five stars, I am simply trying to offset the reviews of the countless morons who gave it one star for not having a search option."
715,Sammy Nerf,"May 10, 2014",4,"HUGE improvement. I don't know what happened internally at Vimeo, but all of a sudden this app just got serious. (It sure took awhile). It's far more usable and intuitive now, with video info and comments easily accessible. The only thing I'm surprised about is 'Staff Picks' has gone missing. Bring that back!!! Will change from 4 to 5 stars when that happens. Finally some solid, solid work from the Vimeo team. Cheers."
716,tlakova,"May 20, 2014",3,"Not Great But a Step in That Direction I initially had playback issues with the most recent version of this app but they have now seemingly been solved. While not perfect, it's OK. Interface wise, it's a definite improvement over the last revision. Organization is a bit better also. Overall, once the issues were ironed out, it's actually fairly good. However, buffering is still relatively slow compared to other streaming video services and sites, even Vimeo's own website."
717,bibbywv,"May 28, 2014",3,"Still Waiting for Viewer Stats Can't understand why this app doesn't provide stats on videos, yet.  Also, videos tend to freezes up after initial playing, which then requires a couple of steps to replay the video.  That shouldn't be.  When it plays the quality is good and I enjoy the feature that makes the videos on the channel roll silently before being selected."
718,Makaipi,"April 10, 2015",5,Outstanding Format and Help Section. Vimeo is a helpful outstanding program with a format that helps regular guys like me who just want to put videos of the family or share a little adventures with friends. I'm not a producer of  big anything but God bless the guys who do an outstanding job through the Vimeo media. Thank you guys and girls on the staff from whom I have gotten some good info. Take care.
719,Arcadium1177,"August 4, 2015",4,"Normally great, but... I'm a huge Vimeo fan and in general I'm a huge fan of the app. Very clean design, well executed etc. A few glaring bugs exist though, lists work odd and if I watch a video it goes back to the top of the list (especially frustrating in your favorites). Also, I notice that a lot of the times the videos won't rotate into landscape and stay in portrait. "

722,@smaedli,"December 17, 2012",2,"Needs work By now basic mobile user interface issues should be a thing of the past, but unfortunately for Vimeo they haunt this entire app. The UI regularly becomes unresponsive to taps, gestures, etc. so aside from missing features others have mentioned, it has missed the fundamentals of quality application development, too."
723,ScottF2384,"December 26, 2012",2,Unfortunately Lacking Vimeo needs to find a way to bring the great web experience over to their app. I am of the opinion that Vimeo should first focus on fixing Feeds and search functionality before trying to turn it into a video editor. If that is something that they are interested in doing then I believe they should look into splitting that into an off shoot application. It's unfortunate that this app still has a long way to go before I start to really use it. Until then I will be sticking with Vimeo through Safari.
724,OJ JP,"January 21, 2014",5,Entertaining I love enjoy Vimeo when I'm bored or completely don't know what else (which happens very frequently) and i enjoy the whole concept of putting network of videos together and letting people. Also don't know what version you guys are on but it's pretty fast on my iPad. Watched Miley cyrus on snl the other day and not a single buffering was stopping her from being crazy.

But immediately it was trying to get to my photos, contacts and videos to see what it could upload - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  Hold on there.  I just want to look, not share. I finally found my way to other videos by clicking a Feeds link in the middle of a menu.  I would expect a Home button at the top to do that.  There's a fine line between innovation and confusion."

At some point recently, though, you took away the ""Likes"" menu and now it takes me much too long to find the videos I am looking for. I've come to rely on this app, but will have to stop using it if it is too cumbersome to use. Currently, I'm back to my desktop because I can't find videos I've already liked using the app."

Sign up for a free Vimeo account and download this app. It's all free. You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.
731,Bhbasecamp,"January 24, 2013",5,"This app is exactly what I was looking for! The built in video editor seems very functional for free.

732,MediaJolt,"September 19, 2013",2,"Not ready for prime time I was really excited to see this version of the app. Vimeo is a site I visit daily and I liked the previous app a lot. So you can imagine my disappointment at how limited this app turned out to be. No search, not all of your favorites show up (or Watch Laters, for that matter), and no access to channels or any of the other features that made the previous version so useful. I hope the Vimeo folks are working on this - it would be a shame to limit access to such a wealth of wonderful content!"

The only thing that pops up is the dragdown menu which is clickable but every single window I navigate to is blank.

I can't even brows what you want or see my own uploads. Instead, like everyone else, I can only see likes, watch later, and videos pushed to me by vimeo. Not very collaborative. Oh...

I even went through the process of a password reset through the Vimeo website just to make sure that it was correct and even after doing this I find that I am still unable to login through the iOS app even though I can log into the website just fine.
765,rssnbabe19,"December 14, 2014",1,"The app is disappointing. I love the Vimeo website and I'm basically on it everyday. The app however has awful functionality. The design is cool, but none of the videos will play. It used to work before I updated the app. Everytime I click on a video the app quits to home screen. I have not been able to watch or download a video since the upgrade. I can view Vimeo videos on the web, fb, and vk but not in Vimeo. It's frustrating. I want to delete the app but I am hoping they will get the crashing problem resolved soon."
766,Ablitism,"April 8, 2015",5,"iPhone 5 👍Luv it It doesn't crash for me on the iPhone 5, and is super useful. I was looking for a good way to store my videos, which take up most of the space on my phone. I love the ""private"" feature, which allows me to store the footage there without worrying about other people viewing it. Thanks Vimeo!"
767,cameraguy1980,"September 21, 2015",1,"Still crashes/locks up i use vimeo as viewing tool to my high-paying wedding and commercial clients and so far, this app has led to another disappointment.  it is absolutely useless to me when i open up this app up to show a client their project and the only thing i'm greeted with is that smiley face staring back at me for at least 10 seconds and a crash.  "
768,moultron,"April 1, 2017",5,"Great place to host Videos to my coworkers I started using Vimeo approximately 6 months ago. It is a great place to host basic videos and share with friends, family and coworkers.

769,Photoinmotion,"August 18, 2017",2,"App is okay but lacks much needed functionality I love Vimeo and the app is, well, okay. It works but it isn't great. As a Vimeo Pro member I really wish you could manage more from the app. It's very basic. Being able to view advanced stats, manage portfolios or collections and just have functionality that more closely mirrors the web would make this worth using. If you want to watch videos, it works. If you want to manage your Vimeo account it borders being useless."
770,Potpotsie,"April 17, 2011",5,"Cool Its really a cool/good app and makes it so you can make a video, and just edit it on the go. As opposed to transferring to the computer and then editing. Free. iMovie is $5.00 I think so I'd say this is not a bad deal in any way. Although you should fix some of the crashing errors. But here is five stars for working most of the time."
771,Lio Convoy,"April 26, 2011",5,"5 stars with the new search feature My only gripe is the strict limit of what the search results give compared to the website.  That's not enough to lose a star in my books, but it's annoying. Other than that, fantastic app all around and worth the wait!"
772,TheNorthCoaster,"March 3, 2012",4,"Not bad This app really isn't that bad. It is a HUGE improvement from the previous version but there is definitely room for improvement. It spazzes out while scrolling through a searched list of videos but is probably the worst problem. No crashes. In my eyes this app is a success. It serves its purpose, but work still must be done."

Overall this app is one of the best in the AppStore don't trust others reviews until you try it
782,GlatenRob,"May 6, 2014",4,"Good but needs work Well compared to using the website this app is a bit of a let down, and searching for videos most of the time is a miss.

784,GDU3man,"November 6, 2014",1,"Barely usable I am not sure whose bright idea the new interface design is. But it is crap. I can't find what I am looking for. Browsing is a pointless exercise. There appears no way to narrow one choices by genre or anything. A wall of tiles are shown to the user. No titles are given. Movie trailers, short films, kid's films, personal videos, whatever all crammed together with no way to sort them. To top it all off, there appears no way to get any help. "

I wish they fix there apps. Does that make clear how good or bad it is if you get it. You may or not experience a lot issues depends on iOS version being used. Newer version more issues you have with apps.
787,Bruxxxus,"April 3, 2015",1,"Just use a computer I had this app and deleted it for some reason. Today I downloaded it again so I could purchase an On Demand video.

The app seems to respond slower after each video I watched. Every time I tapped on any button, it would take 30+ seconds and longer just to switch between play and list view. This seems like it has great potential and I would really love to use it when the bugs have been squashed."

If you like frustration, you will love this app. I never review apps but I have to warn people here. #1: Search Function (I feel like this is vital) if you can find it/get it to work (over half the time I could not) it does not allow you to see all the videos by a user even wen you know they exist and have searched for them specifically. #2: it will let you watch a video then suddenly stop and tell you it's not a ""mobile compatible"" video. REALLY?... Half the video is and half is not???"
793,Dan Des.,"March 20, 2014",5,Can't speak more highly! I can't speak more highly of Vimeo and it's organization except that their mobile app is a little jaynky. Doesn't always open up or play videos with audio. Hopefully they work these bugs out in the newest update.

795,baglador,"August 16, 2014",1,"It really makes me wonder if you guys even have a QA dept. I check in on this app every once in a while to see if there's been any improvements, and every time it's the same: 9 times out of 10, when I tap a video, it will take me to the video but nothing happens. Now it's even worse. Feed, Watch Later, My Videos.... NOTHING LOADS. It's staggering, really, when you consider how awesome Vimeo is, that they devote so little energy to making a mobile app that works on even the most basic functional level."
796,FoundNFlag,"December 6, 2014",5,"The best they can do. Still supporting film makers. This is a very good app. Unfortunately because of Vimeo's business model and Apple's App Store policies they cannot offer in app purchases of movies. Vimeo gives 90% back to the producers and Apple would take 25%, it might be higher, so you can see how the two clash."

803,Ghostface Dermatologist,"July 7, 2014",1,"Terrible Minimalism taken to its nadir. I am pretty sure they were listening to Philip Glass while designing this featureless, useless rewrite of what was once a prominent app. The UI is terrible, and self-discovery is non-existent. It will take you about an hour to figure out that what you were looking for doesn't exist. Skip downloading this app and use the web interface instead. A sad, sad day for usability. Jakob Nielsen would place this app in a urinal, to use instead of those little bees used so that men aim their stream in the sweet spot."
804,Samsamboy400,"September 1, 2014",4,Getting better This new update made the app functional which is all i need without being able to watch videos. But still needs to be user friendly dont give up on this since things gotten better keep moving forward

What is wrong with these apps recently that are limiting functionality? I'm surprised Vimeo has gotten that comfortable, lazy, and apathetic towards users."
807,MuzikAppJunkie,"August 19, 2015",4,Favorite app for watching music videos This is possibly the best app for watching music videos of any genre or era. The sound and picture quality are awesome.

However anytime I close the Vimeo app it totally forgets what I was doing and where I was so I have to find my spot again. Not to mention syncing my last position across the network to it's website or other devices. :/ at least remember my last position on my device. Even my vcr could do that.

I don't want to share videos with others if I can't tell how long they've been around, how many people have watched them, what the filmmaker has to say about them, etc. I also can't get info about other videos by the same maker, to see if I'd enjoy those too. Really disappointing."

815,Brian Hawkins,"December 25, 2013",1,"Love Vimeo, Hate Their App I'm an avid Vimeo user and really enjoyed the previous version of this app.  However, this new version is oversimplified such that it's useful for very little.  Uploading videos is no longer possible.  The ability to sync videos for offline viewing is a nice idea, but it rarely works, and if I add or delete videos the changes don't sync.  Most of the time I can't even watch my own videos while connected to wifi. Vimeo, please just revert to the old app."

I can't view playlists, and doing normal functions as checking people you follow is a hassle. The app doesn't even fit iPhone 6/6 Plus screen resolutions, a big disadvantage from using the desktop site, and very late to the game compared to other apps. Hopefully the guys at Vimeo figure out how to make a decent app."

824,Sherryist,"January 21, 2014",1,"Yeah Horrible My app was working fine, just fine until there was an Adobe security breach. Vimeo made me change my password (which is good) but when I did so and logged back in, the app completely stopped working. I'm logged in and everything but the app won't show my saved or favorite videos. It won't show me staff picks either. The only thing that seems to function is the search button. Otherwise, I am looking at a blank screen. What a waste of space."
825,Jheovanni,"February 10, 2014",2,Not so good update This newest update is a total bust. Even with full service or full wifi the videos  continuously stop playing after every few seconds.

Even long 20 minute video loaded quicker then this new updates 2 minute video

I like how you can save offline videos that doesn't need internet but at times, many other apps could do that. It's an alright app that tries to make a useful app but it doesn't overshadow the other apps that are out there."
828,dandaninc,"June 29, 2016",5,Vimeo is Fantastic! Huge fan of Vimeo. The desktop and mobile versions of the website as well as the app are easy to use and built for those of us that appreciate independent videos. I definitely prefer Vimeo over other video streaming sites and even the free account has plenty of room to store videos and 500MB is a great size for the upload cap.

I have simply been trying to watch videos...not doing anything crazy. Just be aware it will probably be frustrating to use."

I love the app but it has so many issues, specially with the video editor, there are problems when the music is added, plus there is no option to import from voice memos, which makes it hard to include voice over without recording directly from app. Needs work, but it will be a great app after this is fixed."
844,Flipped,"September 29, 2013",3,The GOOD Vimeo is getting beaten up about problematic issues that are valid. I want to point out what really works for me with this new version. I LOVE this interface that shows a nice big still for each of my videos and Scrolling down through these is an absolute joy and great use of space. Kudos on this visual breakthrough. The app gets three stars for this design alone. 
845,Tans,"December 14, 2013",2,"Apple TV bug I love vimeo, it's a great concept. Yet this app is very poorly written. Search functionality is seriously lacking. "
846,Johnyth88,"January 21, 2014",5,I like it Vimeo could well be the best alternative to other mainstream video sharing sites out there. But this app is a wee bit wanting when it comes to features but pretty solid when it comes to sharing near or far. Nice.
847,Charlie Pryor,"April 26, 2014",1,"Looks nice... If you have an account Requires having an account in order to use it now. Bad move. That needs fixed, because regardless of what the developers believe is a good thing - take it from the negative reviews here: it's not."
848,blackadam130,"May 3, 2014",5,"Good Still a couple of improvements that needs to be done here especially on the search function and customizations department. It shares and plays videos though, and does them very well. But most of all I love the content here."
849,JeffersonSantander6,"August 20, 2014",5,Better than on Safari Using the app version of Vimeo I noticed a load time improvement than when I used it on Safari. I would really recommend this app for people that watch videos on Vimeo
850,Packy 26,"April 14, 2011",1,No search button Okay I really think this would be a great app if you could search for certain video's. I haven't ever uploaded any videos bit there is a very important video that I love because my son was featured it and that is the wishard telethon story 2 my son was a premature baby and was featured in the telethon and on my iPhone I cannot watch this or show others how great the hospital was and what we went through so I think it would be great if we could search certain videos.
851,fortune4chin,"July 3, 2011",3,"You guys were amazing...what happened? When it comes to enjoying a high quality video developed and sustained by a community and respectful and creative individuals, Vimeo is the only game in town. However this app lacks key functionality for the end user to have a robust experience. There's no browsing by channels, groups, or albums. No AirPlay support. <----huge. C'mon guys you can easily make these adjustments."
852,BdotEdotCdot,"October 8, 2012",3,"Needs work App plays other's videos fine but when trying to play my own vids it plays sound at different rate than video.  It sometimes doesn't even play the video.  When trying to use the edit feature and uploading video from own library, the app crashes.  I love Vimeo but this app needs a bit of work."

855,Alejandro9212,"October 12, 2013",1,"This app is a terrible representation of Vimeo Vimeo is an amazing platform to share videos on your desktop but the app is horrible. The UI needs a major overhaul. I wish it was easier to look through your likes, watch later etc. The app is just one high headache. I truly love Vimeo on my PC & I REALLY hope you all can find a way to immulate that on phones"
856,Geniushuh,"February 24, 2014",5,"Airdrop is great! Like many other apps, this one does well in playing videos and is easy to use. However, the feature that I can airdrop the videos makes me choose this app. Easy to share videos means a lot!"
857,dlcmc32,"July 16, 2014",2,"Much prefer the Web Version Noticed others had trouble saving, as did I. Sometimes works, sometimes does not. It is hit or miss with searches as well, lots of disorganized and randoms in the results. Also had issues with freezing on playback, but this could be an issue with iphone itself (4s)."

860,Rob_Rz,"April 15, 2011",4,"Needs search, great for watching your own videos This app is great for watching the videos you uploaded to vimeo, but you are out of luck if you want to search for others' videos--this app is missing a search field for the videos posted by others to vimeo."
861,nealwilliams,"June 27, 2012",2,"Half-baked So many things about this app seem incomplete. The stats page has never worked and tech support has acknowledged that, saying it would be fixed in a later release. I can't share with Facebook or Twitter via the app, either. Each time I try, I see Vimeo's 404 page from its site. I really want to like Vimeo but if this app is any reflection, I wonder if it's nothing more than great idea plagued by poor execution."
862,MrOnegin,"September 16, 2012",1,"Pointless for a regular visitor I'd like a Vimeo app instead of using the web site. I would watch more Vimeo content. But there's nothing to this for a non-video maker who doesn't want to log in. Little ability to browse, no metadata or comments about the videos, and you have to be a member to do anything--surely the app could ""remember"" a video for ""later"" or show me the description without me needing to log in! Completely misses the point of bypassing the web with a customized app. To me..."
863,Tzimtzum6383638,"December 17, 2012",1,Password protection issue After viewing a password protected video in the app - which in this version you can longer change passwords - it automatically removed password protection without warning.

867,Hooya,"May 19, 2014",1,"Worst programming of all time. It's just appalling how Vimeo cannot get this app right. In its first incarnation it couldn't even keep synced with what you tagged for Watch Later or Favorites either through the website or on your Apple TV app. Well, they finally fixed that but if someone sent you a password protected link and you mark it Watch Later through the web interface, the app will not play it. The Apple TV app will but this app just hangs and does nothing. FAIL!"
868,Joe Williams 797,"March 16, 2017",4,I like Vimeo When it comes to music videos I love the offline mode the best app on my iPhone 6s. I can't wait to see more videos downloaded to Vimeo. From the internet from other accounts! And can't wait for them to bring porn to the app ?? That's all it's missing and it will be excellent!
869,spritemap,"May 31, 2017",1,"Can't *really* disable all push notifications Despite manually toggling off each individual lightswitch option under Vimeo's Push Notifications settings pane — and despite their support page's insistence that they don't blast out notification spam — it still happens, and for inane/boilerplate messages (""Explore new ways to browse!"", etc.). The annoyance of this overwhelms the relative convenience of using the app instead of the mobile site; thus, deleted."
870,ethan545,"April 13, 2011",5,"Waiting I have been waiting for a vimeo app for a very long time. In the bit that ive used it, i think its great, i instantly watched some of my likes and the quality was great. I dont upload videos often, so i havent had any problems. Thanks vimeo."
871,Rickv2002,"April 15, 2011",4,Wordpress upload Well I love this thing! Except the fact that it won't let you upload to wordpress. Once you start typing out the post you can't click the bottom post button. You guys should really check this out! It's the only reason I gave you 4 out 5 stars!
872,skellener,"June 11, 2011",1,"Sloooooooowwwwwwww...... This app is ridiculously slow.  I don't mean to load the videos.  Just to navigate the lists and browse is painful.  If it were a paid app I would feel ripped off at any price.  There's also no ability to share the videos at all.  Not in email, not in social media...nothing.  Vimeo needs to rewrite this thing from the ground up.  It's pretty useless the way it is.  It's a shame.  They have great content on Vimeo.  Too bad the app isn't as good as the content."
873,s1rfh,"November 10, 2012",4,"Really great! I just download this app on my iPad 2.  Reading the reviews, I did not expect that it would work at all, or if it did work, it would be problematic."
874,Corey The Great,"February 8, 2014",2,"Time for an update The app crashes kinda frequently on iPhone 5 iOS 7.0.4 . . . I'm really trying to hang in there because I love the great video content Vimeo has to offer but PLEASE launch an update soon! How about some new features? Isn't it about time? It's 2014! Make vimeo a serious contender. I don't want crashes, bugs, or limited features. Spice the thing up a little will you? Sincerely, a real19 year old guy in Texas."
875,itsgladys,"March 21, 2014",4,Takes a bit of time to get used to This app is nice in a way... But it does take a bit of time to get used to the functions and different options. I couldn't really find the search function until I really went to figure this app out.
876,drod84,"April 9, 2014",2,Meh... The app looks nice and it's cool that you can download or watch later.
877,BruceCisns,"July 12, 2014",5,Convenient for videos Great for playing and easy sharing of videos wether miles apart or inches away. It never fails. Love the easy navigation and as I said the simple sharing options. Works undoubtedly well for me right now!
878,Kai.Huang,"August 19, 2014",5,"Great design Does everything it promises to do, very well designed application. I can spend hours on hours just watching random videos. This one makes my viewing experience better than normal."
879,GloriaD,"September 15, 2017",5,"Professional simple to use Lately not every app lives up to their promises.  This app does everything it says it does in a non-glitchy way, fast upload from any platform, easy to use, well priced"
880,KT12Y,"August 22, 2012",5,"No problems. Was able to login and search videos from my phone as if I was on the computer. Wasn't going to download when I saw all the bad reviews, but it worked fine for me!"
881,Full Trucker,"December 11, 2012",2,"Could be better... I'd really like to be able to see another user's profile, subscribe to their feed, and see all their videos in one place. Not being able to do this seems like a HUGE missing component of this app. Also, I have a video set to private, and when I edited it I saw no way to make it public. Shouldn't this be a standard feature? Decent app, needs improvement."
882,Jnssn,"January 23, 2013",2,"Tough to like You can manage your channel with it, I guess? Are a lot of people shooting and editing videos on iPad to upload to Vimeo? If you've got a good ""Watch Later"" list you want to go through, it would work well enough, I guess. Searching is pretty bad. I'd really like  to be able to do something as simple as viewing a user's profile. Hope we get some better features soon!"
883,Onthe Goe,"September 24, 2013",1,"Massive Mistake This app is a complete failure! First there's no sound on an iPad. Second I'm tired of watching the ""kidzilla"" videos that automatically play when I log into MY Vimeo account via the app. Third, there is no search feature (among other issues). Fourth, you can't do anything with the videos and resolution on the iPad is terrible. Fix this app or remove it until you make it functional! Since there is no ""zero star"" option, I give it a (n)one star."
884,Bestarlet,"January 8, 2014",4,"HD sharing! Vimeo has a artistic appeal and offers quality content, visually. However, browsing feels a bit marketed, and it can take some time to find what you are looking for. None the less, this is the best site for HD video sharing. Very easy to navigate and app runs smoothly."
885,rondoD4Hamil,"February 12, 2014",5,Awesome! Works fine for me. Able to store my videos fast and smooth. Sharing them couldn't be more easier too. If you like watching videos on the go then this is the app for you.
886,ECU Pyrit,"March 12, 2014",1,"Wow...surprisingly bad! For as much as I LOVE Vimeo, this app is almost completely useless. You can view SOME of your own work and others you've bookmarked but doing just about anything else is either impossible or too difficult for me to figure out. I should mention that I run an ad agency/production company and consider myself fairly tech competent. Most of my videos don't even show up including all of my private videos. What's the point of this app?!?!"
887,wmcerny,"June 12, 2014",5,"Love this app! This app just keeps getting better! The layout is awesome. I just wish that every time I open the app, it asks if it can post to Facebook and I decline every time. I just wish that it would stop asking me."
888,Thinkstorm,"August 18, 2015",1,"Bad UI, freezes, bugs, no download So sad, how can this be so hard to get even halfway right?!  The app constantly freezes - no only does the video stop but the whole UI is unresponsive. Forget downloads - you can only play them when your connected with reasonably good reception, no matter what you downloaded - so no watching on commute, offline, etc. "
889,fivethirty,"August 2, 2016",5,"hot diggity! I thought the last update was great, and I didn’t think the app could work any better. Wow was I wrong! Vimeo is so slick. I can watch all my videos, then text them to friends and it opens right up in the app for them!"
890,Micah T,"October 28, 2011",1,"Awful and dissapointing I've been using vimeo for two years now (pro for one) and it is by far the most professional, artistic, respectable video site on the web. This app is none of those things. It crashes more than it runs. It's the PC of apps. Maybe even, more specifically, the Dell of apps. If the purpose of this app is to test your patience and build a tolerance for the disappointments of life, it does well. If it's to play videos, however... major fail."
891,drewfenheimer,"November 2, 2011",4,"Nicely done Enjoy the layout and UI quite a bit, app has always worked for me and is considerably faster than using the site when you quickly want to show a video. "
892,gecko luke,"November 29, 2012",1,"super bummed being able to edit settings on a video is very important for me while on the move and not being able to specifically change privacy settings is very frustrating. some videos need to be taken off private ASAP sometimes, and that's what was so convenient for me with this app. now that possibility is gone, and I'll have to figure out another solution. "
893,Jeff H45,"September 22, 2014",5,"Amazing I'm still a big fan of the app. It would be amazing to be able to have user controls of my videos. Privacy settings, thumbnail etc... But I get it, it's a work in progress. Keep up the great work! :) Vimeo"

After loading it onto my BRAND NEW iPhone a colleague's pro account loaded, not mine. To make matters worse I CAN'T LOG OUT!!!  The only Vimeo account in my settings is my own. I tried clearing it, deleting the app, shutting down the phone and starting from scratch and it still comes up as my colleague's account!  This is a major security flaw that needs to be addressed. I recommend that you DO NOT USE VIMEO UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED!!!!!"
896,Lolohasstones,"December 16, 2015",5,Thank you! The content is amazing. What really makes it shine is the ability to play picture in picture mode so you can do other things. Thanks for adding this feature!

900,Ineedanicknamepleasehelpnow,"April 17, 2012",1,"Troubles Would love to get more from this app. It doesn't work well over 3G, and any break in the signal seems to make the replay grind to a halt, never to return. This may just be a limitation of iOS. Unfortunately, since it doesn't cache the videos either, it's effectively impossible to watch a video more than a few minutes in a real-world, mobile scenario e.g. in the car. "
901,Jonthefear,"September 18, 2013",4,"Great interface, slick ideas, but limited My title says it all.

For that alone this app rocks."
902,Drome McKauliff,"October 16, 2013",1,"Loss of functionality The old app was helpful. This is a broken app now. It should be called ""Vimeo Browser"" or something similar. It doesn't let you edit video settings, it doesn't give access to your channels or groups. It's sort of a pretty-but-shallow thing that replaces the almost-fully-functional previous version if the app. I want an app for power users and content creators. This isn't it. Please move back the other direction."

Alas it cannot deliver on its primary objective - streaming videos. Some videos won't load at all, the app hangs and crashes, and if you switch too quickly from Inbox to My Likes it loads the Inbox anyway. Fix the bugs and I'll gladly up my rating. Vimeo deserves better!"

920,Tina Lowry,"September 19, 2013",2,Total Views Would have given it 4 stars at least prior to the OS7 update but not now.  Before the update I was able to view the total views directly from the app. This was a great feature!  Bring it back so I will know if recruiters are viewing my video for a college scholarship for sports.  Or at least give an option to be notified when someone has viewed your video.
921,snghog,"October 1, 2013",1,"Gutted Simpler is not always better. Sometimes simple and beautiful are just marketing jargon for gutted and useless. They added offline viewing, but took out browsing and searching. Sharing from your phone is still just as easy. But who does that really? Not Vimeo's core user base. Bottom line, I wish I could revert back to the Dec. 2012 release, and put the current version back to alpha where it belongs, for 6 or so more months of development."
922,Ant N,"December 1, 2013",1,"Surprisingly bad It's surprising that someone who has done such a beautiful job on the main website would not only approve but then release such a bad app. The one star is purely because the simple design seems nice at first but then it reflects the lack of any features. Beyond not even being able to search, download or even upload videos, my latest videos won't even update when signed into my account."

I have to use the Vimeo website to play my own content. And the latest is that it constantly popped up asking for access to my FB friends and it wouldn't let me deny access. I had to shut the phone off manually using the power button. What gives, Vimeo?"
927,Matt@cbus,"May 1, 2015",4,Vimeo OnDemand You are missing Vimeo OnDemand access on this app. I would love to rent films from your platform on my devices.

You can't open any other persons channel or see what other videos they made. The search bar BLOWS!!! can't find anything. Always says no video found, even if searching a name that I know is on there. Pretty much Vimeo needs to fix a lot of stuff with this app esp since so many people use it. MAKE IT LIKE THE WEBSITE!!!  It's 2012 get with it Vimeo"

When I launch a vid all navigation seems to go away when the vid starts playing. I can't pause it, make it full screen, rewind, etc. tapping on the vid does nothing. This is a mid-beta release at best. I love Vimeo and really want this to work. I will look forward to updates."
935,donnlawler,"September 29, 2013",1,"I have to agree As much as I hate to, this app is not up to standards of Vimeo. I used to love watching videos on Sunday morning but with the older version, I had a way of searching and I could view my channels... Now the selection is gone as are my channels. I can see my videos, which is great and all but after spending 80+ hours editing them, I really want to see something new. I hope these lower ratings brings a new app that is useful."
936,Alextowning,"January 21, 2014",4,Something good Not the best of features and functions on the search system for an app but still worth it when it comes to sharing videos for the people close to me. Interesting layout but needs work.
937,Inspector Cruzo,"May 28, 2014",5,"Works for me I use the app just for viewing and sharing my vids, and for that the app is great. Nice simple clean and clear layout and that's all I need for now. Haven't explored or used other functions of the app."
938,Leonesa58,"June 9, 2014",4,Good quality Videos Great upload just a bit slow. But I believe that is me. Love the description and the way I can manipulate the video with easy to understand symbols!  Four only because there is always room for improvement. God job!
939,WarrenHaynes,"June 29, 2015",1,"Offline videos do not work. I downloaded a video to watch offline in preparation for a trip overseas. This was to have something to watch on a plane where no internet connection was available.  I could not start the video playing offline. Later at a hotel with internet connection, I could start the video. So in order to watch an offline video, you must be online?  That's horrible!!"
940,jklier,"April 15, 2011",3,"Good Start - But no iPad? A long awaited app, and for a first version it delivers and a step up from the browser based use model."
941,dosto233,"May 31, 2011",3,"Needs plenty of work.... Plenty of crashes, freezing up, refusal to export. The concept and design are all there, but its still not quite usable. I like to export my videos into my csmera roll to eit a different copy on my mac, and still havent been able to export a single one. The most cinsistent crashing Ive seen yet (even after reinstall)."
942,Gaster4,"March 15, 2012",2,"Scrolling issues I love the Vimeo website but I was very unimpressed with this app. When I'm scrolling through my subscriptions or ""watch later's"" it keeps changing the order and messing them up as I'm scrolling. Also every time a video is uploaded, it adds to the size of the app. Please fix these really annoying bugs and I'll definitely give it 5 stars."
943,doof94603,"September 22, 2013",1,"Just bad The people who work at Vimeo are dummies, trust me I know, I've looked them up before. They're Brooklyn hipsters who think they know film but know nothing at all about it but apparently that marvels in comparison to what they know about apps. How do you take away the ability the search for videos??? I guess when you're as self absorbed as they are they figured that you only want to see your videos over and over again"
944,Jayzimhan,"November 8, 2013",3,"Homepage I love Vimeo, the service. Hence the three stars."
945,willNgraysford,"February 14, 2014",5,Great App! Awesome fun app. Easier and faster than other apps I've tried for videos. Although search results aren't as complete as via the site. Still you can't beat its sharing features. :)
946,Robert Mohns,"May 4, 2014",1,"Useless. Pretty, but useless. Attractive design, nice pull-to-do-stuff content first design. If all you want to do is watch stuff I guess it's okay, but you can't manage your own videos. Want to change privacy settings? Replace with a new edit from iMovie on your phone? Correct a typo in a title or description? You're out of luck. Go to Safari, then find the link to their desktop site."
947,Marc Pearlman,"June 3, 2014",5,Vimeo I have never had an issue with Vimeo because I know from my four years with them that they care about there customers and provide an amazing service.
948,ClarkyJK,"June 16, 2014",5,"Simply awesome Not only do I get to share my videos fast and effortless, I also enjoy and learn a lot of things on vimeo and it's wonderful score of inspiring and entertaining videos. Thumbs up  to Vimeo for all the help it has given me!"
949,Cement2000000,"May 27, 2017",4,Good but make a block button There are some people that steal my stuff on there so I want to block them from seeing my account. Please make a block button as would it not only be beneficial to me but probably many others.
950,R1cks0nCas,"January 20, 2014",5,"Very good in terms of performance Love the features, airdrop and the ability of instant playback while offline. Little by little this app is becoming up to par with the best social apps out there. Keep it up."
951,AStuKingsly101,"January 24, 2014",5,Pretty nice Somewhat pleased with this app even though it has some problems like freezing and stuff. But still it let's me enjoy videos whenever and wherever I want them.
952,br4ndonkrow,"February 10, 2014",5,App works fine contrary to others Works fine specially for sharing videos. Playback is nice and smooth and not sluggish at all. And as is with the earlier versions it is pretty easy to use. Good job!
953,JD207,"February 13, 2014",3,"Getting there Certainly a step up from previous updates. However, videos still struggle to load occasionally and seems to still have a few bugs. Hopefully they'll smooth remaining issues out. Vimeo is a great site, hope the app catches up."
954,natewells7,"July 14, 2014",5,Quality Vimeo makes posting edits and also discovering others work easy and it's a clean format. I enjoy the easy to use interface and the kind of quality film makers it attracts.
955,Arthur Menezes,"September 24, 2014",4,"Really like the new update! I had a ton of issues with the last version. The latest update takes care of most of them. Great streaming, really easy to find great content, and a simple, intuitive interface. Really like it!"
956,ksanders308,"November 19, 2014",1,"Slowly.....slowly....getting better. Kind've. I'm not sure why innovation takes so long with this app. But here's my suggestions that would make this app worth having: Chromecast support(seriously...) and couch mode(not necessary, but would be super nice). No one is asking for gesture controls, everyone wants to be able to stream to their tv. "
957,mjgk,"March 26, 2016",5,Much Improved Recent update provides much better user interface. Navigation is much more intuitive. Have experienced no problems. Thanks.
958,thebishop,"August 8, 2016",3,Needs work Would love to see a search function on my videos. I have so many videos uploaded to my account it's impossible to find them without having to scroll down forever. 
959,McLeod Media,"March 13, 2017",5,Loyal user I joined Vimeo in 2009 and it has become the permanent home of my products for clients. Can't imagine housing my films anywhere else - the interface is great and the appearance of the video player page is perfect.
960,Anthony65,"August 8, 2012",1,"Awful! First it doesn't list my favorites or has access to the video albums I've created and when I search for a particular music artist I get maybe 10 or so video results and I know the results should be more then 10,because I search the exact same artist on my PC and tons of videos come up. @ Ron Angeli-What doe this App have to do with being a democrat?! That is the stupidest comment I've ever heard, but I should expect that from a tea-bagger."
961,Phillio jp,"November 3, 2012",2,"Playback stinks... Vimeo, I love your site, but really dislike your app. What's the deal guys? I'm sure your working on this problem of slow playback that a lot of people are dealing with. Even connected to screaming wifi, the videos restart and I can't skip around at all because the video will freak out. Please vimeo, do us a solid and get on this issue sooner than later."
962,adikted2musik,"October 24, 2013",1,"All aboard the fail boat! I'm pretty sure Vimeo hired 7 year olds to make this app. Or the people at blackberry. (It doesn't matter they're the same.) Regardless, this app is awful. No search, you can't see anything about your account... It's just awful. The functionality is literally gone. This app is just wasting space on my phone. Fail Vimeo, fail... Listen to your reviews and go redesign this thing before you lose all of your loyal fan base."
963,Wabbapets,"November 18, 2013",1,"No edit, no description, no nothing! DO NOT UPGRADE!!"
964,appmonstar,"November 28, 2013",3,Great I like the app feed view which most of the video plays instantly and has the ability to share videos online. Many of the old features are no longer available I wish they would bring them back. I like the older version better.
965,Ayanmo,"May 15, 2014",1,Video pauses too much I've seen a lot of commercials on TV that had vimeo involved in it and thought I would try out the app. I was very disappointed on how slow the app responds or should I say plays video in the feed. Everything else is okay with the only exception of actually doing what the app is suppose to be. I will check back to see if there are more improvements with playback speed in the feeds. iPhone 5s
966,TheDridge,"May 31, 2014",4,"Very responsive and fast One of the most responsive apps I've used, especially for video. Not good for managing pro or plus level features (stats, settings, etc), but for viewing and sharing, it works really well."
967,Jordan0134268,"July 8, 2014",1,"App does not work The videos does not load whatsoever! I have great wifi and no problems with internet connections. All of my other video streaming apps work flawlessly, but Vimeo is ridiculous! I get no more than two seconds out of a video and then it goes straight to buffering or freezes. This app is a joke! NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
968,Cpittman428,"August 26, 2014",1,"Horrible Used to love this app so I could watch videos without internet. Now nothing works... So many good reviews still for some reason (not sure why... it doesn't work for me). Some say ""must only work for iPhone 5... Well I have an iPhone 5 and still nothing works. Basically just a bunch of blank screens no matter what and if I try to check my profile and update it or look at my likes it boots me off. Crap."
969,Laser claw,"August 26, 2014",1,"The last update broke everything In the past it showed my vimeo content and after the update I get nothing. Videos, likes, watch later are all blank. When I open my vimeo profile in the app settings I can see all 110 videos I've uploaded over the past five years. And it still sends me alerts when people like my videos. They really should revert to a previous version of this app"
970,justinmthomas2003,"February 27, 2012",4,"A big improvement… The new design is a big improvement compare with the previous UI design. The reason for only 4 stars out of 5 is because I did experience a crash. Despite the crash, I am happy with the app. It's much better."
971,IronLordVex,"February 28, 2012",5,Great app! I used to be on the main site now i use this app all the time. Also nice new updates and features. I also love the fact its not censored to artist. I will definitely be using this for a long time.
972,PjRads,"July 28, 2012",3,"Unhappy, but neutral review. I like Vimeo, but one problem: this app doesn't work."
973,larsnJoewis,"October 7, 2013",5,Good but needs work Awesome app for watching videos. I use this app and the website whichever is most handy to me at the time. The staff picks are interesting but I would really love to search for videos for myself.
974,bradseticive,"January 23, 2014",5,Update and tweaks in need I really like Vimeo but this app needs to be updated. Controls don't work normally and the search option is bordering on useless. Speed somehow is pretty good though so that's a nice thing.
975,DHastingsZeds,"January 24, 2014",4,Needs a good update Does not have some of the very basic features it should have and searching needs some parameters. Hopefully this gets updated and become as powerful as with a browser. I prefer Vimeo over utube anyday so please work on this!
976,Unaired,"August 19, 2014",1,"Why make an update live without testing on all devices I noticed that there are people giving great reviews even after this horrible update. Does that mean they've optimized it for iPhone 5 users ONLY? I've got a 4s and I can't see ANY of my videos. This app was great about 3 or 4 updates later. Been crappy ever since. I hate to say it because I like the vimeo brand, but even the desktop version is weird too"
977,Cordesika,"October 14, 2014",4,Advice for installing latest version Tried to log into my account with latest version. Still could not connect to my account. Deleted app and reinstalled it. I was then able to log into my Vimeo account.
978,Kaye.. Pls help me,"August 2, 2015",3,"Help pls Hello ! Good day !! Pls fix the bug or something . Whenever I go to my ""watch later"" the screen turns black and it stays like that for a long period of time . Or when I click the vimeo app it  will load then it keeps on kicking me out of the app .I'll go back to my home screen . Pls fix it .. Thank you 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃"
979,Jon.Baillie,"September 21, 2016",3,Volume Issues I'm unsure if this is related to the app itself but the volume of videos is very low when I cast to my TV.  I'm using Chromecast from my iPad Mini 2 (iOS 10).  I had to turn the volume of my TV up really high to hear properly.  Other apps like Netflix don't have this problem when casting.
980,A man with a plant,"April 15, 2011",5,"I'm gonna give you the 5... I know there's still some work to be done. On first roll-outs there always are. But I think this will be one of my favorite apps... I mean come on, video editing, uploads to vimeo, etc. etc."
981,PianoDr,"May 16, 2011",1,"So much potential, so many problems This could be the best video editing app out there, but it freezes, crashes, plays blank video in the editor, etc., etc. I've tried multiple times to create a simple video comprising 3 short videos of 20 seconds each, and still no luck. "
982,skeptict,"November 1, 2011",3,"Has potential This app has potential, and I hope they find a way to get it working properly, but for now it's kinda buggy.  I'm able to upload videos, but it crashes when I check the stats on a vid.  "
983,DanDelphicO,"October 6, 2013",5,"Just the right stuff The better alternative when it comes to watching interesting videos in my opinion. Works pretty well so far, thanks a million!"
984,J_*el,"December 14, 2013",5,"Search issue now fixed! Bravo! App now includes the search, again, and it seems to work much better than before."
985,johnkpetamil,"January 20, 2014",5,"Loving it! Perhaps the better encarnation of sharing and taking pleasure in videos from almost everywhere. Easy to use, quite fast and has lots of great stuff."
986,holiottrrr,"April 1, 2014",5,awesome I was asking for the search feature and now got it. it does take a long time waiting but finally it shows up. no more complain
987,roekeloosmax,"August 19, 2014",5,A beautiful video app. Love it. I like the progress Vimeo has made over the past few updates. I'm really fond of new clean UI and the camera roll feature is pretty awesome too. Keep it up!
988,Yadda37,"March 12, 2015",2,App and mobile version won't let you change privacy settings. I can't change my privacy settings on the app or mobile version of the site. There are no options on the privacy tab. You have to pay to get extra features and it takes forever to get videos posted.
989,Crash 23!,"May 13, 2016",2,"Thrown on the bottom of my feed page I'm constantly being thrown on the bottom of my feed page whenever I watch a video or go on and check any channel or user videos.

990,Enciter,"April 1, 2011",5,"Worth the wait! This is the best video app out there. All the needed Vimeo functionality PLUS editing, music & titles on the go! Great job. I take back all the nasty things I said about you guys for taking so long to release an app."
991,Usmc224,"July 20, 2011",5,Please Read! This is not a perfect Ap but it is easy to use and it has very cool features. On top of all it's free. I have not had any errors or crashes. It let me edit a video and upload it no problem.
992,zpalma,"March 8, 2013",4,"No problems I just downloaded this app to my iPad and it works fine. I can watch videos and even access the watch later stuff I saved on my Apple TV. It might have problems on some phones, but works great on my iPad."
993,MiguelAngel316,"December 20, 2013",3,"This app could be so much better I've never written a review, ever on any of the apps that I own. I just feel that so much can be done to change this app for its users. I love Vimeo and easiness to use on computer. Please fix it. Like when I try to to pause and play it back it restarts to a part I've already seen."
994,Mountain’s Gate Production,"June 8, 2014",2,"Please fix I know you guys pride yourselves on being a small company, but please, please focus on us, the customer. This update constantly tells me there was an error playing a video. Then won't let me take the actions presented. It's just broken. And for god's sake, why do you not include notifications? Either on your website or the app? I don't get that logic one bit."
995,Camerartus,"June 11, 2014",5,"Vimeo - really works! Simple to use. It's very easy to use. I enjoy the quality of the videos. Most importantly, the videos that they suggest are often some the most amazing vids I've seen!"
996,Joatfo,"July 27, 2014",1,"This app is a waste :( Unfortunately, I'm going to delete it off my device. I love vimeo online so I thought the app would be worth my time but it's not. I can't do anything. I don't see any videos. When I search for videos nothing appears. Nothing! I just don't get it. Smh. What a disappointment. I really don't even want to give it one star, but writing this review was a must. People need to know. I hope they improve this app."
997,nealhamburger,"August 18, 2014",1,"Really? I really like vimeo, it's a great website.  But this app is just pathetic.  This last version is completely broken.  Nothing works.  And I disliked it before that as well.  If you pay for vimeo plus, this app has nothing more to offer you.  It's confusing, slow and now completely useless.  Stop trying to ""design"" an app and start developing something that is easy to use and works."
998,Мariia,"March 22, 2015",1,"Can't sign up It gives me an error when I try to sigh up with facebook on iPhone 6, after I signed in to fb on my phone it is displaying an error asking to grant access to Vimeo from facebook... Looked everywhere on my phone couldn't find that option. Even if it is out there and I just couldn't find it, they should make it clear! Give some instructions... So frustrating...."

1000,RaoulDuke71,"April 25, 2011",5,"Thanks for the upgrade Now that there is a search feature,  along with the rest of the updates, this app is awesome. Probably shoulda' been there to begin with though."

1003,JamesWil1,"October 5, 2013",1,"A confusing experience When I first opened the application on an iPad mini, I saw three or four videos that appeared at the top half of the screen, and the bottom half of the screen was blank and dark gray. Next, I tried looking for a search bar or option, and couldn't find one. Finally, searching through the small number of options I decided to give up using Vimeo."

1005,Sancor3,"October 21, 2013",5,Awesome job guys! The vimeo app is finally usable! A few minor details here and there but overall I feel like I get the same experience as the desktop version. Keep up the good work!
1006,groovey grove,"December 21, 2013",2,Love Vimeo hate the app Changing from portrait to landscape is nearly impossible. I would like to view people's pages and be able to follow them while using the app. Also uploading videos in app would be convenient rather than having to do it on a laptop or desktop computer. Happy with Vimeo but the app needs a lot of work. Thanks
1007,Yaeliscool,"December 4, 2014",4,"Too much water The app is pretty ok. Nothing close compared to the website, or at least that's what everyone here thinks. I am however, really happy there is a download option. I think it makes the app much cooler/better."
1008,AM-LA,"June 4, 2015",5,"Can't complain I wish they would support 4k already, but video quality is clearly a step up from the other free solutions out there"
1009,Lois D. Roehrs,"June 5, 2017",5,My videos are full resolution & easy to share. Using Vimeo allows full security via password or-- share special moments with a just a link that will work!
1010,Obis11,"September 19, 2011",3,"It's really good but I love this app, (despite the fact that this app is needed because vimeo embedded videos do not play in safari for me most of the time) but I rarely watch vimeo vids on my iPhone. I almost always use my iPad for video, so I feel a native/universal app for iPad should be made available for users in this situation."
1011,Butlertotheb,"October 18, 2011",4,Decent but problems Vimeo app is great but it crashes every time I look up statistics the app crashes!  Also it would be neat to input actual video numbers instead of only having the search option.
1012,Nickc_swerve,"June 23, 2013",5,WORKS AMAZING I was mad Vimeo videos weren't playing on my iphone web browsers (3 different ones) but I downloaded this app and all the videos work fine and loads a lot faster in here for some reason.
1013,Hri609,"October 19, 2013",5,"Vimeo This app provides a simple and effective approach for the user to have a better experience during watching and sharing videos, not to mention its pretty cool UI design. Nice job, hats off to the developers!"
1014,CalvinBtwo,"November 19, 2013",5,5 stars for me This seems useful for streaming and sharing my content. And streaming here seems to be void of crashes unlike the other one I've tried. So it's a good job all in all.
1015,Juan_Yone,"November 25, 2013",2,What happened? No search! This has become an almost useless app. One of the main reasons to install this on your iPad or iPhone is to easily search for videos. That is no longer an option!  I am finding myself using Vimeo less when I'm on the go. Unfortunate because I really love the caliber of material you can find on this site.
1016,ormily rogerds,"January 23, 2014",4,Waiting for more improvements This app is a little shaky on the controls plus the search feature doesn't do much. Content wise though vimeo still rocks compared to other similar sites.
1017,ArtemisFitchLockerbee,"April 24, 2014",1,"Bugs make this app unusable. I deleted this app a couple of months ago because there is no way to either allow or deny access to my Facebook feeds--the action box appears immediately after logon and keeps popping up regardless of which option I try to select. There is no way to get beyond this prompt, making the app unusable. "
1018,VickynPaul,"May 19, 2014",2,"App not working? I just downloaded this app after finding it and remembering I have an old Vimeo account. I was excited to watch old movies of my kids but it won't play all the movies.

I don't want to find friends on Vimeo. I want to watch videos. Very shady and misleading and disturbing"
1020,prmstr,"March 3, 2013",1,"Vimeo App -- Fading to Black Love Vimeo but having a real hard time understanding two things:  One, why the iPad app is so buggy (fails to play videos).  And two and more importantly, why does the company appear unresponsive to its users' feedback?"
1021,flipgimble,"May 31, 2013",1,Really primitive App crashes every time  after you tap the banner in safari. Search never returns any results. It makes it impossible to watch a video you found on the Internet within the app.

Also a functional search would be good too. Every time that I search for a video that I know exist on Vimeo it does not come up. Kind of a let down. Please fix ASAP
1034,GoDj1rrA,"May 24, 2013",3,"Good potential The quality on the videos is great, but as other users have said it crashes quite a bit. How come you can't search all videos also? I know Vimeo has the Blurred Lines video and it doesn't come up. Potentially a great video app with some improvements."
1035,Rpoloroman,"October 7, 2013",5,"Nice app Managed to upload some videos without any problems and now I was able to share them with friends. I'm quite impressed, thanks."
1036,Richi3P4rra,"January 26, 2014",5,I like it! With this app sharing videos couldn't be easier and uploading them isn't bad at all. This app gets the job done fairly well.
1037,Ecmproject,"February 3, 2014",2,"Never works So I sign in and none of my videos are there. I search for a video with the exact name and nothing is there. Unless I hyperlink to it from somewhere else, nothing is there (except for a kid in a dinosaur suit walking around). It's too bad, because your desktop has become a standard for streaming HD. But this thing, it just doesn't work."
1038,OdeToRoses,"March 28, 2014",3,Still bad but not quite as terrible... Only slightly more useful than before. If you aren't signed in you will receive general 'unable to play video' errors - or so I found - and there is nothing to tell you to sign in again. I feel like that's pretty basic...
1039,Hermione06_23,"May 13, 2014",5,"Two Thumbs Up!👍👍 I really like Vimeo and was happy to find an app for it. The app is designed very well, so I appreciate that:) Won't waste your time! It hasn't messed up on me, but I can't speak for everyone. Great app!"

I can't watch my own videos without giving Vimeo access to my contacts?  Guess I won't be using this app."
1068,mattbehrens,"November 22, 2015",3,"Nice app, but back button plays hide-and-seek This is a pretty nice app for viewing Vimeo's pretty nice content—except I keep getting stuck on video pages while my back button vanishes.

On both my iPad and iPod, the app frequently crashes, gives an error when trying to display comments, and generally doesn't do what's expected. SO SO fewer features than the website version, it's just not worth bothering with. Again."
1072,OptimusPep,"September 18, 2013",1,"Terrible Redesign This latest update strips the app of any useful functionality. There is no longer any way to search, nor is there a way to upload content. The design itself feels far too cluttered. What happened to the use of white space, this feels far to congested. Why cram everything together and omit the most import features that existed in prior versions. Will be uninstalling"

1081,Texas yes,"December 8, 2012",1,"Lame Vimeo just can't figure this app thang out. I mean come on. It isn't that hard to do some basics. The newest version of the app just makes things worse. At least before it was confusing on how to do even the basics (to finish adding videos you click ""cancel"" for example). Now you can't even create a video with multiple videos or edit them. "
1082,MDAviar,"November 7, 2013",3,"Good/ bad Love Vimeo and the videos. The search function for the phone app was def needed.

That really needs to be fixed."

It constantly cashes while trying to share to Facebook or twitter, as well as when trying to vote stats. It's almost useless unless you want to use it as a vide player. Disappointing to say the least. I will make sure not to pay for another months service."
1091,Keyser Sozay,"July 31, 2012",5,What's the fuss with the one stars? First off its FREE! You who slam a free app are knuckleheads. Second this app is awesome and does magic IMO.

And yes I have an new iPhone.
1128,LincZS,"July 11, 2015",2,Can't watch password protected videos in app Can't watch private videos in the app? That seems like a serious oversight. This is the major reason I use Vimeo.

1141,JimCoulChan,"November 19, 2013",4,"Needs work I am one of those who prefer vimeo over other sites, but don't use it much cause of lack of good functionality and customizations. Improve on these and this'll be a no brainer choice."
1142,librawin,"December 10, 2013",4,Good In fact I think this app is better than others I think. Quickly to play and high definition on iphone. I feel satisfied.  It need to include more various of kind videos.
1143,Fri612,"January 7, 2014",4,Excellent application This app is way better than most video players mainly because it offers a wide variety of content. I would definitely recommend this app.
1144,wuhaopu,"February 26, 2014",5,"good This is a very easy operation software, allows us to store photos and share with friends, even if there is no network off-line can operate"
1145,jppacca,"June 3, 2014",2,"Still room for improvements The app is getting better finally, but I can't believe they still haven't added the option to edit privacy sertig of your own videos through the app. Also the search tool could be a lot better."
1146,Tigran222,"August 10, 2014",1,Have tou used your own app? How can one possibly screw up so badly with basic usability? Why do I have to sign in with Facebook and give a list of my friends and news feed to watch a video? Why does video close when you tap on it? Why there's no landscape mode? And finally why do I have to use this terrible app instead just watching a video on The Vimeo site?
1147,nachonate,"October 15, 2014",2,"Many updates... Still lacks key features Ability to search my own video feed and adjust more video settings inside the app such as passwords, privacy, and other of the desktop functions - otherwise it's not functional for a PLUS subscriber who helps fund Vimeo."
1148,DirtyMartini1,"July 19, 2015",3,"Adding videos to a channel It would be really awesome if we could add a video to a channel from the app. As it is, we're still stuck having to go to the mobile site or a desktop to do something so simple."
1149,Lady Engineer,"March 8, 2017",1,"Shocked about open nudity I'm totally shocked about the total nudity on some of the videos without the proper parental  vetting Controls that should be in place. While I feel that some of it is in good artistic taste as an artist myself, I feel most of it is raunchy and in poor taste. Somehow I feel that Vimeo has a responsibility to censor or somehow totally block until some sort Controls are in place."
1150,drumsonly,"February 12, 2012",3,"Good app...for free anyway. Great to have my videos on hand. And as others have said, the app does crash when loading stats. Hope for an update soon. However it's not life and death if I don't have my stats right away. And it shouldnt be for you either."

I have 3 ios devices and its the same issue.. Its not a network/ wifi issue.. I love Vimeo but the app gets ob my nerves.. The browser version works fine
1153,Nursin Mamma,"November 29, 2012",1,Disappointed! I used to use this app so I could edit my class' videos and upload them to our class website. Even though it would crash throughout the process I still found it valuable to use. Without the editing ability this app has no value to me. Please bring back the editing ability!!!
1154,mikey_n,"January 4, 2013",2,Crash and unable to load. The UI is extremely nice and easy to use. The only problem the app has going for it are its ridiculous load times combined with the crashing of the software. I suggest holding off on this app until these minor issues get fixed.
1155,Futurephonic,"March 24, 2013",3,"Good Great looking app, playback is great, but search is limited to just a few items killing the utility. Would also like to get to a person's profile page from their video. I'll keep the app but likely use the web to search."
1156,cunetto,"December 28, 2013",1,"No functions! The Vimeo app used to be great but the new version is terrible. No access to metrics, no ability to upload or download video, I can't even get my videos to sync. The different video feed views are kind of pointless, as I'd like to use the app to manage my content, less so to view and discover new content. The app now is little more than a viewer. New app please!"
1157,EmilHickorees,"May 9, 2014",5,"Beautiful. Such a pretty, elegant user interface in this new version of the Vimeo app. It just works, really well. I could waste hours on the ""Feed"" watching all the brilliant Staff Picks."
1158,VisualSeed,"May 13, 2014",1,"Slowly getting better. After the revamp of the app left it essentially featureless, subsequent versions have been slowly adding back missing features. I wish Vimeo would work on the app’s playback performance. If the app can’t play a video without sputtering and freezing, perhaps you should consider getting out of the video streaming business."
1159,JonSnow32,"June 24, 2014",5,"Great app This app is just great. Simple, clean and modern UI makes it very easy to use. Videos are in superb quality and staff picks are always very interesting. Worth to try!"
1160,Local H,"December 28, 2012",1,Still can't password protect videos Vimeo decided to remove this option from the app (unless I just don't know how to select it now) from the previous update. Now it's just public or private (me only). Please bring this back and I'll start using it again. In the meantime I'm looking for a better way to share videos with family members.
1161,The Chris Cali,"December 29, 2012",1,No videos will play !!!! Forget the video editors and special features of this app how about fixing the opinion to watch videos without it crashing or just not loading!

1162,DaveS2000NYC,"September 21, 2013",1,"Congrats, app is now completely useless The old version crashed all the time but it was a complete app. This new garbage is just basically an advertising machine.

1163,YamarieM,"October 16, 2013",4,Great but ... There should be somewhere in the app. Where we can see how many people saw the videos we made our selfs. I have to go on the internet to check that. It's annoying. Please add this.

1166,Gofake1,"May 21, 2014",4,Nice design as always Would appreciate a darker theme. I really liked the gray color used in the last version. Staff recs would also be nice. 
1167,fbara,"May 30, 2014",2,An example of horrible user interface design I can't see the titles of the videos. There's just a large image with no words. I try to find a title by swiping but instead I'm either downloading the video or sending an email about it. This is a terrible product right now.
1168,dwayne-o,"April 26, 2015",5,"Love it! Well done. Looks great, easy to use. Only note, they may want remove the outline on the video player progress bar; it's unnecessary. Simple is beautiful."

I'm just puzzled as to why a veteran media company would release something so... weird. Obviously removing the search function was intentional. The result is not good, it's not Mac style minimalistic. It's annoying and inconvenient."
1181,MiguelAMunoz,"December 8, 2013",1,"Nice design, crappy or non functionality I could have given zero stars if possible. My videos are a no show even when they are ""sync"". I always give up after a minute and I better open my browser, there it loads in seconds."
1182,Robert Fisher,"December 13, 2013",1,"Useless I can’t find any way to search. I read that search is available on the iPhone, but it seems insane that the app would have search but not expose it on the iPad. Even crazier for a video app not to fully support the iPad."
1183,taylor76012,"January 11, 2014",4,Really nice I find this app really cool because it lets you answer other people through instant video recording and sending.  I find it cool and absolutelly different from what I've seen before.
1184,Mergy,"January 15, 2014",2,"Miss view and stats features Not being able to see the views or statistics on my videos through the app is kind of a bummer, and therefore I use it less than I did before. The app is very well done but adding those features in would really increase it's usability."

Nothing has been done about thing problem still. I am disappointed with the service."

You are a leader in the online community for sharing videos and not even a single update to address the endless crashes?

You cannot use the app unless you register ether via email or facebook. The client then tries to gain access to your photos and twitter account. It's more data mining and activity sharing in my life that i just don't need.

I pay yearly for pro with Vimeo and all we get is an unusable app. Very disappointed. This should have been tested. I've tried in on my iPhone 6 and iPad Air. Same problems on both devices.

1260,Charles Fries,"April 21, 2011",2,"Not Worth Downloading This app's UI is great, but the app itself is very confusing.  When you try to add clips to your project, you cannot use ones that are on Vimeo; only clips in your iPhone library.  Also, you cannot adjust when the clips appear in a project.  Very, very frustrating.  But hey, for a free app, it's okay"
1261,EZipper,"May 20, 2011",2,EZippy Would be really great if I could watch more than three or four videos. After that it appears to load the vid but just displays a black screen. Only a shutdown and reboot will correct the problem only to have it happen again. Frustrating.

1324,Max the Platypus,"August 4, 2013",1,"Bad move. A huge reason that people switch from a more popular video sharing site (hint: it starts with You and ends with Tube) is that they don't like useful features snatched away from them without good reason, an explanation, or, thank God, an apology."

1365,Jojos circus,"July 13, 2014",2,Ugh Okay I love Vimeo but sometimes I try to watch a video and a message keeps appearing about how I can't watch it but I have options it's really frustrating me and can you guys please fix this bug I'm on full LTE and even with Wifi nothing seems to work :(
1366,AndrewMarksMusic,"September 2, 2014",2,Needs a lot of work Needed to reinstall a few times in order to get the uploading to work. Not a lot of options regarding your channel and what info you want on it (same with your video's info). Seems like they didn't finish the app.
1367,The Return Project,"August 10, 2015",2,Crashes/Bland design I really enjoy the videos and the ad-free experience. But there have been several crashes with the iPod 5th generation. Hard to tell when they happen (mostly when trying to download videos for offline viewing).

1373,kcnobody,"June 21, 2011",3,Good but could better I really like this App.  It packs a lot into it and it's free.  It just really needs to fix the crashes and bugs.  I use the video editor a lot and for a free editor on your phone it's awesome...minus the numerous bugs of course.

Don't get me wrong, I love Vimeo and their content, but just when I thought their app couldn't get any less useful, it did. Previous versions of the app had an atrocious search engine, which this version solved by doing away with searches altogether. Because who needs to find anything anyhow?"
1377,mtn.hiker,"September 25, 2013",1,"Useless The app was designed to let you watch your own videos, videos from your feed, and from your watch later queue. It's great for doing only those things. Otherwise, it's missing search/discovery, comment view, ability to comment, ability to open a URL to a video."
1378,Lorson Family,"October 26, 2013",1,App is garbage How can you create an app that doesn't include search? This app is completely useless.  Everybody does everything on their mobile device now - why bother with a web app? Just make your mobile at work in a browser. I'm deleting this app until it has been fixed to usable state.
1379,Squidmon2,"March 21, 2014",1,Updated crash This ap was working great just before I recently updated to the latest iOS a week ago and now the ap crashes every time I try to launch it.

There needs to be a purpose form creating an app. From the beginning, this app crashes frequently, it locks up, and for get about trying to search for things. You never know what you looking at. No titles, authors, descriptions! The inter face is a failure. Rethink it Vimeo or get out of the game! This is worthless!"

1384,Chris In The Desert,"October 10, 2014",1,"Why this app? The mobile online version of the site is much better than this app. The Vimeo app is exceedingly poor and poorly designed. Frankly, I would fire the development team who came up with this app. The web based mobile site is all you need. This application is worthless; an embarrassing gimmick. Deleted!"
1385,TréLo,"January 14, 2015",3,Please optimize for iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 plus Please. I want to be able to see the full high definition quality that my new iPhone 6 plus has the potential to bring out. Optimize for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

1388,Soon-to-be tourist,"May 25, 2015",2,"Keeps logging me out I like this app a lot but it keeps logging me out. I have a very secure password and it's a huge pain to have to type it in multiple times a day. The error message is something about the connection, when I hit retry it signs me out."

1390,Chefuli,"October 6, 2013",1,"Even worse? Why don't you guys get a professional to design this! Now it won't even launch. Been patiently sending feedback, just hire a proper app developer already! I know the guys from Tigerspike ( they did the Economists' app) I can pass along their info. Really frustrating glitches because it has some great potential."
1391,egophec,"October 6, 2013",1,Hmm... This app lacks the ability to search for videos. I suppose I can setup a watch later playlist but that is a bit time consuming and clumsy. Hope they actually take feedback from the people in these comments. For now I'll just delete the app and check back later.
1392,taylorjoan761209,"December 8, 2013",4,Vimeo Excellent app thank to which you can share your photos astraight away with those who you want.  Easy and realiable way to share your pictures.  Good
1393,Evspc,"January 9, 2014",1,"Old videos don't work I joined vimeo years ago when it first started.  I logged in and the site won't play my archives.

1394,Troll-Jew,"February 3, 2014",2,"Needs Improvement I love vimeo, everything about it. Except for this app. It just doesn't seem to work, I don't know why, but you know it's not my job. However it is yours, please do what you can to fix it. Until then I'll be sitting here NOT watching videos."

1398,Mcredpearce,"April 11, 2014",2,"Need ""news feed"" I love videos. Vimeo needs to fix there app, by biemg able to follow people from the device, suggested videos, being able to see what you following from the home screen. Also the search bar should be more visible."
1399,williambacky,"April 29, 2014",3,Need Upload Progress/Queue All I do is upload and I would love to know the status of the upload and when it's complete. The quick notification that disappears is not helpful

1404,Le Renard Subtil,"June 10, 2014",5,"Highest praise I like the new interface, it runs reasonably well on my second generation iPad. I imagine it is really great on newer devices."

1410,Studio217,"December 5, 2012",1,Poor UI User interface is poor… You would think the first thing engineered would be a search by category function but it is no where to be found.  Both the online and iOS versions seem to be going backwards… Feels clunky and uncomfortable to navigate - a brand killer Vimeo - sad to say.
1411,Frankieslucy,"April 13, 2013",2,Frustrated! It would be nice if I could access those that I follow from the app so I can watch new videos that way. Instead I have to go to their websites and add them to my watch later? Am I missing something? Ben clicking on everything for hours now!

1425,A-Brown 378,"May 21, 2015",1,Vimeo rules. This app does not. This app has a lot of dead ends that leave you stuck inside user pages without the ability to escape. I have to quit the app and relaunch in order to navigate away from certain pages.

My laundromat has a better app.  Who the hec are you hiring to do you IOS work? An intern? I mean seriously guys this app is useless. Are you guys broke that you can't afford an iOS guy.

This time is the saddest experience I ever had on Vimeo. Back to basic please!!!"
1439,Icemann78x,"December 17, 2014",1,App crashes The app used to be great. The site is awesome and Vimeo on Apple TV is great too. The iPhone app constantly crashes since the new iOS.

1440,Raimundo Valenzuela,"April 16, 2011",3,Great but... It crashes a lot and there is no search and no share. On the other side there are awesome videos and you can edit and upload just from your iPhone.

1444,WilFromTheFutr,"September 18, 2013",2,How do you discover new content I hope I'm not overlooking something but it appears search and content discovery has been completely removed. If all I can access is what I interact with via vimeo's site then this app is a downgrade not an upgrade.

1452,Klimb a Tree,"November 10, 2013",2,No descriptions? Where do I find a video description? I used to be able to read a quick summary before watching. Now that feature is missing. Your quest to simply cut out way too much! Very disappointed in the new update.

1598,EJORO,"October 4, 2013",1,What happened? The search is gone? What does this app even do? Nothing is relevant. Maybe a little bit of cool factor with the video previews but man...very disappointed with this update. I can't even see or find the videos in my own account!? What's the point of logging in? Please fix this!!!!!
1599,lolcat0,"October 14, 2013",1,"No sound. No sharing options. And it crashes. Didn't think Vimeo could have possibly screwed their app that badly after reading reviews, but upon installing I found out that they did."
1600,VillageRat,"February 2, 2014",5,Amazing Great app! Love being able to watch things offline!
1601,GTown78,"August 16, 2014",1,Do not update!!! Ruined the app Everything was working fine until the last update. I can no longer look at my own videos because the app wants to access your contacts which I denied. Does not work the same.  Please fix!
1602,Noobert707,"August 16, 2014",1,Gets worse with every update As useful as the apple news Stand app. 
1603,Mr. Javelina,"September 1, 2014",1,"Absolute junk Beside the shortcomings already noted, the App shows nothing but black screen when trying to play video."
1604,technoprayer,"October 1, 2014",2,a little better getting better but the video window keeps going out of sync with the phone screen. I have to reset the app and start over to get back in. please fix. 
1605,Navak.Dario,"October 27, 2014",3,FEEDBACK - search bug It seems like the app crashes when the search time gets exceeded and founded videos are cero.
1606,kx11,"April 11, 2015",5,Finally ❤️ it! No sign up required... to begin watching.  Also ❤️ the chromecast capability.
1607,Trestles Shredder,"December 27, 2015",2,Compatibility issues Love Vimeo but the app leaves a lot to be desired. Can't stand having to re log in every time I want to like or watch a clip later. Need to fix compatibility issues in a major way. Sorry Vimeo
1608,Riley James Page,"January 20, 2016",5,"Future Vintage This app houses beautifully crafted videos in vibrant definition, within a refreshingly clean space."
1609,Gatosado,"August 14, 2016",1,Frozens my phone all the time! I love Vimeo but hate the app. Is impossible trying to play a video without having my phone get frozen all the time because of the app. No idea if that only happens to me but it would be if that gets fixed as I use it a lot for work.
1610,Jgghvhjnvfgjvfhk,"October 8, 2012",3,"Needs update Love Vimeo, and in a pro member, but the app has been buggy lately on ios6 iPhone4s ... Can't play videos through.. Freezes or crashes. Can we get an update??"
1611,Sk1284,"March 23, 2013",4,Browse users? I couldn't find a way to browse users or other users likes on the app or how to newly follow users on the app.  This would be awesome !
1612,Penguin silver pellets,"July 12, 2013",1,"So frustrated!!! This app is garbage. It crashes, takes forever to load videos, and if you try to pause a video it just gets messed up and eventually force quits on itself. Seriously this needs to be taken care of it's like you guys can't even make an app."
1613,JPot23,"September 20, 2013",2,Can't search It's pretty good now but you aren't able to search! That's why it like vimeo because I can search for new content and des over peoples amazing work. Don't really like the new viewer either. All in all not the best change.
1614,Joe inmotion,"September 26, 2013",1,They went too futuristic :( Took way too many things out. With all the vimeo features gone I just figured it was pointless so I deleted it. By the way this is probably only my 3rd review ever. I typically don't have issues with apps. Looks like back to Safari for Vimeo videos.
1615,Game Review Guy 123,"September 27, 2013",1,Horrible after the Update I used to love this app until the update. They killed it. Now they have taken the videos away. I'm pretty sure in the next update they will turn the search function in to an in app purchase. Please prove me wrong Vimeo and my review will be back to normal.
1616,slamb88,"October 9, 2013",5,Great Offline sync is awesome. The new look is very clean. Can't wait for search to come back.
1617,dhagquist,"November 10, 2013",1,"My god, why? I installed this to try to view a friends video and I was barraged with random Vimeo promos playing on constant repeat.  All the meanwhile, there was no search option while this chaos is occurring. This app is so horrible I am actually cracking up right now.  No words can describe this atrocity.  May god have mercy on your soul."
1618,LazaroFilm,"January 3, 2014",1,Unusable This app may be pretty but it's completely useless. You can't even access the settings of your videos? Better off using the website than the app. Plus it crashes often on my iPhone 4S. I liked the older iOS app better :(
1619,lyndiknappc,"January 24, 2014",5,Awesome Cool app. I like the format and it's very user friendly. I'll be uploading more videos that's for sure!
1620,Gattii,"March 30, 2011",5,"Finally One of the apps I was waiting for, now release a version for the iPad please."
1621,Rhesusmonkey,"April 23, 2011",1,"Doesnt help Thought this might be a way around iphone not playing vimeo files.  Cant search for the video I want to play, nor can i import a link to the movie I want to see.   Unless you're fine watching whatever crap happens to be up on thier very limited listings - Id give this a pass"
1622,Augiem1102,"April 25, 2011",5,Yes! Don't know why the initial version didn't have search but glad it's now here!
1623,rayjrm,"September 11, 2011",5,Awesome! So good! I simply do not understand how there are so many bad reviews. This app has been working flawlessly.
1624,jp0629,"February 27, 2012",5,Amazing update!!!! Finally the app works flawlessly so far. 
1625,dv8godd,"February 29, 2012",1,"Seriously? Lots of useless features, missing many obviously useful ones, and utterly useless to stream anything over 2 minutes long over 3G."
1626,Buttonking,"March 22, 2012",4,"Very good This is pretty good for editing videos, I'd like to see some more features, specifically the titles and music, but otherwise I like it."
1627,JohaPR,"September 15, 2012",1,Vimeo Like other just mention: 1) I can't see one single video without waiting to buffering 2) why cant I connect with my Tumblr account? Wish you repair this. Vimeo is great in quality in the Internet page and I always send people to know it. I can't do the same with this app.
1628,Makrav,"September 26, 2012",1,Buggy I'd rather poke myself in the eye than use this app. I can never make it through a video without it stopping in the middle and starting from the beginning. Not too mention the stats never show up and are forever having technical difficulties. Vimeo.... Try again!!
1629,ATOMINE,"December 26, 2015",4,"Good app, but... When air playing to the Apple TV the app doesn't let you control the video play/pause with the apple remote."
1630,Abouttoquitvimeo,"December 18, 2013",1,The WORST! Can't use airdrop correctly with this. Uploads are the worst and almost never work. Honestly time to fix this or another user is going to leave. From the reviews already posted this is no shock and I am sad to see that there has been no updates. Get it together Vimeo.
1631,Hey y'all what up this is good,"December 31, 2013",5,Great very great Love it...haven't had any problems yet but a search thing would be nice.
1632,HELLOKITTYDOPE<3,"April 24, 2014",4,Play list This app would be so good if you guys could add a playlist so that all the videos we like can play in order.
1633,Shanekg45,"April 25, 2014",5,Good app Needs some updates but has great potential
1634,最终幻想～杰,"June 8, 2014",1,"Bad Search very slow, sometime search forever . Video website better than this apps. "
1635,Flamingslugs,"August 30, 2014",4,Could be better Looks great but is very slow   Needs an update as much as I need a job
1636,EFD600,"November 15, 2014",1,Look elsewhere I love Vimeo but this app is just frustrating.  Playback used to be extremely slow and then it was fixed.  Now I can't do anything because I always get the Retry message box.  Vimeo is great on my iMac but this app is truly awful.  I use an iPad with latest iOS as of November 14.
1637,Bktrey,"December 4, 2014",1,Needs major improvements Just saying it would be nice if you could see your groups and other people's videos. I have a useless feed and can view my own videos that's it??? Vimeo is great but where is the navigation for the mobile app
1638,BigDaddy29450,"July 27, 2015",2,"Great app, Almost This app could be good again if it would landscape the videos.  How about let's fix this and get things turned around so we don't have to just use our Macs/pc's to watch the makers content."
1639,Kill3r4539,"July 28, 2015",2,"Keeps removing my downloads I like to have my videos downloaded for some good quality, but every few days it resets my downloads and I have to track them down again. Bruh fix this."
1640,Leogryl,"November 3, 2011",1,"Yada yada My boyfriend and I have the same phone. There is a private video he's able to load and watch that I can't with the exact same info. As well, his phone is now loading it at a record slow pace. I deleted app. Not worth it. Very frustrating. Seemed like a great idea at first."
1641,LunaLingua,"November 12, 2011",3,"iPad app please I'm not sure why all video viewing apps don't automatically have an iPad version. I'd much rather watch a high-quality video on iPad than iPod or iPhone. Please make one. iPad app=5 stars. Yep, that serious."
1642,Unwaxed,"March 9, 2012",1,Useless I love vimeo site and the clean easy to use video hosting they offer.  I have the 4s and the app simply doesnt work in any way with the phone.  It will render the video and fail to upload everytime. Plus it requires location services in order to use it.  Complete trash app.  Deleted it.
1643,gb3,"April 11, 2012",1,"What a disaster. Please fix this. Can't delete videos. Then, if you delete a video on the website, it won't delete in the app unless you uninstall, then reinstall the app on your mobile device. Think I'll un-install this one until the app and its reviews get better."
1644,obonilla87,"May 26, 2012",4,"Good App It's a good app. For more fun, it should come with a feature that allows one to import a song from the iTunes library of the iPhone. Good luck!"
1645,BrieanaP,"August 20, 2012",3,Profiles This is a great app on my iPad unfortunately you don't have access to profiles. This makes connecting with users much more difficult.

1653,TLC1277,"August 4, 2014",1,Horrible App Vimeo has some serious buffering issues with its app. All other video apps I use on my iPad are seamless and smooth in full HD. I have reloaded this app several times but the buffering issues just bring every Vimeo video to a sudden stop.  Guess it's time to delete it permanently.
1654,BestBatmanNA,"August 20, 2014",5,Good app to share films I love this app! It's a great way to share the films I create and also enjoy other people's creation.

1661,MAdBUTLER,"June 27, 2012",2,"Stats page never works They've had ""technical difficulties"" with their stats page for months now.  When is this going to be addressed? Vimeo is a great site, can't currently say the same for the app."

1663,Jbjbjbjbjjbjb,"October 30, 2012",1,"Very little functionality Vimeo is pretty cool; this app does not showcase even a fraction of the content that makes Vimeo cool. Quite surprised at how useless this app is and that Vimeo would allow this to represent them in the iOS world. Someone's sitting on their laurels, and they won't last long putting out this kind of nonsense."

1674,Blitzsoccer,"January 16, 2012",5,Super App!!!! Seriously. This is great! It's showing HD videos so you may need to be patient for buffering. It's worth the wait!!!

1679,AlanHughes,"July 8, 2017",2,goof First of all there is no back button. How vimeo could overlook something so basic is hard to imagine. They also forgot all of their add to channel/group buttons. Other stuff to that is out of wack or just overlooked.
