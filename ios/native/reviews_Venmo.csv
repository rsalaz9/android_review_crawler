0,alanaalexis,"March 31, 2020",2,"They lie to you I have never had any problems with this company/app but today really changed all of that. I wanted to add money to my account to cover some charges so I transferred almost $90 from my bank account to my Venmo account. If you have used this app before you know when you make a payment to someone the money comes out of your bank the next day. I checked my bank account and it came out so I check Venmo and it doesn‚Äôt show up. I talk to customer service on the chat, over email, and on the phone. Over chat and email they tell me it is run as an ACH transfer and takes 3-5 business days to show in my account. I work in a bank with these types of transfers and they never and I mean NEVER take 3-5 days. They take one at the most two days. Furthermore it was not run as an ACH transfer it was run as an auto debit (as if I swiped my debit card). I asked multiple times why I was being lied to and no answers just a run around. The girl at customer service on the phone was really trying to help me but she just didn‚Äôt have any information. I don‚Äôt know if she was new or if they just don‚Äôt care enough about their customers and employees to give them info and training to be able to help people. "
1,breiannmavraedis,"August 5, 2019",1,"wish I could give zero stars I have money that was sent to me for bills on my Venmo and when I tried sending it to my bank it immediately locked me out and said my account is frozen... I‚Äôm not sure why but it won‚Äôt even let me do anything from this point in my account. I went online to your ‚Äúhelp‚Äù page and followed the instructions for a frozen account... it ended up being a dead end. I then called customer support and they wouldn‚Äôt even tell me the issue with my account, just said it‚Äôs going to take 5-7 business days for an ‚Äúaccount specialist‚Äù to look into my account. I don‚Äôt mind that, all I asked was if I could send that money back to the original sender or just cancel that payment. They said once a payment is sent through there‚Äôs no way to get it back to the sender, not even through customer support. So basically I have money sitting in my account and I can‚Äôt even touch it because my account is frozen? And they won‚Äôt allow me to speak with anyone before the seven business days. Absolutely shocked and mortified with this apps customer service skills. Very obvious that they don‚Äôt care about their customers experience and they have zero safeguards for protecting the financial aspect of this app. There should be some way to send that money back to the sender so I‚Äôm not sitting here waiting for nearly two weeks just to access those funds, or allow me to speak to an account specialist over the phone. Once this situation is handled I‚Äôm never using this app ever again."
2,MrRyanB,"January 3, 2020",5,"Private Commerce Public Benefit The creation of Venmo with its rapid success and broad public acceptance of the ubiquitous private wire transfer-like service, has affected the way we pay our rent, paid our friends for our share of a group vacation, bailed out our college student son when he had unexpected party costs at his fraternity, and there are now myriad other examples of private commerce being conducted constantly between the people of this fair city. But are the exchanges on Venmo more than a mere convenience? I believe that the legitimacy and subsequent public trust of doing business through Venmo has benefited our society in the most positive way by providing a legitimate and convenient way to pay or be paid by anyone with a bank account and internet access. The widely accepted nature of the effect Venmo has had, increasing the ability for people to pay and receive debts and the perhaps unintended consequences have been that Venmo helps the economic conditions of the places it is used, putting money in people‚Äôs pockets in a fast convenient way and with Venmo, gone are many excuses for why a debt cannot be paid, which will be the greatest benefit to our economic life that Venmo has provided. This private sector venture is creating public sector benefits and for that I am grateful."
3,Kevin.Christopher,"February 18, 2020",1,"Venmo is a horrible company There are so many issues with Venmo it‚Äôs completely ridiculous. Their app is a complete joke. Every transaction I‚Äôve ever done has had issues. Basically you get a generic error that says it‚Äôs your bank that‚Äôs the problem and that they are rejecting the payment. Which is completely untrue. That happens like 20 times and then randomly on that 21st time it goes through an hour or two later. The customer service is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. They deactivate accounts without giving a reason or even attempting to contact the account holder first. They just deactivate the account and say we are not going to give you a reason (claiming that this is to protect their other users because knowing why is somehow a security risk). They don‚Äôt even let you respond. ‚ÄúIf you have any questions on this decision, this matter is closed and we can‚Äôt help you‚Äù. All the funds in the account they put under hold and you will likely never see them again. They are basically a bunch of thieves taking money from good people who made valid transactions that they deem invalid for their own made up reasons that they don‚Äôt want to share. When they see an opportunity, they cash in. I could keep going on with their bad business practices but my advice to anyone is just stay away. I personally wish I had never used their service, if you can use something else. Unless of course you like throwing your money in the trash or burning it."
4,PJB2B,"December 15, 2019",1,"Venmo card has been nothing but grief As far as transferring money to another person the service works pretty well , just like CashApp or PayPal. "
5,alexiam.k,"July 29, 2019",1,"Frustrated and Disappointed üëé I have had three venmo accounts and all of them had been shut down without any explanation. I use this app as a method of payment for my car cleaning services and without a doubt, each one gets shut down without hesitation in a matter of a couple of weeks, very frustrating. Venmo makes no effort to provide me with a reasonable explanation as to why ALL of my accounts have been shut down other than claiming it was their decision and I can no longer use their services."
6,Jules Jimenez,"November 11, 2019",1,"Venmo is LITERALLY the worst!!! When I first started using Venmo a year ago, I had zero problems. Friends and family would send me money and I would use ‚Äúinstant transfer‚Äù to my bank account since that was the quickest way to send money and I would receive it with NO ISSUES! All of sudden I am getting problems with the instant transfer. I have contacted Venmo myself and let them know the situation thinking they could fix the problem since it‚Äôs on them, but they are just useless and they offered me a ‚Äúbetter solution‚Äù to the problem which was waiting 2-3 business days for the money to be sended to my bank account. HAHAHA NO. So apparently now their system is ‚Äúdeclining‚Äù my instant transfer funds and there is nothing they can do about it. How could you not do something about this!? It‚Äôs your company declining my transfer! If anything YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO FIX THIS. All I am trying to do send MY MONEY that I need to in my bank account, and yet I can‚Äôt touch it. This is absolutely ridiculous. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened to me with the instant transfer fund, but now that this is happened to me a second time, I am done. After I figure out a way to get all the money onto my bank account, I am deactivating Venmo. I will never use Venmo again. If you read this, please don‚Äôt waste your time on Venmo, because like they told me, there is nothing they can do about it. I am extremely disappointed and upset. Goodbye Venmo. üëéüèº"
7,Dklst,"December 16, 2019",1,"Was best cash app until I had a problem with my ATM withdrawal. Not having any transactions for over 24 hours, when I went to the ATM it declined me even though there was more than enough money in there. Thinking it will be a simple fix ended up being a 24 hour headache with still no resolution, And my money on able to be withdrawn or even used for purchases. Went from the best app to the worst app in one day! The funny part of all this headache, every time I called they said there is no holds or locks on your account everything looks fine. Something you must‚Äôve done at the ATM cause the computer to decline it. They couldn‚Äôt clear anything in the system and the best suggestion was wait a few hours and try again. After trying again and again, and calling them again and again. I was still on able to withdraw from the ATM. They don‚Äôt know why I was being blocked and said there is no hold on my account. I said to them if I can‚Äôt withdraw from an ATM I guess there‚Äôs no point of me having the Venmo account and I should just cancel it. Their response was yes I agree that would probably make sense if you‚Äôre an able to use it. Never in my life have I heard a company tell you to cancel them.  And that was from not only 1, but 2 people. 1 of them being a manager. And the crazy part of it all is still no one can override the computer that‚Äôs blocking me from using my ATM card.  So needless to say I‚Äôm done with Venmo"
8,FrustratedHerm,"February 24, 2020",2,Convenient but still frustrating Venmo is a convenient money sharing app since it‚Äôs the one most people use but man oh man does it have some serious hang ups. It automatically shares your transaction history with all of your friends. It pulls these friends from Facebook and your phone and makes that list public as well. So anyone of those people can see everyone you know and who you‚Äôre paying for what. 
9,nasirgold123456,"September 27, 2019",1,"Trash Venmo is literally one of the worst apps you could possibly get. I tried to send money to my account instantly and it wouldn‚Äôt go through. The excuse I was given was because of ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. Basically whatever they deem ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù is grounds for your account to be frozen, delayed, and or locked completely. Pretty much any large sum of money is apparently ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù so I wasn‚Äôt able to get my money out even after I said oh well I‚Äôll just do the standard transfer and wait the 1-3 business days. I had to send the money to a friend and have him do it instantly and send me the money on cash app. I‚Äôd honestly advise using cash app over Venmo easily. It‚Äôs simple, easy, and doesn‚Äôt have so much baggage with it. You just type the amount you want and you can send the money to someone instantly and take that money out whenever you want to. Customer service was awful and they didn‚Äôt believe the account actually belonged to me and had me go through at least 4 different security processes on the phone to make sure it was actually my account even though I explained in detail only things an account holder would know about their own specific account. They tried to make it way too complicated to use and it‚Äôs honestly a hassle anytime you actually want to use the app. I deleted it so fast after getting my money out and I‚Äôm never using it again"
10,sushichick66,"December 29, 2017",4,"Much easier to use than writing a paper check. Very easy to use money transferred instantly. Much easier than writing a traditional check. I believe Venmo is also PayPal. I took away one star due to privacy. When you sign up it automatically uploads all of your contacts in your phone without warning. It also connects to social media like Facebook. Once you've registered you can change these privacy settings, so be aware to go to settings immediately if you don't want all of your contacts who use Venmo to see your transactions.  Also for each transaction you can select if you'd like your friends, the public to see Who you've paid, minus the amount. You can also set each transaction to private. Personally, I don't understand why it's anyone else's business who you pay for what kind of service. It's a Bizzarre concept to me, but then I don't live my life through social media. I am only using Venmo as a form of payment, like cleaning services. Still, it's easy to use and convenient. Just make sure to check Settings before you start transactions unless you want all of your friends, Family and coworkers to know what you're up to."
11,handsomejex,"September 3, 2018",4,"Really handy -  a few issues I use this app a ton and im a huge fan.   One thing that enraged me though is that they‚Äôll sometimes keep your money hostage when you try to pay someone , adding in layers of verification requirements while possibly collecting interest on the sums held up-  they don't notify the sender that the money they sent was unclaimed allowing the sender to choose an alternative payment channel -  I learned from a young homeless woman who had a Venmo account who i sent money to for train fare, that they would not allow her to accept what I sent.   I consider this to be abusive of their fiduciary role.  I want them to fix this and make it easier for people in her situation to access funds to be able to improve their situation or make it clear to the person who sends money that the money never reaches the intended recipient.  I would give them fewer stars for this issue, but i find for regular use with established contacts it works well.  I wish i had the option to preschedule payments or set regular payments.  I also wish that my venmo balance would apply to my payment when the amount exceeds the balance-  instead of sitting there!"
12,"Waiting, forever","October 6, 2018",5,"Venmo Original I was a Venmo original user, telling all my friends this is the future of payments. I started saying ‚Äúhey guys Venmo me, oh you don‚Äôt have Venmo? What‚Äôs wrong with you? Don‚Äôt you know about Venmo? We don‚Äôt need cash to split bills anymore.‚Äù We‚Äôll, this was also in a period when Venmo said they would pay users if they invited their friends and they signed up. Until this day, I still get users that sign up, because of me, but Venmo does not pay me like they said they would. While I love their application, I don‚Äôt appreciate that they didn‚Äôt pay me for getting many of my friends, contacts, and business colleagues on Venmo. Maybe thousands of users but Venmo only paid me for the first few users. Venmo is great, but they owe me. I was inline with the thinking that there must be a better way to pay people, and I found Venmo, which was a simpler way to pay people than PayPal, which many people did not trust at the time. I convinced people that it would be safe and efficient. Venmo owes me for all the people I invited, as they said I would be reimbursed. Great app overall, just pay me. :)"
13,Kingston Remix is AMAZING!,"December 8, 2018",5,Absolutely ridiculous! My friend transferred $400 to my account I go to do an instant transfer to my personal checking account and it will not go through. And oh how convenient no customer service support to call because apparently they work bankers hours. How in the world are you going to be a 24/7 cash application and not have any sort of online tech support or offer any live tech-support?? This is literally an emergency situation where I needed to borrow the funds which I did.....I now have my funds sitting in this stupid account which I am unable to touch or have access to and will have no way to contact their customer service until Monday morning it is currently Friday 7:30 PM. I am beyond furious. I knew I should‚Äôve gone with my gut and used the other three different cash apps I have on my phone which worked beautifully and have never had an issue with. I only last minute decided to use this one for the first time tonight never thinking for a second that I would not be able to access my funds. USER BEWARE PLEASE don‚Äôt use this stupid application....no tech-support after 4 PM M-F.
14,Nickchap85,"December 22, 2018",1,Disappointed and frustrated Had a friend want to send me money but they only use Venmo so I decided to download and set it up everything went great setting it up including the bank account until it came time to add my debit card for payments and instant transfers. It wouldn‚Äôt allow me to add my bank debit card or my credit card. I called my bank and they said they work with Venmo and my card should be working no problem. So I tried to contact Venmo today and they are closed to phone calls so I couldn‚Äôt talk to a person I could only email and or chat (txt) with them and they told me it was flagged and could not be added and that they couldn‚Äôt tell me why and said they weren‚Äôt provided that information and it was done by there automated system and there was no explanation they could give me and there was nothing they could do about it. I asked who would be able to give me that information and then they said there is no information available.. now I have to wait and transfer to my bank account in hopes they don‚Äôt try to flag that and hold my money. It‚Äôs not $20 bucks I‚Äôm trying to get out of my Venmo account either. If Venmo will correct my issues or even atleast give me an explanation I‚Äôd be happy to update my review but as of now I unfortunately have left this type of review.
15,johniquar,"March 26, 2019",1,They really froze my account and trying to hold my money Okay hello my name is johniqua so it says that Venmo is holding my money okay after my money is returned I‚Äôm not using Venmo again. I understand I violated some kind of rule or whatever. I clearly explained what happened plenty of times 4 times in a row sent my ny stat Id picture twice. I don‚Äôt get it I couldn‚Äôt put the money on my card I clearly explained that then it says I can‚Äôt use my account how in the world is it that sending money is so difficult. when you try to get your hard earned money back to you. which your the rightful owner of someone tells you they‚Äôre gonna hold it oh heck no. I will like my money returned to me no one has to ever worry about me using this app again. I‚Äôm sure I will never use this app. I will be darned if someone freezes my account then I give my Id and tells me they‚Äôre holding on to my money as if I‚Äôm a little kid who just got there allowance and is spending to much money I understand not you fault I chose this app and have to deal with whatever but if I knew I was causing trouble sending the money back to my boyfriend and requesting it back because we both couldn‚Äôt find a card to place the money on I would‚Äôve been asked my sister to use her bank card to put my money on man why the heck why do I have to go through this so I really can‚Äôt get my money back
16,JBritz420,"November 15, 2019",1,"Payment problems I have money in my venmo account and it‚Äôs not allowing me to pay someone with the money in my account it only allows me to pay with my debit card but I can‚Äôt pay with my debit card if my money is in my Venmo this app has serious problems that need to be addressed. Your instant transfer system needs to be fixed I talked to a support person and they told me that somedays you can instant transfer and some days you can‚Äôt this is upsetting and brings me to the conclusion that I will not be using this app. I can‚Äôt give the app no starts but if I could I would considering that your app isn‚Äôt compatible with my bank so I have to manually verify my bank which takes 3 days and then the standard transfer takes up to 3 more days so I cant get my money for a whole week like that is an issue. If I can instant transfer yesterday I should be able to today especially if there wasn‚Äôt no suspicious activity or anything of that matter on the card or account. Once I get my money I will not be using this app and I will advise all the people I know that have it to use a different app that actually gets you the money when you need it, I‚Äôm also never going to advise people to use the app or download it because of these problems you are hold peoples money and causing problems for them. I would fix your problems before your app falls under."
17,Breonika McGee,"November 1, 2019",1,"Transferred Money That I Couldn‚Äôt Even Use And Now My Money Is Being Held! I got my school refund on my chime account. I had a new card ordered and had not gotten it yet. And I needed the money, so I sent it to my brothers chime account. He then sent it to my Venmo account because I had that card. ALL of my transactions were getting declined, except a couple that went through. So I sent the money back to my brother, and ask him to try the transactions and to try to withdrawal from his Venmo. Same problem. So we contacted their chat team about it and we had recently moved so we figured it was happening because we moved to a different state. We called about it a couple times. And they ended up freezing our accounts! They asked us to send pictures of our State IDs or Drivers licenses to prove our identity. We did that. I also sent the a picture of our lease to update our new address. They told me that I went against their user agreement and that my account was being permanently closed and that they were investigating my money for up to 180 days to see if they can give me MY money back! I sent them pictures of my accounts showing what I did. And I also kept the chat transcripts and email communications with the company. No luck at all. And they won‚Äôt tell me how I violated the user agreement! I need my money! I have kids and bills to pay and I can‚Äôt now."
18,pyrolion54,"November 18, 2019",1,"Cash app is overwhelmingly superior. I‚Äôve only had one transaction over Venmo and it‚Äôs already proved unusable. I was sent money by a friend on Venmo, against my raised objections. I already use Cash app, Zelle, PayPal frequently, but they sent it via Venmo anyway. I go to transfer the money to my bank account, and I get a vague error message. I successfully connected my bank account, but when I went to send the money, I got a vague error message. So I contact support through chat. I‚Äôm 34th in line to speak to a representative. After waiting 15 minutes, the chat window closes on its own. I reopen it, but have to get in the back of the line. I try again the next day. Same thing. A week later, I try again and get connected with a representative. I explained the situation, and the response was literally ‚Äúthe system is showing an arbitrary error for reasons that we representatives are not allowed to see on our end.‚Äù That‚Äôs right, the system had an error for reasons not shared with customer service reps. After some back and forth, the representative figures out that the error is because my bank info is on another Venmo account- my wife‚Äôs. Apparently Venmo does not allow a bank account number to be on more than one account. So, my wife and I can‚Äôt use the app at the same time. It‚Äôs just ridiculous."
19,agnu the tiny,"January 28, 2020",1,"Shady Hidden Fee They deducted $5 from one of my transactions because they told me I was in a $5 dollar deficit from a transaction that took place over a year ago. I was never given a notification nor an email saying that the payment method didn‚Äôt go through and I owed Venmo $5. My Venmo wallet even said I was at $0.00. Not ‚Äú-$5.00‚Äù. So they waited until I made a transaction and I noticed it was $5 short. The only thing they told me was a transaction I made a year ago with a specific account didn‚Äôt work, my bank couldn‚Äôt provide a routing number or account number for that account they said I used. That account in question HAS NOT BEEN AN ACTIVE BANK ACCOUNT SINCE 2016. So of course it‚Äôs not going to be a usable account. Which begs the question, why would I use that account to make a payment and why was it not declined from the very beginning? I even tested it by transferring $1 from that account to my friend, and it immediately declined it like it should have. All I‚Äôm saying is Venmo and PayPal have some very shady ways in collecting revenue from their customers via hidden fees. They basically gave me the run around about it. I wouldn‚Äôt be so disgruntled if I was given a heads up prior to the transaction that I was in a $5 deficit to them. But there was no notification and my Venmo wallet said I was squared at $0.00."
20,Jenniferlori,"August 5, 2018",1,"Instant transfer fails! When I first downloaded and added the app I didn't have any problems. So I had my family download the app too. Then all of a sudden my instant transfer option was not working. The only option that would work is the standard 3 business day option. I called my bank and they said it wasn't them because Venmo didn't even attempt the transfer. When I contacted Venmo they had no idea why it was happening, they actually said that! Then they said that it does happen at random and I was the lucky one! Then they told me the only way I could transfer to my bank was by using the standard 3 day option. This is ridiculous! I only downloaded this app because of the instant transfer option. "
21,Mmkayerin,"January 28, 2019",1,"They Share Private Info. So I got a new phone and as such, ended up locked out of my Venmo account. I reached out with my email address on file, confirmed my private bank information, and after two weeks I cannot get any response to be let in to my account. They‚Äôre saying they need an image of my ID without any information covered as if the verification I provided already isn‚Äôt enough, but I am a victim of domestic violence and as such, requested written confirmation that an image of my ID would not ever be shared with anyone else before I provide it. THEY REFUSE TO GIVE IT TO ME. They will NOT put in writing that if my ex, who I named specifically, reached out for info about my account, they would not provide it - why won‚Äôt they agree not to give my personal information out to anyone else? This is SO scary, SO troubling, and enough for me to take my business elsewhere which is such a shame as I was considering migrating over to them entirely. I have followed up with them again in hopes to regain access to my account and once I do, will be pulling all my information and money out of it and requesting to be wiped from their database. I would never recommend Venmo to anyone and I will be taking this information anywhere I can so others are aware of how dangerous it is to trust Venmo with their private information."
22,I approve this app,"February 9, 2019",1,"It‚Äôs my money and I want it NOW!! Really!? 2-3 business Days just to transfer your money from your Venmo account to your bank or debit card? That blows. I suggest everyone try the Zelle app as soon as someone sends me money through Zelle I get a text from both Zelle that someone transferred me money and I also get a notification from my bank telling me they processed a check for the amount I just reviewed on Zelle. So I don‚Äôt even have to go into the Zelle app and say transfer to my bank, IT DOES IT FOR ME! So nice and convenient. I have nothing to do with the Zelle app I am just impatient and want my money that someone sends me right away and to have it accessible and ready to spend using my own debit card from my own bank instead of having to get a Venmo card just one more card to carry around in my wallet. I don‚Äôt use Venmo to make purchases or pay friends back for pizza or anything I use it to just collect money for my businesses and the services we provide. So again it‚Äôs my money and I want it now, I don‚Äôt want to have to wait 2-3 days for it to get into my own personal bank account or be charged a fee to do it right away like other apps do like the CashApp. That‚Äôs just absurd take a percentage of my money Bc I want it now!!! Again Zelle is where it‚Äôs at, it‚Äôs the beezkneez!"
23,Bsbrn,"April 26, 2019",5,"Glad to have! Had friends tell me to get this multiple times but never wanted it or needed it until recently I needed this for an important purpose to receive some money so I finally gave in and downloaded VENMO, and I‚Äôm so glad that I did.  Taking a bit to learn and maneuver but I will get there.  One downside I don‚Äôt like and that‚Äôs aggravating me (although I have set mine to private) is that when I open the app I see people‚Äôs business (people I know of that I don‚Äôt care to be reminded of and folks I don‚Äôt know transactions of sorts, and I find that so very annoying).   I still give 5 stars even with the annoyances bc I‚Äôm hopeful that with the right setting I can get rid of all that extra junk I see about other folks bc I only care what my personal business is doing, not theirs.  Great app. overall that I can tell. Going to be very handy at times for me.  Another awesome thing that much use is free and certain usage is very reasonable fee(s) so that makes it much, much better.  Thanks VENMO! "
24,_4ktay,"May 1, 2020",1,Venmo is unacceptable ! I am very disappointed in venmo and will probably never use it again. I understand you guys freeze accounts when you suspect something but the process to unfreeze takes way to long. I have $190 in my frozen account & I need this money to help support my household in this corona situation but I am still under review after 2-3 days of sending my iD in. Cashapp instantly makes you take a picture within the app of you iD and you are back to using your money. It makes me very upset that I have to go through this not only do I have to ask people for money but pay them back when my account unfreezes. I DONT KNOW WHEN MY ACCOUNT IS GOING TO UNFREEZE. Yes I already sent my iD I also talked to a Venmo assistant who agreed and said he sees my iD and I have to wait for a specialist to fix it. My thing is why aren‚Äôt I already talking to a specialist about my situation not a customer support person who barley has control over helping my situation. I callled not only did I wait and hear your wait music for almost 20 mins when they finally answered and helped me they told me I had to wait for the specialist! Y‚Äôall could‚Äôve told me that in a email after I receive my money I will be withdrawing and going back to cashapp because this is unacceptable. Have a nice day and keep safe from corona.
25,CalmanG21,"September 12, 2019",1,"Let me in an unsafe situation, lost my job as a result Venmo doesn‚Äôt even deserve a star.  I recently got a Venmo debut card and the other day decided to make it my viable option to use for expenses and daily living.  On the first day August 2nd this card worked fine, as the second day approached I noticed the card decline at a gas station, I didn‚Äôt understand and had them run the card again.  Declined again.  I then called the number on the back of the card only to find out that you can not speak to a human on the weekends. You can only chat with a mobile agent at 7AM Pacific time.  So I had to sleep in my car as I was an hour away from home and had no other financial means.  I tried calling the number on the back of card but no one is available you can only activate it deactivate the card.  When I was able to chat with a mobile agent through text messaging they said sorry for inconvenience but there is nothing we can do.  I had $1000 plus in the account and was unable to get gas, they did not care about my welfare and did not has e a supervisor or anyone that could assist or was willing to assist.  As a result I could not get gas in my car and was unable to make it to work where there is a zero tolerance policy for tardiness.  I lost my job, my safety and peace of mind due to Venmo"
26,Paris Maxwell,"July 23, 2019",1,"Froze my account for no reason I recently got a Venmo account this month, and it was all going pretty smoothly for myself when I found out my account had been temporarily deactivated for some unknown reason. Keep in mind I only had my account for 9 days, but the day before my account was deactivated I transferred my Venmo balance to my bank because I had a feeling this would happen. I looked into the situation further and I saw people rarely got their accounts back... which results in Venmo holding your money for a total of 180 days! This is where you shouldn‚Äôt download their app when I tell you that Venmo‚Äôs TOS states that every transaction can be considered a violation and therefore be subject to being flagged. They can literally flag your account if they want to and they don‚Äôt have to a reason for it. Thus, holding your money waiting for you to verify with an ID... BOOM your account is locked with your money in it without anything you can do. If you don‚Äôt believe any of this google it your self.

27,Bmarie19,"December 9, 2019",1,"DO YOUR RESEARCH ABOUT VENMO!! I sent $388 through Venmo to my mom and they froze both of our accounts asking for verification. We both uploaded our ID‚Äôs and were told it would take 3-5 business days to be reviewed by and account specialist. After the review period we were told our accounts were permanently revoked without any explanation. I didn‚Äôt mind that part at all honestly because the point of using Venmo is because I though it would be convenient and efficient and it was anything but that! Now this is the insane part. They did not volunteer any information about the $388 they had of my money. When I questioned them through email (that‚Äôs the only way of communicating with an account specialist), I was given a vague response about their investigation would take up to 180 day‚Äôs and the funds were a part of the investigation so they would let me know at the end of the 180 days if they could return any part of my money back to me!! Now after hearing this I went on BBB website for Venmo she literally every other complain is a story just like mine, some for thousands of dollars. I have no idea how Venmo is getting away with stealing people‚Äôs money but they are. There are many different apps like this so use one of them and stay away from Venmo at all costs!!"
28,TJH112233,"August 6, 2019",5,"A Must Have in today‚Äôs Society With fast moving lives and technology only growing, it‚Äôs about time money catches up. Venmo makes it fun easy to send, receive, and request money from your friends and family. If you‚Äôre a secluded person or like some privacy then just make your transactions private so no one can see them. The only person that sees a private transaction is you and the person you are sending, requesting, or receiving money from.  Your received money is then stored in your own secure account until you decide to transfer it to your bank. My transfers usually take about and hour to a day. The more you use the app the better and faster it gets. If your 18 and can‚Äôt wait to transfer your money you can sign up for the Venmo card that connects to your Venmo secure account balance. That way you don‚Äôt have to wait. Those cards come in a variety of colors, so there is one for everyone. If you haven‚Äôt tried Venmo already I highly suggest you give it a go. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing out on."
29,Bagz-O-Money,"April 19, 2020",5,"Great Payment Platform... It‚Äôs been approximately 6 months since adding Venmo to a few similar money transferring formats I had already been using. I added Venmo as it is an alternative payment platform provided by PayPal. It provides users with an extremely easy P2P payment format. Venmo users have the opportunity to go well beyond just paying other people. They can signup to receive a Venmo MasterCard debit card that affords the freedom to purchase whatever from virtually wherever.  Regardless of purchasing in-store or online, as long as the retailer accepts MasterCard or even PayPal (Venmo being a PayPal subsidiary), it‚Äôs all good. Only downer, the balance held on a Venmo account MUST cover any transaction in its entirety as partial payments of transactions are not allowed. But I have a linked bank account that will always cover, so not enough of a biggie to warrant decreasing my rating or to provide anything less than my full recommendation for all those who haven‚Äôt already to start utilizing the awesome Venmo app by downloading it now!"
30,alletoile,"July 7, 2018",5,"Basically perfect I LOVE Venmo, my only complaint is that it can be annoying toggling between two different banks (one checking account with my bank where all my deposits go, the other is an online savings account where I put money aside to pay off loans and other bills). So if I‚Äôm using one account for every day payments, it‚Äôs a pain to  switch to the other account to take money from there. But honestly it‚Äôs not that big of a deal overall, especially when this app makes it so quick and easy (and secure) to pay people. I hate owing money, so being able to almost instantly pay someone back is amazing. And I REALLY hate fronting the money for something,  and there‚Äôs always the friend who is short right now but will get you back later...and you know you‚Äôll never see that money again. Not anymore, it‚Äôs insanely simple to pay someone (and to send payment requests to anyone who ‚Äúforgets‚Äù to pay you back right away). As Rihanna widely commanded, pay me what you owe me."
31,KiaraChange,"November 9, 2018",1,"Venmo is the worst! In the beginning, Venmo worked really well for me. I was only using the app to receive payments from families that I babysit for. Super convenient. Over time, my boyfriend and I decided that we would use Venmo to save money for our trip to Orlando. On the day before the trip, my boyfriend transferred the money that we saved to my account so that I could deposit it. I tried to use the ‚ÄúInstant Transfer‚Äù option, but it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to so I called customer service. I spoke to a young woman who told me that there was some ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù going on with my account. It was so frustrating because we weren‚Äôt able to get our money for another couple days. A few days after that incident, I received an email stating that my account was frozen and that I would need to send a photo of my I.D to them in order to get things straightened out. After sending the email, a lady named Vera R. (an account specialist with Venmo) responded to my email saying that my account is permanently deactivated! I was so confused and upset. Please do not waste your time with this app. It seems great and convenient in the beginning, but turns bad very quickly. Zelle is a great (and much safer) option for sending money to family and friends! :)"

They only allow one Venmo per checking account. They said I would have to add my debit or credit card which they will take 1% for debit charges and 3% for credit. I use Venmo more than my husband so we decided I would link my Venmo to the checking account and he would link his account to our debit card. He deleted the checking account but it still wouldn‚Äôt let me link to checking. Contacted Venmo again and they said that even though he deleted the bank, he still is linked to the account until he calls them himself to ‚Äúrelease‚Äù his account.. suspect. My husband is a marine so he isn‚Äôt home often. He was out in the field at the time so I had to wait til he was home. But when he gets off work, they‚Äôre customer service is closed.

33,Ben Klotzbach,"April 8, 2019",1,Debit Card and Support I received the debit card they offer to use your funds. I have tried it at multiple atms and online purchases. It has been declined every time and has shown a positive balance since I‚Äôve opened the account. I called the support number and the woman was very nice but said some users cards don‚Äôt always work for atm purchases and there is no reason for it and no way to correct it. I was also told the same thing with online purchases and how they may not work but that it should work in store. So I am now off to try the card for an I store purchase to see if it will work or be declined all ways around. When I asked for more information they said it‚Äôs what they are told and that they don‚Äôt know the reason and so on and so forth. I‚Äôve never heard of a company not letting there employees know how things work as well as someone who is partnered with MasterCard and owned by PayPal. If I were either company I‚Äôd be livid that people are given no solution and aren‚Äôt using their card which in I‚Äôm sure MasterCard is losing out everyday as I was told this happens to a lot of customers and no fix. Good luck Venmo. You might be new but how you can not know about the services and products you offer is mind blowing.

Venmo claims they cannot do anything about getting the money back, even though they didn‚Äôt verify the account, and yet transferred the money successfully in the past AND are the ones that processed the payment to the strangers account even though it‚Äôs not the one that appears in my boyfriends Venmo account.

When I called a representative she literally told me that for some unknown reason, the feature is no longer available to me. Even though it had been for months now!

I get a notification that he accepted my referral and created an account then accepted my payment. My brother and I are chatting about it and he tells me he did not do that and when he tried to create an account later last night it said his number was already in use. So some random person now has my money and I assume by now has deleted the account as they no longer are responding to my comments or money requests (just for my initial payment amount.)

They advertise it as an app to transfer money but they do not let it commonly known to people that it should not be used to pay people for goods/services unless you are a lawyer and read through 25 pages of legal documents. If you get paid through Venmo, then Venmo can reverse the transaction without your approval and not provide any protection. There is no way to file a claim against Venmo and they will reverse your transaction after you think it‚Äôs already in your account. They don‚Äôt care at all about their users. I know a lot of people who use Venmo to pay people without knowing that it technically violates their terms of use because most people do not read through 25 pages of user terms and since it is owned by PayPal it is very confusing to normal users since you can use PayPal to pay people. Very deceiving and unethical business practices. I recommend people stop using Venmo and letting their friends know that their money is not secure.

Shortly thereafter, they froze my and my father‚Äôs accounts permanently, when 2 out of 10 small payments failed due to the VISA debit card refusing authorization. The ‚Äúaccount specialist‚Äù ‚Äúgustave‚Äù is a particularly nasty piece of work, always closing my tickets as ‚Äúresolved‚Äù after demanding a large number of ID and financial documents which obviously takes time to assemble but I eventually all provided. In the end, Venmo has permanently shut down my account without returning the three-figure balance I have.

So I would highly recommend NOT using this app unless you want your money frozen and NEVER RETURNED!!! Still waiting for the $400 back since they still refuse to unfreeze my account simply for questioning why a payment was held. Don‚Äôt go to customer service or they will freeze ur account!! Beware!!!"

I cannot recoup these funds, time, energy, nothing; not can I get an adequate explanation. Things like this are entirely unacceptable. Worst of all are some ‚Äúinstant transfers‚Äù that are inexplicably rejected for vague reasons. I end up having to send the money via Venmo for a fee (outrageous!) and have them take the cash out for me IF it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù for some nonsensical reason of ‚Äúsuspicion.‚Äù It‚Äôs my money, you get your service fees, stop with the nonsense.

But my experience with Venmo has been so absolutely terrible that I want to warn further users. If you are an international student, Venmo can freeze your account and and money you have sitting there will become indefinitely inaccessible to you. Venmo supposedly froze my account with notice (I received none) when I tried to deposit my funds into my bank account. However,I had been able to send money to colleagues no problem. When I realized I could not deposit my money, I called Venmo and I was told my account had been frozen for some unknown reason and that I had to email to find out. I was eventually told I need to provide a US issued ID to prove my identity . Which I do not have , being Canadian. After multiple emails back and forth I was essentially told my money would remain inaccessible to me unless I provide the right kind of ID.. so unless I miraculously wake up with an American passport tomorrow, my money belongs to Venmo indefinitely. This is the most insidious and disgusting policy and treatment. Absolutely terrible."

Recently had the WORST experience ever, customer service department and compliance department and all those in between do NOT communicate internally and causes misinformation to the customer. After trying to send money to a friend for a girls trip to Cuba Venmo held my money up in their compliance department, I followed their processes to provide details but requested that after jumping through all those hoops that they just cancel the transaction once it met compliance requirements. They made me submit itinerary and other personal information to get the transaction out of the compliance department so it could be reversed. Jumped through all of these hoops and they just processed it anyway, against what we had disused (by that time I had just opted to use PayPal instead since it‚Äôs easier). Long story short Venmo didn‚Äôt cancel the transaction once released from compliance as they said they would. Totally screwed up my finances with the duplicate transaction, and customer service was of NO HELP. My advice - STAY AWAY.

After 3 weeks of customer service battles they said my money would be returned, only to get an email stating that they don‚Äôt see any charges and that I should dispute It with my bank. So I did.

I am very skeptical when using Venmo now and try to use other apps to send and receive money requests from friends and family. I have also warned others about this incident and encouraged them to use other apps. I should not be punished for something that I have no control over. I could not force this person to call and unfreeze the account and clearly the money wasn‚Äôt received on their end so I don‚Äôt see why I could not be refunded.

It's been a pain to send money when certain accounts can't be added or won't be recognized for reasons unbeknownst to us.

They proceeded to tell me my account had been permanently deleted for violations to the terms and agreement which they did not specify what exactly had been violated and said that they could not credit the money back to me so they money is gone and they act like they don‚Äôt know where it is. Mind you they sent a couple cents to my account and withdrew it to verify my bank so where could the money have gone? Do no download this app or use it anyway that deals with you personal money or the same thing will happen to you and you‚Äôll never see your money again"
92,Disappointedgal62017,"November 3, 2018",5,Immediate transfer My roommate and I use Venmo to share money. She sent me her half via Venmo instead of driving to the bank. I tried to do an immediate transfer and it wouldn‚Äôt work. I checked again the next morning and it still hadn‚Äôt gone into my account. It took 3 days which made our housing payment late. I even called and asked if they would just reverse it back to her bank account. I was told that I would have had to call within the hour of the initial transfer in order to do that. So our money for our house payment sat in limbo for three days costing fees when our payment was made late. We had never not be able to transfer immediately so we had no idea this could even happen. This has been the only time I‚Äôve ever been dissatisfied with venmo but this one time caused a lot of stress and extra money that I didn't have to waste.

So I applied for and received the Venmo card. After I put the Venmo card information in and saved everything I went about my business for the rest of the day. The following day I tried going to the store and my Venmo card (which has a balance of $40) was declined for no given reason. I then tried going the the suggested money pass ATMs that they list. I was UNABLE to withdraw any money. This morning I call Venmo and speak to customer service. They tell me that there‚Äôs an error on their end and that they CANNOT over ride it. They can‚Äôt guarantee when or if I‚Äôll be able to get my money off while using the Venmo card. The lady said just link your bank. I told her my bank is not supported in the app, and all she said was ‚Äúsorry for the inconvenience, do you have any other questions?‚Äù Yes... will I be getting MY MONEY??? Never again will I use this app its all a scam to get and KEEP your money. So sad I really thought this app would be different from the rest but they‚Äôre not."

Why in the hell would I want to make public money transfers i am involved in ,yet Venmo defaults to that ! And no i do not want to use money just transferred to me to buy stuff from their listed partner vendors. Nor do I want a Venmo card . Nor do I want to let Venmo collect a 1 percent fee from me for quickly transferring my money to my bank when Zelle does transfers instantly and for free ! The only reason i have anything to do with Venmo at all is that I have a business client who says his bank only allows him to use Venmo to make wire transfers to companies like mine. "

I had a payment coming out of the wrong account, so I was getting charged non-sufficient funds because the money wasn‚Äôt there for Venmo to take out, so I contacted Venmo to cancel the payment, so while they couldn‚Äôt cancel the payment, they refunded me $72 for NSF fees! What amazing customer service! I am speechless right now and so SO happy with the customer service I received today! Thank you Venmo for being so AWESOME and I will brag about you to anyone who is looking for a money app! Seriously the best customer service experience I have ever had.

98,sarahs husband214,"September 18, 2019",1,Ridiculously ignorant issues First problem I had with Venmo was I had a customer of mine who wanted to pay for installation of a kitchen floor.. So he liked the idea of having a electronic recipet. Ok so point being not only did Venmo want over $20 for transferring $700 but I've had and been using this app for almost a year and it Continually kept asking to verify my account WHICH I DID...OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!! So my point being my customer was able to verify HIS account but VENMO would not let me receive the money!!!! I would 1000% understand if Venmo was taking extra precautions to avoid any type of fraud BUT why in the world when someone is SENDING the money you can‚Äôt receive it????? I shouldn‚Äôt even need a bank account tied to my account. It‚Äôs my problem what I do with MY MONEY AND CERTAINLY NOT VENMOS BUISNESS!!!! Longgg story short I‚Äôve gone from using the app everyday to every couple to now MAYBE once a month if necessary.  I‚Äôve recommended this to many people but now I try to tell as many as possible to use cash app or any other form of sending money securely. Super disappointed with this app
99,goodall00,"July 24, 2019",5,Love this app I have just recently started using this app but so far I‚Äôm impressed! I was getting so frustrated with PayPal and really wanted another choice I kept seeing Venmo all over the net so I decided to give a shot and boy am I glad I did ! It‚Äôs really easy to use not a ton of steps to start up. It‚Äôs offers all the must haves especially if your doing any kind of online sales. I can add my bank or debit card to add or deduct funds but what‚Äôs really cool is they have there own Venmo payment card that I can transfer my funds too! My only complaint is you have to wait to get the Venmo card. I‚Äôm on a waiting list to receive so that‚Äôs a kind of bummer but other than that I‚Äôm super stoked on Venmo ! I suggest giving it a try because there‚Äôs so much this app has to offer and navigating as well as set up is snap ! Now I can‚Äôt wait to receive my VENMO card

Today I received a payment from a client. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do but initiate the transfer to my bank. Low and behold Venmo suspends my account for violating the Terms and Conditions of their Agreement but don‚Äôt tell me what I violated. I am supposed to wait 3 to 4 days for them to get back to me to tell me what they are going to do with my account and money. Everything I read says they will take your money and run with it or hold it for 180 days, or reverse you and charge you for the payment you never got! I have a mortgage to pay, 3 kids to feed and I‚Äôm SOL. I‚Äôve called and emailed and I am met with reps on auto-pilot. There is no human touch or compassion with company. To boot, it‚Äôs my boys 6th Birthday. We were supposed to go out to eat but now I can‚Äôt afford to celebrate his day with him be because I am broke. Utterly disappointe.

My preferred payment method has never changed. It has always been my credit card. I contacted customer service immediately through the app and have continued to daily. It‚Äôs now been 48 hours and nobody has contacted me to explain why my preferred payment method was not used even though the fine print says it will be used if there aren‚Äôt funds in my Venmo account. They also haven‚Äôt corrected their error and reversed the charge to my bank account and charge my credit card like they were supposed to do in the first place. Essentially they have ignored the issue for the last 48 hours. That is EXTREMELY UNACCEPTABLE! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to my worst enemy"

Each time I have called them they have been unable to give me a straight answer as to why my card is being declined. I have verified my ID, reset my pin and have had PLENTY of money in the account to cover my transactions. It‚Äôs so frustrating that they have a lot of my liquidable funds and I have NO access to them. I have been having to use my personal funds to run my business ever since I started using Venmo. I will be requesting a check if I am unable to transfer my money in the next couple days and closing the account.

I have been trying this for 2 weeks now with the same results: ‚Äúcannot transfer at this time‚Äù. There is no reason this should be a issue when I have money just sitting in the Venmo account waiting to be used. Then when I tried the bank method it told me that they will spend the next 3 days taking a dollar in & out of my account then suddenly put the money there which I am not particularly angry about but I still don‚Äôt have that kind of time or think it‚Äôs worth it. My only (and best) option left was to order a Venmo card and go to a ATM in order to get ACCESS TO MY MONEY! Now I ave to wait until Monday next week to get it in the mail. So overall I am dissatisfied with the app and do not recommend people use this if they want to have clear and simple access to their money. Oh and I‚Äôve already tried multiple ways to fix this issue ( restarting phone, log out then log in, customer service phone line etc.)"

It‚Äôs really none of my business, I‚Äôm note at all interested and I am not remotely comfortable with getting this run down of my neighbors‚Äô and mostly distant contacts‚Äô financial business every time I open the app, particularly who my contacts are paying since those people never agreed for me to know their personal business.

In the meantime the customer service agent, sent me an email, telling me that she could not divulge another customers details, and if she had any trouble transferring thru the Venmo card that the recipient should contact customer service.

I did that too and it said it will put two transactions in my account which I have to verify before I can send any money to anyone but it‚Äôll take 2 days for me to see those transactions. This is ridiculous. If I wanted to wait two days why the heck would I use Venmo?!! I was embarrassed in front of my friend and I‚Äôm really upset with Venmo. I used my debit card to pay my friend just so I can save myself from anymore embarrassment.

I am a legitimate client using this service for the past 8 months, paying legitimate bills instead of mailing out checks. I have followed all their rules and had no issues with my bank accounts. However Venmo decides out of the blue to not allow certain  transactions to occur for the past 2 months, that have been the same amounts and receivers for the past 8 months. Plain and simple, paying rent to a private owner on the day it‚Äôs due, turns into a decline by Venmo. No explanation other than ‚Äúsecurity risk‚Äù, to whom I‚Äôm not sure.

It kept saying my payment was declined even though there was plenty of money in the bank account it was coming from. Talked to customer service with no real answers other than their system flagged it for some reason and it was beyond their control. Tested it out and tried paying different friends different amounts and declined every time. I transferred the money from my bank account to my Venmo account thinking maybe it was a bank issue. Still would not work. Talked to ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù for the third time and they basically said I was out of luck and to transfer the money back to my bank. Well then that wouldn‚Äôt work either! So I‚Äôve got a rather large sum of money just sitting in my Venmo account that I can‚Äôt use and can‚Äôt get any one in customer service to help other than send me the same scripted stuff over and over. So frustrated and disappointed.

Being able to view other user‚Äôs transactions and exchanges is a bizarre and frankly uncomfortable position to be in. My issue isn‚Äôt really about the privacy, I mean it is, but it also just seems extraordinarily unnecessary, and cluttered, for an app such as this. There really isn‚Äôt anything even a little bit useful about being able to see what people you know or may know, are spending money on or who‚Äôs-paying-who. I don‚Äôt consider myself a private person by any means necessary, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I want any person using Venmo having the option of looking at my payment records.

Support will not assist you on it because they have no idea why transaction can not be completed nor you be able to get your money when you need it so just don‚Äôt count on it!!! Purposely chose this app for that reason and guess what, it works whenever it wants or whenever it feels like it. There are better apps like cashapp, they might charge you a bit higher fee, but you get your money when you need it. Very much disappointed with support and with the app."
125,MrsGifted,"July 29, 2019",5,"Worst app ever!!! I literally got this app to be paid from somebody. Transferred money immediately onto my debit card. Worked fine. The next day I couldn‚Äôt transfer anything, using the Insta transfer. I transferred it to my husbands account he couldn‚Äôt either. So I was not able to call customer service because they work less than banker hours. So I was messaging a customer service representative. Who could not tell me literally anything about what was going on with my account. I mean it‚Äôs literally their job to know what‚Äôs going on with my account. And she couldn‚Äôt give me any information. So then I transferred it to a friend because I need to pay my bills like last Friday. And she submitted the $500 to her bank, but Venmo only released $100. Seriously do not recommend this app. Stick with Apple cash or PayPal."

127,Brenden27,"January 14, 2020",1,"Venmo does not value their users Venmo is a terrible app. I would not recommend this app to anyone, as there are far better apps for money transfers available on the App Store. I am appalled at the customer service that such a predominant FinTech company such as Venmo offers. Venmo does not operate in a client-centric manner and only focuses on increasing its profitability. I have called customer service numerous times to try to find a resolution on why Venmo was declining my payments. The wait times to even talk to a customer service representative were absurd and they often blame the bank you are affiliated with even if you are using your own Venmo balance. It wasn‚Äôt until I called for a fourth time that I was told, ""the system declined the payment due to a security issue, and they could not override the system."" I was ultimately told to delete the app, use PayPal, or find another solution that isn‚Äôt Venmo because this would continue to happen. I would not recommend using Venmo or talking to their customer service because they simply do not value you as a user."

The customer service rep removed one duplicate charge from my account thankfully.  A second duplicate charge was eventually removed but he left a pending charge on my account that is the third charge for the same transaction and it is 28 days old at this point.  In effect, dude has frozen my account without explanation.  I have no idea of if or when this pending charge will fall off the account.  I have no idea of when I will receive a new card.

The 3 day transfer is still free, and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get my cash so I almost opted for that, but if you look at the reviews on the AppStore and also now around the web, there has been a HUGE spike in negative comments just in the last month as well as  report after report of people telling the same story of Venmo freezing funds, reversing transfers, requesting timely snail mail I‚Äôd verifications all leading to no releasing of funds with no explanations.

There hasn‚Äôt been one time I have used this app without it freezing somewhere along the process! I get the backend systems are complicated - I also work technology for a bank and understand that regulations etc make processing payments a complicated/convoluted process but this should have absolutely no affect on the GUI interface you have developed and may I say in the absolutely nicest way I can think - REDO THE WHOLE APP - when I go to select a person i want to pay there‚Äôs a good 15 seconds delay from the person selection list showing and me clicking the button - adding more people onto the request - forget about it that‚Äôll take another 20 seconds.

I understand that for privacy reasons but why isn't this taken more serious from venmo or the police!? No one is helping me out and I just want them to ban the account from transactions to go through using my bank information! I'm tired of this."

I emailed and called Venmo and I was told to check with my bank to see if it was back dated! My bank didn‚Äôt find the funds so I went back to Venmo and they gave me a trace number. I gave it to my bank and they still couldn‚Äôt find it! Now every time I contact Venmo they tell me they need to request a trace number or they are waiting on one. I told them I already have it provide them with proof and they are still waiting to get it from there bank. Today I call and apparently one of the people I was emailing isn‚Äôt and employee of Venmo but somehow she was able I email me from Venmo with a Venmo letterhead and email address and provide me with a trace number but the person I spoke to today couldn‚Äôt find her in their employee list.

We went through almost I want to say seven people to even get to someone competent enough to help us , as of now our money is still frozen , they‚Äôre asking for a ton of documents and statements with our personal information on them (I get it like money and banking but it‚Äôs getting excessive). We‚Äôre in our twenties and we just want to get our rent money and this company has now not only made us late for rent but caused us much unneeded stress and anxiety.

I was using the instant transfer for all of my transactions until suddenly it didn‚Äôt work at all. When you contact Venmo to see the problem, they give you all of 0 information about how to get it fixed (based off of several phone calls) then they tell you to just use the 3 day transfer... but I don‚Äôt want to use the three day transfer and so I‚Äôll be using a different service from now on. Apparently Venmo‚Äôs is supposed to be used for paying friends and other small transactions and not for business which they never actually let you know, this is potentially one of the many unknown reasons why the instant transaction doesn‚Äôt work for me.

Other than that, it‚Äôs a great way to pay others back when you have forgotten your wallet or want to pool money to one payer for convenience.

I tried to do that but it didn‚Äôt let me time after time. I thought the system was failing so I kept trying again. I brought it up to their attention today and was told it still needs review from another team and they would tell them to give me an email within 2 days! I have been very impatient with the process but you guys are so unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with in time like this. I‚Äôll try to get my money back and never again would I use this company!
202,lindsay319,"November 12, 2018",1,"Worst money app I‚Äôve used My husband and I have different banks so we use apps like these to send money back and forth every month for bills. This month after multiple times using it with no issue, they have kept our money. It‚Äôs not just a little money either. My husband sent me $1300 and Venmo immediately sent it back saying they didn‚Äôt like the transaction yet they held onto the money. This was Nov. 5th I believe, maybe earlier. After multiple phone calls to the bank and to Venmo, they said it should be refunded in 3-5 business days. It is Nov. 12th and they have still not refunded any of the $1300. I will NEVER use this app again. DONT trust them, they will take your money for no reason. Nothing about our transactions were different than anything before, my husband is a disabled veteran who was just trying to pay his bills and this whole thing pretty much ruined Veterans Day weekend being negative $1300 unexpectedly. All they care about is money."

This is the absolute most pathetic customer service ive ever experienced. My account was frozen the day before my birthday which was this past Saturday. Customer service wasnt open untill Monday. They said my request to unfreeze my account would take 2-3 business days. The specialist reached out today with information that provided no help on how to get my money and never responded. Now im being asked for a picture of my ID for a 4th time. And still no response from ‚Äúcustomer support‚Äù. Its clear venmo does not care about its customers at all.

Everything was good on that end so since I only got 5$ I thought I should just let it go. But I recently was reimbursed for date night and noticed that I still couldn‚Äôt get the money.

The truth is they received my money and either lost it or kept it to themselves. You get one email response a day and it is one of two thing. They tell you to check back with the other party (draft kings, which already provided proof of sending the payment to my card) or they give you another task to complete (verifying my email for the fourth time!).

I had $200 on my Venmo account that I hadn‚Äôt transferred to my bank account yet. When they banned me from Venmo, they also told me that there was no way for me to get my $200 back. That‚Äôs ridiculous and such a spam. It has happened to multiple other people I know as well. Would never reccomend."

I've tried reaching out to venmo about this, they are usually unavailable through their phone line, however I was able to talk to someone with their chat but all they did was tell me to change my password and freeze my account. Thank goodness for my bank and their efforts to get me my money back, but just today venmo has charged a retry payment to my account and yet again taken all my money. Even after my claim was made that these charges were not authorized and even after my account was frozen. On top of that I was never notified of this even after I turned on notification. I hope you read this and choose a different app because this can happen to you. It's clearly evident that venmo has zero fraud support and are catering to thieves."
247,Jenjen1363,"July 31, 2019",1,"Horrible Experience This is absolutely the worst money transferring app I‚Äôve ever used. When I receive money, I can‚Äôt always instant deposit. When I accidentally send money to someone, I can‚Äôt get it automatically returned or cancelled!!! I have to instead ask the other party to send the funds back and WAIT 1-3 business days for the money to be deposited into my account. This caused my account to overdraft!!! I only wanted to transfer $200, but I received an error message, so I transferred $202. Turns out both transactions were processed, when I only intended for one. Using Venmo for 2 weeks has been extremely inconvenient and stressful. I never NEVER have any problems using cash app. I am able to cancel, return, instant deposit, with no problems what‚Äôs so ever. Their processes are nearly seamless. I thought I‚Äôd give this app a try to expand my network, but I probably won‚Äôt use it ever again. It put me in a real financial bind."

They also say that funds could be frozen or removed without explanation, even though the funds are good and legitimate. You should be alerted that part of a system is not working before you take a huge payment that I could have done via check or bank transfer or anything else really, because this is absolutely ridiculous. It will let you send the funds internally but will not allow instant transfers which was the whole point of using the app. They just tell me in customer service that we cannot see the reason why. Are you serious? What am I to tell the client? I‚Äôm just out $1500 without explanation? I can try bank transfer with 1-3 business days but apparently they cannot assure me that it will work either.

He then told me that it was isolated to the one transaction, but when I said this shouldn‚Äôt happen again he doubled back and told me there is no guarantee. They aren‚Äôt able to access anything in the app to fix any accounts. The whole thing is automated and no one is regulating or controlling it.

I love the fact I can just pay my friends very fast if I owe them something or viceversa!!

I had to link my bank account which then had Venmo send a couple small charges to verify that put 2 more overdraft fees from my bank on me. I now owe my bank an extra $180 in overdraft fees that would have been avoided had I been allowed to use the service that Venmo had let me use 3 times before cutting me off with no notifications first.

It back-doors you into letting it view your contacts, then, without notice, it automatically ‚Äúfriends‚Äù EVERYONE in your contact list who is Venmo, sharing all your transactions as a default. You have to opt-out of having private transactions shared with everyone on your phone. The process to ‚Äúun-friend‚Äù everyone is difficult and time consuming. Syncing the app to your bank account is more difficult than most similar apps (Mint, PayPal, etc.). Once set up, the transactions are quick as easy. I have yet to be paid using Venmo, so I don‚Äôt know how easy or difficult it is to get the money from Venmo to your account.

As a first time customer who is usually very computer literate, having used PayPal and Zelle, I find Venmo very unintuitive. And there is no recourse for correcting a mis-sent payment other than requesting the return. Is there opportunity for negative feedback on a user that refuses such a return? Also, I was expecting the opportunity to confirm with a telephone number my second payment recipient. This time the payment sent without the request for confirmation.

So apparently I can receive payments but it will not allow me to send money?!?  How annoying!  I tried to send $40 and after repeated attempts & it being denied (yes, there was enough $ in the account) I called customer service.  I was told that there were no issues with my account, that I was using it correctly but sometimes this happens and that there is nothing they can do about it, no override.  I should just keep trying and if it is urgent use another method to send the money.  Really???"

The other day a friend sent me money so I would be able to use it to buy them something since they are unable to due to school and when I tried to transfer the balance into my bank account it said it was unsupported even though I had already gone through the entire verification process. On top of that, when I went to send him the money back, it took it straight out of my bank account, not my venmo balance. Now I‚Äôm at loss of $100+ dollars due to this and won‚Äôt be able to get my money back for weeks because I won‚Äôt be seeing him until then. Why bother to verify my bank account when I‚Äôm not going to be able to transfer money into it?? I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered with this app if I had known that, no one wants to use this app solely for sending others money and never receiving any. Will not be using again."
289,gshdioekenfbrhr,"February 1, 2020",1,"Victim of a Scam Use Zelle. I was a victim of a scam with Venmo, so there are weaknesses in their cyber security. When I told Venmo what had happened they put it under investigation but they were not helpful in trying to stop the fraudulent  charges. I went to my bank and they were able to freeze my account. A day later the charges hit my account, but since the account was frozen, the funds did not transfer. My Venmo account showed a negative balance for the charges. What is disturbing about the whole ordeal was that Venmo released the fund to the scammer, and when my bank did not transfer the my fund to Venmo, Venmo held ME responsible for the balance. Ridiculous. I am not sure what Venmo did as far as pursuing the scammers for the funds, but they will not allow me to use the app any more after this whole situation. That‚Äôs fine.

I don‚Äôt want that information out to my friends and assume they don‚Äôt like it either.  What‚Äôs up with that?   Why do they have to have that feature?

Not a 5 star card at this time.  Currently I am on a week without being able to transfer funds (same day) to my personal bank account being Venmo has blocked all transfers leaving this situation very inconvenient. I use my Venmo card daily and have also had times of the card being blocked for purchases with no notification at all.

I emailed their customer support and told them of my mistake. They responded and said they needed further info. I sent them back that info; no response. I called to check on this status. I was directed to a ‚Äúreview‚Äù dept. This dept. said, THEY LOOKED INTO MY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS and saw that the person I had sent the payment to by mistake, was on my friends list, and SHOW THEIR CONTACT INFO IN MY CONTACTS ON MY PHONE!

A card purchase or a bank withdrawal. If you load your card for personal use for small purchases but need to send money to a friend or family member exceeding that amount it wipes your card clean first then you have to reload the card which takes days before that money is available,  which is inconvenient. I try to use my card for specific purposes keeping transactions separate. As it is today it forces me to mix transactions causing more work on the back end."

First off there was no issue adding fund, transferring to Venmo, then transferring to an account.  However, as soon as that happened the nightmare started.  Venmo suspected it as fraud and held out fund for almost 3 weeks.  When we talk to customer service they couldn't / wouldn't give us any info and then on top of it the issue was escalated to someone we couldn't call.  All communication had to be done through email.  It was the worst experience ever.  I think this app is a great idea and I would've used it like crazy but never again.  We used it once, got banned for life, and almost lost all our money.

Super disappointed with the customer service, was told it would be 1-2 days before the billing service contacts me and this ordeal has been going on for well over 24 hours already. My bank said that if Venmo can contact them, they can cancel the payment and release my funds back into the account and Venmo, even the supervisor, claims that It‚Äôs a Call Center and We Can‚Äôt Make Outgoing Calls. I want my money back and I want my late fees covered. Why tout this app as a way to send money instantly if my money is stuck in the ether for 1-5 days? It‚Äôs 2019.

When you call customer service their answers for why are scripted with no real help or accountability. There is no department to complain to nor is there any recourse as a customer...all they tell you is that they will send your complaint to a unnamed department and to not expect a response back. Feel like their service is framed to only work for certain types of customers and is biased as my credit score is low (despite the fact that I have no line of credit with them and simply want to pay bills.

They should insist on multi-step authentication.  I‚Äôve been hacked and had $2000+ stolen in a matter of seconds. All because Venmo doesn‚Äôt require stiffer authentication to enter the app and to authorize additional/new users. They also don‚Äôt have 24/7 help like a bank in case of fraud.

I immediately changed my password and PIN as my account had been compromised. Venmo froze my account, then asked for a photo of my drivers license in an email. I did so and today, 3 days after the fraudulent payment, Venmo permanently cancelled my account for violation of terms. When I called customer service, they claimed that their policy did not allow them to handle disputes by phone. Unbelievable. Not only will I never see my $180 again, but I guess I somehow violated my contract without even doing anything! It‚Äôs just as well that my account is cancelled as I would have cancelled it myself. Venmo at your own risk! I regret that I did."
332,mccannpr,"May 15, 2018",2,"Square Cash is better but Venmo works fine Venmo is an okay payment app but I like Squarecash much better, Venmo is more well known and more of my friends use it so that is why I use it but I prefer Squarecash because if you choose the free option Venmo takes much longer. If you receive a payment late Friday or Saturday you won‚Äôt see that money until Tuesday unless you want to pay to speed it up. Also, I love how SquareCash gives you a real debit card for free if you request one or you can just use their virtual debit card # to spend the money instantly anywhere. If Venmo could make their free withdrawals transfer by the next day regardless of the day of the week and had the same free features of SquareCash then I would choose to use it instead of only using it for friends without Squarecash."

I‚Äôve been using Venmo for around 2 years and never had 1 issue with it. Also...I I am really happy to of signed up for a Venmo MasterCard. Having the option to spend my Venmo balance using my Venmo MC or easily transfer it to my bank account instantly for only 25 cents is very convenient...and when they say instant transfer...it is very much so.

It is ridiculous that PayPal 1) has two separate payment apps that do the same thing, and 2) that PayPal did not think to at least integrate the two platforms.  I have had PayPal for well over 10 years, and I simply did not need another payment app.  PayPal worked perfectly fine.  If you wanted to add all these pointless features, you should‚Äôve just added it to the PayPal app and platform.  At a minimum, you should‚Äôve integrated the two separate platforms so that PayPal users can pay Venmo users without having to download another app from the same company that does the same thing.  It‚Äôs not rocket science, why did you have to complicate things when nobody was asking for a separate app?  To make matters worse, you‚Äôre still not turning a profit on Venmo.

I was pinballed back and forth between my bank and Venmo trying to figure out where my money is and if there‚Äôs anything anyone could do, but all they did was point fingers at each other. I‚Äôm BEYOND frustrated with their customer service and the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù I received. I‚Äôm also frustrated with my credit union! "
381,JustaGrlJuls,"August 6, 2018",1,"They cancelled my ability to instant transfer without a warning or explanation If I could give it no stars, I would. I just downloaded Venmo a few weeks ago. Everything seemed okay until they stopped my ability to send instant transfers to my bank. When I called they gave me no information on why my account was flagged. Just that it was, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to use instant transfer now. I had to Google it to find out that larger transfers can be deemed suspicious, and they will stop the ability to instantly transfer to a bank with no prior warning. Now I have to use the standard transfer option and it takes 3+ days to receive the money in the bank. This app is good for smaller payments, like splitting a check with friends. But that‚Äôs about it. Zelle is the better option for instant transfers."

Every time I try to send money it declines. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether I try using a debit card or a Venmo balance it still declines even though there are more than enough funds available. I called in trying to see if they could figure it out and all they could tell me was there was an error on the back side but they could not talk to whoever would know what the error is. It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous they cannot figure out the problem.
385,USMC Mommy,"April 4, 2020",2,"Unprofessional and Potentially Dangerous Nearly everyone leaves their payments public.  Do you really want everyone you know to see what you bought from who?

Hey do you want everyone to know you‚Äôre dating someone or think you‚Äôre dating someone?  Then why share your exchanges of money.  Do you want everyone to know what you bought or what you eat?

I tried for a few days to see if it would work, but it continuously did not work. I decided to go to support to see if I could resolve this, and the response that I get was ‚ÄúSorry I cannot help with this‚Äù. That is literally the only job support has to do, and they gave me a sorry, we cannot currently transfer your funds. So the app offers a feature that does not work when you need it, and support does not offer support, aside from emotional support with a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù."

I've also had friends say it's even been up to 2-3 days! I myself however, have only experienced up to 6 hours. Besides that it's great.

I contacted there support teams twice about this and they said there was nothing they could do so they would put me in touch with managers and that they would be in touch . Both times I was never reached out to by management and had to lose the money . If you are looking for ease of transferring of money this is a good map as long as you don‚Äôt mind getting stolen from every once in a while and never contacted again after two years I am finally deleting the app I‚Äôd rather have to resort back to using cash then have money stolen out of my pocket .

I notified them it wasn‚Äôt me then changed my password as they recommended. THEN THEH SHUT ME OUT OF MY ACCOUNT. For weeks. They have been trying to get me to reactivate my account by sending part of my SSN and a photo of my government issued ID through an email account. Not even directly through their app. This seems sketchy and bologna since you don‚Äôt have to do this to open an account. It won‚Äôt even let me transfer my balance to my NORMAL BANK ACCOUNT which obviously is mine since I‚Äôve transferred all my money there previously. Dropped the ball on things in my opinion and not listening to their customers fears and concerns.

I paid her through square cash thinking Venmo would be quick to give me my money back, maybe 2 weeks max. I was very mistake, I have called and messaged Venmo several times (like over 5 times), my friend has also emailed them telling them to give me my money back.

But wait I did get another account because paying rent through a transfer is easier than a check or cash. I hook up my new bank and I still can‚Äôt send a payment. Reached out to Venmo and haven‚Äôt heard back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If it worked this would be a great app but unfortunately I can‚Äôt use it

434,allyson faith,"April 24, 2020",1,Frozen Venmo account I had contacted venmo twice about my account being frozen and only spoke with one account specialist about it. There was apparently a card added & then deleted in the same day that I have never had nor do I currently have it causing my venmo to freeze. I don‚Äôt see why I can not have my account unfrozen. Apparently I have to prove that I have access to said card when I have already stated I do not. I have provided proof for the only card on my account. I really enjoyed and used venmo quite frequently and the fact that they are not going to unfreeze my venmo account makes me quite angry. I would even deal with a probation period if possible. I just don‚Äôt see it necessary to keep an account that is frequently used frozen for a card they do not have access to.

I contacted the venmo technical support and all they could do was apologize and say that there is nothing they can do about it there for trapping my money in the Venmo account because now I can‚Äôt transfer the money to my bank. If this happened only once then sure I can understand but if it happened several times and I am being told the reason is a security reason .... come on stop scamming people by promoting a feature that traps users money in your account Venmo !

Cash app STILL hasn‚Äôt fixed it and I have a cash deposit pending with them that I cannot access and not a single person to speak to in real time to help me fix it. Just emails and waiting for a response. Ridiculous. Would recommend Venmo. Deleting cash app as soon as I get my money (if I ever do. Its also worth noting that it‚Äôs a decent amount of money.)

But what upset me more was the rep telling the system would not allow me to add the card not telling me why. Her not even trying to resolve my issue just kept repeating the system frustrated me even more. Will not use this app anytime soon once I get my lil sister $20 off I‚Äôm deleting it totally.

Same as most bad reviews on here, the level of intrusiveness by Venmo is rather concealing the fact that this is not as trustworthy of an app as it appears. Think of how much engagement you just had over the word wide tracked web with information that provided no solutions. How this has 4.9 stars is ridiculous. The app is still primitive  in appearance and functionality. The fact that their team member believe deleting their data of you in your possession is enough while improperly processing your issues, makes the company poorly managed problem the biggest concern.  No one knows your issue, yet they make determining factors on what your accounts status is. Still have not received my money and all they did was send me invoice with a non working link.."

Venmo makes sending and receiving money super easy. It has a social engagement side to it when it shows you payed someone and others can comment on it. The publicity of your money transfers can be made private if wanted, but is always interesting to see what others are up to! Would totally recommend and it has made my life so much easier. Not much they really can change either"

After numerous calls and emails back and forth I‚Äôve been left waiting for the money to be transferred back into my account.m but nothing. My most recent email states that I‚Äôve ‚Äúviolated the user agreement‚Äù and that there was nothing further they could do.

The best option I was given was to send the money to another Venmo user and pick the cash up from them, thereby rendering your service obsolete. I have spoken to multiple customer service reps at your company and all I get are apologies. I will be cancelling my account as there is no point in having it if I can not access my money. For future customers you should probably make it clear to them that this card is not usable because I was told it can be used anywhere debit mastercard is accepted and that is absolutely false.

At least describe the basic cause of the payment denial so that I can attempt to correct it.  If your service denies 50% of my transactions there is no need for me to invest any time or effort using you for business or personal money handling.  I‚Äôll simply use a service that completes my transactions or explains in detail any problem."

Make sure to set your settings to private or else everyone on Venmo will know your business and see all your transactions. 2. If you have a joint account, Venmo only allows one of you to transfer funds directly into your bank account from Venmo. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúsecurity ‚Äú precaution.

So Venmo when signing up It wouldn‚Äôt recognize my phone number which I then called and the rep told me to send in I sent in an email to a rep the billing from my phone provider that the phone number belonged to me. Fast forward today and I can‚Äôt transfer money from my bank because my phone number not verified on Venmo and I can‚Äôt pay rent on time.

470,Hotboionfyah,"October 19, 2017",1,Very sketchy Never have I heard of a company asking for your direct login info to your bank account.  I ended up adding my account with the routing number and account number only for venmo to later say my account is invalid when I tried to transfer money to my bank on the second transaction.  The tech never answered my questions and just stated for me to contact my bank.  They do not cut checks to clear up the balance on your account so that I can close the account.  They refunded the money back to the one who sent it but it takes 2-4 business days for that person to receive it.  It also states under their FAQ that if funds are ‚Äúlost‚Äù during a transfer that it is not Venmo‚Äôs fault or responsibility.  Why anyone would trust this company is beyond me. TIP OF THE DAY: DO NOT USE VENMO.
471,Bz working mom,"October 26, 2017",5,First venmo transaction was a fiasco Somehow paid the wrong recipient who has same name as intended payee. There were no fail safes or warnings. My friend let me know something was wrong and i was easily able to get venmo to chat online and provide guidance. My friend's payment was delayed and i had no idea. This involved me having to reach out to the stranger and explain highly Awkward situation. He did not reimburse me for fear venmo would also reimburse me. Moving forward i will always ask friend to bill me. Its a risk to be proactive. I hope it works out as expected and venmo reimburses me in 3 days.

I asked how long it takes for them to ‚Äúreview‚Äù my account and they stated 2-3 business days. If I wanted to wait that long, I would‚Äôve just transferred it to her bank.

In the past I have sent money to a friends account that he found himself locked out of & Venmo failed to help him recover. Upon learning this I had to send him money twice to the correct account. Yet as the Venmo platform doesn‚Äôt have anyway to request reverses or fix this issue, I had to contact my bank to fix it. Yet the moment more funds were deposited into my account, Venmo instantly robbed me & took the difference from my balance. This is why this platform is failing and going to lose to other superior apps. I tell everyone I know to quit using Venmo because of consistent mess ups and abysmal customer service. This is a corrupt predatory service and I have reached my last straw, I‚Äôm deleting my Venmo account and uninstalling it."

Without notification, Venmo will complete a transaction for you and cover the payment if your funds are unavailable from your bank. This will cause you to then have to go to your bank and ask them to either refund your money or place a stop payment on your bank so your funds can make it to the payee. Venmo will freeze your account and suspend it until you pay back the indebted amount otherwise you‚Äôre stuck in a situation where you‚Äôve paid for a stop payment to occur, you‚Äôre trying to recover your money from insufficient funds from your bank, as well as trying to get a refund back from the payee."

I could have money instantly sent to my debit card unfortunately my card got hacked so removed it from my Venmo account. When my replacement card arrived I added it to Venmo account just as I had before with the old card but for some reason I am now unable to do instant  transfers to my new debit card. I called customer service and although they did agree that it was declining to do the instant transfer they could  not give me any type of explanation as to why it worked just fine with one card but didn‚Äôt work at all with the other even though it‚Äôs the same bank account.

Good news, my checking account did not get deducted from these charges.. so far. Venmo ended up filling my Venmo balance to complete these fraudulent charges, which potentially means this person ACTUALLY got away with stealing. I called CS back about that balance being deducted and they were still unable to answer any questions I had. Anyway, due to this ordeal, I will not be reinstating my suspended account and Venmo.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not aware of any retailer accepting Venmo unless you have their debit card. Since Venmo is much more popular with young people than PayPal ever was, the latter has the advantage of being accepted as payment by lots of brick & mortar stores and on the go. Personally, I love PayPals credit option allowing you to pay back the full amount but interest free if paid in full within 6 months. Hopefully, Venmo is thinking of implementing this option, come up with something similar or even better."

I downloaded the app and followed the set up procedures as appropriate but when I tried to add a bank account, I got an error message. First message was that my bank account was already in use by someone else. I tried again and got another error message saying my account was frozen. I tried to look into faqs to see how I can resolve but the guide there says I should get an email with instructions to unfreeze but I have been refreshing my inbox and did not get an email. Now I don‚Äôt even want to use Venmo anymore and don‚Äôt know how I can deactivate it. Useless useless!"
524,LegendKiller231831,"October 6, 2018",1,"An unnecessary hassle with something that‚Äôs supposed to make it easy I already was tired of the fact that you literally HAVE to put in a reason for the transaction. That was aggravating, but I put up with it because it‚Äôs cheaper for the person I send money to to get it out instantly with this app. Then I process and transaction for 260 that comes out TWICE. I contact them and they tell me it will go away once the bank fixes it so I wait. One posts and I reach out again they tell me to wait because one is still processing and will go away. The 2nd posts and I contact them and they tell me I have to wait 2-3 days for them to email me about it... WHAT?! Are you kidding me? This is unacceptable. Do NOT I repeat DO NOT use this app they will screw your eventually."

After using WeChat pay and Alipay for years, I was so excited to see Venmo coming out. This was supposed to be cool, social and convenient. But all I see is an unethical, shady business practice that doesn‚Äôt care about its users at all! "
526,versopp,"April 25, 2020",5,"Oh Venmo, we love you Who knows what we did before this app. Honestly Venmo successfully grows a sense of community. We can buy each other what people want in the moment and be paid back later, gift money without a scene, and keep track of transactions. We still know the value of money, but having this app makes life so much LESS about the money. There‚Äôs not 10 minutes of figuring out how to pay someone back, or 10 minutes of finding a checkbook to write a utility check. Just...‚ÄùI‚Äôll Venmo you!‚Äù. Thanks Venmo."

I‚Äôm on day 3 and honestly I don‚Äôt feel like waiting that long for my money to be transferred, it contradicts the purpose of convenience. In top of that my bank says the money was withdrawn and I have yet to see it in my Venmo account. So ya, I‚Äôll stick with cash app. Easy to use, doesn't have the whole social media thing that shares yours and your friends purchases/ payments (which I thought that was dumb and weird), and when I transfer money to my cash app it happens within seconds.

The few times I‚Äôve ran into issues, their customer service has exceeded my expectations every single time. Secondly, the apps security and privacy policy is perfect. Never have I ran into any issues with fraudulent or suspicious activity. If I have, they were quick to help me close my account and create a new one, hassle free. Great Job Venmo!"
530,pojones,"September 28, 2017",3,"Convenience offset by social aspect I thoroughly enjoy the service provided and its ease of use. It's also quite popular and common among those I know, particularly in big cities like NYC, making it even easier to frequently use it. But unlike Square Cash, it needlessly combines a social aspect that informs others of financial transactions, from menial payments of going out to eat to far more substantial and personal items like rent. I've turned this feature off, keeping all transactions private, but most everyone else I know pops up on the financial feed with all their transactions out in the open, rather than kept private and secure."
531,FirstSheTaz,"October 8, 2018",1,"Not worth the trouble better off using Zelle I signed up for Venmo because a client of mine uses it to send funds from time to time. After setting up my account everything seemed to be working fine. However I was then sent an email saying that my account was frozen and if I didn‚Äôt provide them with an excessive amount of background information that my account it would stay frozen. After already sending this app my banking info, name, address I didn‚Äôt see the need for them to then have utility bills, copies of my sensitive documents and any of the other items that they asked for. With identity theft being so rampant today I would rather use Zelle that is already linked to major banks and does not demand my sensitive information."

For example, if I want to send $100, and I have $50 in my Venmo balance, I have to do two transactions. First transaction $50 from Venmo, second transaction $50 from my bank account. Instead of pressing send $100 and it pulls from my Venmo balance first and the rest from my bank account easily. The app is appreciated, just wanted to let you know how it would be easier for myself personally."

534,Bar tabber,"December 8, 2019",1,"Not enough security I‚Äôm quitting Venmo before it is too late. My research:  Venmo is not secure.  It does not allow the user to set appropriate limits on transactions. It is easy for hackers scammers and thieves to get your money and Venmo will not prevent, protect, recover, or make you whole if you are victim of theft or fraud. Did you know that Venmo will advance thousands of dollars for you (or a thief) regardless of how much money is in your bank account?  Venmo does not have a sure way of tracking and recovering stolen money from users. YOU are then required to pay Venmo the entire amount. You could be wiped out. Yes it‚Äôs free product, but it still holds that if you are not paying for the product, you ARE the product. Users beware. This service is not being operated with your best interest in mind."

Verification of your identity process used by them us questionable as they allow you to use app and send receive money and decide when you need to verify which is after you use the app. They can freeze your acct for no reason and they can keep your money. It took me 3 months to get my money cause of that. They wanted documents emailed which is not secure. My id had to be unaltered and then bank acct info as well- really ???? Be careful since your venmo acct breach allows access to your bank and your money

I will be contacting the BBB (better business bureau ) to report them. None of there customer service people have any knowledge on what‚Äôs going on and the people who do have to be emailed which they do not respond if they do they take days to respond. I will never be using their services again once I get my funds off that account.

So I tried another card and it said It was not authorized for online use ( which is not true because I have mobile access to both of my accounts)Both are great banks . And all customer service can say something about red flags and sorry for your inconvenience. Save that bs for your boss ! It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trying to send thousands of dollars ! It was just 200 bucks! I‚Äôm not usually the one to write reviews but this app deserves ALL the one stars it can get ! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to NO-ONE!!

But if you need to find someone it takes less than a minute to find and add them. So much easier than adding a person to your list on your bank contacts to transfer money.

Only slightly more usable than driving to the ATM and taking out cash: four separate unmarked icons need to be pressed to even get to the point where you can begin to send money to another person.  Venmo‚Äôs just-updated FAQs actually provide incorrect information, and following their steps won‚Äôt allow you to pay anyone anything! I only use the iOS app 1-2 times a month, so I don‚Äôt remember the intricate procedure required to send money, so I just spend 5-10 minutes fumbling around until I hit on the correct sequence of steps to get what I need.  For an app that only does one thing, this is really poor usability."

It is easier to pay people when they also have it. The annoying thing, for me personally, is the inability to link my joint bank account to my Venmo since my husband already has it on his. I have linked my debit card but I cannot transfer to the bank directly. Sure I can pay my hubby and then he can transfer, but schedules, work travel, and life in general sometimes make it difficult to get funds. Honestly, also annoying to have to travel ‚Äúback in time‚Äù and wait for my husband to give me money hahaha! It‚Äôs the 2000s Venmo. Just sayin‚Äô"

Cold and alone I knew the odds were against me. My only way out was to bribe my captors but alas I didn‚Äôt have any money on me. That‚Äôs where Venmo came in.

To add to the uneasiness, the only way to reinstate my account is to send a picture of a government issued photo ID over to a group of people that I can't speak with to unfreeze my account that I believe was frozen wrongly to begin with.

The next day it was already 3 pm and i have not yet to receive my funds. Called customer service and i was told that they were waiting on my bank to process the transfer. I then call my bank (CitiBank) and was told there were no pending deposits. In a world of Zelle and Cashapp this app is useless and doesn‚Äôt come close to it at all.

But my bank assured me that the fault was 100% Venmo for not properly delivering the funds. Thus $400 just disappearing. I have just received and email stating that I know owe Venmo $400 because I disputed and won the case. And if I do not pay $400 to Venmo they will go to collections. Do Not use Venmo.

I actually get frustrated now whenever a friend wants to pay me back with check or cash. I tease them about sending me a telegraph while they are at it. I can't count the number of people I've referred to this app. Love it!
622,lllwwwwfff,"May 28, 2019",5,Don‚Äôt do it!!! They can leave your money in limbo between accounts and u have no recourse. They have no ability to do any manual transfers so something happens you are out of luck. My daughter accidentally caused my account to be overdrawn and when she realized it she transfer back the money into my account.  Venmo did not allow it and could not give me a reason. I was charged an overdraft fee by my bank and I am hoping that my money hits my account tomorrow but I will never use the app again

This all occurred AFTER Venmo supposedly froze my account because they themselves detected fraudulent activity. Really horrified this was tied to my bank account. Thus far Venmo has said their ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù found it was not fraudulent even though they‚Äôd notified me moments before this attempt was made via email to alert me of fraudulent activity.

The money does not go straight into your bank account like their competitors offer. You have to accept payments before they will deposit them into your Venmo account... why is this necessary?! I‚Äôve never met anyone who didn‚Äôt want the money they were owed. Then they give you 2 options to transfer your money...instant which costs 1% and 1-3 days for free.

Also, PayPal and Venmo are joined and there is no option to transfer money from Venmo to PayPal which makes absolutely no sense to me at all.

Their agents lie to you about refunding your money. Don‚Äôt use this app it‚Äôs the worst.

I have contacted customer support via phone but their phone service has been unavailable for a while. Customer service rep ended my chat and said I will be transferred to another department and nobody contacted me! I added my bank account through signing in and my account got validated but still can‚Äôt transfer the money. I get an error message that says there is a problem with my account.

After two calls to customer service and my bank, 24hrs later I‚Äôm still dealing with a large ‚Äúpending‚Äù hold on my card that will take up to five days until I can dispute it with my bank. Venmo still claims to have no record of one of the payments, and no explanation as to why a rejected payment is being held."

Only reason I can‚Äôt give 5 stars it because it takes absolutely forever to load. The home page, someone‚Äôs individual page, to load a search term, you name it - it takes forever. Also for this same reason probably, it freezes a lot.

677,Liesl1313,"August 21, 2019",5,No issues and very happy with Venmo Easy to use. Have the Venmo card and makes it even easier when you receive payments. When I had an issue it was easy to contact support and they took care of my issue step by step and even followed up with emails and phone calls. Found Venmo easier to use and no issues like I have had with paypal. Recommend using Venmo to send and receive payments to anyone who is looking for a service to use.

I will never use this app again after I get my money back and I will let everyone know how crappy this app is. I also have over 200,000 IG followers so I will be posting this on my Instagram if my cash isn‚Äôt instant deposited into my account by tomorrow.

So I had a balance of $20 on Venmo and tried to transfer it to a friend for bills. So my Venmo balance went from $20 to zero, but the next day I saw that my banking account was also charged and my Venmo balance disappeared. So in total they stole $40 from me and customer service is of no help. All they (Jiv G) did was explain how it should work (something I already know, which is how I know they messed up).

I can‚Äôt transfer it to my bank and the only thing I‚Äôm getting told is I have to wait for an account specialist. I wouldn‚Äôt use this service again if I were paid to.

Now I am paying overdraft fees and there is absolutely nobody I can talk to regarding the matter. The app is only good for sending and receiving payments, but if you end up with any problems you will have 0 support. Switching to Zelle cause they have real humans who help."

If I have any questions they have a live representative to help me. I can even use my venmo debit card for store purchase. You can get money back for the atm but they charge a huge fee of $5.00 but besides that venom is amazing especially to pay a friend or request money if u don't have cash on hand. I made all my friends and family members get it to make our lives simpler.

They now do not charge a standard fee of .25 cents for instant transfers, they now feel the need to take 1%. As a college student, I loved Venmo because I was able to receive money from family members quickly without having to pay a lot to transfer. Now, Venmo wants to act as the IRS and take a cut which is awful! Sorry Venmo but you just made a rookie mistake!"

Why do I need to type in ALL the card info every time I want to make a payment?! Totally stupid. The app obviously has the info. It shows the last 4 digits of the card. Not just asking for a new expiry date. No. It wants everything. Total waste of time. Will just hand the guy cash. Much faster, easier and less apt to raise ones blood pressure trying to decipher the inscrutable UI of this thing."

Then an email requesting my ID. Next email states that they need to still prove further that I am who I am by sending four months of bank statements, and account statements for all of the cards on file with the Venmo. Why not ask for that IN ADVANCE to ensure people are not having money held if receiving, or rejected upon first try when sending. Never had this problem at a PayPal and this is supposed to be a company under the PayPal umbrella?! Unacceptable."

The email I received required me to submit a copy of my driver‚Äôs license to show proof of identity and unfreeze my account (which was pending a transfer of over $900 to my bank account). I submitted the copy of my legal ID and two days later they sent me another generic email telling me I violated their User Terms of Agreement and my account was permanently deleted. No explanation of why and no way for me to obtain the funds that had been in process. Attempts to further follow up produced no results and I‚Äôve now had to engage legal counsel to try to get the funds that are being held by Venmo. Beware using this app!!!!

(No one else has done this with my permission, and their support team just send links to the help questions.) I've tried just sending the money to someone else that is willing to just transfer it to their account and give me the money, but it won't even let me send the money I have on balance.

I had $420 on hold and my account suspended for silly mistake because I sent it to wrong person and when he resent it back got me and this person account suspended and my $420 put on hold for 180 days.

Turns out if you are married and you have two people who use venmo but share the same checking account , only one of you can link to the bank. The other has to just send funds to your spouse and have them transfer it.

728,Groovy dopey,"September 2, 2019",5,App has trouble staring Love Venmo but for the past few months the app keeps crashing during startup (A white screen comes up for a few seconds and then crashes). As a solution I always have to delete the app and re-download it for every transaction. A few of my friends are experiencing the same thing.
729,Small Busines Owner,"July 16, 2019",5,"Every transaction Is a hassle Used it once it was amazing, every time since then I need to verify my information  with my bank and it doesn‚Äôt work. I ultimately spend 15-20 linking and changing passwords to get it to work. . It‚Äôs also not my banks issue because I can log in using the same info on their mobile app, and their full site. Would love for this to work efficiently like bank apps do. Sorry if you can transfer via another app do it."
730,Chancemom09,"March 23, 2018",1,"Instant transfer I had an emergency, so my sister sent me $300, I went to use instant transfer so that I could get the money and get my car fixed. I enter all of my information for transfer and they pop up and say instant transfer is not working, use the other banking way which takes 1-3 business days. Excuse me, hello that was the whole point of using your service to receive my money quickly. So now that I have to wait 1-3 business days to receive my money, I will never use them again nor will I recommend. From this day forward, I will tell customers not to use them. They hold on to your money. Give me my money so that I can delete this app and never use it again."
731,Nav_sp,"March 18, 2019",1,"They are a SCAM! With the worst customer service out there My account was blocked and now permanently banned because according to them I used an ‚Äúunauthorized funding source‚Äù which is not true as I‚Äôve used the same account to pay/receive money to since the origination of my account. What‚Äôs worse is now they want to hold onto the money in my Venmo balance for 180 days. Even though they‚Äôve already come to a verdict of banning my account. It‚Äôs a crooked app with horrible Customer Service. Stick with Zelle, Venmo is just a crook corporation. They refuse to give a timeline on when I would get it back or elaborate further in any category when I can clearly show proof of any transactions that they think they can flag."
732,Breezy Ross,"April 19, 2020",1,"Venmo is complete trash I friend of mine sent me some money through this garbage app. The money was received and I transferred it to my personal account linked to the app. The transaction got held up due to ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. I received an email to validate my account with a picture Id I did that. A few days later they said my account was deactivated, I called and spoke to a rep. They gave me some story about security. At least the person that sent the money got it back and we used PayPal. Read the review it‚Äôs a lot of people have the same issue. Take it from me I rarely complain about stuff like this. Do not I repeat do not use this app. A lot of better options out there with a lot less hassle."
733,Striveforperfection,"December 5, 2019",2,Best payment app imo but needs one thing fixed I hate how if I have a Venmo balance it doesn‚Äôt allow you to pay with your bank/card. If it wants to replace PayPal as the primary payment app (and it certainly has the potential much more user friendly than PayPal) but it needs to allow you to pay from your card even if you have a balance. Other than that I love it is though and if they ever change this feature I would give it 5 stars but I truly hate that one feature there are time I want to use my balance for something so want to pay a friend off my card and it doesn‚Äôt allow it.
734,mljkay,"October 16, 2019",5,Great I love Venmo! I have 2 roommates and we split all bills every month. Venmo makes it supper easy and fast for us to split rent and pay each other. It‚Äôs also great if you out with friends and for some reason your credit card doesn‚Äôt work. You can just Venmo your friend and they transfer that money to their account to pay. I have never had any issues with this app. I have found this app to be safe and very trustworthy when handling money.
735,technicreations,"October 2, 2019",1,"Scammer user base & terrible customer support A scam user requested money from me, posing as my brother. They created an account with his same first and last name, and nearly identical handle. I mistakenly made the payment, immediately realized the fraud and reported it to customer service. After multiple inquiries, Venmo refused to reimburse me because the ‚Äútransaction had complete‚Äù and was against their user policy. Despite all of my screenshots as evidence of clear fraud, Venmo still refused to pay me back. After using this app for years, I will never make single payment over Venmo again. You simply can NOT trust them with your financial information, especially with other services (i.e. Apple Pay) now available."
736,AAAguirre,"September 4, 2019",1,"Rediculous reload speed Makes no sense how the app can take your money from your checking account within minutes/less than an hour but can‚Äôt transfer the money to your account for over a week. I recently lost my debit card and was relying on using my Venmo card for back up until my replacement came in. Well, I transferred some money to my Venmo account, and my replacement card came in before the transfer was completed! But I have no access to my money, because the funds from my checking account are stuck in limbo waiting for Venmo to accept the transaction? Absolutey ridiculous. Fix this. Mobile depositing checks takes less time than this mess."
737,Montrezbynum,"August 14, 2019",2,Very meh I‚Äôm just not understanding the reason for Venmo anymore. Besides the fact everyone uses it there‚Äôs Apple Pay Cash works right through iMessage for iPhone users and Cash App has their Cash App card Apple Pay supported and the Venmo card isn‚Äôt Apple Pay supported. The truth is I Venmo people and people Venmo me for small things I‚Äôm buying at the moment there‚Äôs never money that lives in my Venmo card because I don‚Äôt use it like that but if it was Apple Pay supported I could just save their money no charge use it for what they asked for and not have to go through so much. First world problems but get the Venmo card Apple Pay supported please
738,bvachta,"July 29, 2019",1,"Privacy is not king here If you aren‚Äôt interested in sharing you contacts or facebook info with Venmo, this app constantly spams you to do so. What‚Äôs worse, even though I didn‚Äôt allow the app to access my contacts in apple app settings, Venmo still accessed the contacts on my phone. There seem to be buttons that trap you into giving this information to Venmo."
739,Anthony3258A,"June 25, 2019",5,Too many problems adding money This system is garbage when trying to add funds! It‚Äôs suppose to accept your debit card as a payment method to add funds and doesn‚Äôt even appear as an option when trying to do so! 
740,watzke98,"August 8, 2018",1,"Worst customer service My friend owned me a lot of money because I covered his bills he had for a month. So when he had the money he paid me back in full on the app. When I got the money I wanted to transfer it to my bank account. Then I get an email saying your account has been terminated, this is the only time I have used the app and they won‚Äôt tell me why, they said they gave the money back to my friend but they terminated his account and he can‚Äôt get the money out of his account on the app. They wont tell us why are accounts have been terminated and they won‚Äôt give the money back. All I wanted was answers and my money but they don‚Äôt seem to care about the people using the app."
741,daveydoesntcare,"October 9, 2018",1,Horrible I don‚Äôt use this type of service often but when I do I use Zelle. All my friends told me to sign up for Zelle. Zelle is fast they are quick and very easy to work with. After using their service I have to agree. I‚Äôve never had an issue with Zelle. A friend recently convince me to use Venmo so they could pay me for taking some photos for them.  I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot and I have to say Venmo is horrible. I couldn‚Äôt add my bank or debit card right away. The verification process is horrible. It is been four days since I made my deposit and it‚Äôs not even in my bank account yet.I am aware there are a lot of five star reviews but if someone ask me my opinion I am going to suggest Zelle over Venmo.
742,Sal Gargiulo,"October 19, 2018",1,"NO 1% CHARGE I‚Äôm a biology student and in between class, studying, and volunteering, I nanny. Expenses are already tight, I rent an apartment in San Francisco, and just daily living is costly. I get paid through Venmo from nannying every other weak. 1% is a lot of money being taken that I desperately need. I‚Äôm going to be switching to another app if this doesn‚Äôt get reversed. My friends are already talking about how they are going to ask people to pay them 1% difference because they use Venmo so much and would lose a lot of money. So sad Venmo came to this. After years of use and thinking that this app was people like me, it turns out Venmo is just another money hungry company that doesn‚Äôt care about it users. Thanks anyway."
743,ehehajdb,"December 17, 2018",5,"Absolutely amazing Aside from what most of my friends use it for witch is, paying one another back for Dinner or drinks or something along those lines I do a lot of side jobs such as leaf removal helping somebody move with my truck landscaping carpentry anything and since I have downloaded Venmo I would say that almost half of my side work customers pay me through Venmo it makes everything so much easier and has pretty much in lemon dated me receiving checks"
744,Love my chubmoji,"December 26, 2018",3,"Not easy to sign up a friend They make it difficult to find where and how to sign up a friend w Venmo . If they don‚Äôt already have it forget it. Trying to get my mother to figure it out would have been a lot easier if I could just send a link to her. The directions on how to send the link are ridiculous . You would think Venmo would make it easy to sign people up, not hard. Also changing my phone number was impossible bc someone had my number previously and still has it linked to their account. The phone company gave me the number."
745,moonstruck26,"January 18, 2019",1,Stole my money I will never use app again they allowed me to send money a very large amount and apparently did not have sufficient funds to send. Other times this has happened with lesser amounts and payment will decline however this time they decided to pay on my behalf and froze my account until I paid amount I owed them. When I went to see about making a payment towards this new unwanted debt it took the full amount!!!  I was shocked and when I tried to ask them to cancel it they said they couldn‚Äôt and if they could help me with something else... yes I‚Äôm never using this app again!! Not only did this happen but this app constantly glitches or delays payment.
746,priv settings,"February 15, 2019",5,Private setting It upsets me that Venmo has as their default setting not private. For example for people in my contacts I can see the reason they are paying someone and they‚Äôre not even aware. You can‚Äôt change your settings to private but it should‚Äôve felt this way because of this I pretty much use Google Pay instead of Venmo. I have complained to the company and they claim they are a social media platform which is ridiculous.
747,surfboy11,"February 18, 2019",2,"Decent concept, not 100% there yet We need more of these options for transferring money in the U.S. (Europe and Asia are way ahead of the curve on this stuff.) So I like the concept of Venmo and look forward to them working out a lot of the bugs over time. One major one is that I can‚Äôt add debit cards from any of my banks. All attempts trigger an error message that says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt add this card.‚Äù (!?) I think they are trying to steer customers to credit cards so they can collect the 3% fees. Also, when paying from a bank account, I get ‚Äúinsufficient funds‚Äù messages when clearly there is money available. Getting there, but not 100% baked yet."

When I tried to transfer it over, it just keeps saying can‚Äôt be transferred. I‚Äôve done everything right and even verified my account through my bank. I call and call and call Venmo , no one answers. I finally get ahold of someone via text and all they have to tell me is no one can go to my account and override it.

749,187Import,"March 7, 2019",1,"Make no mistake... After hearing glowing reviews I decided to download Venmo and give it a try. Upon initial setup the application doesn‚Äôt specify that you can‚Äôt use a savings account; long story short, I tried this venue and it failed. But not only did it fail but Venmo froze my account and then terminated it for some undisclosed reason. I tried to get assistance & answers and the only response I received was what seemed like a generic template that basically said they can‚Äôt disclose their decisions in detail. Moreover, you cannot(no matter what) speak with someone over the phone from account services; they hide behind email only. Needless to say, I‚Äôm very disappointed in Venmo and I will not be recommending this app. to others."
750,Jpebes,"October 20, 2017",5,"Never again I have never had such a horrific experience with an app. My account was frozen due to suspicious transfers. After responding appropriately to email requests for my identification, my account was still inexplicably unverified. It is impossible to reach anyone to discuss the matter outside of email, and representatives have either taken their time or not bothered to respond. As soon as my funds are all accounted for, I will delete venmo and happily never use it again."
751,Harteisjs,"April 24, 2020",3,Automatic reload button not far While I love this app it really is far that some people have more features then others even if they signed up a after you.  The automatic reload feature is one of them. No one can tell you why on there or on email why some do have more features and don‚Äôt I guess they choose randomly which is far.  Your people should know why this is happening but they don‚Äôt have the information to tell you why. Just give you the some people do some people don‚Äôt that isn‚Äôt how a card should work.

753,RawrMantheFreeman,"March 1, 2020",5,Amazing App!! Just an all around amazing app for it‚Äôs ease of use and overall simplicity. Almost anybody can just hop right on and use it. So simple to pay a friend for groceries or an Uber. Great too for helping save a few extra bucks in between checks if you‚Äôve got a few dollars In here. I wish you could load money on here from your bank without having to pay someone but other than that? I have no complaints whatsoever.

So I contacted customer service to get it unfrozen just to take forever to get back to me then to get back to me and say it‚Äôs been frozen permanently for reasons that they can‚Äôt tell me.

Attempted to transfer cash multiple times with multiple amounts. All declined until I tried with a couple small amounts that was finally accepted...twice.  I then tried many more times to transfer more cash. All declined with no reason. Called bank and was told they hadn‚Äôt received any request for transfers so issue must be Venmo. Contacted Venmo support for answers and was told they had no idea why it happens but it just does sometimes and to keep trying. Tried the next day. Same old thing.

Venmo has an unexpected error and is holding my money. Can I charge Venmo interest?  This is very disappointing. No other apps similar to Venmo behave his way. I received an email saying I was just paid so Venmo is able to send me an email but the app has an unexpected error.  Nice.  I am not a Venmo fan and will encourage friends and family to try another method for making personal payments and money transfers.

They held me sending it to her twice and when I called to see why they simply read from a script stating it was a control and regulation practice.  I was sending $20 each time which should never be flagged.  Also the whole point of this app is to instantly send money so you telling me it may take 48 hours until she gets it in her Venmo account defeats the whole purpose of this app and ALL of their jobs.  I have never had this experience in the years of using other apps or PayPal or even though sending directly from a bank.  Awful practice.
764,CoachM7,"October 19, 2018",5,Best App ever This is hands-down the easiest way to send & receive money. The Venmo card makes its even more convenient. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars has nothing to do with the app works ... it‚Äôs just that you can‚Äôt personalize the cards you add to transfer money to. That would be great to be able to nickname them instead of having to remember the last 4 digits of a card and which bank account it goes to. Just my 2 cents üòÅ

I called my bank and they said that everything was fine on their end. I called Venmo customer service and was told they were unsure why this was happening but their recommendation to me was to stop using Venmo and try an alternate service including giving money to people in person. This is unbelievable to me that they would not have a solution to what appears to be an issue in their processing of payments.

What‚Äôs particularly maddening is that Venmo no longer supports financial transactions via web browser, you are forced to use the app. I use a long complicated password, and it has proven almost impossible to login to the app and the only way to enable touch ID is...after you‚Äôve logged into the app! Other apps allow you to enable Touch ID right on the login screen. Serious shortcoming. Also hate that it pushes you to add friends."

780,horserev,"March 8, 2018",3,should be better privacy!! cool app but not all that intuitive. takes a full day to verify a bank accnt. and i had to go read reviews to  find out that unless you make sure to set Private in settings or by transactions-all your contacts & Face Book contacts can see your transactions-WTH!! why would you want that?!! i mean if you are paying w a group of friends - fine for them to see but no need for ALL to see. Im surprised too since this is supposedly a PayPal owned app and i know Paypal has good privacy /security.

I rent to college students and they like to pay rent through Venmo because kids don‚Äôt have checks or even cash anymore. Part of the reason I agreed was because the low fee that was charged to instantly transfer the funds to my bank account. Originally it was $0.25, totaling $1.25 a month, which I agree was too low, but the 1% they charged now is more then it seems. Now when I withdraw the rent money it cost me $15 per transfer. Paying $75 a month in transfer fees equals $900 per year! Previous years it cost me only $15 per year, that is a 6,000% raise!!!"

Days after making the purchases I noticed my bank balance was lower than expected. Venmo took all the fees at one time and called them reloads which is crazy some of the purchases are smaller than the fee.  Please read the very fine print.

I‚Äôm still waiting to hear back but they currently have thousands of my dollars locked up and not showing in my Venmo or bank account.

I felt uncomfortable sending that information and asked that they send back the money to the account from which they withdrew it; they refused!

Right after I accepted it, they froze my account.  I wrote them but no response.  Eventually they lifted the freeze and I was able to add my bank account info so I could transfer the money out.  They made me wait until they took money from my account.   I responded with the amounts.  I have jumped thru every hoop they made me jump through including all kinds of verifications and I still get an error when I try to transfer money to my bank acct.  been waiting on chat for over thirty minutes trying to get this resolved.  Complete BS!"

The geniuses also says there‚Äôs no error to fix. How can there not be an error to fix if my confirmed bank account gets an error message and the system won‚Äôt let you or any manager in it to see why it‚Äôs flagged and not working. Not worth the hassle. Use the cash app it‚Äôs much better.
838,prsctt363,"November 5, 2019",1,Horrible app horrible customer service I‚Äôve had nothing but issues from day one . Venmo denies every transfer and customer service says it‚Äôs the systems fault and they can‚Äôt do anything about it. What kind of system can‚Äôt be looked into or fixed by a human personal . If trying to buy my son a simple baseball bat while he two hours away at college flags the system that‚Äôs a problem. Also tried to simply send my wife 1-10 dollars a few times to test app still denied transfer and customer service got rude and pissy when contacted to try and solve the issue. From personal experience I would stay far away from Venmo and try PayPal or any other means you can
839,Niggakillar,"September 27, 2019",5,Convenience at its finest Venmo has become such a convenience for my daily life that squaring up a bill or splitting a bill has become as easy as sending a text message. I even got a free debit card from Venmo that allows me to use whatever money has been Venmo‚Äôd to my account or I can add money to my account balance and use the card as you would any other debit card. Simple and convenient you could ask for much more.
840,mike from FL,"February 3, 2018",5,"It‚Äôs great and I have one suggestion!! One suggestion: It would be amazing if, when paying someone, you could type in a list of items and their prices, Venmo added them up as they are listed, and then the itemized list of prices and the total would be part of the memo. Can you get on that please Venmo? I know you can type it in now and add it all up manually, but it would be so nice to have lines for itemization and an automatic calculator. ;) Thanks."
841,ShanPerez,"February 19, 2018",5,"Too Easy! I choose Venmo over any other way to pay someone whether it‚Äôs splitting the bill, paying for a crafted item, or just an I owe you, kind of thing! It‚Äôs super easy (almost too easy to spend money), and it seems faster bc you don‚Äôt have as many clicks to have to go through to send or receive money! If any changes, it would to be able to have the money in the account sooner but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker!"

After showing them all the fees, they shrug it off and only paid off a fraction. Even after I did everything they said, confirming that with screenshot proof, and sent a million screenshots showing the excess charges that were not reimbursed.

847,Sandy in the South Bay,"August 11, 2019",1,"Weekly limit! I wanted to send my daughter money towards her wedding but the app doesn‚Äôt let you send more than $2,999 per week! If a user has funds available and their identity has been authenticated why is there a cap?? I was told in the chat that this helps prevent fraud and keeps costs down. I was asked to verify my info, which I did, so how  does this prevent fraud?? And how is this keeping costs down? You charge a fee to customers who use a debit card for instant transfer and a fee if you use a debit or credit card vs using a bank account when sending money. This makes no sense! I guess Venmo would rather lose business than accommodate the customer needs."
848,benjai7,"July 19, 2019",1,"This is ridiculous... Okay, so I have signed up for apps like Venmo in the past. Super easy. Want to send money? Link your card number, pick the person, type amount, done. Receiving money? Get notification, enter bank account, hit deposit, done. I have not one clue how to set up my account to be able to send or receive anything because there are nine billion options. This is the WORST user experience for something so simple that I have ever seen. Apparently, if you have had this for a while, it was at one time easy. Now, it‚Äôs easier to go through a government background check for highest security levels. I‚Äôm deleting as soon as I get done typing this."

850,indeebee,"December 24, 2018",3,Love the app but... I love the app and it‚Äôs easy to use and fast. I HATE when I need to send people money it uses my Venmo balance and i don‚Äôt even have the option to use my card/bank account. Sometimes people send money through Venmo to pay bills and I like to keep it there until it‚Äôs time to pay that bill. If I need to send money I‚Äôm taking that bill money away from the person giving me bill money and not myself. It‚Äôs frustrating and makes keeping track of finances difficult. If that changed it would be 5 stars.
851,Dubdoodle,"February 15, 2019",1,"Fraud While the app itself comes in very handy, it is quite easy for someone to steal or transfer your funds and there is no way for Venmo to trace it or get your money back! Here‚Äôs what happened to me - phone was stolen and I hadn‚Äôt logged out of the Venmo app. Phone thief simply added a card to my account and did an instant transfer. Here‚Äôs the interesting part. Because the money was in the app my bank isn‚Äôt responsible. Because I don‚Äôt have an account from the card phone thief added and it wasn‚Äôt my account that bank can‚Äôt trace it or release any info. Venmo couldn‚Äôt give me a good enough reason that they can‚Äôt simply refund my money. So I‚Äôm out $510, frustrating situation."
852,SK199222,"March 8, 2019",2,"Issues So many issues. The app directs you to contact your bank if a transaction is declined. It took me nearly a week to get a hold of a Venmo representative to figure out why my card was being declined, even after I submitted a help request by email that sat untouched for days. When I finally received a response, it was that Venmo had flagged my debit card for security reasons and there was nothing that could be done. Really? If security is the concern, maybe they should contact the bank. Unlike Venmo, the bank‚Äôs reps are very responsive and could validate it the day of. Anyway, would not recommend this service to anyone."
853,m0kah,"March 20, 2019",3,"Well, I mean sure It transfers money and all. But what they are not clear about is that they DO NOT process refunds or rescind payments. They make it your responsibility to deal with the payee directly. They DO NOT take Venmo money out first. If, for example you make a payment of $500 but only have $300 in Venmo, what they do is take the ENTIRE $500 out of your bank and bypass funds in Venmo. So if you don‚Äôt have the entire $500 in your bank account -BAM $27 NSF charges. And they‚Äôll keep trying to take $$ from your bank acct. Best Practice is to keep $0 in Venmo and have it all drawn from your bank acct."
854,Eli the Righteous One,"April 22, 2019",4,"Convenient and Easy I use this app very often. It‚Äôs a quick and convenient way to pay friends and receive payments from clients. The only thing I‚Äôd suggest as a change is adding a ‚ÄúTransactions‚Äù page in the main menu. That would make it much more convenient than having to scroll through over two weeks of your friend‚Äôs transactions with strangers just to find a specific $15 payment that I need for work or tax reasons. Other than that, it‚Äôs great."
855,NamaNancy,"May 1, 2019",5,"Wanted to like this app But after making two successful transfers, I could suddenly make no more. My bank assured me it was a Venmo problem, so I had a chat with a Venmo advisor. Her solution: attach my account to a card, not my bank. She could not explain the security alert on my card, nor could she connect me with someone who could. For a born-in-America, senior citizen with never a credit problem, I feel I am owed an answer about a security flag. Really!üò°"

Unfortunately, that was not my experience.  I had issues with my first transaction.  However, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, submitted another transaction on a later date and encounter an issue with that transaction as well that resulted in a ""hold/freeze"" on my funds being sent to my account with the reason for this occurrence is ""unknown so can't tell you why this happened.  This was very inconvenient.  Furthermore, the customer service is subpar.

I dislike how before when I first for it they only charged you $0.25 cents per transaction, however now they charge you a percentage. So obviously your limited to send an amount of money unless you want to pay a higher fee.

I believe it‚Äôs faster that way. I‚Äôm not quite sure. I‚Äôve never had an issue. If someone had an issue it‚Äôs because they sent it to the wrong person.

869,brittanykristen,"April 8, 2020",3,Great for sending money but.. I‚Äôd said the only reason I‚Äôm taking away 2 stars is because it makes me uncomfortable that Venmo has a public or friend feed showing others transactions. We should be able to hide it completely and only see transactions personally to us. Why on earth would I want to see someone I don‚Äôt know pay someone else I don‚Äôt know for an avocado? Or a friend pay someone I don‚Äôt know for drinks? Is there a benefit here? Please make a feature available to hide these feeds! Payments don‚Äôt need a social feature.

They wrote an email saying that after ""careful investigation, the transaction was not unauthorized or erroneous."" I notified my bank and filed a fraudulent claim with them.

For example, if you have a Venmo balance of $10 but you want to pay someone $20, the app won‚Äôt automatically take the $10 from your account and then the $10 from your bank.

I‚Äôm so frustrated with this whole app, you tell me to contact my bank cause it‚Äôs on them but they say the same thing about Venmo, they‚Äôre not giving me answers to really explain where my money went and don‚Äôt even seem like they want to help me, more like my questions are a nuisance to them instead."

Be careful and make sure absolutely that you are paying the correct person or you will have a lot of headache.

You can use that instead of transferring the $ to your bank account and lose 10 %. If it‚Äôs how your clients pay you, it‚Äôs costs 10 of the transferred amount as same as PayPal to do the transfer as immediate vs 3-5 business days. I used the card for the first time ever last nt at CVS. It did ask for my PIN # and is definitely secure and is chipped."
896,Venmo Expat,"October 18, 2019",1,"Instant Transfer The instant transfer feature, designed to allow users to conveniently transfer their balance to their bank account instantly, does not work for me when I need it. The issue always, and only, persists when I am in actual need of money immediately. As I stated a few months ago when I first encountered this issue, a bank transfer from takes the same amount of time to complete as a regular transfer on Venmo, therefore the Venmo platform is completely unnecessary without the instant transfer feature. That said, I will be discontinuing my use of the Venmo platform, effective immediately, as it no longer convenient."

Make sure not to pay by credit card or you get dinged 3% and can't reverse the transaction. I had a substantial credit in my Venmo account but it didn't use that up and then pay the rest with the card so I got hit with the 3% on the whole transaction. No warning or message or anything. Just notification of the fee after it had been charged and I can't do anything about it. Use a checking account if you use this app.

Meanwhile my account was returned to active. However, I continued to ask Venmo, where‚Äôs my money? Same response, still no money.

When I would go to accept the money, it would tell me to confirm my email address to receive it, but no matter what I did it would not send me a confirmation email, the app would just say that an email was sent. Long story short I got frustrated and forgot about it, and a few months later I contacted Venmo for help and they said they had no record of that transaction ever. In the end, it was pulled out of my employer‚Äôs bank but I never got the money."

Couldn‚Äôt search the recipient by name. As soon as I would start to type the last name the app would declare zero results. Once I found the recipient by scrolling through every person with the same first name, it would loop on ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to send them money?‚Äù No matter how many times I reassured the app it would demand I check myself and click the darn button again. I gave up and snail mailed the check from my bank. Ugh. Now if only I could delete this stupid acct."

I only used Venmo cause my friend told me that she could pay me for taking her around by sending it through Venmo and it was a safe app to use. I read the terms and I was in no way in violation of the terms. This was a personal transaction between myself and a person I knew. In 30 yrs of banking, I have never experienced anything like this from a company at all. I am extremely disappointed. I recommend for people to just use their bank (Zelle) to send or receive money quickly and safely."

My credit union has no problem with linking to Venmo, but apparently the feeling isn‚Äôt mutual!  So now, after trying literally a dozen times to link my accounts, Venmo is considering my bank (and account number) invalid.  The best I can do is transfer money to a credit card.

You are charged immediately when you pay someone and are paid within such a short amount of time when you transfer money to your bank. Venmo works on all banks and the app is available for all smart phones. Now you can even have a Venmo debit card. Venmo continues to amaze me. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

When I tried to use my debt card in the new account, they even frozed my account! That's so funny! I contacted the customer service, and was told that I need to wait for 4 or 5 business days!

As I, and many others I‚Äôm sure, use this app as a way to transfer money for bills and rent between my roommates and I this change is extremely frustrating.

Through the phone calls I have made I have been told I will have to wait for Venmo to contact me. Making me wait several more days to even figure out what this mess is about.

They forwarded me to the account team and informed me I would have to wait 3-5 days for an email response. You cannot speak to anyone in that department directly. After almost a week my $$ finally showed up in my checking account. Though I still have not received any correspondence back from Venmo to inform me that they resolved the issue.

Every time I call support and give them all my info they say they can‚Äôt override the automated security system that‚Äôs flagging my transactions and then suggest I try something that doesn‚Äôt end up working.

I CANNOT even make a SINGLE food purchase without struggling and getting constant declines when I know I have money in this app. I cannot PURCHASE ANYTHING despite me knowing I have money in both PayPal (this isn‚Äôt a PayPal issue) and my Venmo account. Every single purchase I‚Äôve made with this app has been a STRUGGLE. therefore, I would not recommend this app to anyone."

It took 5 days to get my $ over an instant transfer to Chase Checking and their only reply was that they hoped the issue was fixed soon.

I called Venmo and say on hold for nearly 15 minutes to be told my account is not frozen. It somehow appears that my bank routing number is incorrect. (Which it is NOT). I was told to contact my bank to see if they have done something with my routing number. So I am pretty sure that banks don‚Äôt change routing numbers like they do account numbers but what do I know. All I DO KNOW is what can‚Äôt transfer MY MONEY into my bank and Venmo doesn‚Äôt seem to want to help. I have switched to CashApp and have had NO ISSUES

But no!  Multi factor verification on even the same device that is reset even if you have your user ID and PW and account details and info needs even a photo ID.

I chat with a representative from Venmo and they said it auto declined for ‚Äúrisk‚Äù reasons. Were not talking thousands of dollars, we are taking $400.

Talked with customer service who had no clue why I was banned as well.

That‚Äôs just completely nuts because most casual users will not think to change the visibility to private. This public transaction data can presumably be collected and used by anyone with a Venmo account (Russian hackers?) to build out your financial and friend network.

I‚Äôve asked customer service what I can do in this case and received zero response. If a company wants to act like a bank they should be prepared to respond to questions.

Not only do they take that other person's money they will credit their money to the basement in the account that caused it to be frozen. ONE BIG SCAM. THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE LEGAL

The purchase I did make was for just under $5 and they tried to request $20 from my bank account when their terms says they will do it in $10 increments only and only when my Venmo balance doesn‚Äôt cover it. But my Venmo balance had enough to cover that small purchase. So essentially they tried to take $60 from my bank account for a $5 purchase that was already covered by my Venmo balance.

You have the option of making it private but just another hassle.
1309,hdtwosugeksh,"January 11, 2019",5,"No stars This is NOT an easy app or convenient way to send and receive money. One time it will do instant transfer, then the next it won‚Äôt and they tell you when you call that it‚Äôs based on security. And the person you are talking to tells you 5 times that they can‚Äôt do anything about it. Waste of time. Rude customer service. Stupid app!!"
1310,Maddsteeze,"September 27, 2017",5,"This is an ESSENTIAL app This app is a must-have! I use this app almost every week. I am a college student and my friends more often than they should forget their wallets when we have spontaneous trips. If you dont want to waste time splitting a check, just Venmo your friend right after. Venmo is part of the college culture, and if you don't have it now, you'll be needing it eventually."
1311,jennymay86,"December 13, 2017",5,"Best way to pay.... Family and friends!!!! I was skeptical at first, but happy to hear it was created by PayPal. When you receive money, it‚Äôs  transferred immediately. Very trustworthy and secure. I love the ability to lock app especially the option to enable a fingerprint log in. I use it to pay and receive money from my friends, family, and Co-workers. Love it. I rarely use paypal anymore. Best part? NO FEES!!!!"
1312,HeatherM2929,"February 15, 2018",5,"Transfer Faster It‚Äôs a great app! Very easy to transfer money, but just wish it would transfer into your account faster, it leaves your account no problem but takes a few days if someone pays you.

1313,Tom'sTake!,"February 28, 2020",4,"Great card and convenient. Quick & easy! Offers high cash back incentives on some popular merchants, However, these ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù function more like coupons, since the cash back bonus isn‚Äôt across all merchants in which the card is used for payment. Although the card really need more merchant relationships to make the card more manageable as a one card debit card solution."
1314,Jane User,"February 21, 2020",1,Venmo will collect money and not let you spend it It will allow you to collect money without entering a bank account or credit card. But then even though you have several hundred dollars in Venmo you can‚Äôt spend it with out entering a credit card or bank number. Then to make matters worse if you and you spouse have the same credit card number and you spouse is already set up you can‚Äôt use that credit card.  We don‚Äôt want to tie it to the bank so now I have to get another credit card just to use my money to pay other people.
1315,Borktaco,"February 6, 2020",5,Change your profile to private Why is this a social media thing? People are posting payments for all kind of reasons that nobody cares about. Just disable the social media part of this and it would be much better. Use Cash app or Zelle and keep your transactions between you and the the other person.
1316,Nysect109,"January 30, 2020",1,"Absolutely Horrendous Customer Service My checking account payments through Venmo are being declined even though I am otherwise able to use the checking account without issue.  Called customer service and was told that there was a security flag associated with the payments.  No explanation as to why, and I was told there is nothing that can be done about it from their end.  How can the system just automatically flag an account without giving cause and then how is it that there is no way for a real living person to examine the cause or do anything about it?"
1317,Brirunner,"January 2, 2020",1,"Customer service useless When I opened a new bank account I verified it with Venmo. However, when I tried to send money, all my payment requests were declined. Venmo Customer service said it was flagged for security reasons and I should try later but when I tried over several days, I had the same problem. They said there‚Äôs nothing they can do and to try a different app... I wish I never would have used this app. So disappointed because it used to be great. Can‚Äôt believe they seriously said they can‚Äôt put in a ticket or delete my account or anything."
1318,rdgorton,"November 3, 2019",5,"I love it! This app is owned by PayPal so I trust it completely. I use it to split restaurant bills, charge roommates for utilities and even to borrow cash from friends while I‚Äôm out.

I tried setting up a new account as well but it won‚Äôt let me use the same phone number therefore, I can legitimately never use this app again. OH YEAH! and the fact that I had $40 on there that I can no longer get back due to them deactivated my account is the cherry on top"

I have spoken with countless people in customer service, my account/card are not locked and they can see the declines in my account and the available funds. Reps can not fix the problem and tell me to ‚Äújust keep trying to use it‚Äù. How humiliating!"
1321,Long Time Viewer 54,"March 21, 2019",4,Beware I just downloaded this app and made a payment.  As it turns out the payment was made to the wrong person with an identical name.  There is no easy way to get my money back.  There should be an option to cancel payment.  The person I chatted with was not helpful at all.  They will get back to me in three days.  This is not acceptable to me.  The only option is to dispute the charge with my bank.
1322,BigGayAndy,"April 2, 2019",1,"Fxxx this app I had my account frozen for no reason, they had told me they weren‚Äôt allowed to say why, and I had 100$ in my Venmo balance that I had planned on saving, when my account got frozen they told me they had no way of getting my money back and that the money was ‚Äúreturned to senders‚Äù when I put the money in myself. And I asked the two people they said they ‚Äúreturned the money to‚Äù and they never received payment. Also, I‚Äôve contacted support 5-6 times and they haven‚Äôt responded since last Thursday.

1323,Go smile to the world,"May 29, 2019",5,"This app is delightful Okay. As a college student, this app is amazing. Great job with the whole concept and adding the card was 100% a fantastic idea. I‚Äôm giving it 4 and not 5 stars because I have a hard time connecting my bank account... but it‚Äôs kinda unnecessary because I can just get paid on Venmo and then use that money instead of my own... Hahahaha like a self stopperüòÇ"
1324,Aveniravi,"September 25, 2019",5,Venmo is wonderful Venmo is wonderful. It gives me full financial freedom to make money and pay people too. I can connect my bank account and there are many safeties to keep it secured. If I use my Venmo balance and go over it can use money directly from my bank account and there are no charges. I applied early for the Venmo card and i use it for everything!
1325,Kyliejansennnnn,"August 28, 2019",1,Venmo Account Freezes out of control Had terrible luck with Venmo and rather than contact you if fraud is suspected they freeze your account even though there is nothing close to it. Then make you jump through a million hoops and contact them to resolve or it goes frozen and your money is not accessible. This seems criminal.  Had repeated freezes and have not been able to access my money in 2 months.  Linking a bank account is not fraud or changing your phone number. It happens. I have worked in Fraud/financial crimes for 18 years. Looking to turn to State Attorney General next.
1326,Rmike97,"August 20, 2019",5,"Money transfer service A great and user friendly app to use to transfer money to friends, family , co-workers. Makes it easy so you don‚Äôt have to split your tab 5 ways. Also, you don‚Äôt need ask anyone their account # or Routing #. A very small convenience fee. For larger transfers your gonna have to go through a verification process though."
1327,effthiscompany,"August 1, 2019",2,"Unhelpful company Venmo is super convenient when working properly. However, the help hotline is a complete waste of time for the customer and money for the company. They cannot tell you why a payment was declined or when/if it will be fixed. You‚Äôre basically calling them for them to be like ‚Äúuhhh the computer doesn‚Äôt let us ever see that information‚Äù. It‚Äôs baffling how an online payment system can‚Äôt tell you why the company has declined payments when they were the ones who declined it!! Beyond frustrating."
1328,Cvillepicure,"July 22, 2019",4,"Strange that the default setting is ‚Äúpublic‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure Venmo users realize that the default setting is that every transaction is shared publicly and viewable by everyone in your contacts.

I‚Äôm gonna stick with quick pay from now on."
1331,Teesa41688,"June 17, 2018",1,"Customer service is crap Fast and mostly easy way to send money. Downside is there is no way to cancel a payment. When asked about the possibility l, customer service reps ask you several questions before telling you it cannot be done. It was such a waste of time. Their solution was to have the recipient send the payment back... which was not possible. So granted it was my mistake but it was rather infuriated to have them waste my time. A simple ‚Äúsorry we cannot cancel payments‚Äù would have been better than playing 20 questions. Not happy at all with how it was handled."

I just sent money to them again and my intended person reached out right away to let me know they didn‚Äôt get it. It had been 5 minutes and I can‚Äôt stop payment for MY OWN MONEY. How is that even possible??? Now I have a request to this stranger to get my money back and I feel certain after no outreach in December that he will not pay me. I am out my own money and this guy won‚Äôt even be held accountable. I will never use this mess if a service again.

I have already account with them and it won‚Äôt let me login but only sign in.. when I sign it it says I already am in their system!!!!!! And it won‚Äôt offer other way to get in my profile. Just stupid and ridiculous. No further comment needed. So mad
1336,Tiny Madre,"December 1, 2018",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è Venmo I always felt so helpless when my kids, who are out of State, needed money in a hurry!  Sending money orders or cash in the mail took too long, wiring the money had to be picked up at an office and it was so frustrating that the bank I used wouldn‚Äôt do transfers without charging an arm and a leg!!!

1338,mn2az,"December 20, 2018",5,Easy way to send money. Our family started using Venmo because we would go together to purchase flowers for funerals etc. it was very convenient rather than send checks. My friends have used it when they have purchased art from me. Then someone I just met paid me for a service through Venmo. She was surprised I knew what Venmo was since I am a senior citizen :)
1339,Bluebirds mile,"January 4, 2019",5,Sad Should be a way to delete transactions so they‚Äôre not permanently saved in your feed I understand you can make them private for only you and the other party however still leaves you vulnerable for other people getting a hold of your phone you should be able to delete items you don‚Äôt want seen
1340,BROKE NOW THANKS TO VENMO,"January 26, 2018",1,TAKES YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! It didn‚Äôt start out bad I had done numerous transactions with no problems. One particular purchase was rather expensive as it was 1500 total which was split up in a payment of 1200 and a mother payment of 300. Venmo thought it was a good idea to take 1200 out of my wellsfargo account 2 times and then when I disputed that and they put the one payment of 1200 back a couple days later went ahead and took 1200 out of the other account I had on my profile. I contacted customer support and pretty much told me I out that money. I WILL be taking legal actions when return home from deployment.
1341,Mrs wjones,"February 8, 2018",1,There is no such thing as easy transfer I heard about the app from college kids. So I thought I would try it. The first two times no issue. After that magically my cards or banking institutions would not allow instant transfers.. I was on the phone every day with Venmo!!! They blocked me from instant transfer without a reason why. Offering me the deposit into my bank option. 
1342,SigmaSnake,"March 19, 2018",5,"Annoying keyboard bug It‚Äôs been almost 4 updates since the keyboard bug was introduced, where if you  are currently using a third party keyboard and tap the payment amount section, the numpad keyboard does not show up until you tap in the description box then back to the payment amount box.

I would stay as far away from this app as possible and will be deleting it as soon as I can get my funds off of it."
1344,Kacki F.,"March 3, 2020",5,Quite User friendly Quick to set up I had not heard of Venmo before 2 weeks ago and have already used it seamlessly 3 times to pay for services.

1345,Meiweilo,"February 1, 2020",2,"Issues with instant transfer Having issues with instant transfer, NEVER had an issue since using Venmo in 2018. I called venmo and the rep said they can‚Äôt override it and nothing they can do. I called my bank and they said nothing was causing it to decline the deposit/transfer on their end, they even had the Visa card company on the phone as well to confirm. Not sure why this is happening all of a sudden since I sometimes often use this app buts it‚Äôs caused a huge inconvenience when I do need it. I guess it‚Äôs back to cash app"
1346,mishinstah,"November 5, 2019",3,"Venmo is trying... and not quite getting it right. I hate that it publishes the transactions of other people you have i your phone or on Facebook. I don‚Äôt need you to know I paid my dog-walker and I don‚Äôt need to know you paid a masseuse in your home. This just contributes to all of us being so overly scrutinized.

Well recently I had a bank take $55 from my Venmo card. They realized it was a mistake and voided the transaction. After several attempts I finally got a Venmo representative tell me there was no void initiated and once it was the funds would be back on my card immediately.

I sent money to a friend at the wrong account. Long story short, this particular account had hacked back in 2016 and I did not know that (had not paid him money since 2015). The money I sent to the hacked account was accepted and, because I had sent him money back in 2016, Venmo will do nothing as I ""know the recipient"". Let me repeat: VENMO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OF ABSOLUTELY NO HELP IN THIS. I have reported it as fraud thru my bank and it will no doubt be fraud. However, There are simply too many payment services to use Venmo."

And it‚Äôs completely unable to handle a simple transaction using a credit card. Told repeatedly to try again later for my own security.

Buggy, insecure and unable to help in resolving issues with their own inability to do what they advertise."
1354,KingOromance,"May 4, 2019",1,"Hassle The only reason I‚Äôd ever use this is when forced to because the other party doesn‚Äôt have cashapp which is way easier.

I‚Äôm sure 50% of my spam phone calls come from my number being sold to third parties. Venmo reminds me of dmv where a cranky old lady tells me I can‚Äôt renew my license without passport, birth certificate and a drop of blood.

Venmo claims zero liability and can‚Äôt even tell her where the money went. They claim it meant for trusted peer to peer hence they have zero liability for fraud. BUT THEY ISSUE DEBIT CARDS. Debit cards are NOT used for peer to peer trusted transactions. Furthermore they encourage kids link to a bank account or bank debit card. Which opens up even more potential for fraudulent transactions. I say that is some bullsh$t. They are making tons of money off of teens and young people and offering zero user protection.

I know I can make my transactions private (and I make sure to do so), but I couldn‚Äôt care less about what the people I know are doing financially. It‚Äôs childish and none of my business.

Yes, it was a mistake and you‚Äôre not supposed to use Venmo except btw friends (I learned later), BUT Venmo did absolutely nothing to help me and to add insult to injury permanently closed my account.

I get that their is fraud protection, but there should be away to unlock something like that and after a waiting period, be able to add a card back in.

1466,cash app is better,"August 23, 2018",1,Cash app is better Venmo is garbage charge .25 for money now and they take 3 days to charge your account. Cash app is instant so there‚Äôs no back end problems. They charged my bank account twice and then my Venmo account once for the same transfer and then said they needed more proof than the screen shots I took of my bank account showing the charges and their own data on their system. Support was worthless and considering this is an app linked to ours bank accounts they would better serve us. No refunds for any charges occurred. Go to cash app cheaper easier and safer.

I was also charged 2 fees for insufficient funds. I thought the email I received was some fraud message bc it just didn‚Äôt make sense. The email said Venmo paid the vendor and I now owe Venmo!

A nice idea for an app but the convoluted process and the abysmal customer support service (unless you manage to get a hold of someone in a supervisor position) end up making this far less convenient than simply sending a check. Fair warning: if you get a ‚Äúred flag-worthy‚Äù amount in your account (anything north of $1k) good luck trying to transfer that balance without it getting flagged and held by the Venmo service... that is unless you want to let them charge you a 10$ fee... then it seems that that lock breaks...

So Venmo closed my account with $1919 in it and told me they‚Äôd take 180 days to determine if they will give me MY MONEY back! This should be illegal and I plan to look into taking this to court.

1570,Jen (name already taken),"October 6, 2018",5,Venmo makes life better Instead of a bunch of losers trying to figure out money in groups while awkwardly looking at a few dollars and their credit cards in their wallets - one person just pays the bill. Then the others Venmo money straight to that person on the spot from the app. It‚Äôs amazing. Just get the app already.
1571,ShaeW89,"October 26, 2018",5,Suggestion Some people I know have only prepaid cards but they are personal (with their names on it) and they are unable to use Venmo for that reason but they would love to. It‚Äôs a great source to send money to friends but would be nice if they would branch out to Pre-Paid Cards as well because some people just don‚Äôt trust banks/Credit unions.

I asked this person if this was a mistake (they did not reply) and I did not accept the friend request. A week later, they file a claim requesting the funds back. I tell Venmo that this sounds like a scam but they offer no protection and returned the funds. For this reason I‚Äôm deleting the app. Not because they returned the funds but because they offered no protection to me when I had done nothing wrong."

I see old roommates and former dates paying or accepting money from people I don‚Äôt know for rent, groceries, garbage, ‚Äúsecret‚Äù stuff and professional services. I doubt they would be pleased to know that all this info is visible to acquaintances and strangers. Maybe it was in the fine print when signing up? It‚Äôs unethical in my book."

I got an email the very next day I was told my account was frozen and asking my to send a picture of my ID when I contacted them to find out why. They told me they couldn‚Äôt tell me until I sent them a picture of my ID..... that‚Äôs just ridiculous!! Also the one customer service person I spoke with Alexis C.

It‚Äôs hard to believe they‚Äôre related to PayPal because I‚Äôve had only smooth and delightful experiences with Venmo. Unfortunately my experiences with PayPal have only been negative.

1580,Susana11M,"June 6, 2018",5,Easy to use but I hate having to enter a reason for payment There is no reason Venmo should require that I enter a reason for a payment in order to proceed with the transaction. The app should allow me to opt out of it.
1581,Miye Miye,"July 8, 2018",1,Awesome! They‚Äôre easy to use and fast to transfer money from your account to your card unlike PayPal a transfer from bank to Card takes 5 days AND when you have business transactions they charge you 2.9% plus $$.30. There‚Äôs none of that headache with Venmo!!!!

1586,$porkman,"September 1, 2018",2,Quirky and non-intuitive Functionality is compromised by problems with fingerprint reader sign-in.  If you EVER hit Cancel by accident and have to sign in with your PIN afterwards there‚Äôs apparently no way to get it working again.  Also if you want to pay someone you‚Äôve already paid you can‚Äôt just go to your history of payment to them.  You have to Find Friends (‚Äúfind‚Äù them again) in order to activate the option to pay them again.  Non-intuitive at best.  Dumb at worst.

It‚Äôs difficult for me to find my actual friends (I added a friend, he accepted and I still had to type in his full handle and search for him to come up for me to pay). Meanwhile, there are 3 tabs at the top to peruse global users paying each other. But no tab for the people I pay on the reg. Honestly. Who cares. Not user friendly!"

Even after questioning they won‚Äôt tell us or let us access the money in the terminated account. They literally just stole the money from us. Do NOT use if you value keeping your money."

It‚Äôs so easy to make transfers and easy to navigate through the app. I often forget my wallet when I go out so Venmo comes in clutch. I just ask my friend if I can Venmo them for whatever and most people already have it downloaded. I wish stores could take Venmo payments with a swipe of the phone.
1604,Djkimgof skirl 34,"February 2, 2020",1,Use Cashapp Instead Instant transfers are not instant and will still take up to 30 minutes to be completed. Cashapp offers instant transfers and when I say instant I mean instant. You get the money transferred within seconds. Also I and multiple people that I know keep having a problem where it won‚Äôt allow me to do instant transfers and insist I use the 1-3 business day option. I know m card and bank are eligible for instant transfers. Over all the app is unorganized and unless you like other people seeing what you do with your money don‚Äôt get it.

Considering the fact that people use the Venmo cards and services, 24x7 / 365, it seems reasonable to expect that company to be available to support its customers during that same time period.  Venmo apparently doesn‚Äôt agree."

Keep this in mind when your downloading and sending money around. Some of us actually care about our privacy yet Venmo makes a full fledged effort to broadcast what you do and with whom you are doing it with. THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM OR APP THAT SHOULD BE BROADCASTING YOUR PRIVATE FINANCIAL BUSINESS!!!!!!!! Do you go to the bank and announce to the people in like your withdrawing the max and to give you a high five and add you onto social media to like their bank withdrawal post? NO YOU DONT!!!!!

No fees!

No reason any payment app needs a feature for the general public see all the payments made to/from a person - especially when this feature is BY DEFAULT. No reason there should not be a clear and easy for a user to close their account with an app that stores their payment information. No way I should be able to see my contacts‚Äô transactions when I specifically said that I did NOT allow the app to access my contacts. I don‚Äôt trust Venmo. I don‚Äôt trust the attackers who must see this as a goldmine.

1633,ASDB24,"May 27, 2018",1,"Joint Bank Accounts My one star review is solely based on the fact that Venmo does not allow multiple users (with separate accounts) to use the same bank account. This is a very limiting policy and makes use of the service annoying and cumbersome for people who share bank accounts (which, I have to think are many people in the married and over 30 crowd).

The only thing I would change about it would be not having the 25 cent fee to transfer money instantly but that‚Äôs such a small price to pay for having instant money in my account that it‚Äôs totally worth it!
1638,mariebushard,"September 26, 2018",1,Malfunction The app had worked great for me up to the last month. When I tried updating my card to a new one it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to do so. Then when I tried to insert my bank account number the screen remained blank for what seemed like hours. I tried erasing the application and downloading it again but that didn‚Äôt change anything. Finally the app settled for an error message and it‚Äôs been like that for days. I don‚Äôt think I can trust them with my money if I can‚Äôt navigate through their app and do the things that the app promised I could do.
1639,1badchick,"November 17, 2018",1,"Mimi I don‚Äôt care for Venmo at all the fact that I can‚Äôt get my transfer immediately bothers me, I downloaded this because cash app was down and my husband needed me to pay contractor . Needless to say I ended up spending money in my Acct for another bill to pay him because transfer didn‚Äôt come thru in time. Which put me I a bind the entire weekend. I will never use this app again it‚Äôs pointless I definitely like cash app better faster and secure. Venmo want even allow me to add my credit card for instant payout from capital one and it‚Äôs a actual bank card"
1640,SwissMiss4754,"October 28, 2017",5,So easy to pay! No need to write checks to people who can‚Äôt take your card. If they have an account you can transfer it in with a few clicks. They do have a ‚Äúpublic feed‚Äù option similar to FB; but I like that it can be private...you can lock down the account as far as you want very easily.
1641,forced user of this app,"December 4, 2017",5,"Frustrating It has no problem linking a credit card quickly, but when I try to link a bank account it makes it difficult and takes until the following day to ‚Äúverify‚Äù the account. So you can‚Äôt use the bank account right away."
1642,CA2GAgirl,"December 5, 2017",5,Great Customer Service I had an issue with my account and received excellent customer service from both chat and phone departments. Megan was clear and concise in her chat help and Jay was extremely helpful and called me back to follow up and make sure everything was corrected. Great app that‚Äôs easy to use accompanied with great customer service.
1643,Dadsbabylol,"December 27, 2017",1,"Frozen account for no reason? Apparently in their user agreements, you aren‚Äôt allowed to use it as a goods and services outlet payment. Which is I guess fine if that‚Äôs what I was using my account for! They froze my account indefinitely with this reason because people were paying me for ‚Äúvideos‚Äù... too bad they meant family video, redbox, and GameFly. I had to go in and remove all my bank info because venmo kept moving money around. I messaged customer support to delete my account all together and I‚Äôm still waiting for them to do it. DON‚ÄôT TRUST THIS APP OR COMPANY. Only PayPal for me!"

I mentioned this support and they only offered solutions that didn‚Äôt actually fix the root cause of the issue, which is a tech issue at their end. Then, when a friend tried to pay me using my email address, it didn‚Äôt go to me. I have talked to support and they only offer scripted responses. Each time I contact support, I get a different person. Not a marker of good customer service. Venmo has completely lost my trust and I am deleting my account."

1649,bree0325,"April 15, 2020",1,Steal your money I was liking the app a lot and was gonna be using it long term untill I had to send my mom a large transfer then Venmo made a issue they took the money out of my bank account then didn‚Äôt put it in my moms even though they stole the money from my account and now they want way to personal information considering this app isn‚Äôt a bank and just a app to send and receive money I don‚Äôt recommend if you make transfers more then $300 which could be for rent or something hopefully they remedy this and my stolen money isn‚Äôt in limbo
1650,Ver Sol,"April 11, 2020",2,"Why is it difficult to find the submit buttons? I wanted to make a simple payment to someone. The site doesn‚Äôt make it easy to recognize how to advance forward, like ‚ÄúNext step‚Äù buttons. I have to hunt for it, go back and forth at different options. And I‚Äôm pretty computer savvy. Makes me rather think twice about using this app. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it because it would be difficult to assist someone having to describe it because it‚Äôs not visually easy."
1651,Phone missing,"March 30, 2020",5,Sure. Sure. I‚Äôll leave a review. It‚Äôs been cool to pay people more conveniently I guess. Somehow it feels more convenient than PayPal. Even though you can‚Äôt get your money immediately for $0.50 (or whatever and this may have changed). But that was my only reason to use PayPal over Venmo. But good job Venmo. You‚Äôve done nothing wrong to me
1652,neehow_37,"March 21, 2020",5,"Team Venmo I love venmo . Much more secure than scamming cash app . You can actually speak to a human with venmo , I‚Äôve never had my money stolen and any problems I‚Äôve had that occurred there is MULTIPLE ways to speak to someone . I wish they let you take money from a pre paid card but that‚Äôs the only thing I would change !"
1653,Charbml111,"March 21, 2020",1,Transfer This app will tell you that when you transfer funds that it‚Äôll be there the next day but possibly 3 and business days they mean. There‚Äôs not a card that allows instant transfers. This app is ridiculous. I call support and they‚Äôre very rude and inconsiderate. Oh and I have yet to find out where I can even buy things with venmo. Tried to make a purchase thru Walmart. Walmart cancelled my order for some reason and they have never done that with any other form of payment. I suggest not using this app it‚Äôs very time consuming with funds.
1654,Truvious,"January 8, 2020",1,"Good until it isn‚Äôt. For the basic purposes Venmo was sufficient and met my needs. Unfortunately somehow my information was leaked and my Venmo account cloned. A substantial amount of money was stolen from me and Venmo‚Äôs customer service is almost nonexistent. I‚Äôve tried to contact them and I‚Äôve only gotten automatic responses that say I need to wait 1 to 4 business days for someone to reach out to me. Meanwhile Venmo is just allowing people to siphon money. I would think their system would flag 12 consecutive payments to an unknown user. Unfortunately instead, Venmo has left me assed out."

1657,Tay515,"December 15, 2019",1,Wish I could give zero stars I have been trying for over a year to get your application to work. You cause my bank account to be locked multiple times. Now I can‚Äôt even add a Wells Fargo account to your application?! This is insane. How can you be a top application for money transfers and you can‚Äôt even connect a Wells Fargo account? Your application has way too many issues for me even consider continuing to use your application. It‚Äôs a good thing that Apple has ApplePay now because that means that I don‚Äôt have to use your trash application anymore.
1658,Disappointed Stephen,"December 3, 2019",1,"Terrible!  Absolutely Useless for me I‚Äôve spent a week trying to get the service working, verified my bank‚Äôs checking account but always unable to send money.

1660,Laxman21,"September 7, 2018",3,"Scam artist!!! This is the worst money transfer app I‚Äôve ever used. I sent my son money to loan him and all went well. When it came time for him to send money back, it came into my account and they won‚Äôt release it, saying it‚Äôs my banks fault. My bank has not noticed any denials and yet these clowns still will not release my $250. "
1661,benmosucks89,"September 15, 2018",1,"Stay away!!! Horrible service and you have no rights Don‚Äôt bother with them and if you have an account delete it, eventually they will steal money. I sent a someone funds and they didn‚Äôt notify me that it was a frozen account and when I requested my funds to be returned they kept using the excuse that the reviving party‚Äôs account was frozen and that person needed to work with Venmo. If the person walks away from the account like the person I sent the funds to  Venmo keeps the funds ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù forever, in reality they keep it after x amount of years."

"
1663,Hue gass,"March 19, 2019",1,"Won‚Äôt let you cancel a payment Venmo is making me responsible for a payment from a fraudulent transaction, even though the payment didn‚Äôt go through. I called my bank and told them to block the payment. My bank recognized the fraud, but Venmo paid the fraud anyway, despite my attempts to stop the payment. Venmo took back some of the money, that was left in this fraudster‚Äôs account. Now Venmo is making me responsible for what it couldn‚Äôt take back, even though they basically recognized it as a fraud and tried to take back the money. I don‚Äôt get it."
1664,TrueTrue7,"May 15, 2019",1,"Disconnects my account constantly Convenient and great ... when it works. But every time I try to quickly send someone money plaid has disconnected my bank. And then, every time, there is an error that stonewalls my attempt to reconnect my bank account. So what should take 30 seconds to send someone money instead takes 15 minutes of fighting this app and then half the time just eventually giving them an IOU instead. This is unacceptable and if it is not resolved soon I will be deleting. Why waste the storage space on a useless app?"
1665,Now I'm negative due to Venmo,"May 26, 2019",5,Horrible Tried transferring money to my son in the Marine Corp. and they took the money from my account and they wouldn‚Äôt allow his account to accept the money.

I'm disappointed in Venmos inability and or desire to try and help resolve my situation.
1668,Jmontgomery83,"July 26, 2019",1,They restricted my account Venmo restricted my account because they were suspicious about ‚Äúbusiness activities‚Äùon my account. I accepted money from multiple people for a fundraiser and now i have to use another app such as cashapp or paypal because venmo was suspicious. The suspicion isn‚Äôt always correct so you can‚Äôt just go around suspending account because on what you think is happening on my account. I also emailed them and asked for the information and reports about my account and they have yet to answer. I am absolutely and utterly livid right now!!!
1669,Not Sugarcoating Anything,"July 13, 2019",1,"Trash. This application is trash. Apparently there is a six card limit for Venmo for security reasons, and honestly, I can‚Äôt think of a single soul that knows about this.

1670,Jriv69,"January 19, 2018",5,"Easy money This app is easy to use. Whether making a payment or requesting money, the interface is easy to use & pretty straightforward.

1671,Cbhancock7,"January 28, 2018",4,"Overall easy and convenient Makes it easy to pay people when you bank differently. Even nice that you can pay right in iMessage.

Then I tried contacting them online via the support form, except they required an email and phone number attached to a Venmo account, which I don‚Äôt have and can‚Äôt create.

I constantly have to renter my bank information because it says it lost connection to my bank account. It takes so many steps to just pay someone and it should be such an easy process. Also I think it‚Äôs a breech of privacy to be able to see all of the random people who paid people in your contacts. I don‚Äôt know why that is anyone‚Äôs business.

My account was frozen for no given reason with a $60 balance in it that I‚Äôm apparently no longer entitled to. Another $75 was sent to me through messenger and it went to my Venmo account that was still linked to it. I never unlinked it because if the account is frozen there should be no activity I would think. Well not with Venmo! They will take money coming in but not let money go out

1688,Rose Pride,"December 21, 2019",5,Convenient I love this app way better then Cash App. The transfer fee is very reasonable and there is a limit to the fee that they charge to transfer unlike Cash App. The app is easy to use.

I would like to keep that money separate from say my personal or business expenses."
1691,MamaRho,"November 12, 2019",4,Too Picky The app has become to picky with what cards they let you use with it. The card I had linked for ages all of the sudden didn‚Äôt work. No warning.

All I came here to say is, when you need your money, Venmo will find a way to inconvenience TF out of you. I only give it two stars because I am a diplomatic person that tries to see both sides of an issue and perhaps all of the unnecessary hoops I‚Äôm always jumping through for this app, is all for the good of data security and what not. Regardless though, Cash app all the way."
1693,CheyAutumn92,"October 2, 2019",5,Love it. I wish this app had been created years ago! It‚Äôs perfect for paying back friends or even someone across the country safely and instantly without your bank account being involved at all!

I had money transferred to me for an emergency and when trying to do an instant transfer the app tells me that it won‚Äôt process that and to try a standard transfer. That is not an option for me as it is, like I said, an emergency.

1696,lil.lucie,"August 6, 2019",1,Bank Account under construction I wish that all these apps didn‚Äôt always have to route thru your checking account. Why isn‚Äôt there a way that you could put a credit card on file..why just your debit card? Sometimes people accounts get overdrawn (seriously not a fault of my own) by a HUGE AMOUNT and there should be a way where we don‚Äôt have to be a slave to our bank accounts. There should be other outlets and routes. Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me..but it‚Äôs annoying. We should be able to put/use whatever we want.
1697,ciscokidmilo,"August 1, 2019",5,"Great app, high fees I use this all the time and it‚Äôs great. It was even better when it was only $.25 to transfer money to your bank immediately; now they charge 1%.  Still better than Cash App which I think charges 1.5%.

You didn‚Äôt put in on this so you don‚Äôt get none of this!

Venmo just freezes your account automatically if they think they see anything ‚ÄúSuspicious‚Äù which is not okay. If I would‚Äôve gotten alerted I would‚Äôve called right away to clarify any concerns.

Then they tell you it should be there 4 days later. For anyone hoping to use the money to pay bills, good luck. Other apps will actually send your money instantly, and with no fee.

I was hesitant at first as I have Cash App, PayPal and Zelle, and Zelle is a close second BUT Venmo is so incredibly convenient with the card they send you!

Like many others, my account was frozen for no clear reason after my first use of the app (which went through with no issues). Customer service has informed me that I need to send a picture of my photo ID to verify my account or to close my account. That second part seems particularly concerning, so I removed all bank info and deleted the app. It‚Äôs one thing to momentarily show an ID at a bank, but I‚Äôm very skeptical of providing an image of my ID to an app developer."

Similar to prior reviews I called ‚Äúcustomer service ‚Äú and they couldn‚Äôt even tell my why my account was frozen like it was some super ultra secret. It had to be handled by a department with no phone access email only and that they would get back to me in 2-3 days. This is ridiculous and inexcusable for an app that is linked to my bank account. If I could give it zero stars I would.

1798,totall ash,"June 18, 2019",1,"Absolutely horrible One of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had with a money sending app. They tampered with my account number that was linked to my bank so the transaction could take longer so they could hold the money longer to make more money for themselves. So instead of getting my money three business days later, it has taken a week. The customer service is absolutely horrible and confusing. I would suggest anyone reading this to not use this app. It will save you a tremendous headache in the future. Thankyou"

1801,LizEaT,"October 12, 2018",4,Pretty good Pretty straightforward $ Xfer app. The only thing I would add is an easier way to link your PayPal account to your Venmo account. It would be nice to be able to do a simple transfer of your Venmo money to your PayPal account.  Currently you have to have a PayPal debit card. Also if you have the Ca$h app(Venmo‚Äôs major competitors) you cannot link your Ca$h app debit card or account to transfer Venmo money onto for immediate spending.

I use a PO Box for personal mail and a work address for deliveries. Venmo‚Äôs advice is to use a relative or friend‚Äôs home address.

During this time I have spoken to 5 different service reps and only today with the last one did I receive the information that my bank is on the short list of institutions that are not supported funding sources for venmo. If the other 4, who were very nice people, had done their job correctly it would have saved a lot of time and exasperation on everyone‚Äôs part."
1849,Super Saver 7,"July 25, 2019",5,Easy Money Transfers & Great Cash Rebates Venmo is a great way to quickly send funds to family & friends.

Thank you Venmo for a simple but crucial way of transferring funds when they are really needed.
1850,joshua dombass,"December 8, 2018",5,Ability to transfer funds from back account to Venmo Instead of just being able to transfer funds from Venmo to our bank account we should be able to transfer from our bank account to Venmo as well. But overall great app
1851,Chef Meli,"December 20, 2018",5,Major issues A complete mess.  I have received many payments they Venmo and then I get notified I can receive them thru my email address:  so I offered it to someone and have had nothing but trouble with no way to contact anyone but a ridiculous automated response email that lead me no where.
1852,Fred-Member,"January 28, 2019",3,"Very good, but in need of improvement. This is an outstanding app, I highly recommend it. My critical feedback is that you can‚Äôt have multiple accounts. I need an account for my business and one for personal use. I only have one cell number and I can‚Äôt create another account using the same number, and you need a cell number to open an account. I‚Äôm optimistic that Venmo will fix this. It‚Äôs still a great app!"
1853,SoSophiaWh,"February 6, 2019",4,"Love it Venmo has made my life so easy.. I don‚Äôt have to stop at an atm and get cash out, I can just Venmo it. I pay my rent on Venmo, transfer money to other personal accounts to avoid the charges, it‚Äôs super convenient! The only complaint I have is that some banks are not supported by Venmo. Some friends I can transfer money to but they can‚Äôt transfer it to their account, so it‚Äôs just in Venmo limbo."
1854,CGAZ122,"February 21, 2019",5,"Convenient My family is spread out, so this app helps collect money from family members for gifts, etc. It‚Äôs connected to a credit/ debit card and/or bank account so transfers, payments, deposits are easy.

1858,Univero,"March 19, 2019",5,Convenient & Easy to Use It‚Äôs made receiving and sending money so easy. No more splitting a restaurant check 5 ways.

1859,Zombie animal lover,"March 20, 2019",5,"Love the app Love the ease of transferring money to friends, but any consideration for biometric integration for confirmation of payment?

1860,crazymonk15,"June 30, 2018",1,"The most irrelevant app ever. Obviously the objective of me downloading this app is to instantly transfer funds to my account from other people with different banks or outside of business hours. However, venmo doesn't mention that they can flag your account if they sense there is a risk or something, which isn't the main issue. The issue is that no one in customer service can reverse this ""flag"" or tell me what the hell happened on my account for me to not use the instant transfer feature. I'm my opinion, that makes the app pointless."
1861,Amy Katy,"August 8, 2018",5,"Won‚Äôt authorize joint bank accounts The only issue I have with this app is that they don‚Äôt authorize joint bank accounts with users.

1864,1 because 0 wasn't an option,"September 21, 2018",1,One because I can‚Äôt give none Instant transfer of funds failed epically. When attempts were made to put the money back into the original account it couldn‚Äôt be done instantly like it was to remove the funds. Instead was told it would have to be a bank transfer. Seriously if you could take it out instantly you should be able to put it back the same way. Then telling me the system wasn‚Äôt broken was the worst case of 1984 I‚Äôve heard recently. Thank goodness there are now better choices.

It worked great until a few weeks ago, all of a sudden we can‚Äôt instant transfer anymore. And there‚Äôs no way to cancel or decline a transfer so that the money just goes back into the senders account. It‚Äôs very inconvenient which defeats the whole purpose of this app."

1867,canuck5870,"October 31, 2018",5,Feedback It‚Äôs a great App. So convenient. The only thing I would change is to add a setting to have only my transactions visible to me.

1871,TobyMJB,"October 17, 2017",5,"Easy and excellent Great app.  Very reliable.  Love to use it.  My only issue is it's sometimes hard to be sure you've found the right person to pay.

I logged in from a new device with an existing account attached to a phone number and an old email. The txt verification via phone is apparently not enough they require verification through the email, the email is old and doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Ok, things happen, HOWEVER, when writing to customer service twice over a period of a month and not one person gets back to you, consider this app/service the worst on the market."
1874,skippwad,"January 21, 2018",3,3 days????!! 3 stars in my book because in this day & age the ‚Äú3 day‚Äù limitation is ridiculous in my opinion. The whole reason there are apps out there like square cash which allows me to choose a small change deduction to deposit instantly if desired or needed. Even the 1 business day stipulation if funds are transferred before 7p EST is again ridiculous in my book. Recommendation: if you want flexibility use the square cash app ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1875,stellarbeller,"February 5, 2018",5,"eh very useful, but it takes soooo long to transfer to your bank. on square cash the money goes into your account INSTANTLY. with venmo you must not forget to actually transfer it to your bank, and even then it will take 3-4 days minimum. not my favorite cash app, but i do like how it looks like a social media feed!"

When I tried it for the first time, it worked like a charm.

After being on hold with support for 30 minutes, I was told that she didn‚Äôt have access to why the lock was put on and that an account specialist could contact me in 3-5 business days.

After i sent the picture they immediately deactivated my account permanently with the reason being they are acting under their own input which basically means they didn‚Äôt like that I was constantly sending and receiving a decent amount of money per week. There‚Äôs a clear reason why this app isn‚Äôt #1 in the financial section."

It really comes in handy one time I was at the grocery store and my card was not working and in less than a couple minutes of friends sent me money to cover my purchase without holding up the line too long is very convenient one of the best prepaid cards that I have used.
2007,oanjao,"May 31, 2019",4,"Works well, but privacy is a concern I have never had a problem paying friends or vendors, so Venmo does what it needs to do. It‚Äôs free if you pay from a checking account. I don‚Äôt like that it displays people‚Äôs transactions, though you can make your transactions private. I don‚Äôt see what value is added by displaying that information."

This is the leadership desperate to be valued like a social network.

2076,_starbucks_14098,"April 1, 2020",1,"ZERO STARS!!! This app is ridiculous. It automatically connects to your facebook and shows all the transactions your friends are making. I noticed this and realized they can see my transactions too. Why is a money transaction app mimicking a social media app??? It‚Äôs like twitter, but the feed is just filled with who is paying who for what. With all the things we share on social media, is this really going to be one of them? Definitely one of the stupidest things i‚Äôve ever seen people do with technology."

2078,YWilliams8,"February 3, 2020",1,"Venmo is complete crap A few months ago Venmo contacted me stating that my account was being deactivated because my account was doing business transactions. I can assure you I NEVER did any business transactions and every transaction that I did was to pay my roommates or friends for bills or to pay them back. When I attempted to contact Venmo to see if they could unfreeze or reactivate my account, they said that there was nothing they could do. All I want to do is pay my roommates and friends back but Venmo is not cooperating."
2079,Bellayourfella,"December 18, 2019",5,Best Remittance App I love how I can keep my money and just transfer it when I want to and when I need it. Low fees for instant transfer. Better than going to the store for sending money. My family and I are apart and we can send each other cash when emergency comes. I just love it!
2080,AllN-AllN,"December 15, 2019",1,"Do not get this app This app is horrible, a total joke. I was scammed out of my money. Reached out to Venmo for help and they were no help at all.  I paid for a service that I did not receive. They asked several questions as if they would be able to help. I even provided proof of the fact that I was scammed. Nothing mattered. The did not help me at all. I should have known this app was bad if it is a part of PayPal. I would give it zero stars if I could. Do not get this app. Situations with your money is serious. Especially around the holidays."
2081,d******t,"December 12, 2019",3,"Could be 5 Stars This app could be a 5 star app especially with its social media addition. But it lags shortly behind its competitor Cash App in that  where you can add money to Cash App from your bank account instantly, it takes days for you to add money from your bank account to your Venmo balance.  If they would allow instant transfers to your Venmo balance this would definitely be a 5 star app."
2082,TBFTME,"December 10, 2019",1,"Stole my money My account has been frozen for reasons unknown. I‚Äôve both emailed and called Venmo company; however, they refuse to explain to me what I did to break the user agreement, that I read in hopes of understanding what rules were broken. My account was then deactivated permanently according to the email, and the remaining 100$ that I have in my account is not being returned to me, being that the app won‚Äôt let me transfer it back into my bank account. Strongly don‚Äôt suggest, and I‚Äôd go to any other app like cashapp or Apple Pay."
2083,solonena120399,"December 10, 2019",3,Not access to my account at all. The app does not allow me to access to my account because I changed my phone number. I‚Äôve tried to reach out but no answer to my concerns. Is really annoying that you have money sitting there and you can‚Äôt just use it because they would not allow you to access to your own account. Really disappointed.
2084,gtussey,"December 1, 2019",5,Amazing App! So easy to use and fast payments received!  I am a Professional Pet Sitter and this makes it so easy for people to pay me and not have to go back to them to get paid. Thank you! (And so much better than PayPal!

2085,Cr8143,"November 14, 2019",1,Never had an easy time I‚Äôve never not had a problem using this app and spend more time on the phone with customer service then I do receiving or sending money. I wish other similar apps were more widely used because I would ditch this in a heart beat. Seriously today I tried to enter three different cards and was told that each one was unable to be used by Venmo. It‚Äôs frustrating because it‚Äôs always something and like everyone is on here so it‚Äôs impossible to get away
2086,AngMarieB,"November 6, 2019",5,My goto card This card saves the day when i need to pay bills or send money and if i lose my primary debit card its linked to this one so i still have access to my funds while waiting on my replacement card to come in the mail.
2087,kuzdas,"October 22, 2019",5,Only caused a hassle My account was flagged the same day I created it for trying to send a large payment to my landlord. Never was able to make the payment.

I‚Äôve been trying to get my money into my bank account for six days now and no matter how many agents I speak to everyone seems to have their hands tied.

2090,public spending habits,"May 31, 2019",4,Review It‚Äôs fast and easy to use. Super convenient! I absolutely hate that you can see who‚Äôs paying who. Takes a lot of privacy away. If someone wants the world to know what they‚Äôve been doing or where they‚Äôre spending their money they can post it on social media. Take this feature off and Venmo would be so much better!
2091,JGL2400,"June 3, 2019",3,"Latest update loads slowly on iPhone X This app used to run pretty quickly and smoothly, but after the last few updates, I‚Äôve noticed that it takes 5-7 seconds to load once you open the app. I‚Äôm not sure why it takes longer to load on startup now, but it would be a better and more efficient app if this problem was fixed!"
2092,AtomAndroid,"June 6, 2019",4,"No thumbs, but that‚Äôs okay As a person with no thumbs, going to banks is difficult for me.

2094,alskskajsjsjjd,"August 14, 2019",3,Sending thru bank Nearly every time I have tried to send a Venmo payment I have had issues with it not connecting to my bank. I have had to reset it numerous times. I just had to add my bank card in order to send a payment. This is been very frustrating. I only use this now to send money to my sister and choose other options when available.

I had to make a whole new account, make a whole new email, and a whole new phone number, because Venmo wants to freeze my account. I couldn‚Äôt even unfreeze it after I email bank statements, my ID, picture of my Debit Card. This is pretty ridiculous, this shouldn‚Äôt take more than 30 minutes to have some unfreeze my account. I even called my bank before I called Venmo to have them call you to see why your holding my money..."

2097,no ethics w/ late capitalism,"August 4, 2019",4,"Could be better. Capitalism is an evil institution. And while we all are privy to the externalities that this operative system imposed, this app helps better minimize the role that banks play. Robbing banks sounds like a lot of work and while I am not against other people doing such, I‚Äôm not quite ambitious enough. So I guess this will work for now. Wells Fargo and the like, y‚Äôall still deserve the stink eye."

I just wanted to delete my account and be given back my remaining balance and they refused and kept my money and still have my banking information and won't even allow me to delete the account!

2103,MrJeffreyGee,"February 6, 2019",2,"Auto Transfer Feature Needed I get money multiple times daily in my Venmo.  It would be really nice if there was an option to auto transfer the money to my checking account; instead of, having to do it manually each time.  Venmo can still offer the instant with 1% or 1 business day method with auto transfer like Square Cash.  It‚Äôs one reason I prefer Square cause they've got both these features.

2104,heydude,"March 6, 2019",4,Convenient but... Relatively simple but lacks some features that would make it more robust. Not easy to track and setup regular payments. You can‚Äôt just use a prior payment as a basis to create a new payment. No way to quickly review past payments or people. The purchases feature doesn‚Äôt do it. Venmo needs to step up its game to survive.
2105,CC/2014,"April 15, 2019",5,So easy for those that are visually impaired This app is amazing for those of us who are blind or visually impaired using a smart phone not only paying friends and family and allowing them to pay us but also using with different merchants that have PayPal. I love it! Thanks so much for creating it!
2106,Feliciakitty,"April 20, 2019",5,Weird feedback loop Venmo couldn‚Äôt verify my bank account so I had an embarrassing encounter with my payee. Then I got stuck in a weird feedback loop where I had to answer multiple personal questions for bank security. So I closed out of that and suddenly my transaction went through.
2107,JoycieAnne,"April 30, 2019",5,"Great app but... I recommend you change settings and provided downloadable statements from more than 6 mos.

2108,Roof2Fix,"May 4, 2019",5,Good Payment Source This has been a trusted payment source option for customers that wish to use a neutral payment form instead of giving credit card info or bank account info for their transaction.   Ask for a Venmo Debit Card.
2109,NiniB5,"May 5, 2019",3,Character space for message is way too short In general this app works fine but it‚Äôs so very annoying that the max characters are only 280. I was just trying to send a birthday gift and say a few nice things but had to make my message short and basic because of the limit. I‚Äôll use another app next time I want to send money AND  message. This feature on Venmo is just dumb.
2110,Shockadow0808,"August 13, 2018",5,PayPal is king Not being able to send and receive directly with PayPal stops my Venmo use not the other way around .. eBay and many online shopping sources take PayPal NOT Venmo and I shop online tons so Venmo is almost obsolete since almost all my friends have PayPal as well .. what‚Äôs the benefits of this useless app again?
2111,nielscfaa,"September 28, 2018",1,"Horrible I‚Äôve used Venmo a few times mostly to send money, and when I received money Venmo claimed there was a flag raised on my account. I called and they told me they could not tell me why, apparently it‚Äôs against their policy, so they withhold money without probable cause and can‚Äôt override it manually. Now I have 400$ sitting in the account and I need the money now, but they can‚Äôt come up with a solution for it, and still can‚Äôt tell me why. So i rate Venmo no stars.

2117,blakeneverthere,"November 23, 2018",1,"1% Debit Card Transfer Fee??? Utterly ridiculous. Have been using Venmo for years but once I empty my balance I‚Äôll go with another app. Latest update imposes a 1% debit card transfer fee or a free transfer if you give Venmo your banking account information. Eventually Venmo, just like everyone else, will have a data breach so no thanks on handing over the free banking information. I understand Venmo needs to make money but how about a little ingenuity rather than an easy price hike? Venmo is now the same idea as the big banking apps. Sad day Venmo. Sad. Day."

2121,hrafael1397,"January 22, 2018",2,"Faster payment Venmo really needs to get into the age of instant payment. A lot more people would use this app for payment instead of other apps like cash app. Maybe Venmo should create an option where you can select for an instant payment with a charge or have the money come at normal time free of charge such as it‚Äôs doing right now.

2126,Jbswell71,"June 15, 2018",1,Holds money hostage Venmo decided that they would hold my money and not release it to my bank account until they felt it was appropriate. I spoke with customer support about it and the only thing they kept telling me was that they could see what the issue is but that when their system decided to release the funds it would go into my bank account. They would not give me an estimate on when this would happen either. Don‚Äôt use this if you actually want to get your money in a timely fashion

Then they restricted my account! I‚Äôm done. Disappointed that such a quick and simple and fast way for payments has to be ruined with so many issues. Also app is not as quick or efficient as would be useful."

Literally never planning to use Venmo again, yet they still made me download their app just to use the service."

A few days later i get a message saying that Venmo couldnt take out the money so I MYSELF had to pay venmo back and if i didnt pay them back they THREATENED ME with contacting a collection agency.

When he tried to pay me back it came to my account but their automated system flagged my account when I tried to deposit it into my bank account for unknown reasons. Venmo said since it‚Äôs automated and basically sorry there is nothing they can do. At the end they wanted me to upload my banking and routing number which I‚Äôve never do on an online APP. So basically I‚Äôm out a few hundred dollars. THIS APP DOES NOT WORK AND THEY WILL KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!!!
2251,g_mac420,"June 6, 2019",4,"Multiple users same bank account THE MOST irritating thing about this app which prevents me from using it much more is the banking issues.

2252,This-is-a-crappy-app,"October 8, 2019",1,Do we really need this???? I installed this app a while back.  I have tried to figure out how to use it and see if this could be useful with my online sales.  My online attempts always takes me to a so called ‚Äúsupport community‚Äù that is populated with a bunch of useless millennial knuckleheads.  Venmo might be helpful to me to collect money from millennials that like to think they are cutting-edge and trendy. Venmo needs to replace the vague colorful marketing web pages with some meaningful explanation/instruction to support how to effectively use the system.
2253,Chocoeliz,"October 8, 2019",2,"Not international enough I used to study in the states and had a venmo account and now that I‚Äôm out of the country a lot of people in my schools are Americans and use Venmo.

I tried to open a new account but it only caters to American phone numbers which are super frustrating. Yeah, not really satisfied about that."
2254,JJP130,"September 13, 2019",2,"High fee for instant transfer It‚Äôs crazy they charge a fee, especially by % for instant access to your money. I can‚Äôt imagine why it costs more to transfer 100$ than 10$. Also, with apps like Zelle available now, which immediately transfer funds to your account with no transfer request and no fee, Venmo needs to catch up to speed. I think their whole deal is to get you to use their credit card."
2255,RayJRuddy,"August 26, 2019",5,"Another useful tool. I had trouble setting it up, linking accounts, and figuring out how to pay people. I‚Äôd saw the UI could be more clear.

2261,PayPal only from Here on.,"December 5, 2018",1,Beware!! I tried having $900 transferred to my Visa debit card and it wouldn‚Äôt do it because it was too large of an amount for a new account. I was told this after being on hold for quite some time. The money was already transferred before I was aware of this. Now I HAVE to have it sent to my bank account and it will take one to three business days. Absolutely no warning of this anywhere before the money was transferred. There is a reason why PayPal is so large and trusted. I will never stray again.

Luckily my bank stopped the transfer and shut it down, but Venmo says ‚Äúno problem‚Äù they stepped in and funded the transactions and now I owe them $2500.

2268,baisherknight,"April 18, 2019",1,Crappy service Don‚Äôt ever get a debit card from Venmo! They will flag every purchase you make and never let you get your money off the card! When you call to resolve the issue everyone you speak with will argue against you and then act like it‚Äôs your fault.

2287,Filemaker pro lover,"March 11, 2020",1,"No more transfers to bank. The latest version won‚Äôt let you transfer only part of your balance to bank. This makes the app useless for me.

Now the app has been updated and the option is gone. Only the total balance can be transferred. Why? It wasn‚Äôt changed to help the user. It must somehow increase their profit."

So I talked to a customer service rep and she mentioned that the card is flagged with a security risk. But wasn‚Äôt able to tell me why. That wasn‚Äôt much help at all.

The default privacy I expect from a corporation that has to do anything with financial information is that they handle my transaction at the highest level of privacy unless I set it to public. So unprofessional! "

So my friend sent me $50 and it took it from my account so I lost that $50 because Venmo took it. WHY THE HELL WOULD VENMO SEND ME THAT $79 if I owed it this doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all I have never had a problem  with Venmo until now I‚Äôm very disappointed!
2301,Not a Venmo Fan,"November 3, 2019",1,Customer Service They will not allow account to send money from a bank but they will gladly allow you to keep paying via Venmo via a credit card where they charge 3%. What a fraud this service is. Their customer service don‚Äôt even tell you why you can‚Äôt send money through a bank. All they say is try again later. They admit at how frustrating this is but don‚Äôt do anything to solve the on going situation which has been over 3 weeks for me now.
2302,Jhalprin,"October 29, 2019",2,Venmo not transferring funds I paid someone thru Venmo & have confirmation. It showed up in her account but will not transfer to any of her bank accounts; she repeatedly gets the ‚Äúspinning progress wheel‚Äù which remains on the screen indefinitely.

2304,JohnnyBPhilly,"October 10, 2019",5,Excellent There‚Äôs an ever growing number of these apps and I‚Äôve found this to be the one most likely someone has and transactions are instant. Being able to shop and receive a card just for the app is something I like as well.
2305,Jorge Prasse,"September 14, 2019",1,Unfair business I recently download this app and just to make the first transaction they wanted me to send them all kinds of information about myself and copies of passport and social and all of that. I declined and I‚Äôm erasing this useless app. I‚Äôm sticking to Zelle which is already linked to my account and does not give me any issues like this it requires me to give me life away. Why would anyone trust an app this much to share so much information and why the hell they would ask this from customers. Not fun at all.

The only problem I‚Äôve had is that I have a joint bank account and can‚Äôt add it because the other user on the account already did. Any time I need to get my Venmo balance out of Venmo I have to send the money to my husband first which is mildly annoying
2310,Skyyyyy,"November 30, 2018",1,"Use Apple Pay, messenger or cash app Venmo just randomly changed and now charges a lot more for an instant transfer, when it used to be $0.25.

We used to use Venmo every month for rent but since the change I‚Äôm no longer using Venmo when there are better money transferring apps that don‚Äôt charge as much.

Well that‚Äôs really inconvenient for people who share accounts. Which I‚Äôm guessing is most people. Spent over three hours trying to transfer one payment because it wouldn‚Äôt let my fianc√© use our account number. How frustrating.

Only 1% charge for having the money sent from your Venmo acct to your debit card or save the 1% by waiting 3-5 days and have it sent to your checking or savings acct. No bugs and works perfectly every time.

2460,ketoMacroTracker,"September 28, 2018",3,"Easy to pay I appreciate how easy it is to pay people (professional or not).  I do not like the auto setting that shares with the world who I am paying.  I recommend Venmo have people opt in to that feature vs opt out.  I guarantee you if more people understood that when I log in I can see who they are giving money to and why, they would be VERY displeased.  Fix this, Venmo and you get 5 stars."
2461,Lawley's Review,"October 4, 2018",5,Fast and secure This is a great app allowing you to send and receive money from friends and family. You can deposit any money received instantly to your bank account for only 25 cents! It‚Äôs been better than PayPal or the Cash App hands down.
2462,Kyss ‚úåüèº,"October 12, 2018",5,"So necessary I mean what did people do before Venmo?! SO easy to exchange money now. It‚Äôs great even for work when everyone puts lunch on one card, you just Venmo that person your share! No fees if you set it up with your account/routing number and transfers super quick. Bye bye ATM service fees, it‚Äôs been real ‚úåüèº"

I can‚Äôt even add on the ones I took off. This is  worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced."
2464,Back@it13,"October 24, 2018",1,"Transferring is a JOKE. Don‚Äôt waste your precious time and money on this app. They literally stole 2 of my RENT payments. They took the money from my account both times, it‚Äôs still gone. But they held onto it and didn‚Äôt let me landlord transfer the money it just says ‚Äúerror‚Äù. I used the app for over a year but now the rates are jacked up and they quite literally stole 2 payments of 340$ each . I will be taking the next step in reclaiming my money from them, even if it requires lawyers and shutting this app down."

I drove 30 minutes for a night out and there was no parking where we were meeting so had to park in a valet lot, but forgot that I had just given my last cash to my son, and valet didn't take CC's. As we stood there and thought, he soon asked, ""Do you have Venmo?"""
2467,Captain Gimpy,"November 5, 2018",2,"A decent enough app but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really understand the point of the social payment app, but that aside, it is a pretty quick way of sending money to friends, splitting bills, etc. But recently with an app update I can‚Äôt see all of the fields that should be showing up when I attempt to send people money. And the box where you enter the payment amount is completely absent from my UI and I have no idea how to fix this"
2468,cfcthis,"November 30, 2018",1,"Stealing your money!!! I‚Äôve been using Venmo since it came out. They added a feature last year that allowed you to make an ‚Äúinstant‚Äù transfer to your bank (as opposed to 3 days) that charged $0.25 per transfer - no matter the amount. Out of nowhere, they force an update and all of a sudden it takes out 1% OF THE TRANSFER AMOUNT. So if you transfer 500 to your roommate for rent they‚Äôre gonna take $5....NO BANK DOES THIS. I am officially looking for different banking apps as this one has lost me. Capitalism wins again. Pigs!!"
2469,SilvasGang,"December 7, 2018",1,"Not good anymore. I really like this app before the update, works very well for me, but seriously they jump from charging $0.25 to 1% the whole transaction. Very greedy. Big NO NO to that. Why can‚Äôt they continue have lots of happy costumers paying a quarter of dolar, instead of unhappy costumers not paying 1%. "
2470,nsvd hdjd,"June 8, 2018",1,"No good Constantly gives messages that it‚Äôs not working when trying to receive money. Sent a letter to customer support and got the exact same letter back that my friend got. So much for personalized customer service. Was on vacation and expecting money, app wouldn‚Äôt work and I was stranded. Happened again two months later. Worthless and frankly dangerous to assume you can have money coming to you on a certain day and it never comes due to technical issues...again."
2471,mfauscett,"June 28, 2018",5,The credit card and debit card settings I wish they would fix the way you enter your debit cards and credit cards. If you accidentally enter one more then 4 and delete one to do it they don‚Äôt let enter anymore for 6 months
2472,Aleeexxxxxx_,"July 4, 2018",5,"Eh I like Venmo because it‚Äôs convenient, but I don‚Äôt give a crap about everyone else‚Äôs transactions and I don‚Äôt want to see them.

2473,somesthetic,"July 6, 2018",1,"Worse even than PayPal I thought I‚Äôd try using Venmo so my mother-in-law could quickly send me and my wife some food money, but after taking the money from her account, Venmo decided we had broken the rules, though it never clarified how. It refused to transfer the money to a bank and permanently locked both our accounts, tying up the money for two weeks while it slowly refunds the amount to my MIL. Now my family hates me for suggesting we try it and we had to eat ramen until payday. Don‚Äôt use Venmo."
2474,Snow Ryder,"July 18, 2018",5,Reinventing a square wheel Why is it so hard to find a bill or pay someone? UI makes no sense. Every time I use the app I find it complicated and counter intuitive. If someone asks me to pay with Venmo again I will ask to deduct $5.00 for pain for using the app
2475,FShrn1996,"July 23, 2018",5,"Good, but room for improvement It would be great if we could request from multiple people at the same time. This way if you're splitting a restaurant bill or utilities, you won't have to request from multiple people individually."

2478,moogalooo,"August 30, 2018",1,"A privacy nightmare It‚Äôs a great app, but it blares all of your transactions to the entire internet by default. There appears to be no legitimate reason to do this except that it‚Äôs fun and probably seemed harmless back in 2013. If you are fine with complete strangers, large companies, and foreign governments having a detailed, time-stamped history of your payments and your friend network, irrevocably and for the rest of time, then Venmo is a good app. Otherwise, competing apps don‚Äôt do this and have all the same functionality as Venmo anyway."
2479,Sknyz,"August 31, 2018",2,Problems traveling abroad Experienced a lot of problems while traveling in India. I was not able to log in to my account on the computer and could not handle rent payments from abroad because my account was frozen. I couldn‚Äôt unfreeze it because I couldn‚Äôt access it from a computer. Luckily customer support was helpful and suggested I ask a friend to send me money to unfreeze my account. All in all a faulty and inconvenient process.

2484,D.Apperson,"January 17, 2018",5,"Easier & better than PayPal I got tired of PayPal charging me fees when someone would send me money. That‚Äôs absurd. It should charge the sender & not the receiver. Anyway, I got rid of PayPal & I use Venmo. It‚Äôs must easier to use.

2485,Jaypance,"February 3, 2018",3,"A social media platform?? How disappointing Venmo is not a place or venue to use as a social media platform. It's disappointing that a company would even have that as an option, let alone the norm that you have to turn off. I only use because it's needed between certain people. Otherwise, I'd use a different service. "
2486,LindaB123,"March 11, 2018",5,"Great easy app I have been using it for years. I‚Äôm not a youngster (truth be told I‚Äôm a grandma) My kids showed it to me and it‚Äôs so easy to pay people or request money when I lay out for theatre tickets, movies, etc. So much easier than having to remind people to send a check!"
2487,Unique nicknames,"March 21, 2018",2,No refunds for accidental payments. It‚Äôs convenient but the default social posts of transactions is weird. I liked it for a bit until someone accidentally sent me money when trying to pay someone else with a similar name. Turns out if you pay someone accidentally Venmo won‚Äôt help you out. You have to hope the person refunds the money. I refunded the guy‚Äôs money. It‚Äôs fine for small payments but not large transactions.

I don‚Äôt know how to tell I‚Äôm sending to the right person because so many of the exact same names pop up and I like privacy. But often I can only identify by the other exchanges posted. Just don‚Äôt want any id theft.
2490,Bravojumper,"October 11, 2017",1,"Terrible In order to transfer money from the app to my bank account, Venmo wanted me to enter my bank account user name and password. Um... no. There are other ways to connect a bank account. You should NEVER give your bank account password to anyone. Also, why is this app a social thing? I don‚Äôt need a feed of who paid who for what, nor do I need other people to know what I‚Äôm doing with my money. Save yourself the time and just get the Cash app by square cash. It‚Äôs a million times better."

I called Venmo and they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything to help me and that I‚Äôd have to wait for a standard transfer. Very frustrating as I need my money now. I see why ppl dislike Venmo.

Occasionally a bank transfer is quick (1-2days) when you‚Äôre account is low it seems to wait until there are not enough funds before a transfer so it may overdraft your account attempting multiple times later after the account no longer has the balance to make the payment you had just pressed send for.

2705,yayalee123,"September 18, 2018",5,Love Venmo but... I love Venmo! But I do think they could do something to make it better. I think we should be able to let our friends look at how much somebody paid us. It should be an option there should be a button for it. That‚Äôs all though.

Why should I have to do all of that to make a purchase or why should my friend have to do all of that to get their money. They will freeze your account over any little thing.

It needs some improvements in the options, but my big concern is that they do not customer service operating 24/7 and the FAQ does not clarify a lot of the question that you might have. I had a problem, the app did not let me transfer my money to my account, and there was not customer service for me to call to have an immediate response, they only offer you the option of email them."
2709,JustSquidy153,"November 5, 2018",2,"Be very careful with this app When using this app you have to know that transactions go through pretty quickly. So if you accidentally send money to the wrong person they can block you and refuse to give back your money.

2724,Hunterisadickface,"February 2, 2018",1,Horrible service I tried to transfer 400 dollars when I had that money in the account. They took 5 days to actually take it out by then I had switched banks so without telling me anything any notice or anything they start sending me non stop overdraft fees not allowing me to close out my bank account like I needed to. Without giving me any notice or option to pay it or anything. And instead of taking the blame they tried to push it off on my bank

There is no way to conveniently decide which account you want to pay with. You have to dig through the options and use an absurd check mark scheme instead of just selecting which one you want to use at the payment screen. Absolutely bafflingly incompetent and very in line with a company who has roots in a garbage dinosaur like eBay."

The whole no weekend transfers really needs to be changed!!

No one was able to help me whatsoever and basically stated this due to my account being a potential loss for their company when I‚Äôm literally a college student. This has happened to multiple people I know. So I don‚Äôt recommend downloading Venmo because they might ban your account for no explanation like they did with mine

But recently they have blocked my account for no apparent reason and they are saying that for security purposes they cannot tell me why and undo it. So basically they created an issue and have no solution for it. Furthermore they said the money i currently have on venmo may be just lost. Which is basicaly theft because I had quite a sum totaled up.

2907,BarbieCortez,"September 24, 2019",1,Highly disappointed If I could do ZERO stars I would!! If you paid the incorrect person by accident GOOD LUCK having Venmo help stop this transaction. They basically told me they are not a middle man and for me to Dispute it with the person I sent the money to. I DONT KNOW THAT PERSON! They claim they did full research and came to the conclusion that I know this person and we are connected via social media which is FALSE! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WOTH A CROOKED COMPANY AS THIS ONE!

If you really want to charge someone charge the payer.  It‚Äôs clearly a strategy to have people keep the money or a balance in their venmo account.

This story is typical. They are owned by PayPal and we all know someone who has had their identity stolen using that service. The cash app is amazing and actually takes care of their customers. This service is terrible and you have a very good chance of having your identity stolen if you use it.

2954,Rivermont,"July 12, 2018",5,Simple & Quick I love this app. I can immediately pay someone because I am the friend who forgets and never has time to go by an ATM. I use the app every week and have invited everyone in my life to join. It makes all our lives easier.

2957,Tiangell1,"August 24, 2018",5,Convenient I work in another state most of the time.  When my daughters need money it is so convenient and user friendly for them to just send me a request.  This app has made life so much easier for me.  Definitely a 5 star app!
2958,Jesmari,"August 24, 2018",5,"Fast & easy I hate the ‚ÄòI owe you money‚Äô feeling and this let‚Äôs me take care of it on the spot. No weirdness, awkwardness or room to forget.

2961,jscarcella,"September 20, 2017",1,"Worst app ever!!!! I currently have 50 dollars sitting on here that they will not allow me to send to my bank account. I spoke with customer service and they basically told me to handle it with the person who paid the 50 in person which is impossible due to the fact they live in another state. Literally the worst app with the rudest employees, will never ever be using again! üëéüèº I'd give 0 stars if I could. Do not use, especially if you plan on actually using your money."

2964,Simon Says!,"November 2, 2017",2,Great concept poorly executed Love the concept. This app is so poorly designed I can't believe it's become so popular. First of all it's kinda childish thinking to mix social and finances.  Why would you think financial transactions should be shared among friends. Also the reporting features are pretty weak. Not easy enough to find and sort transactions. The web interface is pretty cumbersome. Takes to many clicks for each transaction.
2965,Never Mo,"March 26, 2018",1,"Venmo finance This has been a nightmare that I would not recommend.  No one has contacted me after waiting for y funds all weekend.  No matter how you try to reach someone to fix the problem, the truth is that the Company ignored my requests for help.  The funds are in their possession and that‚Äôs not what we wanted, who would have known that this problem has no way for you to resolve it because only the Company staff can access your money."

2973,N√Æ-Mo,"March 25, 2020",1,No option to delete my account For some reason Venmo has played into the dishonest roll like many other shady services where the ability to delete your account is made difficult or not obvious. Requires research rather than looking in account options. Stupid. Sod fully bring this is the only payment service people have tried to hack into multiple times. Glad I‚Äôve never linked my account information.

2982,VALENr12321,"January 5, 2020",1,Frustrating There‚Äôs not even a button to view your entire friend‚Äôs list but you can comment on and like an infinite amount of transactions posted by complete strangers. Seems like any real concern for functionality has been thrown out the window with this app and is replaced by the obvious attempt to make the user feel like a part of some social media platform. I would recommend trying a different app for making transactions.
2983,Soggybrownbears,"December 30, 2019",1,"Garbage customer service I accidentally sent the wrong person a bit of money and instantly went to Venmo‚Äôs support to have them reverse it. A day later I get a mediocre attempt at helping, only for it to be extended for 2 weeks after they seemed to not understand that I was giving them what they wanted. Great app for the most part but wow, extremely disappointed in how little they try to help you after you make one wrong click in the app."
2984,CharlieNewYorka,"December 26, 2019",1,Instant transfer doesn't work all the time So as a landlord I accept venmo for rent. Typically receiving rent and pay mortgage isn't a problem. Using the instant transfer every month makes life easy when the instant transfer works. So last month it didn't work. This caused all kinds of fees. Venmo has still yet to pay them. This is the second time. So I'm not using Venmo anymore. Hello Zelle! So far Zelle works like a charm and direct transfers into checking accounts! What a difference!
2985,The obsess,"December 16, 2019",5,"Life is a little easier Venmo is so convenient and user friendly, it has saved me more than I can count when I don‚Äôt have cash or avoiding writing a check, yes I still have a checkbook. Thank you Venmo don‚Äôt change anything."

2989,Megan1239991,"November 6, 2019",4,Great app except privacy concerns I don‚Äôt like that the default setting is ‚Äúshare with friends‚Äù.

All of my payment info is correct, and yet I am consistently denied when trying to pay someone. There is not a problem with my bank account on any level.

So frustrating.

2995,ÓîêAceÓîê,"August 18, 2019",1,Buyer Beware I used this app to purchase an item on Facebook. The item I purchased arrived incomplete. I contacted Venmo and they informed me that they offer no protection for their customers making purchases even though it clearly states in the app description above that you can use Venmo to make purchases. Protection is expected by a customer when they use a service to send money!
2996,aevorea33,"August 14, 2019",1,"Zero stars Venmo has inexplicably frozen my account. The team that reviews frozen accounts takes 7 days to complete their review.

It‚Äôs a huge inconvenience to delete my bank and then go add it back every single time I want to Venmo someone.

Then they add one stupid buggy feature that is unnecessary and is a part of every single transaction (unavoidable feature). Only writing this as I hope someone will see it. When you are typing it suggests stickers. If I don‚Äôt want to use the stickers there is no way to exit the suggestions and just complete a payment. Keep it stupid simple people.

3138,paydaddy,"February 28, 2020",2,Doesn‚Äôt feel private It feels weird having a story listing of all of your contacts‚Äô transactions. Venmo just shows you the transfers of everyone listed in the contact list of your phone. It‚Äôs really annoying. I don‚Äôt care about what every single person I‚Äôve ever met is buying. The story feels violating & it‚Äôs not obvious how or if you can turn it off. But I like the ease to transfer cash.üôÑ

Told him the money sent, the next day my payments were returned to my Venmo app and my account was frozen. Venmo took the money out of my bank account and held it in my frozen Venmo account. I've been dealing with customer service for almost a week trying to get my money back. Useless, not user friendly, and definitely not worth your time. Spend the extra few dollars and go to Western Union."

3244,kmay2010,"February 4, 2020",3,"Not as expeditious as similar apps For some reason, it still takes them 5 days to transfer money from your bank into your Venmo account, which obviously makes the transfer rather pointless in most cases. Seems that with PayPal being a bigger name, Venmo would do more to match their benefits to their customers."
3245,Faculak99,"January 11, 2020",5,The perfect App for this job! This app is perfect as my payments to and from me are managed directly to my cards. Better than others that make a separate account that pays out only when you cash out.
3246,not happy Nixon,"January 6, 2020",1,"Not happy Had an issue with a transaction not going through on the day I initiated it which led to my account being unsuccessfully covered when Venmo tried to retrieve it days later on two occasions, I then incurred two reverse charges from my bank, and now Venmo initiated without notice a charge to my other bank account on file to cover the balance owed, which is going to overdraft that account first thing tomorrow. I‚Äôm cancelling Venmo and will not use again."

I wish you could hide this feature and use it only for its main purpose - an easy way to send and receive money."

3256,twinkernella,"September 7, 2019",1,DO NOT USE! This app is ridiculous.  I was able to get about 5 instant transfers to my debit cards and after that everything had to be a standard transfer to my bank account which would take 3-5 days.  No one could tell me why I could not get instant transfers to my debit cards any longer.  What poor customer service!  I am deleting the app as soon as my last standard transfer is complete.  I will never use again.  What a waste!!

My account continued to be locked and finally after filling out complaints about moving apps they said they‚Äôd be having a consultant get to me?? I‚Äôll never use this app again and trust me you shouldn‚Äôt either. They locked mine and two of my cousins accounts and the same thing happened to them.

3267,Back to Paypal,"August 5, 2019",1,Worst customer service EVER I accidentally Venmoed the wrong person and Venmo told me to contact him to get the money back. I messaged him on Facebook and he blocked me so he would t be bothered and so he could keep the money. I called Bank of America and they stopped payment on the transfer. Venmoed emailed me and told me because Bank of America stopped the payment (that never posted) I owe them $78. Then they said if I don‚Äôt pay they will freeze my account. Are you kidding me?? No. Just no.

3279,tristonexoticcarrentals,"April 25, 2019",1,Use Cash app or something else!!!! If you need money sent to you fast do not use this app! They will deny your debit card transfer that claims takes minutes then force you to use the 3 business day option! On top of that when you call customer service they DO NOT provide you a reason for it being denied OR help you in fixing this issue NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL THEM. Supervisors only tell you to F off in other words. Worst app ever I will never use again.

So if you‚Äôre unfortunate enough to lose them or have them taken from you, you won‚Äôt have instant access to your funds any longer in Venmo because you won‚Äôt be allowed to add your new debit card.

When I contacted customer service they insisted they only charged $100 despite my evidence that they withdrew another $100 from my checking. How do they respond to my dispute?

3400,David Meier Smith,"May 1, 2020",1,BE WARNED! Privacy is NOT their concern!!! Default setting on Venmo... Public. Everyone everywhere can see what you sent and to whom you sent it. If you add your address book (DON‚ÄôT) then you see all the transactions made by all of your friends who obviously didn‚Äôt realize that the default setting was PUBLIC!!!! Theybsee all YOUR stuff. What the heck! I‚Äôm cancelling my account immediately. No telling what they do with your information. Probably hand it out on street corners.
3401,sandre702,"April 30, 2020",5,Get rid of seeing others transactions I do not need the added noise of knowing that my friend paid their kid for Pizza or gave them a gift. This app should get rid of the ‚Äútrail‚Äù of other people making payments. Does anyone care?

They said that they only use this app. I used the app and sent the money and the person I bought from didn‚Äôt send me the product and I tired to get Venmo to help and they pretty much said I was SOL.

There is no option to delete a card or account it will capture and keep it. If you send someone money who has a prepaid card they cannot claim it. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to accept payments immediately once you see it with even some non prepaid cards. GOOGLE WALLET IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN.
3500,InfoCartagena,"September 18, 2017",5,I love Venmo Super easy way to pay people. No need for transactions just a quick tap into Venmo and you can send anyone any amount of money you want. The money is transferred into your account pretty fast after you request it.

Although I understand your wording in the update description is meant to be harmless and cute/hip, but ‚ÄúNothing to see here‚Äù is also a phrase people use when hiding something (think Wizard of Oz) and may not be in the best taste for an app that deals with peoples money.

However the app is far too complicated and I can‚Äôt understand the point of the social features. I really couldn‚Äôt care less if Susy Two Step pay Johnny Apple Seed $4 for a hat. It‚Äôs not relevant. The Cash App is far superior. It‚Äôs a cleaner design it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt bother with any of that pointless social crap and it allows me to have a physical Cash Card.
3595,dipzinski,"December 19, 2017",1,Not safe. You all read the horror stories of chargebacks and zero care on part of Venmo for these issues. For that reason I made a purchase thinking if I used my credit card I would be protected. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do they will deduct money. It‚Äôs really sad since this is a PayPal company. I had to close my account because I had all my rents and monthly landlording going through here and even with that they could care less. All over $125

Horrible service and I can‚Äôt believe Apple features this identity theft app on their App Store Page. Worst subsidy of PayPal.

Terrible way to deal with issues. Offering no real solutions and just no care to lose customers.
3907,nicknames-are-lame,"May 5, 2018",1,Poor security measures You should never ask for my bank account log in information. That‚Äôs just very poor security practices.

So now a large sum of money is stuck in Venmo account and neither me or the person that sent the money has access to getting it back into our banks! The entire first time experience using Venmo has been very bad and once get money out of there will never use Venmo services again.

My review is slightly mixed on the fact that it originally allowed immediate cash out but now is not allowing the ppl I send funds to to cash out instantly. I also was inconvenienced by my account being frozen for no reason before. Took two whole days to have issue resolved.

No thanks, your app and platform is supposed to be fast and easy but it‚Äôs far from that. Customer service was no help at all."
3992,magarcia5576,"April 20, 2018",1,Venmo is a steaming pile of crap Their big report doesn‚Äôt work. The ‚Äúchat with us‚Äù is a series of standard prewritten responses that they select for problems they know they have. They have my payment and I can‚Äôt get it for 1-3 business days because their instant transfer doesn‚Äôt work because I ‚Äúraise a red flag‚Äù that they cannot see what that is but it must have been by signing up and entering a legitimate card I assume because that‚Äôs all I have done.

One more social media app disguised as a feel-good ‚Äúpay your friends‚Äù and ‚Äúhey look, emojis!‚Äù that‚Äôs likely just a data mining boon for some dude who hates his Dad.

Fix your issues Venmo. Could be a great tool."

4149,Raaysteer,"January 15, 2020",1,This app is HORRIBLE This app is horrible! And plays games with your money they will freeze your account for absolutely nothing and make you wait days for someone to get back to you. Dont do it ! It is a waste of your time! I wish i can give 0 stars! Banks won‚Äôt even hold your money for 180 days! Venmo WILL and won‚Äôt give you ni explanation for it. They are basically robbing people. We need a petition to get this app shut down

I guess I‚Äôm not getting my money back or figuring out how a payment was made from my account without my knowledge. Thanks, Venmo."
4240,ddddnyc,"July 30, 2018",2,No concern for privacy I doubt most users even realize that anyone in their network can by default see the transfers they‚Äôve made. Venmo makes it hard to change the default so you need to set the payment to private. Every. Single. Time. Not sure why they want people to nosily see who their friends are paying but this strikes me as a deceitful practice.
4241,BIG ANG THE 3rd,"July 31, 2018",4,App is great but needs work Everything regarding the app is great! Except there needs to be a way to decline or cancel payments. What if I didn‚Äôt want someone to pay me? Or What if I accidentally sent the money to the wrong user? Please add this feature then I would rate 5 stars ASAP!

4244,FreqentTraveler,"September 4, 2018",5,Privacy It is an ongoing process to remain private and to respect the privacy of my contacts on Venmo. Every time I open this app it asks me to access my contacts.  Every time. Every time. Could I please just say no - never?
4245,DrMuddinton,"September 6, 2018",1,"Disappointed I have used Venmo for some small transactions, and it was great. I thought this would also be great for work payments. Wow, was I ever wrong. First they have a $2000 per day cap, so basically the same as many bank apps. They also do not guarantee instant transfers, so if you need the money this is the wrong app. The also do not guarantee any transfers for that matter. So it‚Äôs a great app if you can afford to wait, or possibly not get your money"

The money was taken from my friends account with no problem, but now can‚Äôt make it into my own account? Makes no sense and seems fishy."

I set up my account put money in out of my bank account tried to transfer it to my daughter-in-law out of state and they froze my account for two weeks. Now I'm fighting with them to unfreeze my account because of their procedures not anything I did wrong.

4253,instant transfer guy,"March 24, 2018",1,Instant Transfer doesn‚Äôt work. I have had this app for all of two weeks and the instant transfer hasn‚Äôt worked once. A couple of my friends have it and when I send them money they can transfer it to there bank instantly but when they send some to me I have to wait 3 business days every time and we go to the same bank. This app would be great if instant transfer worked.
4254,None of u chicks can fade her,"April 11, 2018",1,Terrible I would give Venmo 0 stars if possible. They defeat the purpose of being able to send money right away when needed. They falsely flag normal transactions as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù and then threaten to hold your money for up to 180 days. Send you through hoops to prove you own the bank account that they took YOUR money from. All while earning interest on your money and causing hardships for people. Shut them down and DO NOT USE THIS APP. Scam alert*******
4255,Tosin Sotannde,"April 28, 2018",1,$400 stuck in Venmo Be careful. I sent some money to my friend and they initially frozen my account. Even after I submitted I‚Äôd to have it unfrozen they just permanently disabled my account with $400 in it. I tried to transfer it out and delete this stimulus app but it wouldn‚Äôt let me then I find out that they transfers my funds to themselves before closing my account . Now it‚Äôs gonna be a long battle because they have the worst customer service ever. DONT RISK IT.

The notification says ‚Äúlost connection to bank‚Äù.  This app is a pain.  I can never pay people when I need to because I have to always wait for Venmo to verify my bank information.  I would highly recommend finding another way to send and receive money.
4351,a_v_m29,"December 21, 2018",5,Easy to use I love everything about how fast and simple it is to use. Very similar to the cash app but it‚Äôs kind of cool to see what people pay for! You can connect with friends too so I love it!

4362,Jenny Price,"November 14, 2018",3,Fee change I would‚Äôve given 5 stars before had there not been a change with the fee to get instant cash... going from $0.25 to 1% of the whole amount‚Äî I find it a bit redundant and that displeased me. That‚Äôs why I lowered my rating 2 stars. Hopefully Venmo goes back the the old way.
4363,hypree,"November 15, 2018",5,"Fees I used to love Venmo, but now with the new update there instant transfer fee went from 25 cents to 10 dollars for large transfer amounts. That is a ridiculous jump in fees just to transfer to the bank."

I always thought Venmo was unlike any other money service because they didn‚Äôt charge ridiculous fees and made it easy to instantly transfer money. But now they do and 1% of my paycheck goes to someone else. Incredibly irritating and will most likely be looking for a different app to use.

Then suddenly this morning, it worked. However, I missed sending a birthday surprise to my loved on on their special day"
4757,DucatiPaco,"October 14, 2019",5,Love it!!!! I love how easy it is to share an expense or do a favor for someone by paying for something. It‚Äôs truly the easiest way to make sure you‚Äôre not a mooch and pay your share at dinner!!

4760,Lady Anarra,"October 6, 2019",1,"I would avoid Venmo Instant transfers don't always work and their customer service is a joke. They told me their system was blocking the transfer, but wouldn't give me a reason as to why. As someone who relies on instant transfer for business purposes, I can't afford to have my money held for days at a time. I would stay away from Venmo if instant transfer is something you need access to all the time."
4761,hleipart,"October 4, 2019",5,Impressed Set up was very easy and my first transaction when through without a hitch. I'm shocked how fast and easy this site is. I think this is my new preferred method of doing business!!
4762,Pnwfag,"October 4, 2019",1,Impossible to resolve payment issues In my second time using the app the payment was refused because of a security flag. I submitted a help ticket and contacted customer service. Both told me that it was impossible to resolve the problem and recommended that i use a different payment method. 
4763,LadyKatie1258,"September 29, 2019",5,Katiescrittercare Love Venmo!  PayPal charges me a huge fee every transaction.  Trying to get away from letting my clients pay through PPal. Going to Venmo only!  Always safe and always get paid the day my clients pay!  Love this app
4764,pissedoffhellie,"September 29, 2019",1,No stars I have had the worst experience with Venmo. I had a disputed transaction in 2018  because the person I sent the money to said they didn‚Äôt receive it and Venmo wants me to to basically pay them before they can unfreeze my account. 
4765,hahahahausuckass,"September 28, 2019",2,It‚Äôs good when it works I haven‚Äôt had an issue with Venmo‚Äôs until my phone number changed.. I followed the instructions and submitted a request to update it but nothing was ever done I don‚Äôt know if anyone ever had this issue but there just be some other verification other than just the phone number being necessary..
4766,natalie overn,"September 27, 2019",1,Difficult to work with Never had issues in the years I have been using Venmo and then I tried to transfer MY MONEY to my bank and Venmo flagged it as an internal risk so I contacted them and they told me to try standard transfer but that could also get declined. They couldn‚Äôt tell me why it was flagged for a risk but they have to protect their users. Downloaded Google Pay as a friend had problems with Venmo too.
4767,412 Chesney Fan,"September 25, 2019",1,"Total Scam My account was compromised and someone sent money from it. I alerted Venmo to the fraudulent activity and they refused to do ANYTHING about it, in fact they basically called me a liar. I had to have my bank reverse the charge and then Venmo really had the nerve to attempt to intimidate me into paying them for the reversed charge! They‚Äôve threatened to send my account to collections and I honestly hope they do so I can prove on paper how shady they are."
4768,M_F626,"September 18, 2019",1,"They steal money Don‚Äôt trust this app!

I verified all of my information and once I checked back on my account , they took my $300. I have tried to reach out to them and they kept making excuses. THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM ! They also won‚Äôt help trace back anything. Don‚Äôt use ! CASH APP is so much better . Try them."

4770,mcnava89,"September 10, 2019",1,Terrible Terrible I‚Äôm probably going to delete it now they‚Äôve changed they‚Äôre way of transferring they now take more to transfer immediately and they don‚Äôt work with all banks anymore!! So even if your willing to pay them more to transfer immediately there‚Äôs a chance they don‚Äôt work with your bank to do that. I use to use this app a lot for immediate money now you can‚Äôt.

4772,Bitsandpieces2222,"August 31, 2019",1,"Friend was debited, I was never credited Waiting for six days after Venmo shows I was paid by my friend, my bank account has still not been credited. I use only one possible method to pay and be paid, a bank debit card. And trying to get this fact through to Venmo customer service is impossible. What a joke!  No service, no explanation even after waiting 5 business days."
4773,Zarp3333,"August 26, 2019",5,Even old dorks can do it! I‚Äôm practically illiterate with social media and other ‚Äúmodern apps.‚Äù I tried Zelle. Totally sucked at it. Couldn‚Äôt get it to work. I gave Zelle the finger. Venmo rocks. I dig it. Now go tell your grandpa to sign up and take advantage of his kindness.
4774,BootsMax,"August 18, 2019",2,"Not impressed I thought this was like PayPal but it obviously is not. Why would I want to have other people see my transactions and who gives me money? That‚Äôs my business. For that matter, I have no interest in seeing what $$ someone sent to a friend of mine. I hope I have my settings correct so that nobody can see my personal business."
4775,Jskoenig89,"August 11, 2019",4,Friends list?? Why isn‚Äôt their a actual friends list that I can add people too? Seems like a great quality of life improvement. Less chance of sending money to the wrong person.
4776,toyflop,"July 30, 2019",4,"Saaaaay whaaaaaat? Say word! Sister sent me $80, was skeptical at first but it worked! They took .80 for a fee,  which is cheaper then the $1.75-$3.00 atm fee! Money sent instantly to Venmo then to my debit card! 4 stars for now until I use it more and see if it‚Äôs truly worthy of 5 stars!"
4777,KillerInDisguise,"July 30, 2019",1,"Disappointed This app has the worst customer support system. Either it takes 7 business days to respond to an email or you can set up a chat in which representatives provide a pre-written answer then log off. I use this app for business & this past week has been an inconvenience for lack of customer support, I‚Äôd recommend using an alternative service provider."

I had them in standard an this customer service clearly had no idea on how to do their job.i had to repeat myself multiple times to make them understand but they kept saying I am unclear.

4780,KLHappy,"April 29, 2019",5,"Easy. Helpful. Fun! I never expected money back and forth to be a place for community, but weirdly it is. I love seeing my friends paying for coffee dates and shows. I love how easy it is to toss money at folks on the fly!"
4781,llllxxxllll,"May 5, 2019",5,GET THIS NOW This is MUCH easier to use than PayPal because you don‚Äôt have to hook your account up to a card(you can link it to a bank account) I would give it ten stars if I could. üîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜüîÜ

4785,C.rivera,"May 25, 2019",5,I love Venmo Really I do. I just hope it stays this awesome and doesn‚Äôt go down the drain with fee‚Äôs like PayPal did. It‚Äôs owned by the same company so chances are high it will happen. But for now it‚Äôs amazingly convenient for me and my clients.
4786,kaitlynswales,"May 25, 2019",3,Suggestion wished Transfers from bank to Venmo account take way to long I transferred money in hopes of it being available to my account in two days and it was taking out of my checking account and I am on vacation short bc it hasn‚Äôt posted to Venmo and they said 6 days!

If any competitors are reading this, you can easily knock Venmo out of the market by simply make an app that does what you want it to in less than 10 seconds. Seriously please go get some funding or something and market your app so I can stop using Venmo for good. TY kindly!"
4789,dparks22,"June 14, 2019",5,Excellent App This app is so easy to use. It makes sending and receiving money simple. I would definitely recommend it to others.

4795,International Metro,"March 13, 2019",3,"Convenient, but how secure is it? Admittedly Venmo is a convenient way to exchange money. My two major concerns:"
4796,Brutal Bob,"March 15, 2019",1,"Takes forever Slow slow slow. You could mail a check snail mail it would get there faster.  Took 3 days for money to show up in my Venmo account. It‚Äôs been 3 days so far, money still has not shown up in my checking account.  Multiple chats and phone calls result in ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know, it could could take another day or so‚Äù.  Terrible app. Terrible support. No answers. No help."
4797,Davod 2159203,"March 28, 2019",1,"Do not use - good chance you‚Äôll lose funds Venmo has pulled the plug on payments from computers. I tried to complain and got worlds most defensive explanations so I did some reading. It seems they are going out of business, the person on phone didn‚Äôt deny it. Not fake news: See stories in Wired, Business Insider, and TechCrunch warning that any funds may disappear when they shut down. Do not use!"
4798,Spartyon2k14,"April 2, 2019",1,Poor system and customer service Keep declining my instant transfer and I was collecting money for T-shirt‚Äôs that was due that day! They couldn‚Äôt tell me why I was being declined and they did not make any suggestions to me. Instead I‚Äôm making suggestions on things that I can do and their CS says ‚Äúwon‚Äôt know until you try‚Äù. Really unpleasant that you all could care less about what happens to my money.
4799,Mhenry256,"April 25, 2019",2,Every update has lessened this app. Every update has created more and more issues. 3 of my 4 last transactions have either been doubled or not gone through at all and left me an error notification that my card is wrong.

4800,Awesomestperson in da world,"January 2, 2019",5,"So convenient Just download it. It‚Äôs super handy for splitting checks, or just shooting money around without the restrictions of apple pay. 10/10 would recommend."

4810,tomdick&hairy,"November 11, 2018",1,"They need more money Well for awhile it was a 25 cent charge to do an instant transaction. Now it‚Äôs 1% of the total transaction is going into their pocket. Doesn‚Äôt seem like much but a normal $200 at 25 cents before and now it‚Äôs $2 which means it‚Äôs about multiplying it‚Äôs profits by 8 off of this $200 transaction. Terrible, they‚Äôre falling right into a normal bank and how this country is going I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is run/owned by Citibank or Bank of America."
4811,Jbas35,"November 14, 2018",4,Increase in rake! It‚Äôs really sad that Venmo decided to increase their cash out rake. I will be using this app a lot less and telling my friends about other apps that do the same for less or nothing.  I really liked this app until then.
4812,sewbiz1,"November 19, 2018",1,"Money grab 101 I started using Venmo about a year ago. It has worked fine for me until they decided that they were not charging enough for transactions. I don‚Äôt mind paying 5%, that would be reasonable. But they want double that at 10% of the total amount of transfer.  To me Venmo was a excellent service, but has now turned into a money grabber and I am not going to use it anymore."

4857,Caity_112,"March 23, 2018",2,It‚Äôs fine. I loved Venmo the first two years of having it but when I got a new debit card it became a nightmare. I‚Äôve been calling my bank and emailing Venmo for the past month and a half and I still cannot use my new debit card at all. It‚Äôs frustrating.

This appears to be an attempt to make Venmo into some kind of social network, when it‚Äôs for paying people, which is undoubtedly cringe and a serious irritation, but I am writing this because this app asked me to rate it and I chafe at that sort of thing."

5237,Justype1,"December 20, 2019",1,"Bad policies Venmo worked fine for the year that I used it to send money to the same people each week. Out of the blue, my payments are being declined. According to Venmo it is because of their security review software. No suspicious activity on my end, but now they tell me that there‚Äôs nothing I can do and to find an alternative means of transferring money. Tough luck. See ya later is what I got from customer support."

One also has to be careful with where your sending $ as many Venmo addresses are similar. Lastly, why does anyone need to see who is paying who.  Otherwise ok"
5286,Spells a lot,"April 14, 2019",5,"Easy to use, reliable, fast It‚Äôs fast and easy to use, and is safe and reliable. You can connect cards, banks, or have a balance within the app"
5287,Lindz3e,"April 15, 2019",5,"The bomb! So easy to use and helpful. Makes life a lot easier, not having cash on hand at all times. Transferring money to friends made easy :)"

5289,kdnzhhlaicb,"April 20, 2019",5,Love it This is VERY convenient because I am too lazy to drive to the bank. You can do it from anywhere and saves a lot of time! The fees are also not bad at all so I love this app overall!
5290,Yohebaby88,"February 5, 2019",5,Convenient but... Love the concept but the 3% fee for using a credit card is a turn off. I‚Äôd much rather use my credit card than debit but the fee is prohibitive.
5291,Jmann299,"February 11, 2019",1,Not secure Venmo is a great idea and is easy to use. But it has problems like not vitally verifying an account and transferring money into that wrong account and then taking over a month to get that money back to the right person. It definitely needs some work on the technical side of things and that is why it gets 1 star for screwing people over. Will not ever use this app again.
5292,ndifongbd,"February 19, 2019",1,"Cannot use app and no one knows why Venmo is declining every one of my payment options and no one knows why. I cannot even use the money in Venmo. No one in support has any other information other than the algorithm declines payments. I am told I am in good standing. There is no way to override this, I just have to keep trying an hope it works. Really worthless. I loved the app but now I can‚Äôt use it."
5293,Basslover2980,"February 22, 2019",5,Love!! Definitely a lot easier to use than some other payment sites. Thinking I will be sticking with you guys to make any payments needed to be made! You rock!

5296,greengoddess04,"February 28, 2019",1,Never again Taking me 2 days to get $200 that I used Venmo for since my friend had it. Thought it would be quick as it always has been for them...it doesn‚Äôt even track the money going into my bank or on here...just floating in cyber space somewhere when I needed it immediately. I am a business owner and was needing money transferred ASAP and that is not happening!!
5297,Kaseyk38,"March 6, 2019",5,Pay day all day I love this app makes things so much easier on me when it comes time to get paid or to pay either way I love this app
5298,oopsx2^,"March 10, 2019",5,Why won‚Äôt this pay I have more than the amount in my bank to pay $8.00. But Venmo thinks there is not funds.  Called the bank it‚Äôs ok on the bank side

I sent receipts proving the refund due to me, and Venmo just never once responded to my multiple attempts. I‚Äôd love to give you 5 stars for the convenient service you offer, but customer service is everything and clearly you guys don‚Äôt have that."
5301,ProteinSheikh,"December 21, 2018",1,"THEY WILL FREEZE ANYTHING MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS I‚Äôve been using Venmo forever. Always for food. But this month, roommate venmoed me, and now they‚Äôre holding the money. They MAKE you send confidential information via email (personally identifiable information, SS#, Address etc) to let you transfer your money out of Venmo. It‚Äôs been more than a couple days now, and they have yet to release my thousand dollars. Un-fkn-believable! I never had this issue with CashApp!"
5302,PechetotPDX,"December 27, 2018",5,Incredibly convenient I hate trying new apps but a family member made me sign up to simplify ‚Äúpay backs‚Äù. Not a fan of learning new apps but there really was nothing to this one.
5303,Jennadb,"December 28, 2018",3,They were awesome before they started charging 1% for immediate transfers I would have given Venmo five stars a couple of months ago. The easiest and most convenient way to send and receive money from friends etc. but then they started charging 1% for immediate transfers. Don‚Äôt be fooled Venmo is actually PayPal
5304,Jami Town,"December 31, 2018",5,"Easiest way to send money! The best part is?  They sent me a debit card that I can use as soon as funds are transferred to me!  So convenient.  And all the millennials are doing it, which makes me feel sooo hip."

5307,watcher85,"January 16, 2019",5,Love this app This makes my life so much easier! I don‚Äôt have to worry about stopping to get cash! I can just pay the person with one click :)
5308,stephrachelle1,"January 24, 2019",5,So easy to use! Only drawback is there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button and you have to back out of every screen to get back to your profile
5309,gardengnomev,"February 4, 2019",2,"Search function stinks I find the people search feature almost useless. It just doesn‚Äôt work well. For example if I‚Äôm looking for a friend who is Mike_Smith_30 and I type that in, a billion mike smiths will come up before I find the right one. And people have trouble finding me even though my name is totally unique. Please fix."
5310,hi.sofia,"September 29, 2018",1,Terrible support staff Found out I had a my bank account linked to some unknown account on Venmo. When I contacted support they pushed me to email. They took days between responses and in the end simply rejected the claim that it was my account (on the theory that it was already linked to another account) without asking for my identification or any proof of my ownership of that account. This apps support team is terrible!!
5311,Tinroom1,"October 5, 2018",5,Easy and fast Venmo is one of my favorite apps. I especially like that I can pay my dues or request to get paid at the tap of 5 or less buttons! It‚Äôs easy and fast!
5312,Completely Loved,"October 14, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt use this service! I sent a transfer to my bank on Wednesday and here it is Sunday and I still don‚Äôt have it. Therefore I‚Äôm late on my payment. The representative could not provide me specific information about my request. The last information I received was it may or may not have been reviewed. And it won‚Äôt be processed until Monday. I‚Äôm highly disappointed in the service.

5318,Petsingrad,"November 28, 2018",4,"Very handy, but could be better Like the ease of paying and receiving funds, but the site is not intuitive.  The popup add for the Venmo credit card with every transaction is seriously annoying."

5321,tloveutes,"August 20, 2018",5,Why must I re-enter my account every month? Bummer w Venmo is having to delete and re-add same account info constantly. Not a frequent user (2-3x month) so must be the downside

This is time consuming and annoying. This time when asked to do it, there is some sort of new way to add the bank back and I just don‚Äôt like it. Why doesn‚Äôt Venmo just store the bank account permanently? This is making me not want to use Venmo at all."
5327,Hello_Grandma,"September 20, 2018",5,"Easy / simple / free Early adopter of the extremely simple and useful app. I have gotten my parents to join and friends to join. Maybe it‚Äôs owned by PayPal now, oh well. It still works and serves its purpose with ease."

Cash app will allow you to decline and un send money transfers where as this app will not. It‚Äôs either put it in instantly or wait 1-3 days for a bank. We needed money instantly and it decided to not trust my card so me and my wife are now homeless for a night because this app can‚Äôt un send or cancel a transaction. A basic function.

My account was then shut down. I asked for further details and was told that Venmo doesn‚Äôt provide any further info on their decisions. So be cautious because even using the app appropriately can apparently get your account shutdown.

5392,DianaJillie,"January 27, 2020",5,Fast and convenient We used it to split family phone bill payments.
5393,Christopher Michael$,"January 22, 2020",5,Review Very optimal use of technology here. Quick transfers between accounts and can cash out by means of friends and family.  It‚Äôs quick too.
5394,AlishaHughes,"January 22, 2020",1,I‚Äôd give no stars if I could This app is the worst. Customer service should t even be called that for this app. Rep laughed in my face when asking why I couldn‚Äôt get the money in my account sent by my brother. Said ‚ÄúI guess there‚Äôs nothing we can do then‚Äù wow. On top of that I‚Äôm trying to add a secondary bank card to use and it keeps having a error message and I now have no way to resolve this.
5395,Robmills68,"January 22, 2020",5,Amazing I love this app. Makes carrying cash obsolete. So easy to share tabs at restaurants and make small payments and gifts to friends and family. Recommend to everyone!
5396,Bikermicers,"January 18, 2020",2,"Joint bank accounts can‚Äôt use it It is very frustrating to have a joint bank account with your spouse and not be able to have a joint Venmo account. It makes use of the app difficult. Other than that it is great, just wish I didn‚Äôt have to have my husband make payments for me because I can‚Äôt use it."
5397,britnayys,"January 4, 2020",4,Venmo rocks Awesome however should have a limit ($50) that dsnt charge interest for instant transfer.  Then maybe do one percent less interest on all day of and 1-3 day transfer. Break even. Venmo keeps additional overflow and puts towards their employees???
5398,cohita,"January 1, 2020",5,Convenient cash Venmo makes it so easy to pay when you don‚Äôt want to use cash or a credit card.
5399,vhnomovenmo,"December 20, 2019",1,Worst service! Use any other app. Venmo is the worst. They freeze your account with no explanation and ask for all your personal information to unfreeze. It‚Äôs completely unorthodox and alarming a service holding your account hostage to claim copies of your bank accounts and id. It‚Äôs almost on the verge of a fake service. With so many other options go with them. Venmo isn‚Äôt worth you time.
5400,suarom,"December 9, 2019",1,"Frustrated Was loving the ease of using Venmo until my bank sent me a new debit card and this site won‚Äôt accept it. Tried getting assistance from customer service, but they informed me they can‚Äôt see what causes the security alert and they can‚Äôt do anything. Wanted me to go through PayPal. If I wanted to make payments through PayPal, I would have a PayPal account. Super frustrating and a huge bummer."
5401,0vercomer1,"November 29, 2019",5,Easy! Such a convenient way to transfer money person-to-person and the safety of knowing that this is a subsidiary of PayPal is an added plus.
5402,Kelseygabriella,"November 21, 2019",1,"frauds Someone tried to hack into my boyfriends account so he reported it to the Venmo team. They emailed him back a few days later saying he is banned from Venmo permanently for ‚Äúviolating the terms and conditions‚Äù laid out on their website. When he asked what exactly he violated, they refused to give him an answer. "
5403,Woody2013!,"November 19, 2019",5,A gift from God I love Venmo what a way to pay people back when you loan money or pay rent. Anything it is so easy that I can't imagine not having it. Thank you who ever invented it.
5404,Mongojamie,"November 16, 2019",3,"Paid to have deposit in minutes turns to many hours A deposit was made at 8:45 am today. It is now 1:30 pm and still hasn‚Äôt posted to my bank card account.  Sure it was only a $1.65, but it was only to be faster than 1-3 days for free."
5405,PO49,"November 9, 2019",5,"So easy to use I‚Äôm 70 years old , my daughter-in-law showed me how to set it up! It is so easy to use to make small payments to friends and family! If I can do it - anyone can!"
5406,Liver3142,"October 30, 2019",5,Reliable Card has worked In every way needed  and used   app works great on the I phone   Also. Highly recommend   It
5407,SJacks09,"October 29, 2019",5,Love This is great! I‚Äôm just learning about all this kind of stuff. I needed a refund for some air pods I bought online and never received. The business refunded me my money through this! Pretty cool!
5408,LC of NH,"October 27, 2019",5,"Awesome, free, secure app! I use this a lot and with the free transfer option, it never costs me to pay someone back, donate to friends‚Äô causes, pay for services, etc. So easy to use!"
5409,Salmonfly27,"October 23, 2019",5,"Love the flexibility! Venmo gives me the flexibility to pay when and where I need to - friends, small businesses, etc. what a great option to writing checks!!!"
5410,meg1111222222,"October 18, 2019",1,"Impossible to authorize bank to transfer funds I‚Äôve been trying to associate a bank account with my Venmo account for almost a year now and no matter what account (PNC, Discover) I try to associate it with, Venmo tells me the authorization fails. I have money in my Venmo that I cannot transfer to a personal account. Eventually I had to Venmo it to my boyfriend and he had to give it to me that way. Ridiculous."
5411,Llaiyah&yanna mama,"October 18, 2019",5,Rate I love my Venmo account! It‚Äôs a great way to receive payments from other people and a great way to pay other people quick and easy! I really enjoy it!
5412,jdjdkdkdkfkfkkfkfkfkfkfkfkf,"October 8, 2019",5,Not so good Most of the times it doesn‚Äôt want to transfer my funds to my account. Card number and all info is correct .
5413,get money itches,"October 4, 2019",5,Great app Send money fast and get money fast goes right into your bank account right then and there a little percentage taken out but not crazy amazing app
5414,angie5f,"October 3, 2019",1,Use caution I have had nothing but problems with my Venmo being declined. Both Bank accounts and credit cards. There is something flagged on my account that makes all my payments decline all of a sudden. Contacted customer service multiple times to be told there is nothing they can do and no one can look into and maybe try again later!!
5415,ckcrocker,"September 26, 2019",2,World wide exposure Why can I see what other people (who I don‚Äôt know) have paid to other people (who I don‚Äôt know) money and what it‚Äôs for. If I can see them then they can see me.  This is an evasion of personal private rights. Venmo!  Tell me how to correct this fast or I‚Äôm deleting you and telling all of social media what they better look out for.
5416,suzy q 122,"September 24, 2019",5,"Venmo rocks!!! I love this app. It makes planning travel and nights out with friends easy, paying tutors simple , contributing to group gifts a pleasure  and keeping track of the ins and outs of my transactions seamless. Thank you Venmo!!!"
5417,vinceballard,"September 24, 2019",5,Easy to use It‚Äôs super convenient and it‚Äôs never failed either way. Getting paid or paying made simple.
5418,Angela740lynn,"September 16, 2019",1,Friends useless New to this wanted to try it but I‚Äôll delete. So even after my friend accepted my request she never showed up anywhere on like a friends list and when I click to go in and send money she‚Äôs not listed and I still have to fully search for her. I really thought she would be there to just click on and make the send easier. Disappointed
5419,okkiyrrdghrwfji,"September 11, 2019",5,So Easy It‚Äôs so easy to make a payment through this system. Click a couple buttons & literally it‚Äôs paid.
5420,mozealong,"September 6, 2019",5,Doesn‚Äôt work Venmo says my bank account is ‚Äú0‚Äù now for no apparent reason and getting in touch with them is very difficult.
5421,Toddy-O,"September 2, 2019",5,Simple and efficient Venmo is great when you don‚Äôt have cash and want to keep short accounts with friends and don‚Äôt want to search out an ATM to get cash.
5422,tstar money coup,"August 27, 2019",1,"Service has gotten personally worse. First couple of times had food service but the more I use it the more restricted it seems to get. I would love to keep using it for my personal use but sadly I‚Äôm having to search for another payment option due to long processing times, randomly can‚Äôt do instant transfers with no explanation. Same responses. Was good while it lasted."
5423,Megaph0ne,"August 25, 2019",5,Great way to pay! Venmo hooked up to my one account ran by squirrels makes it easy to give my family money when I see fit!
5424,mindy mine,"August 7, 2019",3,Ms Gail I‚Äôm just setting up this account and I like the security feature but it is not user friendly. I can‚Äôt turn off the FB add contacts; I do not want to interface with it; I don‚Äôt like that you can see who sent what transaction detail and I still can‚Äôt find how to add on a contact. Dam!
5425,cenos2009,"August 6, 2019",5,So convenient This has changed how I do business as well as personal life. It takes seconds for each transactions.
5426,Deepesh,"August 5, 2019",5,It should not be so hard to set up a bank account Very time consuming to set up an account. 
5427,stella5tar,"July 31, 2019",5,Annoying I need to keep reconnecting to my bank and updating information like every few weeks.
5428,Loganzhunt,"July 17, 2019",1,"Unresponsive customer support Since getting a new phone number, I have been locked out of my account for 2.5 years, totally unable to withdraw the funds from my account. I have opened up 3 cases with customer service, each of which has proven to be unsuccessful after repeated verifications of identity. Would not recommend this service to my friends or family."
5429,Elizzabuggs,"July 17, 2019",3,"Email Confirmation?? I‚Äôve been trying for the last week to get verify my email, but every time I do, your confirmation site loads as a blank page. Further, i can‚Äôt actually transfer my money because there‚Äôs no way for me to verify my email."
5430,just being me..,"May 11, 2019",5,Makes life easier! Paying money back & forth when we are all helping elderly parents Venmo has made life a lot easier!
5431,molinamd2019,"May 20, 2019",5,Feedback The service fee is too expensive for credit card transactions.
5432,HGoldMD,"May 22, 2019",5,No need to order checks This is the most convenient way to pay someone. I am not going back to checks unless I absolutely have to. Thanks Venmo!
5433,mamabear2791,"May 24, 2019",1,"Dishonest and terrible. My app was hacked and I lost out on over 600$. Venmo does not at all protect their customers like paypal or cashapp does. When I made a complaint for fraud they basically said it was my fault that I was able to be hacked. And the icing on the cake is, I have over 100$ still in my Venmo and they refuse to unfreeze my account so I can retrieve the money and close my account. All the staff is rude and unhelpful. Very unprofessional and risky.. beware."
5434,cmharris78,"June 6, 2019",2,"Account frozen for almost a week I am currently waiting on $402 that someone sent me, I‚Äôve made contact with Venmo since Friday, May 31st, sent my ID three times and still no money, this is getting very frustrating, no one to talk too in that department, only email and response time is 2 to 3 business days. Cash App is much better."
5435,Patty from San Diego,"June 7, 2019",5,"Great app for receiving or sending money! It‚Äôs user friendly, you can hold funds until all is received great for communicating updates of funds."
5436,kittenberrycastle,"July 11, 2019",5,"Love it Only problem is finding people through search, and people finding me. Other than that, very useful tool."
5437,Theo0208,"July 5, 2019",5,Makes life easy This app makes life easy! It is fast and convenient. I also like the transaction history that Venmo provides every month.
5438,Jill61S,"July 5, 2019",5,"Works great! I am over 60 and though I am pretty adept at technology, I still often find it confusing and not intuitive. Venmo is easy to use and very convenient. I love it."
5439,juneigor,"June 30, 2019",5,"Fast and convenient I‚Äôm an old man and not a techie but this app is so easy, fast and convenient. If you have issues, you can chat with tech support and resolve it in seconds. Kudos to whom ever invented this app."
