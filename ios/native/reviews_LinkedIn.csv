0,Lisa cushman,"March 27, 2018",2,"Serious VoiceOver accessibility problems I am a blind person using the screen reader voiceover for iOS and I am having some serious VoiceOver accessibility problems. For one thing, in the new version, when I double tap on my Contacts, the app crashes every time. Secondly, when I am browsing through my people you may know section, the app get slower and slower and slower the longer eyebrows. Thirdly, if you were using voiceover, there is no option to remove someone from your people you may know list so that you do not see them anymore. The accessibility problems with this app used to be somewhat minimal. I am really looking forward to seeing this app fixed and using LinkedIn again. It is one of my favorite social networking platforms.  I apologize if other people are bored by this review, but LinkedIn also does not have any where in the app or on the app support page to provide feedback about the app. I would also be kind of nice if developer of LinkedIn provided details about its updates in its release notes, but many App developers don’t do this. It’s just a pet peeve."
1,kintobaR Rabotnik,"June 13, 2019",1,"Horrible Interface I swear this site has provided me with so much stress just trying to set it up. I didn’t dropped out of college and I left my job but they are both in my interests and I cannot change them. Whenever I open the app it tells me to finish updating my profile but I don’t have anymore information to add. There’s no way to say no. When I tried to leave things blank because they don’t apply to me I couldn’t. I got a notice that I had shown up in a search but when I opened the notification I was taken to a page within the app that did not work without a laptop. Why would this happen on the mobile app? It makes no sense. I’ve made all the connections I want to for now but every time I open the app I have to skip through the page to make connections with random people I don’t know. This app and the website are infuriating to attempt to use. I use all kinds of other social media that work at least decently. This platform is by far the most angering to use. Maybe the team is overworked or has no time to fix these issues, but they are too glaring and long lasting to still be around."
2,LoveFurnitureGuy,"June 12, 2019",3,"Linked-Book It’s a shame LinkedIn has gone the lame -childlike FB direction allowing posts which mirror FB of selfies, family outings, dinner plates and gifs / memes flooding the “business network” feed and constant / annoying and unrelated to your profile or interests .....posts/ads which have no option to “delete / not see” in the message post options?  "
3,1953ZBirdman,"November 19, 2019",2,Changes to LinkedIn. I too am very disappointed with LinkedIn and the direction it has taken. 
4,SendingOutAnSOS,"June 17, 2019",1,"The absolute worst networking app... LinkedIn is the absolute worst, corrupt, and non user friendly social app out there. There are too many reasons to even begin mentioning all of them. Just to name one: if a user wants to unfriend or leave a group, LinkedIn intentionally makes it impossible to do so on the mobile app."
5,Mike O PhD,"December 13, 2018",2,"Chronological content feed - second attempt. LinkedIn... I love your platform. I have already posted a comment on the lack of a sort by “recent” function on for iOS. When I’m on my phone, the work around is to go to your mobile site, then request the desktop site, then select “sort by: recent”. The most recent update you just pushed out now has “lives” or something that feels like a clone of Instagram/YouTube/Snapchat/Facebook, etc. I do not subscribe to these platforms because I believe LinkedIn is the only social media platform of any substance. There is quality content and networking happening everyday. Why did your newest update add a cookie-cutter “lives” function and not a simple “sort by:recent” function. Why am I seeing 3 week old posts with recent posts scattered about. Totally ridiculous... The one platform I thought was doing a service to a community of professional people is slowly becoming just another social media platform."
6,M Kutman,"January 15, 2018",3,"Option to improve feed needs to be improved The app is solid and very easy to use. My complaints are the content in the Feed and that the option “improve my feed” really offers no real options except adding new people to follow. It should be flexible and let you choose what you want to see more of OR less of. For example, in my feed I don't need to see every single time a connection “likes” something. I also remember I always used to see when my current connections connected to new people. I used to see those a lot every day. That was helpful info if a contact connected to someone new in my industry. It worked well in conjunction with the other “people I may know” info. I almost never see those types of updates anymore in my feed. Can you explain why the feed offers me zero flexibility to see the things that are most important to me?"
7,twr_167,"January 2, 2020",1,Horrible The newest update has them limiting your preferences for your job search an forcibly showing you state wide jobs like that helps. If  someone like myself has set up job preferences why take them away and why start showing jobs to them that are outside of their preferences like a job search isn't already hard enough and tiring enough. Now I'm every time I open the app instead of being able to scroll through the recommendations I have to create different searches because the jobs recommended to me are 8+ hours away and don't interest me in the slightest. Just because I live in a state doesn't mean I'm comfortable commuting far and doesn't mean I'm trying to relocate to the opposite side of it. So who's dumb idea was it to add that useless and annoying feature that shows jobs to people outside their now very limited preferences. I don't want to be shown state wide jobs and according to the customer service rep it's a feature I can't manually get rid of. Dumbest update to date.
8,(Joe)45,"April 18, 2020",3,"Please add an unlimited word count I love LinkedIn, but would like to see an unlimited word count.  There are so many times that I have a post that exceeds the allotted word count and it’s frustrating.  I could condense what i need to say most times, but sometimes I need to be able to say more than what LinkedIn allows.  "

10,SquidlyMan,"October 31, 2017",1,Horrible interface This is a perfect example of what NOT to do in mobile app design. 
11,Johnnyboy1960,"December 20, 2017",2,"iPhone X Number one, if your application in the Apple IDs door would support a dialog box when selecting apps support I would be writing this in that dialog box and not under reviews. My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‘s responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I’ll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon. I would use your out more by not having to manually put in my password, holding the phone to your face makes my motivation to use your application what greater than having to use my large fingers To type in my password. Thank you, John"
12,Effthisnickname,"September 12, 2018",2,"App crashes and crashes again. I downloaded the app again because I thought it would be easier to use on my phone. I’ve been using it for about 30 minutes and it has crashed 3 times. It crashed while I was sending a request to connect. I was attaching a message to this request because the person doesn’t know me. Now, It has sent the request and I can’t finish my message. I don’t know if it attached what I typed already or not. Given that LinkedIn is a tool to help people network and make professional connections, this is more than frustrating. Now, to reach out to this person, I would have to pay for a premium account and use “in mail.” I’ll not be using the app anymore which is a serious inconvenience. I stopped using the Linked In app years ago because it would lead to accidental connection requests while scrolling through searches or suggested connection."
13,Nickname is already taken 3,"September 27, 2018",5,Good app I really like LinkedIn because it’s social media kept professional. A suggestion I’d make that would help recruiters find and connect with talent is to add a salary requirement to the “jobs settings”. I get contacted by so many recruiters and each time they contact me about a position I talk to them for about 30 minutes just to find out they want to offer me a job that pays me 25-50% less than my current salary. It’s a complete waste of my time and the recruiter’s time as well. Another thing I’d recommend is providing recruiters a service that lets them know what is the median salary for the position they are trying to hire for so they understand how much professionals earn in their industry and position.
14,Candy_Girl80'sbaby,"October 23, 2018",5,"Professional Networking Tool LinkedIn is my preferred way to interact with business professionals. I do, however, wish that the site would allow a longer time to deactivate an account or allow one to restore their account within a year. I deactivated my account for a “spiritual hiatus” and attempted to set my account back up and was unable to retrieve it. I built a great network before and now it seems like I am not getting as many recommendations for people that I knew from college and other businesses. 😏 I’m sure my post sounds like a combination of great things and not so great things, but I do really appreciate the fact that the tool is much more professional than most social media outlets."
15,Dulce CaraBella,"November 24, 2018",2,"Terrible Update for New Jobseekers!! Why is the current company name for occupation now forced in the headline with the job title!?!? What about those of us that are currently seeking other jobs while still working at the current position???  This is a terrible thing, we should have the option to not have the company name on our headlines if we don’t want it! So disappointed.  I was getting so many job opportunity inbox messages from recruiters with my customized headline before this terrible update, I was wondering why I hadn’t seen any inbox messages recently and now I know why, since you removed my customized headline and added the company I currently work for I don’t standout to recruiters anymore and I’m not getting any leads, my headline looks just like everybody else’s headline therefore recruiters don’t even notice me anymore because my headline doesn’t standout like it use to. Change it back please!"
16,Xtyna Yee,"January 9, 2019",1,"Freezes, Can’t apply for jobs, links don’t work! NEEDS THE TO BE FIXED! I’ve heard so many people speak highly of LinkedIn, so I tried it out. Unfortunately this app does NOT work, as it needs serious updates.  When you try to apply for any of the job listing your are given the option to give permission to attach your LinkedIn profile in replace or your resume, it does NOT work. Once you click you get a white screen or when it does go through to the next screen where it will ask for your name and contact info it freezes. Therefore you can not apply for any of their job listings. So I look up the company on google to find their website and then apply that way  with my own resume. "
17,unnecessary change,"April 9, 2019",4,"Responding to recruiters new feature is terrible In the past when I was contacted by a recruiter in my message inbox, I could respond directly to the recruiter. Now, the app forces you to respond whether or not you are interested in the job before you have a chance to respond. To me this is a 100% unnecessary feature and is an unprofessional way to contact a recruiter to express interest. The right way to treat a recruiter is to write that person directly and let them know your intentions, perhaps including some background for your decision. This can help keep communication channels open in the future and is a networking opportunity. This new feature is a result of someone “overthinking” the situation. This goes back to the old saying, “If its not broke, don't fix it”"
18,sm 1485,"October 28, 2019",4,"Great app but... I love this app however it frustrates me that the current job title seems to be the only factor that is included when recruiters are delivered search results.  As a consultant, my title can be anything and it may be quite different from my functional role and area of expertise.  Depending upon the currently listed job title, I’ve noticed a sharp difference in the number contacts I receive from recruiters and the roles they are seeking.  I wish that other factors such as education, certifications and skills would be considered when recruiters are delivered search results.  Also, LinkedIn should allow subscribers to search by certification or certificate.  Currently a search for common certifications returns no results despite the fact that these certifications are listed within job descriptions."

20,Keithrube1,"October 14, 2017",5,Linkedin App is a must have for anyone in business at any level When Linkedin first introduced an app I’ll admit I was sceptical. I was leery because I’ve experienced many many websites attempting to make life easier with a new app and they fall on their face. This particular app is probably one of the easiest to maneuver and it allows me to stay connected easily with notifications and simple maneuvering around the site. I choose to be a Premier member and the benefits are well worth the money. I love linked in. I’ve become friends worldwide not only for the industry I’m in but also personal friends with multitudes or different interests. Get the app.
21,Lora2424,"December 2, 2017",1,"BEWARE - Terrible customer service and awful refund policy. I was tricked into paying $135(!!!) for a “premium” subscription that has absolutely no value to me. I assumed that the free trial would end because I never received a single email or notification about the upcoming subscription renewal after signing up for a free trial last month. I tried to find a place to cancel the subscription in the app and on the website with no luck. Now LinkedIn refuses to refund the payment. I am appalled. For a company that feigns interest in professional success, they have absolutely no sense of what providing good customer service entails. Auto renewing an expensive subscription without notice and without asking for permission is sneaky and conniving. Then refusing to refund the payment is insane. I am severely disappointed in LinkedIn and will be sure to warn my employees, colleagues, and friends."
22,GREEK 2U,"May 11, 2018",2,"Watch out for Premium Trial!! The mobile version lacks so many of the desktop version features such as privacy features and profile customization. However, what really bothers me is that LinkedIn uses this difference to their financial advantage so you cannot cancel a Premium subscription from your device even if they allow you to subscribe from your phone easily. You also get no notification when the Premium trial is ending so you get charged abruptly. If you miss the subscription cancellation date, LinkedIn will offer no refunds even if late by an hour!! Really?"
23,Bunty1286,"September 26, 2018",1,"Frustrated! Tired of app crashing constantly. This app constantly crashes on uploading posts with photos and video. The effort that it takes to write a post goes to waste as it crashes more than 90% of the time. I am using iPhone X, so hardware should not be an excuse for this issue. I would like to hear what the developers have to say about the problem. This problem has been an issue for at least last 2 years. I have installed the app multiple time but no luck. I don’t use the app anymore but sometime while traveling I have no other option. I am not sure why such a basic functionality is not resolved on this platform. Is it too hard for LinkedIn to figure this out?? "
24,Eagle33199,"November 28, 2018",4,"Great but... The app is generally the only way I interact with LinkedIn, and it works well for what I need it.  However, while I appreciate the alerts most of the time, ever since this last update I've gotten alerts several times a day.  When opening the app, the alert ends up asking me if I know someone... And it's been the same individual every single time. And every time, I dismiss it because I don't know them.  It's gotten to the point where I seriously want to turn off alerts for the app, which would significantly decrease it's usefulness.  Up until this last update, it was just fine.  Now it's begging for attention that I really don't want to give it."
25,Lena Kay,"February 21, 2019",1,"Horrible user continuity and takes advantage of user data I use LinkedIn on my Mac computer all the time and used to be signed in to the app on my previous iPhone. When getting a new phone, every other app was able to use facial detection to let me sign in, while LinkedIn was the ONLY app to reject my facial recognition and force me to take a “not a robot” test to collect AI data on if users can identify pictures. Is it necessary for me to take this free data AI collection test for Microsoft/LinkedIn over and over again every time I get my password wrong. Is there a reason why this is the only app that won’t accept my facial recognition, while every other app does, when moving from Mac to my iPhone to log in???"
26,mugnum_parts,"March 8, 2019",3,Good app but bad recent changes LinkedIn is a great professional app and I love how I can work on my career and look for opportunities using it! Haven’t had any weird glitches with it yet that downgraded my experience.

Well, that is until recently. Over the past few months, it does nothing but crash, crash, crash! Every time I do anything more than browse through newsfeeds or search for profiles/jobs, it crashes. Try to write an article on the app...crash! Try to apply to a job...almost always crashes! Try to download or save something from the app....I can guarantee it will crash!"

29,jt_alias,"January 13, 2020",2,"Performance issues - always loading, rarely loads I love LinkedIn as an app however lately - over the last few months - the app has become so slow it’s almost unusable. Simple searches that used to return response in seconds now take minutes and often throw an error and don’t come back at all. Pretty much any action off the main landing page has not worked for me, returning the “oops it’s not you it’s us” error and it happens across mobile app and website. Often times I get the never ending spinner, with an ultimate failure error message. While I love LinkedIn - it’s not working - and hasn’t for weeks and I haven’t seen any acknowledgment of the issue which I have to imagine is widespread. Send help! Also please note that I installed the latest app on iPhone XR but no change :("
30,Jarek Bannister,"September 23, 2017",3,Please Fix I am trying to connect to a lot of fitness professionals and it takes 10+ minutes for the requests to send after I clicked on it.  Then if I switch screens it stops sending them.  So I have to resend requests over and over.   It also covers up the search bar so I can’t do anything else.  Then when clicking the little circles to add someone it always will jump to their page because my fingers are too fat maybe making it less sensitive around the circle or making it a bigger button would be better.  It just is a nuisance and I can’t get back because the back button is covered up by the requests being sent pop up. Fix those problems and I’d say 5 star.
31,Fraxtil,"October 3, 2017",1,"Completely irresponsible with push notifications I've turned off notifications for everything except the few things I care about (invitations to connect, messages, anything else that pertains directly to me). I still receive push notifications for superfluous events like ""trending news articles"" on a daily basis. The app is designed to have as many notification types as possible, and I've turned off more obscure notifications than I can remember. If you turn one off, the notification settings linked from the dismissed message only shows you what you've turned off, with no option to turn off all the other notifications you'll eventually receive. Completely irresponsible and annoying. I'll be reserving LinkedIn for the desktop from now on."

33,Irie's Pie!,"June 19, 2018",3,"What Happened????? I lived LinkedIn until a few weeks ago when I started getting notifications and solicitation from them via my work email asking if I wanted to join our network. After joining, it didn’t make sense to me to have two professional LinkedIn accounts. Of course my personal account was more prominent with a complete profile and a vast network. Once I merged the accounts, that all disappeared!!! I was left with the account attached to my work email and no profile. I’ve been looking on the website to see if I can get this corrected, but as in most cases there isn’t a was to get “LinkedIn” to a real person!!!  Not sure if I even want to re-build another profile and network!"
34,Tootoon31,"September 10, 2018",1,"I cannot stand it Although the app is good in general, it just constantly fails to load contents. The different pages either don’t update or load partially or just don’t load at all! Sometimes I want to type a message to someone or update my profile, only to find out later that the message was lost or the updates were not made. It’s happening on both my iPhone and iPad. I’ve contacted the support team several times, each time they seem to fix the problem but only for a few days. It keeps coming back! I’m even a premium member but that doesn’t seem to make any difference, it’s just so frustrating. I’m starting to use other means like Glassdoor more and more... Conclusion: the app can be great but for me it’s totally unreliable, I just can’t recommend it for anyone who needs to seriously work with it."

36,H0rs3 luv3r,"May 3, 2019",1,"Beware of the “free” premium auto renewal.. Before I start.. this is more a review for Apple/iTunes subscription practices than LinkedIn.. so everywhere you see LinkedIn, you can basically fill-in any auto renewal subscription app.. WATCH OUT!! If you’re interested in trying out the free Premium version, you better be paying attention because if you’re not, you're going to slapped with the $65 monthly subscription charge before you even figure out what the difference is between Premium and the free version! I can think of a TON of other things I’d rather spend $65 on! And if you do get charged, GOOD LUCK getting Apple/iTunes to issue you a refund... I think they literally flip a coin. You’re likely stuck with another 30 days. Maybe you can use the extra 30 days figure out the difference..SOUR APPLE!"

Other than that, I absolutely love LinkedIn.  It’s an easy, fun way to connect to the business world and to network and build relationships across different markets and industries.

38,ricegator,"December 18, 2019",1,"Cannot message potentials connects before accepting The evil money-grabbers at LinkedIn have removed the ability to message for free somebody who has requested to join your network. For privacy and security it is necessary that we be able to message these people to make sure they are who they say they are or if we don’t recognize them, to ask them where we know them from. As a free user I am now forced to accept the connection before sending the message, exposing my personal info to a potential stranger. The goblins as LinkedIn need to value our privacy and security over our money by reenabling the reply (don’t accept yet) option on connection requests. If you agree, please also give a one star review (you can even copy and paste mine) so we can inform LinkedIn that they cannot get away with this."
39,spicy chica linda,"October 30, 2019",3,"Could be better First and most importantly, there should be a rate/review a company option! This would allow current, past & possible new candidates transparent reviews about every company! A competitor, Glassdoor has this feature! Past associates would be able to shine light on issues they encountered while working there as well. Secondly, what’s with the constant LinkedIn members flooding message inbox to get one to go premium? I would like a notification feature where I can more easily tell when I have new messages that way I can keep track and respond in a more timely fashion!

You can download your connections and get all the information you need to plan regional meetings except City and State. If you check profiles to get that information and add it to the downloaded spreadsheet, they restrict your account for the “security of your connections.” I can download their names, employer names, employment history, education history, etc., so I’m not sure how city and state contributes to security risk. Customer service rep didn’t seem to know city and state aren’t in the download, didn’t seem to care, and didn’t have the forethought to give that suggestion to the product development team. Kinda lame for a business app."

I like the convenience of being able to access my account on my laptop or through the app. The mobile app has issues though, primarily that the news feed can not be displayed chronologically with “most recent” instead of the algorithm-determined “top stories”. The value of this network is seeing what people are doing now and what events are coming up. Eliminating the ability to view the feed by recent posts makes the mobile app useless for me. "

It has logged me out in my phone as well as on my computer. It does it after maybe every 10 minutes. So it has been nearly impossible to search jobs and connections without being logged out every time. Therefore, I have become very disappointed in this program. Also I haven’t been able to submit my resume with easy apply so it has caused me to revert back to the normal search and go to original website method. There are just too many glitches preventing me from enjoying this program."
52,JWoodson22,"April 15, 2018",3,"Close to flawless Just started and love the concept. Love the way that it invites you to fill out your profile since it engages you with a meter that fills every time that you do something. But the thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that when it asks you to submit a profile picture, or work experience, or almost anything else you have to try multiple times by starting over, entering the same information again, and hope that it accepts your information. Pressing the “add to profile” or “save” feature virtually does nothing. Very frustrating, but everything else is pretty flawless."

Knowing who is looking at your profile can help determine if the company that is looking at your page is something you are actually qualified for, or help you decide if you need to tweak something or pay money to someone who can help with your resume.

But then when you select “choose” in the app, it immediately sends you to the “crop photo” screen and distorts the color making the profile picture look terrible. You’d think LinkedIn’s photo editing options would help, but no - the colors remain unacceptable, even adjusting with the filters. Why not just allow the photo to remain in the same color as it was uploaded? This forces users to accept unprofessional looking photos when they are trying to update their profile photo."

To add another you must retype your entire search term—every time!  This is infuriating because it doesn’t even save your previous term.

Sometimes even providing topics for the conversation -- like to comment on their recent post. This can enhance the conversation.

Its more professional and you get to let the person know why you want to connect with them. This gives more connections to be accepted.

Or maybe they have a trick question or trick button that I didn’t realize what it was. I would never have given them permission to send emails to all my contacts. I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS!!!!

When you go to notifications and like anything from my network it automatically unlikes and likes other posts not what I click on.

2859,A long term customer,"October 7, 2019",1,Nothing more than a social meeting place At first it seemed professional . A little later it was professional and social people meeting. Looked on my ex-husband’s page he had other accounts  one of his names he called hisself  big bone . Which was a total lie there was nothing big about it and I’m serious . I knew he was talking to other women because that made up a fake account for me  to see if he would flirt. when he got home the entire conversation popes up on his (so called professional) page but he denied that he was big bone. Right as he got home and sat his iPad down the entire conversation popped up on his iPad.  however I’m not stupid it would not be on his page if it wasn’t he who did that. But I have many reasons why I knew he lied about it. I rather not go into full details of how I knew he was using all these sites meeting women . Condoms disappearing. We were together 17 years and for 15 years he had no problem he always let me use his phone or iPad but all of a sudden the last three years it was a problem . he didn’t like me looking at it and he would reset the phone if I grabbed it before he could so  yeah I don’t believe this site is not much different than Facebook Twitter or any of those other sites. Also on LinkedIn he would not accept my friend request so what does that tell me and anyone else I tell this to I just got sick of it and deleted my account not long after I had it . If people would use it professionally like it was made it would be a good site unfortunately they are looking for extra things that other sites have who are not professionals. So my sites deleted I’m happy I did it and I will never install it again.

Yes, I have been able to connect with a few more people, but that is not worth the exorbitant monthly fee. The jobs that are suggested by LinkedIn are usually far from a match.

Integration of contacts with calendar is mildly interesting and cool but while my calendar stays extremely full, I don't have enough meetings with ""cold contacts"" for it to be a regular or useful part of my workflow.   Similarly, the emphasis on updates would be more meaningful if more than a tiny fraction of my contacts chose to use LI as a place to share content.   "
3061,CricketsMommy,"June 19, 2014",2,"Can't edit profile from iPad app. Ridiculous. I downloaded the LinkedIn app on my iPad, played around with it a bit, then realized there were a couple of changes I needed to make to my profile. So I tapped. I surfed. I swiped. I assumed that it was possible to update my profile from the iPad app, but that the necessary button was just hiding in some obscure place that I wasn't seeing. After all, I've been able to edit my profile from the app on my Samsung Galaxy for more than a year. So I Googled ""How do I edit my profile from the LinkedIn app for iPad?"" and was taken to a forum on LinkedIn's site...where I discovered it's ACTUALLY NOT POSSIBLE. Um. What? A LinkedIn forum moderator hopped on the thread (more than a month after the question had been posted, mind you) saying LinkedIn was listening and that she'd make sure to forward their  comments to the app development team. I would think profile editing would be one of the first functions the added--after all, if the purpose of the app is professional networking, wouldn't you want your profile to be the absolute best it can be? So in the meantime, I have to access LinkedIn from my browser in order to edit my profile, which means there's no point in my having the iPad app at all, as there's nothing the app does that the full site doesn't. So. I'll be deleting this memory hog until it actually does what it's supposed to do."

A great digital highway for job seekers and hiring employers to meet and maximize bright minded, secondary educated, technologically experienced professionals. This is by margin's one of the best Business Networking sites out there in Cyberspace. They've done things right by starting early to create a networking site and now it's continuously expansive through many facets of corporate business linkage. A virtual business Buzz site with multiple ways to sell oneself and make known to others your own skills and capabilities. If you're on this site and not seeing results, get help, and find out how to utilize this application website. This internet domain is a virtual gold mine for anyone looking to get involved with business. Love the new interface within the website."

The culmination of intelligence insight and learning that one can experience daily by only spending 10 minutes on LinkedIn is a highly unique and not worth the app that truly has changed the business community and open doors of opportunity for networking recruiting and just fundamental learning. Proud to be part of this ever growing community from the very beginnings. I am hopeful overtime but this Apple emerge with incremental features such as your current location available to your network to allow you to engage with your network who may be traveling locally and open the opportunity to meet with members of your network in various cities.

3065,Pooperdoodler,"March 13, 2017",1,"Poorly designed app It's amazing how terrible this app is and how much worse it is each time it updates. First of all, replacing the ""me"" button with the ""jobs"" button is so unnecessary. If I want to open the jobs app, I will go to the jobs app. It's ridiculous that I can't reach my own profile at any screen, I have to be in my newsfeed for it. I can't reach settings unless I am on my own profile. And for the love of god PLEASE FIX YOUR NOTIFICATIONS. Seriously it's 2017, it's like a child developed this app. I never get push notifications about people accepting my requests, or people requesting me.. oh but I do get tons of notifications everyday to congratulate someone on a work anniversary. Really? Yes I care so much about who started a job on this day, who will it be today?! Whoo! Please think about it, it is the only notification that is going to happen EVERYDAY and it's the only notification that the app feels necessary to put an app badge for. I don't want badges for this! You have so many notifications settings and how is this not one of them?! Why is congratulating someone on their work anniversary the main highlight of your app? Also, when I enter my newsfeed I see something that catches my eye, but it automatically refreshes itself and even if I scroll down, I can't find it.

3070,Rflr,"August 17, 2011",1,"More bling. More annoying. I'm a heavy linkedin user and I appreciate the attempt to overhaul and redesign everything from the ground up but I do not care for this update. I knew from the very first second when I was forced to watch a goofy unimpressive video and then brought to a home screen with 4 over-the-top decorative buttons to choose from. This version doesn't even load my own profile and I feel like there's way to much going on - so much so that it's hard to know where you are in the app and it's easy to get lost in profiles. It kind of bothered me how prominent the 'add to network' button was and i repeatedly worried that i might hit the button unintentionally and cause confusion on the recipients end. Maybe the intent is to hyper-connect but it's not working for me. Could I be greeted instead with a running list of activity similar to what the Facebook app does? That would be better for me. Linkedin is about knowing what's happening in your professional network and building awareness of self, businesses, and opportunities. It's not the kind of app where I turn it on and then want to decide what I want to do every single time. Instead, it should be showing me what I want to see like a live feed with deep integration into people's profiles IF I'm interested in digging deeper. Meh."
3071,Dominick Gallegos,"April 26, 2012",3,"If you can get past the login screen...it's great! I would've given this app a 4 or even 5 star review if I didn't get kicked out of the app 4 times as I tried to login.  On my new iPad, I was already logged into the older iPhone LinkedIn app and selected update from the iTunes store. After installing, I entered my credentials and logged in....I was able to get a quick view of the new home page each time i logged in but was quickly booted out of the app...on four different occasions. To overcome the issue and the reason I'm able to give this review is because on my fifth attempt I logged in and the split second before I was kicked out I was able to pick on the profile icon and overt my subtle ejection.  After logging into the application I must say that it is great to finally see that this app the way it's supposed to be on an iPad. I like the integration with my calendar and also liked the quasi-Flipbook like function that shows users posted articles or content by flipping the app from the right to the left.  After the problem I mentioned earlier I could see giving this app some where closer to 4 stars...there is always room for improvement. :-)"
3072,WARRZONE,"December 28, 2014",2,"Sneaky Info Thief Besides the fact that the app has not been updated and looks bad on my 6 Plus, I could not get past the set-up page with the ""Continue"" button that wanted to upload my address book to the LinkedIn servers. There might have been a decline button under the ""Continue"" button, but I couldn't tell because my keyboard kept popping up and getting in the way. Luckily, I read most of the stuff I agree to, so I clicked on ""Learn more"" to see what I was clicking ""Continue"" for. I don't mind sharing a small amount of my contact information on LinkedIn, but there is no way I am uploading all of my contacts' info. That's a betrayal of trust. With all the recent data breaches, it makes me even more cautious. Needless to say, I force quit the app without continuing."

3074,Jim VanDev,"June 1, 2015",4,"It's All Up To You To Make It Work To Its Full Advantage LI provides an opportunity to connect on a fairly astounding level , however it is up to the user to use it proactively to truly maximize its potential. Proactive reach outs, personalizing reach out messages, being active in initiating and participating in group discussions are necessary to get any results . However I feel that major changes to the tool such as not including user's new connections on the update feeds is not customer friendly and not a great idea overall. More options in settings should be configured. Also, there are too many challenges in the effectiveness and usability with InMail ---- ie, requiring knowledge of a person's email address (of course we all know the week around!); also I would like to see additional filters on Contacts such as being able to sort by more intricate industry filters, past employers/organization affiliations, etc. The app needs more features that the main site has , all along the lines of what I have noted here already ."

I did my best to resolve this by coming back to the module but with no positive results.

This app was convenient for me and the font was legible, but the frustration is not worth it.  I have the app installed on my iPod Touch but that's buggy and crashes often and takes a long time to refresh and execute commands. I've just installed the mandatory iOS update on my iPod Touch, so maybe that may help the crash/freeze issues there.

Only a few have used the contact info to cold call me for sales so most respect my request. I simply delete any connections who abuse my contact info. The articles posted by other members are very informative and helpful. I look forward to posting some helpful insights from my industry for my connections to benefit from. I highly recommend Linkdin for any who want another helpful avenue to expand their business reach. "
3083,UserExperienceRocks,"March 15, 2015",3,"Nice design but buggy and missing key functionality I appreciate the design of Linked-In's app, but it has consistently been buggy the entire time I've used it (e.g. screens not loading, loading incorrectly, messages not going through, etc.) The most recent example was a message not going through from one of my contacts, which was surprising. Also, perhaps I haven't found it, but I can't find where I'm able to view my sent messages on the app. I can on the desktop experience, and feel like it wouldn't be too terribly hard to do this on mobile. A conversation is between two people, and I only get half of it on mobile, and as a result lose the context of what has been discussed. There's also no indication that I have responded to a message on mobile, so I'm often left wondering whether I've gotten back to the people I've wanted to, and have to go on my desktop to check this."

This approach has led to the development of some very good relationships with contacts. With the current version, I do not receive any notification when an invitee has connected with me! Consequently, I now need to write down the name of every person I've invited, and search through my contact list to see if they've accepted  the invitation. (By the way, who's'Genius idea' was it to alphabetize professional contacts by first name!?) The result: finding out if someone has responded to an invitation is hit and miss and tedious.

LinkedIn has made phenomenal improvements, with providing ideas to connect with your contacts, suggesting ideas to get your conversation started, recommending relevant links that have been found in the news. Quite frankly the best update I have ever seen from this app, all the negative review seem to stem from unexperienced users or ones having technical issues that seem more related to their phones then anything else. If this app is used correctly it can be a very effective business tool, and since this is a professional social networking app it is not uncommon for individuals who have the liberties of posting whatever they choose do so with political comments, however those political topics only alienate themselves from the rest of the community as one reviewer complained, so get over it and keep using the app as it's not to any fault of the creators of the app."

I don't want to. I have no interest in it, and I don't care how much you feel it will change my life. I have an absolute right to make those determinations for myself, and your insistence that I MUST do it could lose this customer. "

This app only allows you to view the current status updates and view your profile or your contacts' profiles. There is no option to view jobs or open positions available through the full linkedin web site. Searching is limited to any updates made on a computer. This includes searching for contacts or people in general, including groups. There are no options to make updates on your phone. This app also allows you to receive messages via push notifications and to reply to messages. I gave it two stars because searching contacts' activities, jobs, and editing my profile and account information on the go are extremely important for me and this app does not offer the options to perform those functions."

3092,HoptownMovieMan,"October 5, 2013",1,"Failures Abound The app would be a nice, professional alternative (and, in some cases, a compliment to) Facebook. Unfortunately, it simply has too many failures.  Notifications repeat without explanation. Eliminating those notifications (on the first or subsequent occurrences) requires drilling down into multiple layers of the UI.  The incessant notifications are painfully annoying and distracting when looking over the phone's home screen containing the App, showing a badge counter that never goes away permanently after 'clearing' the notification within the App.  Adding insult to that injury is the badge count being consistently incorrect.  It will report '14' when I only have 2 notices."
3093,Greatnetworkbadapp,"October 5, 2014",4,"Great network, bad app LinkedIn is an invaluable network, but its app and UX is buggy.  Most frustrating example: When I receive a request to connect via email on my iPhone, I click on an action button in the email message which then triggers a web interface asking me if I would like to download the app - to which my response is no! since I already have the app on my phone.  I wish it would simply open my existing app automatically when I click Accept from within the email message.  At this point, I typically then open my app separately and the app often does not contain the connection request that I received via email.  Yikes!  It's maddening and a waste of time and frustration. With that said, the LinkedIn network and concept is so powerful, I will begrudgingly deal with the challenges of the app itself."
3094,Frequent VoteBlast User,"September 1, 2015",1,"Poor product design! I have noticed many serious issues with LinkedIn. And many of these are not software bugs, though some are. There are many serious design issues that have major negative implications on users (in my case, a paying customer). For example, timestamps of messages sent within LinkedIn and the email messages they generate to users can be substantially different. This is serious, because often the body of email has statements like: ""see you tomorrow"". ""Tomorrow"" can be a different day depending on which notification you look at, within LinkedIn or the email sent by LinkedIn. This very thing happened to me and I caught the issue at the airport, just before boarding the plane to go to a meeting that I though was in a few hours, when in fact it had been the day before! "

However, this recent version is very disappointing.  The circle photos make it much harder to make out the likeness of people as compared to the larger photos available in the previous version.  The contacts list is organized by first name.  For people like me, it much easier and way more functional to manage contacts by last name.  Lastly, the menu set in the previous version was much more intuitive.  This version has options that are hidden and hard to find.  It's as if the developers wanted the platform to more resemble the Facebook app.  Instead they should be focused on how to enhance the user experience to maximize people's use of the app for ongoing business and career development.  I hope the developers are reviewing these more recent reviews to see how improvements can be made prior to the next version release."

On the App, there's only a news feed now and other people's likes, very much just social Facebook or just a news app. This is not useful to find contacts and new jobs, it feels just like a news feed app, not a networking organization anymore, at least on the app, the site is still good. But on the app, important notifications don't show up, like new people to view your profile. Doesn't show who your contacts add as new contacts, which I feel is very important to know to network with people friends and colleagues know and can introduce you to. Constantly tell you, you have updated but all it is, is more news on your feed, not helpful for networking, time management, and finding contacts."

I also enjoy how easy it is to share an update or to write an article and publish it. I am not a professional writer but being able to publish a few pieces on LinkedIn have added to my professional reputaré. I wish the newsfeed was completely chronological but I believe the app has tools to let the user adjust how the newsfeed is sorted, I just haven't used them yet. Overall this is the only app I use for professional networking and I like that it permits for me to separate (somewhat) my professional contacts from my other social media."

I am so happy I did I found the Company I currently working for thru this app and have received many offers in the past few years. I been with Igloo for almost 4 yrs but it is always great to hear there more options if I ever decided to leave and switched careers.

I don't want to just criticize your work but I really want to go back to the old setup and may forgo the new features all together.

If I click yes that I want the app, I am taken to the site to order the app that already have, and so I click open but I just get the home screen. I cannot find the article that I wanted to link to at all. And the only search engine available is to search for people, not articles. And there does not seem to be any easy way to unsubscribe to these annoying emails with links that don't work. Perhaps Linked In could call upon one of their own connections to find someone who can make this app work. Right now it's nothing more than an annoyance."

Not for me and a lot of the other people who have been complaining all over the interwebs. Why can't i update my profile? That seems like a basic function that is most frustratingly missing from this app. I can't even login via my browser because the company INSISTS on making me download the app when I already have it and can't do what I need to with it. How about making the app more functional before blocking users from logging in via browser. Or let us login via browser if you're going to keep the app at its most basic and least functional/useful. The app should be as dynamic as the website or close to it allowing users the basic functions. I think i am going to delete it because it's pointless for me to keep it on my iPad. All it's doing is taking up memory space. I would rate this 0 stars if iTunes would let me.

So I thought I could swipe any direction and I swiped right and that deletes a notification. Not cool. LinkedIn is about real, professional relationships. I don't like that it downplays the connecting by putting so many on the list to add. Since it's also not Facebook, I'm not interested in just adding for the sake of adding. It would have been nicer to see 4-6 people at a time with their title, last position, a LinkedIn article title, or something else that would lead me to PROFESSIONALLY connect with them. I love that the Who's Viewed My Profile shows the graph now, but what is the point if I cannot click and view more details? I also despise that, like Facebook (of course), I am required to have a separate app just to see a freaking group. I'm immensely disappointed in this update and I wish I could revert back. I have no need for this - I already have Facebook."

I have a lot of education and many different skills and abilities, and I am lacking  in job experience, but, I am not lacking in knowledge or know how. I recommend this app to anyone who is seeking new employment or just wanting to connect with the other genres and learn some things!

I liked it and read though about 1/3 of it at what point i was interrupted. I haven't noted the author nor the subject.  It was about hiring an A-class employee.  Now as I went into the app a few days later, it briefly showed me the page I was reading, then refreshed to the Home without ever asking. I cannot find the article by scrolling the posts. The search function is useless.   Very disappointing, LinkedIn!  Your UI and for functionality never made a complete sense to me. The way your app is designed just proves the point.

They label themselves as sales and marketing experts, but selling government phones to financially challenged people is nowhere near real selling and marketing. But, I blame LinkedIn for allowing companies that don't really offer anything to potential employees. Companies should be screened first or at least have some type labeling that says ""Legitimate"".

How silly is that.  Can barely participate in discussions.  Comments don't post, and exiting the app and coming back in, or tapping somewhere else in the app (both usually by accident) kicks you off your location in the discussion/comments, and you have to start the process all over again.

It also doesn't refresh my newsfeed so the same stories have been in my feed for a week and the new ones aren't loading. This is a huge disappointment because this was one of my favorite apps and now it is useless. I will say that if I go through safari and use the browser settings it is okay.

It is the frequently and automatically displayed list of suggested new contacts, some or many of which have already have been my connections.

I have been on LI for at least five years, and it was my favorite app. It was easy to connect with professional associates, easy to keep track of LI friends changes in status; and connection requests were easy to find; easy to message; easy to get in touch with my LI friends. It was just a simple app with most of what I needed right at my fingertips! I used to be able to see how many LI contacts I had and to check on their status with two taps or clicks....So what happened to my favorite app? This is a huge disappointment!!! In order to find everything I used before, I now need at least two different LI apps...maybe even three. Change is wonderful, but in this case LI messed up. This new and ""improved"" app cheapened the product by giving the user far less than what the old app offered. I wouldn't recommend downloading this LI app. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I AM ABOUT TO DELETE LI FROM MY PHONE AND MY LAPTOP!!!"

I don't understand why it was necessary to take something simple and make it unnecessarily difficult and cumbersome, but the reviewer who suggested the old Windows Vista team designed it may be on to something. One of the things I particularly don't like is that updates like work anniversaries and new jobs no longer show up in the timeline. Also, once you review them under ""My Network"" you can't get back to them. All you are left with is a list of  ""People you may know"". If I haven't added them, they are not in my network. These two items should not be grouped together. This update was a big disappointment and I am writing this review in the hopes that they will make some changes."

With the App you have it on the go. It is nice to get a notification when people send you requests or messages. Since this is a professional network you want to see the updates and take action quickly. Yet since it id not like face book you don't get to many notifications to where it becomes annoying. Overall I like the App very much but the only problem I have with it is that the search engine on the app is not as good and responsive as the website. I would have gave it 5 stars otherwise. Hopefully they fix this in future."

In addition, I'd like to be able to see my recent activity and deep dive into my profile views stats.

I have not been able to post to LinkedIn for well over a week now. This is completely unacceptable. If you're wondering why the amount of posts you are receiving has gone down so much, it's because your app extension is broken. FIX IT ALREADY!!!! Also, just FYI, the LinkedIn iPad app still leaves a lot to be desired, and does not give you an accurate profile view, because it does not show all the same info that even the iPhone app, or web interface does.

When I click a link in an e-mail notification, it opens a screen asking if I want the app, if I say no, nothing happens, it stays forever trying to open the mobile version of linked in, and if I say yes it opens app store and then I can click open, which will launch the app but in the regular home page, not in the link or section I was intending to read.

This is unlike some apps that don't recognize or connect with the mail links.

The service is required for basically anyone who wishes to progress up into the corporate world. That being said, this app needs help. While the interface is well designed and pleasing to the eyes, it contains several flaws. A major flaw being that I can not edit my profile at all on this app (and if there is a way, it's not explicit on where without requiring a heavy amount of google searching). On a website in which it is essential to update your profile information on a regular basis in order to let other potential employers about your skills, availability and contact information, it seems that should have been the first thing they made sure was easily accessible to all users, both new and old."

I do wish there were more filtering type options in the jobs portion of the app. For profiles, I wish there was an option in the experience section to deal with being a contractor as many of us are. We should be able to state our employer and list the projects, companies, or accounts that we work on while being able to associate with their logo. Today, most of us state that we worked there, which is a misrepresentation, but we want the association. Other than that, it just grows on you the more you use it."

However, the new interface of LinkedIn is so poorly designed with such bad usability I wish I hadn't upgraded. The previous couple of GUI redesigns on iOS were poor but this new I think sets a new standard for poor screen layout and usability. I sadly find the My Network page, which I use most often on my mobile, particularly confusing and difficult to use, with all the overlapping notification taps that you have to discard individually. What were they thinking!! I am finding myself using my LinkedIn iOS App less and less and just waiting to get to my laptop, which defeats the purpose of the App in the first place. They clearly missed the whole idea of iOS simplicity and usability."

Given how much I work from my phone and read/review sites like LinkedIn during my downtime when not in front of a computer, I find this lack of functionality/comparability between platforms frustrating.

It will crash repeatedly until something changes on the server side.  Second, the design decision to hide certain key information in the app, such as a contact's email address.

I would say the animations and information architecture are ""clunky"" and confusing to new users especially. There are a lot of extraneous menus that I don't feel are necessary and it creates a convoluted feeling throughout the app. That being said, it's definitely worth having for the networking alone.

I used this app to check on companies, connections, jobs, and see who has viewed me.

That is a convoluted way to have to do what could be done with a combo box or a selection tree.

People on here giving it poor ratings are clearly looking for another Facebook, which is just not the case.

3187,SamiJean,"January 13, 2016",4,"Great App -  Update has pros & cons Love the linked in app and has always been fairly user and mobile friendly.  Update has some great new features but is harder to find info like people who have viewed your profile. Love the network updates but wish you had the option to like or comment on job updates or anniversaries vs only having the option to send a generic congratulatory message. As someone who recently updated a position I received 55++ messages saying ""congrats hope you're doing well"" from colleagues who most likely wanted to acknowledge the update with something smaller such as a like or comment but app directs you to inbox."
3188,Meg9,"May 4, 2016",2,"New profile layout is awful I was slow to update to this version and as soon as I did, I regretted it. My profile view is completely different than in the previous version. My publications are buried under the courses I've taken in a section called ""accomplishments"" My publications were perfectly happy in their own prominent ""Publications"" section. I'm a writer, so this section was actually one of the more important parts of my profile. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the accomplishments you show (and this section was also buried under the useless skills and endorsement section. "
3189,Abr42,"June 7, 2017",2,App crashing all the time I am using this app in my iphone 7 plus now. Last month had a problem the app was not opening. Everytime I tried to open it crashed. Then I got annoyed and uninstalled it.  Then install it again after a week. Cause I needed the app. But the problem I face then was the app was not aigning in.  Even after trued opening a new account.  Then tried for another week and then it got an update addressing some issues and bugs. After that it was okay. Then again from last friday the app started crashing again. When I press the app icon it shows the page with the linkedin logo and crashes. Every time.  Just now updated the app again.  But the problem is there. Please do something with the app. Thank you
3190,ShaiWhite,"December 10, 2011",5,"I like the Linked In Site But... There should be a few things added: like FB link on your profile, find connections using your contact list on your phone as well as on FB... And the adding a connection should be easier, instead of having to go search for your friends email in order to send them the invite to connect on LI. I'm just saying the app is made so you have easy access via your mobile, so the application itself should be easy to navigate, and have necessary things added to it... ;) overall love the app, a little improvements would make me happier"
3191,Designer0417,"February 15, 2012",1,"THe app that wont stop bothering you This app wont stop with the push notifications. I personally do not enjoy getting push updates on my phone from any social media app, so I have push notifications turned off. Unnecessary push notifications interfere with whats important - texts and calls, the functions that the phone is meant to do, and the notifications that you actually need. I have checked and double checked every setting, and turned off every notification everywhere, and I still get messages from this app! The most useless push notifications telling me to check out whats new since I last checked out the app a week ago! I had to delete it. this app is very frustrating and annoying, I would not recommend it. Unless you like receiving unnecessary push notifications on your phone."
3192,Flying Forester,"October 28, 2013",1,"Not intuitive or ergonomic. While this app looks good, it's capabilities are pretty shallow. I can't see members of a group I own/manage and I can't approve/decline those that apply to join. I have to go on my computer to do that. I also can not search for LinkedIn members who are not somewhere in my network so when I am out networking and meet someone whom I would like to connect with, I can't search for them unless they are 3rd degree or higher. If there is a way to change that then I haven't found it...which is another problem. The user had NO CONTROL of their app. No options, no versatility.  LinkedIn is a powerful resource for professionals. You would think they could come up with a better app so their members are empowered on their mobile devices as much as they are on their computers. The iPad app is no better!"
3193,MrXiphoid,"May 7, 2014",3,Decent but needs improvement. Probably the biggest flaw of this app is that it does not have the full features of the website.
3194,nemock,"December 8, 2014",3,"Necessary but only ok On the surface this application looks really fancy but the more you use it the more you notice the lack of attention to detail in the user interface. One of the most notable examples is using the email editor from an iPhone. The interface will not allow you to scroll back in a longer message if you need to edit and you cannot turn the phone to its side and get access to the larger iOS keyboard that has cursor key controls and other advanced editor functions.  If your only interest is to send a one or two sentence response to someone, then it's fine. If you want to send a thoughtful, longer email to a contact, you'll need to use the web interface."
3195,Erica9881,"February 17, 2015",4,"Useful way to interact with LinkedIn The app is good for skimming through people's status updates and reading articles they post. And for seeing who has updated profiles and new connections. You can also initiate and accept connection requests, post status updates, comment on others', and ""like"" items. One thing that bugs me though is that when I receive an email from LinkedIn (e.g., a connection request) and I click a link in the email, it takes me to the LinkedIn web app and pops up an alert saying ""Dontcha wanna download the iOS app?"" I already have the iOS app. I wish the email links would take me to the app instead."
3196,DeHoux,"December 4, 2015",1,"Ferociously Bad Update... ...to a perfectly serviceable app.  Why does this update feel like a really poor beta version of a 2010 phone app?  Really? No landscape view anymore?  Why can't I find anything?  And why is this app now ENDLESSLY haranguing me about ""what I HAVE to do"" to improve my profile?  My profile is exactly how I need it to be...shut up and let me get on with it.  What I HAVE to do is delete this app.  For me the utility of 'Linked In' has always been a tenuous one, a bet based on future possibility, whose professional usefulness to me has yet to resolve.  This app update is the death of that possibility. The ball is in your court LINKED IN.  Fire some staff, apologize, and fix this astounding misstep. Give me a reason to not delete my account and succumb to the growing cultural zeitgeist that says that being professionally listed on LINKED IN is a JOKE."
3197,Lappp9,"December 15, 2015",5,"This app is clearly way better than it used to be. Seriously, the old app was garbage as far as usability and design go. The navigation between your profile and your feed was super confusing. It used to show a square with the content of the last item in your news feed as the button to go back to the news feed. That made no sense. Now it's super simple, it's just a tab view. The messaging is also so much better. It used to be a super ugly email rip off and now is basically just messenger for talking to other professionals. Also way way better."
3198,Gekigangar,"May 10, 2016",5,"Good Stuff Great tool to stay in touch with coworkers and clients. I've had the same job forever so I can't speak to its job recruitment abilities. If you want to see what company your coworkers or clients moved to and chase down work or a new job, this app is the one to use. What I've learned in the last 15 years is business is about people not contracts and POs. This app allows you to track and communicate with the people behind the paperwork. Every upper management professional should have this app and a profile on it for maximum exposure and information in the digital future we currently live in."
3199,stuinseattle,"August 19, 2017",5,"LinkedIn is a journey to a better life What an amazing journey LinkedIn is. It's a pathway to reconnect with contacts and clients from the past, make far more new connections, and ultimately, to building the kind of business and professional network that never could have existed in the past.  In particular, LinkedIn has made it possible to connect with readers of my books. The thrill of hearing how something you wrote has changed someone's life is indescribable.  And that is what LinkedIn makes possible.  In fact, it's pretty much impossible to have a career without it today."
3200,Beckster416,"October 3, 2012",5,":) It mayyyyy be the best thing that's ever happened to me. It should be the #1 trusted networking website, if it already isn't. The app is pretty good, you hust have to adjust your ""notifications"", but on your desktop computer, everything is fantastic.*** You must upgrade to get the best of the best! It's not THAT bad. And you can choose when you want to pay, so that's cool. Meaning- You don't HAVE to have the upgraded account forever, you choose when you want to pay for an upgraded account by month. It's awesome! I highly recommend it to job recruiters or job seekers. It helped me a ton. THANKS LinkedIn!!!! Xoxoxo"
3201,Wavelover757,"July 18, 2013",3,"Request for improvements I like the app. It's much better and seems to offer more than the PC version. The complaints I have is about how it works with other parts of the system on an iPad.  Here's what I mean: I receive an alert in my email, from Linked In, that someone has a message for me, or has a change, or is requesting to become part of my network. I click on the link and a screen appears the asks me if I want to get the App.  I have the app already and there's no button to open it. If I press the ""Get the App"" button, it goes to the App Store and there's an Open choice there (after I enter my system passwrd). If I press the ""No"" button, the browser opens. Just not smooth at all."

3204,Jimmy gal,"December 3, 2015",1,You're killing me Holmes It took me a hour of trying to adjust my settings to realize you had changed the mobile app for the worse. Why would you have removed access to my connections contact info that they have selected they are willing to share ? Before I could just click that info and drop them a note in a platform of my choosing not yours. Why would you not allow me to see my connections connections when they've permitted it in their settings ? This limits my ability to extend invites to other people to get connected with me thus limiting the expansion of linked in connections. Why would you force me to use another computing device other than my phone to make these transactions? Perhaps I'm missing something here but it seems like steps backward . Please repair
3205,R1C2H3111,"December 6, 2015",1,"Horrible... Since the update I've really tried to give the changes a chance but I constantly find myself giving up instead. I am a young professional and an avid user of LinkedIn. I tend to use the app much more than the desktop version obviously for reasons of convenience. After the latest update there is information and data I simply cannot find anymore. As for much of the information that is still available I find myself constantly searching for it. Nothing seems to be logical with the new set up. So now, the app I once used for its ease and convenience has become a huge headache. Can you do us all a favor and PLEASE bring the old version of the app back?? On the prior version of the app no data was missing and everything was so easy to find in a LOGICAL location."
3206,Winneroski1,"December 7, 2015",1,Terrible update!!!! What was so broken with the old app that it needed to be fixed?  This new update is absolutely terrible.  LinkedIn -- you are not Facebook and I use each of you differently.  Integrating Connected is a waste.  With 2k + LinkedIn connections I am not close enough to the majority of my connections for Birthdays to matter but that doesn't stop you from serving up dozens of cards a day with Birthday notices and other useless info.  What I do care about as a premium member is who views my profile and with the new update it's impossible to tell how many profile views I have each day.  Not that it matters because since the update my profile views have all but stopped.  The old app was awesome -- now you have a bloated useless app that does everything but what it's supposed to do.  Please change it back!!!!
3207,blake_oistad,"May 23, 2016",4,"Wonderful and necessary I don't write reviews often, so hopefully just my taking time to write this goes to show how important LinkedIn is to me as a tool for professional development. I love that I can keep my professional information updated on LinkedIn, and use that profile to fill out job applications and connect with new peers and acquaintances. The only thing preventing 5 stars for me is the UI, which is nice and easy enough to use, but doesn't strike me as being quick and simple enough; at times it feels a bit busy to me, which seems nitpicky but I want to be honest with my feedback. Essential to my iPhone experience!"
3208,BackNDaDay90,"June 28, 2016",3,"Seniority with Company I love the app. The only issue I have is that there should be a way to show seniority with a company even with position changes. I believe it's natural for anyone at a company that's been there for years to have several roles. LinkedIn doesn't show a person's ability to stay with a company if the person has more than one position. I should be able to select my company and years of tenure so it shows a true work anniversary, then there should be subgroups created for different positions while at the company. No company celebrates a work anniversary from the start of a new position at the same company, they celebrate from the time a person started working at a company."
3209,The Jones Journal,"December 9, 2016",5,"Love it. ""Apply Now"" needs a little TLC The app is wonderfully designed. Very intuitive interface. On the desktop, I use linkedin to apply to jobs. It is a single click process that sends your linkedin info as a resume.  I am a little disheartened that the mobile ios app functionality for this is so clunky. There is no one click apply. When you hit apply it opens a webview where the submit linkedin profile button opens a strange webpage. You can go back from this, but the apply with linkedin feature just doesn't work. Otherwise, love it."
3210,agraham77,"January 30, 2010",3,"Decent, but some functionality probs Works as expected, but a few things that are very annoying. 1) the GUI and widgets break iPhone ui conventions: the inMail should feel like mail. 2) this is horribly annoying: the app allows people to 'send' you their contact info, which they expect you to add to your contacts list. But if you don't want to add them, there's no way to decline! You're bullied into adding them if you want to get rid of the red counter circle. And why would I want to add them anyway, that's what linkedIn is for! Please give is the ability to decline contact addition. 3) these 'themes' merely allow you to change the color of the buttons. Big deal. That's not a 'theme'. But whatever."

Check my groups add friends get suggested friends, the whole nine.  I have to say this has transformed Linked In for me it has made a more professional networking tool instead of a site I only care about when I'm looking for a job.  With this update I can see a real mechanism for building my professional social network while on the go.  This team did an outstanding job and it looks great.  It was well worth the wait."
3212,Michelle.A,"May 22, 2013",1,"Needs a severe overhaul This app is one of the worst I have ever come across.  You cannot update your profile, navigation is frustrating when you have to leap frog through 3 categories which are not exactly intuitive, and you're unable to do, well anything.  Alerts that someone has looked at your profile or any messages received never go away....ever.  Can't delete them either, they overstay their welcome, and like fish quickly begin to stink.  Oh and if you want to read an article, I hope you like cliff-hangers.  You can't open or expand the news stories, but you just wanted the gist of it anyway, right? The design is so limited that it really isn't worth wasting the memory on the app.  You're better off just using the website and dedicating the memory to that album you've been wanting."
3213,HipboneJerome,"September 5, 2013",5,Stay Linked and Informed I'm able to connect to others on a business level rather than personal. This helps me figure my circle of interest to affiliate myself with. That along with reading topics and articles of interest to business growth or strategies is very helpful. And being able to join industry specific groups is a major plus! 
3214,MagicSurf,"November 12, 2013",4,"Pretty good In terms of look and internal navigation, this app is first class. My only little issue with the app is how it works with your email notifications. For example, I get notifications as an email for different articles my ""groups"" post or when people endorse me for things. When I click on the link in my email, instead of taking me to the article referenced in the email, it takes me to the ""home screen"" of the app where I then need to go and search for the article--which honestly, I rarely have the patience to do. I wish it would take me directly to the article. "

The only thing I've noticed the app does not offer is the ability to sort my news feed by most recent rather than what's trending. The website offers this filter and it would be great if the app did too, so I can see what's happening now, and not just the same stories every day. "

3220,ColliewogWakefield,"April 4, 2014",4,"Good content formatting but integration requires work Sequential improvements have seen content displayed and aggregated in useful ways, both for news articles shared and updates to connections' profiles. The level of detail gives the app a more grown up feel than other social media which is appropriate.

This past week I sent several vital messages via the app and they're not there now. To remedy this I went onto the desktop version, grabbed the contacts' emails and took the conversation out of LinkedIn.

It needs to be more organized, the layout doesn't show nearly as many postings as the desktop, and the job relevance is WAYYY off because of the lack of search options.

I say no, but then I can't find any evidence that it did connect me with the person from the email. I can't even find this person in fact. I have to look up his name.

The core functionality, for example,of inviting someone to join your network with a personalized message has been lost.

That's very valuable for many fields..As a LinkedIn member since 2004. The current release is truly unusable. Swiping, re-org'ed UI - but no real product improvements. Lipstick on a pig. This is a classic case of responding to style trends, and forgetting that great products solve problems, remove barriers to opportunity. I used LinkedIn App daily, and now find it completely useless! PLEASE FIX IMMEDIATELY! even a rollback is better than waiting.. Next time, maybe a public beta??"

There is a vast array of knowledge being shared that has enhanced my success. I have received many grant writing requests over the years. The application also can assist professionals looking for employment. I am very pleased with their customer service...very helpful. Truly a remarkable device. I recommend that you partake in the LinkedIn experience! You will not be disappointed.

Make sure you put a professional photo if yourself and take the time to build a complete profile. In the beginning you're tempted to accept every invite for numbers sake. If they sell a product you don't want, reject the invite. Block your contacts so people don't raid your list and bombard your friends with spam. The premium option is pricey. Take the free trial and determine for yourself if it's worth it. I use LinkedIn daily, it's an important part of my toolkit."

No in-app notification, no view of ""Fred Bloggs'"" profile - nothing. I can't even view my new connections in the app. And it shows me events from months ago. "

This is because there is no intermediate step just click and they get a request to connect without any confirm.  I actually prefer to log in through the browser rater than use the application.  Seems like they are trying too hard, but not delivering anything special for iPad.  I deleted from iPad today due to annoying connection issue and did not see why I needed."

3338,Slynnen,"December 12, 2015",1,Unable to download since new release Let me start by saying I love LinkedIn. Unfortunately their iPad app is terrible. Even before the new release I thought the app was not well thought out for a typical user. A typical user like me wants to search for jobs but on the iPad app this functionality was very limited and frustrating. Since the release I am unable to download the app at all and it has nothing to do with space as I have a 64GB. I am surprised that a company like LinkedIn would produce an app of this caliber. Their desktop experience is really the only way to use this site. This really limits usability and opens the door for another site to sneak in. I will say their job app for iPhone is great. I wish they would release that for iPad.
3339,Kris_RRT,"January 20, 2016",2,"New App Update concept is great but not working well at all!! I like what LinkedIn is trying to do with its latest drastic update by attempting to making it more user friendly but it was a drastic change in which users don't know where to find things as easily (such as, how to endorse without going to someone's profile). The idea of the instant messenger is great but it is the greatest problem of all! A lot of messages are delayed, or does not alert that they have you have one or in general very slow to respond. Hopefully these will be fixed in the very near future since many are considering (if not already) deactivating their accounts due to their frustration."

If you find someone listed through, say, a google search, it often requires you to sign back into the App when it is already open, and then frequently deletes the search so you have to type the search back in.  There must be a fix."

The share capabilities are sub par and less than the mobile version, the profile editing is non existent, and the performance is still a memory hog and crashes the app, if you go too deep in the browsing.

That's what character counters are for.  I don't particularly care for its navigation arrangement, but  I've become used to it in a tolerant sort of way. The thing to keep in mind is, LI is probably not terribly worried about the app. They know folks will tolerate enough to stay with the service.

I'd be on LinkedIn more if it was more streamlined in this respect. Thanks."

3374,BobbyMoBetta,"September 15, 2015",2,"Much to be desired As far as functionality, the LinkedIn app lacks much in general functionality and/or leaves a lot to be desired in terms of intuitively accessing different aspects of the network. Rather than being a useful tool for accessing settings and updating your profile, the app is clogged with less-than-important notifications and doesn't make it easy to see your own profile or interact with any groups you might be part of. I'd really like to see a major overhaul to this app. To remain a major player in social media AND become a more credible job search portal, the mobile version has to really improve its ease of use."
3375,Frustrated Tech Savvy,"October 2, 2015",3,Why are the connections so difficult?? I get 10-15 emails everyday about asking me to connect. It would be so much more user friendly if I could sign onto the website or App and connect with all of them at once or at least on one page. It takes too long to respond to each individual email. This may already be a function and I just can't figure it out?! But if that is the case it brings me to another point of the website and app not being very user friendly. I like to consider myself a very tech savvy person as I work for a telecommunications company.

I want to look through my connections connections but it doesn't seem to give you that option. You also can't see all of the groups you belong to. Just the top 3?  That's annoying. I think you guys need to do a thorough functionality check. If you need to slim things down, don't let it be by only providing partial views of things.  If you're trying to promote your suite of apps, don't do so by limiting functions in the main app. That's just irritating. I don't really want 5 linked in apps on my phone. Sorry."

I have never allowed LI to sync with my email. I have triple checked all settings and permissions. After researching and seeing other people with the issue it appears the app is the source of the problem. The apps built in permissions allow it to data mine your phone for contacts. It's gross and the app was immediately deleted from my phone."

I mean come on... what isn't considered a business in this world? Practically anything is a business. This app has a similar feel to Facebook except without all the tedious hassle of posting about how your feelings are getting the best of you, or deciding what selfie you should post that will get the most attention. This mainly for serious business people."

It would also be nice if my email links for LinkedIn actually took me to the app rather than open a page in Safari.  It would also be nice if I could see everything that my online profile has.

The differences in experiences between the iPad, iPhone and my desktop or laptop used to bug me however I've look at each experience as an environmental thing. I've learned that each has its own operating limitations and that I don't expect something to do what it wasn't designed to do. Right now it works great for my needs."

However, added is the ability to remove a connection.  Therefore you can take away connections but not build your network.  Seems like they are moving in the wrong direction to me.  Seriously looking at Spiceworks (IT industry) or Doximity (Healthcare) as new platforms to network since LinkedIn doesn't survey its members for advice and makes bad AppDev decisions like removing key functionality."

I wish I could use LinkedIn mobile app for reading business and economics news, but I have to turn to facebook instead because the experience is more enjoyable, although it also makes me see stuff that people post.

Turns out they are buried a few clicks away in a spot that is not at all intuitive. Why not have a direct link to them?  Aren't the connections themselves the main freaking point of this whole exercise?  Your app has gone from something I used sometimes to something I almost never touch because it is so frustrating."

I have a LinkedIn account that I use frequently via browser, and I have the LinkedIn app, too, but it's ridiculous (and frustrating) that every time I'm on my iPad and click a LinkedIn link, it takes me to a promo page to ""get the LinkedIn app"" instead of recognizing that it's already installed and just following the link.  The net effect is that I can never follow LinkedIn notification links in email (browser or app-based, Gmail and Yahoo) or feature links on webpages on my mobile device."

I end up having to go onto safari and use LinkedIn via the web because the app cannot address all of my needs. If this isn't fixed I am just going to delete the app and use the web, which is great, but if you're going to make an app, make it useful for things other than just checking the status of your profile."

I went to the help page on their website and it didn't match either the app or website and now I've just connected with everyone I didn't want to with my limited number of invitations (that limited number being 3000).

When I got to LinkedIn, I had to tilt my head to the left at a 90 degree angle because apparently they forgot that adaptive UI design includes both portrait and landscape orientations.  It got worse from there, the intuitive navigation has been replaced with a few buttons, which definitely looks cleaner, but makes finding anything you are used to navigating to a real big chore.  As a professional marketing person, I would suggest two words - test groups.  I certainly won't be using LinkedIn on my iPad.  Hope they fix these issues soon."

When one clicks off of an emailed link, a screen pops up to give one the option  to download the app or indicate 'no thanks'. There's no 'I already have the app'-option. This needs to be integrated. Also, why do I have to log in so much? My phone is password-protected. Having to type the password in every time is too much friction. I also hate that there's no password reminder within the app. The in-app functionality is annoyingly limited. Also, LinkedIn itself may need to disambiugate universities. Today I received a news bit about Washington U, the private school in St. Louis. I actually attended the U of Washington -- the land-grant institution with Seattle main campus. Pretty bad."

It crashes on a daily basis. I have not experienced this with any other app. More frustrating, however, is having to use the full site on a daily basis, as the app (and often, even the mobile site) lacks a number of functions - recommendations, customizing a connection request message, modifying group settings, etc etc...

I now get at least two or three LinkedIn acceptances a week from so-called ""invites"" that I sent out – none of which is true! LinkedIn basically invades your mail server to find new addresses to invite to you. If you've ever given LinkedIn permission in the past to access your contacts, you are screwed forever. There is no way of stopping this from happening now – except for a class action lawsuit that has been filed against LinkedIn. It can be embarrassing, or downright harmful to business, when LinkedIn decides to invite anyone in your contact list – especially if they are the opposing party in a lawsuit. Beware!!"

Seriously, for an iPad app it's subpar at this point in the app's life cycle that it does not have almost full desktop type features. I gave 2 stars just for the ease of use and decent (although the layout could be better). The app is almost pointless except that it's easier to read profiles and news on the iPad rather than iPhone.

The only thing I wish it had was a way to completely unlink yourself from a person. Unfortunately, people are starting to post political, racial, religious, etc content more and more.

It looks like something designed by a Facebook person - updates are readily available but your contact list is nowhere to be found; looks flashy but hard to use. If I want Facebook and friends I will go there, I use LinkedIn to maintain my business contact and news about who connected who is not helpful - finding the right person is much more important. Unless you are attempting to brake the number of friends record - again, Facebook territory."
3421,corianderbunlet,"July 17, 2012",2,"Not glitchy, just inadequate I haven't experienced any of the glitches mentioned by other reviewers, but I do feel that the app's design fails in some significant ways.  There is no way to show or access groups you belong to from the main page.  If a group doesn't have a recent discussion, you can't get to it.  There is no way to search for anything other than a person.  Want to look for a job posting?  Out of luck.  Want to find a thread about a specific subject?  Out of luck.  Want to locate a group and see who the members are?  Out of luck.  As it stands, it's a good tool for adding people to your network and not much else."

The articles don't load. Not sure what's going on but would love to see these quirks fixed. My usage drastically reduced once Twitter removed the hashtag integration and w/the tablet app being barely functional it feels pointless to continue using LI.

Or quickly reviewing who know know from a certain company when you're in a meeting discussing a potential client or partner or threat. The current app focuses too much on content, which is not LinkedIn's core value proposition. I spend at least 2 hours on LinkedIn every day, but less than 2 minutes of it is on the iPad.

Red indicators are for things you need to act upon. In the app, focus on messages and connection requests.  I'll find all the other updates if and when I have time to peruse my network feed.

So when I see the app icon saying it's got 9 messages waiting for me, and I open the app, and there's actually none, I usually just quit the app and forget about it."

I kept the groups app (hate apps that make you download 4-6 other apps when they could figure out better options for switching between functions). LinkedIn will never change.

Of course LinkedIn would like to generate revenue from their product so if you want a better interface and product offering you will need to upgrade your account.

The portrait only viewing is ridiculous and I sincerely hope the developers will pay attention to what is being said on these reviews and go back to the original version. Maybe then I'll come back.

This is horrible and might be a Harvard Business case review one day in MBA classes as an example of a company making a massive wrong decision and then not listening to their customer base.

3504,Vesalius' nephew,"October 4, 2014",1,Invite function broken In the mobile app there was once a very handy way to invite people if you just met them and had their business card. This functionality has inexplicably disappeared. I have contacted LinkedIn support and have received no satisfactory answer to this problem. I have a big stack of business cards from recent meeting where I cannot add these people as connections. This function was probably the single most useful function in LinkedIn without it LinkedIn is nearly USELESS. I don't think anyone at LinkedIn is paying the slightest attention to this because I am not the only one complaining about this now busted feature.
3505,hplax09,"September 30, 2015",1,"Beware of email data mining LinkedIn is clearly using this mobile app to mine my gmail account. Today LinkedIn suggested I connect to someone in the ""people you may know"" area that I had recently emailed only once and I have no mutual LinkedIn connections with. To be clear, I have never allowed LinkedIn to connect to my gmail or retrieve my contacts. The only things that have access to my gmail (per gmail's security site) is iOS and my iPhone. So the only way LinkedIn could have suggested I connect with this person is if it is using this LinkedIn iPhone app to mine through my gmail. LinkedIn shows a blatant disregard for my privacy and I have lost all trust in them."

About 50% of the time I try to to respond to a message in my inbox, I can't send my message out. It just says that it's failing to send and that there's a connection problem. As a result, I  have to go into my desktop version on my Chrome App and then access and send my LinkedIn message from there. I'm on full wifi bars here, so I know it's not a network wifi issue."
3507,Freerangechowhound,"January 6, 2016",4,"LinkedIn for professionals It's a great starting point in your networking phase of marketing. You still need to reach out and connect, write and attach relevant articles, join relevant groups and in general, market yourself to your potential clients, employers and vendors. It should be mandatory for all graduating students to build their on screen personas. Connect to people who can improve your career. And learn things by reading some of the posts. Great for researching people and companies. And, if you do it right, get headhunted."
3508,Dean0:-),"April 3, 2016",2,"LinkedIn App is OK, sometimes annoying I slightly prefer the full LinkedIn Web site. You can really struggle trying to navigate through the same information on this mobile application. What really lowers my opinion of the mobile is the incessant requests to Link to all my contacts stored on my phone. For quick tasks such as accepting Link request the app is fine. Also, the Web version is constantly being ""improved"" with often times mystery navigation added. Both the Web and mobile application are getting annoying to use. LinkedIn should fire their UI staff."
3509,PhilliesFan555,"January 22, 2017",1,"Segregating the features into app ruined it for me Having to view 4 apps to get done all of the different tasks I need to do just kills LinkedIn for me now. So disappointed with this app. I also keep getting errors when trying to refresh my network on this app. I can't search for people not in my network if I don't go to the discover app and trying to look through jobs at a glance is painful!!! If the average user only uses 5 apps daily how you do expect your 4 to make the top 4 out of 5?! Short term. Please fix the network settings to stop the errors!! Long term. Tear down these app walls and bring the app back into one! It's 2017, no need for this segregation."

It seems like it loses my login almost every day I get a notification to open it. I turned off background app refresh but it's  still happening. This wouldn't be as bad if it used touch ID but for people that don't have touch ID it would still be a problem. This behavior doesn't make me feel more secure using the app, it just makes me irritated and use the phone app less."

It's not just bad as in ""I'll have to learn some new features"" but rather it's bad as in ""I've been using the new app for several weeks and I still don't get what the heck happened!"" Every time I open it I cringe. It's not intuitive, it's not user friendly, and everything that was awesome about the app before is now hidden, changed for the worse, or simply gone. It's one useful feature is that opening the new LinkedIn on my phone serves as a stark reminder  to me to get on my laptop if I want to effectively use LinkedIn in any manner."
3515,Myswerveon,"February 12, 2016",3,"Could be better Don't give me wrong, this is a great application for using LinkedIn on the go. My main issue with this app is the fact that whenever you click a LinkedIn email link, this program wants to hijack the web traffic by asking you if you want to open it in the app. Whenever you say yes, it will take you to your updates/news feed, no matter what. It won't take you to the message or profile link you clicked on; it only redirects you to the app, leaving you with a disjointed user experience."
3516,oaj1977,"August 18, 2016",3,"Overall great app but why so BIG Fast, fluid, intuitive. Biggest complaints would be not being able to view a profile (or ANYthing for that matter) in a browser format instead if the app, I.e., ""view this profile in..."".  Second complaint would be not providing an option to customize a LinkedIn request message (or even giving you an ""are you sure you way to send?"" feature)."

However, when I open the app any click on the notifications icon on the menu bar, on occasion, the notification screen does not reflect the new connection (it's almost always outdated). If the app fails to load the notification the first time, it won't ever load the notification, it does not update or refresh the notifications feed. Why does it do that?"

3519,Photosil,"June 29, 2017",4,App works nicely The application works nicely and I feel linked in is improving in content and usefulness. Articles by influencers are often well thought out and appropriate for a work social media environment.  The canned congrats and thank you messages are a little stiff but with time people will get a bit more creative. A couple years ago I thought there was no point being on linked in. Now I think the platform has a relevant future as the professional social platform.

Unfortunately, after using LinkedIn through a browser, there are many - too many - differences and the app is significantly less robust.  Never mind the periodic crashes.

However, you need to make it easier to delete contacts both on the website version as well as the iPad application.

The feed is an incoherent mess and the 'My Network' interface is horrendous. The profile page is pretty bad too. I understand that there is a learning curve when it comes to apps being redesigned but this is unacceptable especially being a LinkedIn premium member and dishing out $50+ per month.

One would think that with the increased real estate of the iPad Pro or phablets that LinkedIn would be tempted to up their game. LinkedIn has obviously not thought it is worth the effort to make it a serious contender for the role that competes with the desktop version. It continues to lack the options of its big brother.

It reminds me of eBays first application 4 years ago, and since then eBay has had 3 major design overalls for the better. It's time for LinkedIn to stop ignoring this application.

Also notifications don't seem to be working for me on iPhone the same as on iPad. Altogether not bad, but nothing like the polish of some other first party social media apps, like Twitter."

Like, including people that gmail saved because we were on the same email chain a couple of times or contacts I am not in touch with.  I am seriously irked with LinkedIn right now.  I wish they weren't always trying to trick me into do doing their job of recruiting members... This was certainly a sneaky way to do it!"

It prioritizes stuff I just don't care about -- like notifying me it's the birthday of a former colleague, then forcing me to interact with it to clear the notification. Yuck! Meanwhile, I can't find things I used to check daily. The whole UX is a tremendous downgrade -- sorry, I'm sure you worked hard on it, but what was clear is now confusing, and worse, its off-putting.

The first feature is the ability to customize your connection request, personal notes are so much better than the general ""I'd like to add you to my network."" The second feature that is missing is the ability to recommend someone. Other than that, I like the app."
3643,neilirium,"August 2, 2013",3,Pretty but limited. Overall the app is sleek and has a great look and feel. However there is limited functionality (like managing endorsements) on the app vs. the webpage and I think this is a flaw. One should have as much profile editing capability on the app as on the site (maybe sans deleting your account). I also agree that it's annoying when I follow a notification link from an email it takes me to the iPhone browser and not the app itself. Would give this 4/5 with improvements.
3644,Business_Insurance,"September 5, 2014",2,"Corrections must be made! Application needs to be fixed to address this bug: when leaving a comment on someone's post, app permits view of only single raw. Since apple's keyboard on iPad does not have cursor buttons, user can't see text beyond first about 65 characters. So, if you need to backspace a few characters, you don't see what you're deleting. Also, stupid ""send"" button hangs over text line you type partially covering a few words. "
3645,Kelly Kem,"December 14, 2015",4,"Do not ruin your app Of course there were quirks in the prior version, but I shouldn't have violated the mantra:  ""Always read reviews first."" When the updated app wouldn't open after 3 attempts, reading reviews comes too late to undo. I had to delete and re-install before it would open. I will keep it on my iPad only for notifications, and hope the next update might restore its usefulness. Giving one star, as it is the minimum."
3646,Cynber,"December 24, 2015",1,"Failure This has probably become one of the worse apps EVER!  That, on top of the fact you can no longer filter the postings (so you have to page through all the inane postings before seeing what the people you are actually linked to are doing) makes LinkedIn, unfortunately, one step away from being deleted from my iPad and out of my life.  I used to like LinkedIn because it was NOT one of those stupid social media sites/apps, but now they've given in to social pressure and money, so that it's nothing more than a Facebook/blog site for professionals."

Again not a critical flaw, just more annoying than anything."

I have never been more frustrated with LI then I have these past few months with what you've touted as a big deal mobile app upgrade.  It's become unintuitive and impossible to find info easily and quickly.  It seems to be the case from mobile to the web site overall.  I'm not feeling the connections, I'm seeing updates which are not relevant and push info I do not need.  I'm considering dumping my $80/mo subscription now.  Big step backwards."

I enjoy reading the publishings and interacting with subject matter experts, I potentially otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to do so."
3657,Ivonnemillan,"November 3, 2016",4,"Great I really like LinkedIn because it is a way to connect with like-minded professional people. I read articles and news related to my career, connect with people whom I have worked for or leaders in my field, and search for employment opportunities. I have actually had people contact me for an interview because they saw my LinkedIn profile and felt I was a good candidate. Overall, I enjoy having a professional digital social networking profile."
3658,Enriquebush,"March 30, 2017",5,"Excellent First off it's very rare to run into any bugs, I'm still a college student so I have practically no job experience, so my options are very limited, but if you have job experience I highly recommend this app. I've been at my current part-time job for nearly a year and I applied on linked in, every now and than they'll have some practical part-time jobs."

Meanwhile, I look rude, because it's been over a week and I haven't responded to this message yet. Please fix the messaging feature soon. The site is great, but the whole point of having an app is for immediate access to the site; if that doesn't work, the app is pointless."

3661,bwehner,"May 24, 2012",3,"Good Interface, Functionality Needs Improvement As far as the interface of the app goes, it's a very clean interface that is simple to navigate. The biggest thing lacking from the app is the ability to edit anything. The website is clustered and difficult to use, but it's the only way to update anything. This app is a great way to view information that is already posted, but would be much more useful if it had the ability to update information."

It should be easier to identify/add people through the search function though (level off connection, invitation)."

News stories show up as a thumbnail on one screen, but when you navigate to read the article, they're gone.   Email messages, contacts & other communication tools don't refresh or won't reopen a second time.  No way to update profile, find new connections, or to use the tool socially.  This is a prime example of a company taking a web application & thinking it will work on a smartphone - without considering the varied use-case of a mobile user!"
3665,nicoftime53,"October 1, 2013",1,"Lack of functionality I'm typically happy with the apps I use, but I had to write a review to point out how horribly designed this app is. LinkedIn service is great, but this app cuts it off at the knees and ruins the entire experience. Just opening it to read and delete a LinkedIn message is cumbersome, confusing, and annoying. There's a serious lack of optimization to the iPad screen size (iPhone version is ok, not great). But the worst is how little you can do in the app, almost everything (including basic settings changes) requires a full browser. There's just so much potential for this app, it's depressing to see it go to waste!"

It goes to a web browser and asks you to login to view content. That negates the point of having the app. Secondly, when you click 'connect' with someone, it doesn't let you edit the message. It sends the default message which makes me look like an idiot, especially if the connection is just an acquaintance. Finally, I have never heard of anyone who got hired through linkedin making it an useless app by all definitions."

At that point I have to go searching for them in the search bar which is annoying!"
3669,Noel Davila,"July 13, 2015",4,"Great but there's room for improvement I love LinkedIn. I use it every day and it's become an indispensable tool to connect with other professionals in my field. The only complaint I have is that work samples are not viewable from this app, only from the desktop version.

3672,Moble user,"September 2, 2014",3,"Great within app, but lacks linking from email I want to give this app additional stars.  It works well when opening and using the app.  Unfortunately it doesn't open from email links.  Instead, I have to log into the app, then find the thing I was interested in reading.  Other social media apps link automatically, so not having this functionality is frustrating, ultimately only half the time I actually read an article I'm interested in because of this issue."
3673,PacificRy,"September 23, 2014",5,"Nice, but limited features I like the new-ish design. Makes the app enjoyable to use. However, I'd like to see more functions added, especially to the iPad app. "
3674,SweetGirlVirginia,"January 1, 2015",1,"Very Disappointed I downloaded this app to help me stay connected on my phone. Unfortunately, immediately after downloading this app I discovered it had also installed malware. Every time I opened a page in Safari, it immediately directed me to the App Store to download Kim Kardashian's app instead of opening my desired website. After I uninstalled this, I could visit any site in Safari. Heads up LinkedIn- don't include a virus or malware in your programs. I was very disappointed that such a seemingly reputable company would include this in their app- knowingly or not, LinkedIn, you should test things like this before you release anything."
3675,T0rvick,"May 5, 2015",5,Most efficient networking app I've been impressed with the options this app has available for free and premium users. It keeps my business contacts all well connected and has even brought my personal friends into relation with some of my business contacts and opened up opportunities for them which I feel has been the most rewarding.
3676,Telecom_Prof,"December 10, 2015",1,"Janitor This new version is terrible - I can't view my contacts and is very hard to maneuver through. This reminds me of a bosses unfavorable nephew putting something together but published for family reasons just so he could have a ""job"" . Well he's done a good job because I for see a mass exodus of people using LinkedIn unless this gets fixed real soon. I down loaded LinkedIn because it was a professional link and easy to use. If it's not easy to use I can just as easily delete it from my smartphone and use something else to connect with my contacts. I'd say LinkedIn better get it fixed soon or ""bye bye""."
3677,Starbucksdeacon,"April 24, 2016",2,"Stop Repeating the Information I Ask You to Delete When I hit delete an update, I'd really like to never see it again. Your script tells me you are going to remove it, but you don't. I don't care if my other contacts like it or forward it, once I've seen something one time and made a decision on what to do with it, I never want to see it again. I spend 90% of my time on Linked In deleting the same stuff over and over. 8-10 times a day for weeks and weeks. You need to stop the madness. One delete and please let me never see it again."
3678,AlexMMain,"October 14, 2016",4,Searching for Contacts by Location Needed I really like the recents redesigns and upgrades you have made to the app but one problem I keep finding is that I don't have a way on how to find my contacts within my network by location thru mobile app and allow me to create a temporary list to message. This is critical for those who travel and want to leverage their network the most by being in another city.

It has frozen on me a couple of times when browsing updates.  Some big misses in my opinion: should have a way to browse through contacts quicker (i.e. quick first letter browser/slider); should have access to contact's classification/groups; messages only shows inbox but no send messages; should be able to edit profile."

This has been my experience with the LinkedIn app.  I'm a fairly patient person, willing to page through ephemera to find what it is that I'm looking for, but on more than one occasion, I find myself signing out of LinkedIn until I'm at a desktop or on my iPhone rather than attempt to navigate via my iPad.  It's really a mess, particularly when it comes to trying to find particular contact updates that aren't among the very latest postings."

For example, the ability to change a profile picture from a phone should be a big deal, but it seems that you cannot change the picture at all.  This means that you must connect the phone to the computer, transfer files over, and update the picture from the computer, making the process much more complicated than it could be."

It accepts my email and password but then requires me to match a text picture to continue.  I match it every time yet it says it does not match.  Please make the bad men stop.  All I want you to do linkedIn is go the f!&k away!!!!  Why are you immune from the requirement to have a simple unsubscribe.  Now I have gone from simply wanting to unsubscribe from emails to having a personal vendetta against your company!!!
3688,artfoundry,"October 24, 2013",3,"Overall ok but one major bug App is fine in most cases, but I just discovered a really annoying bug. If you try to edit your summary, the current text isn't copied into the text edit field, so unless you write out your entire summary again along with the changes, whatever you do type in there will overwrite what's there. And to make it worse, you can't even select and copy the current text to paste it in the field to edit. So that feature is pretty much useless."

The biggest improvement I would suggest, however, is better integrating the app with the email newsletters.

If I didn't want to add contacts to my LinkedIn before, why would I know? Or in any future updates! Just let me do it through settings on my own time.

3694,Walrusmt,"May 28, 2015",2,LinkedIn is awesome-app still not so much It would be great if the app was linked to the update emails linkedin sends out. On my pc if I get an update email I click the link and it takes me there. On the app when I click the email link it takes me to the linked in login screen and then into my profile. I don't expect full functionality in an app- they're really just for checking updates and such. But taking care of this would get 5 stars.
3695,e2g2,"June 25, 2015",1,"LinkedIn Web Services are Terrible As an FYI to all the non-geeks, the reasons that you need to wait 45-90 seconds to complete most actions in the LinkedIn iOS app are due to their own systems (their API's and Web Services). An application / service that depends as much on mobile usage should ideally invest in bolstering their mobile functionality, but my assumption is that their budgets aren't prioritized in that way. Desktop, NOT mobile web, works ok, but anything that has .m or .mobile is virtually non-functional. "

I've downgraded my rating and am switching back to the previous version if I can.  Hopefully the developers will switch this back in a future release. Otherwise, the app has some very nice design features."

3713,High school Latin student,"December 6, 2014",3,"Too Clumsy, Kinda Frusturating LinkedIN has a number of things that annoy me. First off, if you use it to post a job opening, the only way you can look at those jobs is from the profile that your company is linked to... So other employees cannot see the people's resumes without getting on your LinkedIn profile."

I was not impressed with it when I first downloaded the app.  However, now I used it more and more now to be in the know in my field. Also like the fact that it does list the people who work where you work too. I gave it a 3 star because people are able to see my resume, but I still haven't been able to directly find a job on here. There's still room for improvements."
3715,Imperial Hawk,"April 8, 2015",3,"A bit clunky I like using linked in on Safari better because it seems more responsive. I get many mails from linked in so when I follow a link from a mail, I sometimes go to the app while other times I go to the website. I enjoy the website more because of the speed, but I think both need improvement. "

I own an iPad and I went to the LinkedIn site and it will not let me edit.  So I came to the app store to download the LinkedIn app. Even worse. If there are editing options then it's not very intuitive. I've searched all over the app and I don't see a way to edit my profile.  I'm pretty computer savvy so this is ridiculous that it should be so much trouble to update the company I work for, at this point I'm just going to delete my linked in account altogether if I can even do that."

The best app I have on my phone-I can do everything I see other people complain they can't do.

This part is done very well and very user friendly. However, one of the main functions I'd use the app for is to update and edit my profile, which cannot be done from the app.  It crashes a lot and when I really get to clicking around the links and news feed I'm greeted with a ""something went wrong"" message at which point I have to manually close down, end, and restart the application."

App is installed but if you get an e mail for an invite etc and select it, it goes to a screen that asks if you want to download the already installed app. If you say No Thanks it launches the Linked In website but just goes into and endless loop of a turning gear. Not by any means intuitive, you need to guess where thing are, shows a number of notifications when you have none and the list goes on. Either badly programmed or badly tested or both. In need of a major overhaul to have value."

No luck, and a search for Homepage only returns businesses named Homepage or something like it. I guess I'll be using LinkedIn a lot less now."

That takes me to the non-functional mobile Linked In site so I installed this app. Problem is it's implemented very poorly. It not only does not launch automatically when I click on a link in their email, it is not even smart enough to pull up the link I clicked on once I launch the app manually. Linked In engineers will do well to take a look at Quora's app and implement atleast the basic features that make the Quora app so seamless and a joy to use."

Recently they added a fantastic new layer of annoyance and frustration.  It's a social mobile app. It's primary purpose is to allow me to quickly check the status of my network. Instead I get a 5 page request to plug LinkedIn in to every single aspect of my digital life every time I open the app. Today I got hit with it a second time in one session.  That's how you get your app deleted.

The User Interface is extremely broken and far from user friendly.  The old format was PERFECT.  It was easy to navigate and all the options were laid out at the top of the page.  Account settings - I cannot even find those now and the menu segregates all the information.  I deleted it. It  is horrible and as part of an app development team, I am floored you released this.  If you change the web version, you will lose me all together."

I can't figure out if you can edit your work experience on the app so if you can it should be easier to find. Editing your profile at all is not easily explained. Also I think it would be really great if there was the ""bump"" function. If you come across someone who has an iPhone and the LinkedIn app you could ""bump"" iPhones and connect that way."

I like that I can surf jobs, attach a PDF res or port to a message, message system works well for me too.  There is always room for improvement and I look forward to where this goes.

If I wanted that kind of new source, I would just go to any of the hundreds of other News aggregator's that were out there. This one was different and has been my go to source for a while now.

It is becoming exceedingly difficult to find what I am looking for. "

LinkedIn advocates for invitations to be personalized with a message to potential connections however; the feature is not available on the iPhone app. As a LIR user I was able to show that the declines were all from the iPhone as I use the personalized invite feature religiously via the standard site. Endorsements are annoying and irrelevant.

Being able to delete people from linked in through the app or delete feature for anything posted incorrectly.  Thanks!

This app works very well for me, I have no major negative issues. My one feature request is when inviting to connect with someone it would allow you to customize the message. Currently it just sends the invite with the generic LI message which is bad form IMO (I like to add a sentence about how I know that person or such)."

This is really annoying for someone like myself, who wants to review the job requirements after getting a call back for an interview-especially after having applied to multiple job postings. It helps with the interview process, and allows potential employees to remember certain things the employer is looking for in a candidate. It shouldn't be sealed up like it is after you have applied.

Why can't LinkedIn take complaints about stalkers and not allow people to view your profile as anonymous.  Sure, the response will be that recruiters or companies interested in you may not want to be seen, but why is that not my choice?"

Switching back and forth between messages, notifications, profiles, and posts is silly and takes up too much time. As big as they have come to be, it's kind of disappointing that their app is so mediocre. Professionals use their iPads and iPhones for business all the time so they are really losing out on potential mobile connectivity between users. I'd use it more on the go if it weren't such a pain to navigate and use easily."

BIG COMPLAINT is that  in v6.0 for some reason they no longer show you the actual total of your own contacts anymore. Why would they hide that... from you? Thats a very important feature. It also no longer seems to show you the amount of contacts on anyone else's profiles. If these numbers are still there its very hard to find them so it's  bad design either way.

It's a very polished app, good-looking and easy to navigate. I generally ignore my update feed when viewed in a browser, but it actually looks interesting here, presented in a magazine-like fashion, and at the risk of sounding narcissistic, I like the way my profile looks."

If you are looking for a job it is high in cost to upgrade, and maybe that cost could be pasted on to the recruiters using it. By cost friendly for the public with a lower tag might draw more people to upgrade. Over all this is the tool to use, but hard to upgrade with the cost when looking for a job."

I can do pretty much everything from my phone where as before I had to long into LinkedIn from my laptop to answer things and I wouldn't find the things I saw on my phone. I wish the email notification would open in the app automatically. That would be perfect!

LinkedIn is the Facebook of careers like I say to my friends."

DON'T DON'T DON'T allow them permission to show your calendar. What were they thinking? After their password debacle, you're going to surrender your calendar over to them? A seriously flawed concept and half-assed execution. Wannabe Flipboard? Not even close. Don't bother downloading these cheesy app. D'Oh! Once you have it on your iPhone, you're stuck with the iPad version which reloads even if you delete it. I will be deleting both off my devices. Grrr."
3871,Mapesa,"April 2, 2013",4,Good App Just only negative thing is it needs an update to allow to send a connect request directly to the people already on linked in instead of having to send an email outside the network.

Went through some data breaches and the pay-for version not really a cut above. The pay for version is just a less stringent view of what you have now. That helps no one. LinkedIn is far behind in making sense of the collaborative benefit interface and until this gain, as The Sharks would say, I'm out."

I was just able to send a message to someone very quickly and was able to find them in less than two seconds. I like to be able to zip in and out. I have not tried applying for jobs on it yet but it has most of the features of the website very accessible.
3878,Iaian7,"May 21, 2015",2,"Poorly designed, frustrating to use The entire app is a bit of a mess with poor UX and cluttered design. Notifications don't always work correctly (keeping badges even when you've tried to mark alerts as read), navigating is tedious, and the signal to noise ratio is just bad. The app also periodically forces you to go through the introduction screens all over again. Then interrupts what you're doing (if you're able to do anything) with pop ups asking for ratings."

This app is handy, but every time I go to run the app, it always insists every time that I go through it's wizard for finding contacts and such like it's my first time opening the app.  It's incredibly annoying and, worse, it wastes time.  I don't need to watch her on how to find more context by email or whatever when all I want to do is accept an invitation, for example."

Wow, all of these bad reviews must have been when you guys first came out with this app because I have had none of these ""issues"" people have complained about. This app works fine!

3882,Natalie Springer,"April 1, 2012",4,"Just a little bit more Great app. Pairs really well with their newly acquired CardMunch app for connecting with new people. Obviously, they need an iPad version, but the most annoying thing to me is that my daily digest emails won't open in the app. I just get a screen in safari wondering if I want the app, and a perpetual loading screen if I do. I do want the app though, that's why I got it already. If this coding were fixed, I'd be a happy camper. Thanks guys"
3883,TurkeyJellyButter,"January 7, 2016",1,"Difficult to use As a first time user, this app isn't user friendly at all. It's difficult to add people to my network, even people that are in my contacts list. It tells me to add them, then says they're invited and tells me to add people via email. I complete all these and then nothing happens. I repeat the process and it's as if I had never done it before. I don't know where to find out who is in my network, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. It's also too similar to Facebook. I don't like how this app isn't it's own. This app isn't useful at all."
3884,Ramonitje,"October 1, 2016",5,GREAT PLATFORM I've been using linked in from just about the very early days. It has continued to grow and evolve. Always useful and easy to access contacts and find new/additional folks to reach out to. Lots of features that provide utility and are valuable sources of information. I can highly recommend the site and mobile app.
3885,JYAppleSeed,"November 14, 2016",5,"Just what matters to keep your career going! The App had gone through several evolutions.

3888,Contrarie,"September 2, 2017",4,"Great business tool! I see LinkedIn with huge potential for becoming the cloud solution for everything business.  Networking, sales follow up tracking, goal setting and as collaboration tool.  Like the only tools anyone is using someday.  But I am not sure LinkedIn sees this vision.  If they do they have to hire more creative developers who can design outside of the current paradigm.  The app is clunky still.  But much faster."

3893,UMD1988,"July 29, 2014",2,"Awful update The new update, while meant to show more of the profile, makes it cluttered. The new summary section is particularly irritating with only a couple lines showing, while before, visitors' attention was completely on the summary, therefore immediately highlighting what position you're seeking, qualifications, etc. Now it's more work to scroll down through an abbreviation of everything and click ""more about so and so"" to see full profile. The top of the profile is so crowded. Awful update."
3894,Rierie1123,"September 22, 2014",2,Messages sent stink This app needs serious help. Poor messaging . If I send a message to someone and want to review what I sent or just look at when or if I sent it to that person there's no trace of it . If you click the mail icon where one would think that would be where you'd find the mail it just shows messages that have been sent to you. Very disappointed in this app and probably why I don't use LinkedIn as much as other social media that have their apps in order. Unlike this one.
3895,Justintyme30,"February 23, 2015",4,"Great for Networking All around great for networking. The website on the computer does a lot more than what you are able to do on the phone app though.

I recommend that as well. Stay connected."

There are followers - not connections. You can't easily see your rankings any longer. I really like some of the business changes like blogging but the mobile experience needs to get back to being more professional. The prediction I have is that the nature of posts will also become more fb like if not careful. That opens the door to a new entrant"

As a manager who has mobile development teams this is not a well thought out update from a user's perspective. Capabilities like saved jobs are gone and you are told to use the jobs app which isn't designed for an iPad only iPhone. You can only run the app in portrait mode, I don't use my tablet as a regular habit in portrait mode. I would have preferred a mobile app that got me more of the web capabilities that I have wanted included in the app than this. Looks like I am not the only one the does not like this update."

I hope this isn't a precursor to the future direction of the web version. Please reconsider and change immediately, this used to be an app I visited everyday but now it's so confusing, unattractive and less people/face focused that it's no longer worth attempting a quick browse. Please keep trying, I love LinkedIn and want to love the app again."
3913,Treichel1225,"January 22, 2016",2,Bad update I might have left one other review in the App Store so for me to comment on this app means something. I've been a long time LinkedIn member and user. This most recent update is awful. I no longer can see what is happening in my groups and am at the mercy of news that only pops up on my home page. I think it is crazy that LinkedIn would take such a step backwards. This once was my favorite and most used app. Now I cringe when I want to use it. Please change this or you will likely lose me...

Navigating it is nearly impossible, and every time it updates I have to answer 20 questions and swipe a bunch of crap asking me to Connect to a bunch of people I don't know away before I can get back to the main part of the app. It's incredibly annoying. If I could hit one button to say 'no take me to the app' it would be fine, but I have to swipe through so many screens to do it I would rather just delete the app and not deal with it if it can't be bothered to remember what I did last time."

The capabilities it offers are often better to use than in the browser, but there's just so much missing that it's frustrating. Why can't I see an entire profile on the iPad? Why can't I edit or even see my notes about contacts? It makes me wonder if they're having cash flow problems and had to lay off most of the app development team."

They have both been critical and helping me find new clients as well as promoting my business. I also like the fact that the website is very professional and they do not allow content that is not related to business.
3936,Alyssa18384759285729;78/&274,"January 10, 2017",2,Who developed this? I recently downloaded the app. Almost every time I try to make changes to my profile I'll get an error saying something along the lines of 'could not be completed' in various different wordings. I've tried to change my picture and enter skills many times before giving up and doing it from the site. The messaging works fine but I'm not going to be using LinkedIn as a main source of communication. You should hire a software dev from LinkedIn to improve your app.

3938,Shelby Ak,"August 12, 2017",5,Great way to stay connected and informed This is a rich and resourceful app. This app provides you with a solid platform in which you can network and stay abreast to new and upcoming technologies. You can keep track of companies you may find of interest and be alerted when a potential job openings becomes available.

Being a premium member has aloud me to be in front of people I never would have had the opportunity to meet. I highly recommend this app."

As well there are numerous groups that one can join and participate in discussions of a wide range of topics, or commence a discussion about your chosen topic. Another neat thing is that you get to choose whether or not you want to connect with whomever. For me, I appreciate the ability to reach out with the primary intent to make a real safety difference!"

The LinkedIn network has been pivotal for me and my career. This is we have for it in the mobile space. Let's offer our suggestions to make it better; to meet a broader spectrum of users."
3943,Sundayld,"March 1, 2015",2,"EDIT OPTIONS You should either be able to edit the profile picture selected or delete it.  I choose a picture with other people it the photo thinking I would be able to crop it, like all other applications.  After it posted I tried to delete it and that option was not available. So now there is a picture under recent activity that I do not want showing.  So, did I miss and edit or delete option? I hope there is an edit option to correct typos!"
3944,mskaggs93,"April 3, 2015",5,No Issues and got me a job I haven't really found any quirks in the app but I may not use all of its features. The main thing is what it did for my career. Someone being to able to look at my profile and my experience and find out that it fit an opportunity perfectly - the networking is incredible.

3946,RodRuns,"April 16, 2015",5,"Job Machine LinkedIn has been a reliable source of business, references, and business marketing for me. This app is a perfect logical extension. Doesn't provide the full site experience and I don't want the full site  experience on my phone. This brings the things I can do and want to do to the IOS platform. No crashing, no spam, no complaints."
3947,Itserod,"July 10, 2015",4,Connect Messages The app is great but I am not able to send personal connect messages. I do not like tapping the connect button which sends a generic message. I rather have the option to send a personally message when I tap the connect button. 
3948,ProfiGal,"December 8, 2015",1,"WORST update ever WHAT happened with this app? I would give this zero stars if I could because I can't even open it! And you took away landscape mode? I use my iPad when I travel, you ding dongs, and have a KEYBOARD so that I can quickly write intelligent posts and messages. But that doesn't work in portrait, now does it?! I'm going to delete the app now. Thanks a lot. You've now made it too difficult. Did anyone even beta test?? Guhhh, I'm so annoyed. And I've worked in SaaS for more than 10 years. Unacceptable. Your product manager, scrum master and QA team have some explaining to do."
3949,badnews333,"December 18, 2015",1,"LOL Looks like they made absolutely no changes to the app from the 9.0.0 OR 9.0.1 release, they just wanted to hide their thousands of 1-star reviews."

I spend little time but it got me so many good people to professionally network with who I had no chance to meet or know. Also this one platform where you can write things in your profile which people in your network can confirm or vouch for.
3952,Mjiyer,"October 24, 2012",5,"Great networking app! LinkedIn has made its niche as a Go-to professional networking site and the app has just made it more likeable. Simple, easy to browse and has the right features. The Endorse feature is the new one i really liked bcos it doesn't require a writeup of the person but still validates their skill.  Hope to see LinkedIn as a interview portal in future."
3953,Evanescence_Fanatic,"October 28, 2012",4,"Good App But Has Navigation Flaws The LinkedIn App has gotten a lot better . However one cannot endorse someone's skills via mobile app, which is not efficient. The other is the lacking editing options. One should have the ability to navigate from mobile mode into full site mode and ""not"" have it automatically cycle back to mobile mode unless the user ""wants"" to."
3954,rippedX,"February 26, 2013",3,Please simplify the process of adding a connection! Overall it's a decent mobile version of LinkedIn. It's responsive and fluid and hasn't crashed on me yet.
3955,Ashyykins08,"April 3, 2013",2,"Great social networking website, poor app I love LinkedIn. I'm a recruiter so it's become my favorite sourcing and networking tool. My first and biggest issue with the app is the inability to use LinkedIn recruiter. Make this available and I'd be able to inmail on the go, ensuring I keep my premium account for years to come. Second, the app is slow, crashes, and pretty much useless. I don't understand how their website is so seamless, so easy to use but their app is not. Most days I'd rather pull up the website in safari than use the app."
3956,rekrabm,"June 8, 2013",2,Great improvement in difficulty of use The last few updates have really made this app much less intuitive in navigation.
3957,Shoosty,"June 10, 2013",5,"It keeps getting better - steady as she goes. Lots of new features, smooth interface, reasonable speed... Plenty of room for creativity on all level. LinkedIn continues to outpace the competition setting up one of the finest websites on the planet. The mobile app just extends that success in ways I wouldn't have imagined only a few years ago. Thumbs up!"
3958,Pegs Stuff,"August 1, 2013",5,"Integration with email needed Love the LinkedIn app - almost better than the website!!  Easy to find people, profiles and my groups."
3959,jack tanuki,"June 24, 2014",3,"Becoming less ""professional"" with every upgrade. Although this is pretty much in a class of its own, This is more of a F***book style app than a place where professionals look for potential clients and or employees, I'm constantly badgered by ""let's get started"" on my profile by trying to connect to my phone contacts and face book friends, I know what people and demographics I'm looking to connect to I don't need another social meeting place."
3960,Random Ragdoll,"September 13, 2011",2,"Ooh, shiny! But sort of pointless. Really the only purpose the previous version of the LinkedIn app served for me was to allow me to download my connections' contact info to my iPhone. This very simple function is gone. "
3961,Cftextreme,"September 20, 2011",2,"OK if you want Superficial If you are a superficial LinkedIn user, then this is ok I guess.  The last version gives the user much more functionality.  This feels like app development people did this design and not aggressive users.  Please allow us to download the older version again or put more robust functionality in.   I née access to my profile, direct access to my entire contact/connections etc etc.  This app looked ""pretty"" but is less intuitive and more awkward to use to try to get the most out of it."
3962,LydRod,"January 28, 2012",3,Horrible email integration on iPhone You need to fix it so that when you click on an article on your iPhone emailed to you from LinkedIn it detects the app and interacts with it instead of safari and it keeps asking you to install the app! 
3963,Woyer,"May 10, 2012",1,"Slow and messy Very poor showing. It is slow, half the time doesn't load the page, and it is such a mess. You don't need to post 3 of the first paragraphs in an article that someone posts. Post the title, maybe the first few sentences and then a link to it. You only fit like 4 updates per page. My connections, which total less than 500, post about 100 updates per hour. No way I could possibly get to important ones by scrolling through."
3964,Quincy.cs,"September 28, 2016",2,Hate messaging. I'm very upset.  I am writing a long detailed message to someone.  I have to go to other apps like browser to get references/ figure out what I want to say next.  Eventually I come back to the LinkedIn app maybe 5 minutes later and then the LinkedIn app goes to the home tab.  My draft message is all gone and erased.  No way of getting it back.  I would expect going back to the message thread will show what I was typing before.  I've seen this issue a year ago as well. Please fix this hole!
3965,swilson2245,"September 29, 2016",5,"A must download for college seniors and graduates! Love it! Great for college seniors and graduates seeking new networking opportunities. Also, it provides current news and updates on what's going on in different areas. It's great for professionals that want to stay informed on what's happening in there respected fields. One of the best apps I've downloaded and anymore I'm using it more than Facebook."
3966,CrystalRoc,"December 20, 2016",1,"Update to recent review When you apply for a job and it asks you to upload a resume, you better hope you are in browser mode because every time you go to a selected cloud storage, it will drop and put you back to LinkedIn. It does not even pick up where left off if you were to click and go back. You have to start over again. It's not worth the effort to apply for a job through LinkedIn. Just find the job on the company website and apply that way until the creators of this app fix this problem."

Now that I've had a chance to use it for a while...meh.  Still limited functionality compared to using LinkedIn through a desktop web browser.  iPad version does NOT like to upload photos for posts, and frequently craps out (""post unsuccessful"").  Overall, it's ok, but most of my activity is still through the desktop web version."
3970,Chiana 5 Star Dreams LLC,"September 11, 2014",5,Amazing App!!! Great for Business! This app allows me to know who is qualified for a position. I love having so many connections through the jobs I've had over the years. Having a small business it gives you advice on how to grow your followers. Plus with all the social media it's nice to have a professional site and app like LinkedIn. Great App!!!
3971,nicpot14,"January 17, 2015",3,"Super tricky Premium free trial cancellation! Not a big fan of trying a service and not being able to cancel easily if you don't want it! Even the directions under the help section point you to a place on the app to cancel that doesn't exist! Then you have to manage your subscription in some obscure way to cancel before being billed under your Apple ID. Not a big fan of trickery plus there was no big ""premium"" service that I saw via the app."

3973,Bete Noire,"November 12, 2015",3,"Only three stars because... The app crashes every single time I  click on the ""see who's endorsed you"" area. This has been an ongoing problem since I first downloaded it. After several updates, the developers have had ample opportunities to correct this glitch, but haven't bothered. It's very annoying, to put it mildly, and makes me reluctant to use this app. Fix the problem & I will be a satisfied user. I'll also upgrade my rating."
3974,memcache-problems,"December 1, 2015",5,a breath of fresh air! 👍👍👍 opening this new app experience was better than going outside on the first sunny day of spring after the coldest and rainiest winter comparable to the Ice Age. each tab perfectly addresses my business needs and keeps me invested in relationships with my professional network. so proud to be a LinkedIn member and can't wait for everything to come!

After this most recent update and change in layout, you're trying really hard to be Facebook and it's extremely disheartening.  It's made navigating your site extremely tedious and irritating.  Please fix it.  I was really beginning to enjoy using all the features and even considered making myself a premium member again...  But with this sad and pale Facebook imitation layout, it doesn't make any sense..."

However not being able to update your profile is a bit inconvenient for me as I am in sales and hardly ever at my regular computer. Also it says I have 2 notifications and I can't seem to find them. It is very limited on what you can do with it. My app on my old blackberry worked better then the one on my brand new iPhone 4s which is really irritating. Hopefully there will be an update soon."
3981,Moe Train's Tracks,"May 28, 2012",3,"Good, but needs tweaking! I've finally taken to LinkedIn and the networking possibilities. It's great for that... However, it needs the ability to type in landscape mode. Typing in portrait mode is tough when typing messages within groups. Also, we should be able to edit our profiles within the app. Suggested connections have been repeating after adding several people. "

I'm wondering why this app is not ""smart"" enough to be able to launch directly from the email updates that I receive from groups I belong to in LinkedIn.

3990,captobie,"December 15, 2015",1,"As bad as everyone says I normally try to avoid jumping on the bad review bandwagon when an app gets a major overhaul because I understand change isn't always easy to take and we usually grow to like something over time. But this has to be the most ill conceived app I've ever encountered. LinkedIn's iPad app has always fallen short of what it could be, always maybe 3.5 to 4 star worthy. But if we could give negative stars this app would truly deserve it. LinkedIn needs to fix this immediately, or run the risk of becoming insignificant in the mobile app space."
3991,Jumpstarttracey,"January 13, 2016",4,"If not for some weird stalkers it would be perfect! I love the fact that with a career in Multifamily that expands more than 40 years (OMG I AM SO OLD!), this app keeps me connected with all the people that have either worked alongside me or has been touched by my efforts.  Only recently I have felt somewhat concerned as a single woman that their may be men with less than honorable intentions.  Still my most trusted biz networking source!"

Mobile is obnoxious and more like another Facebook but I really don't care as much on a professional level to be notified so much. Sure, I could change settings etc. but they changed the whole backbone of the app on the assumption that this is what users want, and it probably is. Just not for me."

3994,Foxjordan,"May 10, 2016",3,Lacks basic functionality I can't believe at this point there is still no way to sort or filter posts. Everything in the app is a jumbled mess. You have to scroll for miles before you find new content because it gets shuffled around between posts from 30 days ago. 
3995,Infinitepez,"May 18, 2016",5,Jobs and Networking What a great app! Makes building what is essentially my resume very easy.

4006,VJack1921,"January 29, 2015",5,LinkedIn good for free too expensive for premium This is a very useful to network with.  The connections help build a professional tool box that you can draw from.  If I was LinkedIn I would offer something in the $10 a month range with most of what Premium offers.  Better to get something than nothing.
4007,Tech Pro 7,"January 31, 2015",4,"Good but Needs to Continue to Improve The LinkedIn app is good and does 80% of the functions I want on a regular basis. On the other hand there are some things that it doesn't do that are quite frustrating.

4008,Atomicdog68,"July 20, 2015",4,"Great app, could be better This is a very good app.  It gives you most of the functionality of the website, which is a great thing.  However, you will still be forced to go to the web page to get the full experience.  If the developers can make this app function in a way that I never have to go to the site, then they would have a 5-star app."
4009,Jkensuke,"August 16, 2015",2,Used to be okay but now it's just terribly invasive. You used to be able to use this app but now whenever I launch it to try and clear out notifications it asks you to scan your contacts and connect with everyone. Before it would be the first screen you loaded would ask it but now it's every screen you load asks to scan your contacts. It seems like they only want to expand their service too others rather than be helpful than the user.

4015,PlanePete,"August 24, 2016",4,Great platform. App is very useful but would love to get some things improved.  Most social platforms don't do a good job of this as I imagine it reduces viewing but I'd like to know what's posted since my last opening of the app and not all the previous things.    Then to also put priority on people or topics so I can determine how deep to look or skip things I'm currently looking to follow (actively  vs passively)

Not only have I benefited financially from this app, I've also made friends who I connect with on a daily basis where we share and exchange information that benefits us all. Once you connect with similar people in your field, the possibilities are endless!"
4018,jefbak,"April 26, 2017",2,"Stop auto contact requests in app The LinkedIn app is notorious for trying to add all your contacts on your phone as connections in the app, and not just the first time you use the app, but almost every time you open it. This is annoying to both the user and their contacts (it's easy to accidentally press the button)."
4019,Casey J_09,"July 12, 2017",5,"Leave the ease of the App! I don't take time to write reviews often; however, I really love the mobile features that this app gives me.  It allows me to stay in touch and network at ease, especially when I'm looking to find new connections. Great job on making this App a user friendly experience."
4020,Delta-flyer,"June 6, 2015",3,Can't write comments on iPad It's not convenient to write comments in the forums because the editing feature is not working consistently. The main issue is that the keypad covers up the editing window and the editing tools don't work. So if you use the forums the iPad (and probably iPhone) versions will not be useful. 
4021,Sultan-8,"July 8, 2015",5,"What to say...It's LinkedIn! One of the best apps there is! Simple, yet to the point. I actually rely on LinkedIn to achieve, stay connected/visible, and keep up with all that is going around within/without my network."
4022,Unhappychiver,"October 29, 2015",1,"App will cause unintentional connections I actually like the app, but when it sent out 350 connections today when I was only trying to add 50, it got deleted. The app gets in your email and contacts list and tries to connect to everyone you've ever sat next to on a bus. It is an irresponsible way to write an app and makes me look foolish with my connections. Some of these people are folks that have poor business practices. I would never recommend them and now they are on my network. I can't cancel it either, or even see who all was added."
4023,Swordfish148,"December 6, 2015",1,"Can't post company updates LinkedIn goes a long way to make sure your mobile experience is bad regardless of using their app or mobile site.

4024,mmasnjak,"December 8, 2015",5,"Nice update that simplifies the user experience As a designer, I can see where this update is going. Gone are the mass amounts of custom UI in favor of an iOS-style user experience that will be faster to bring new features to users."
4025,No nickname 1234556,"December 9, 2015",3,"Old layout was better. Let's be honest. All I want to see are people that viewed my profile (now even harder to do because you offer private mode now 😑) and post updates to my profile. Honestly, the overhaul has made me click more to get to the content I want to see with the addition and frustration of swiping left/right at additional content I don't want nor asked for. I'll likely delete the app in the future."
4026,Corbindbarron1995,"December 31, 2015",1,New update FREAKING BLOWS Please change it back to the older version. No one that I know or have talked to about this likes it at all. Don't know why it still hasn't been changed. I don't even want to use it anymore. It was nice to have it on my phone so I didn't feel like I had to get on my computer every time to do something. Now I feel like I have to again. This app used to motivate my future career as a 20 year old. Now I'm just done and all I do is play video games! Lol but foreal this update blows. Please change it. Literally makes me want to shoot my phone.
4027,Livemusicluva,"January 12, 2016",5,"Love the newest updates I have used LinkedIn for a few years now, but rarely used it on my phone until now.

4028,Opus104,"February 7, 2016",4,"Much improved for iPad Rocky start has been improved. Still not a fan of the heavy Facebook-like streams, but that speaks to personal preference, not functionality. The update ""cards"" worked really well. "
4029,E-Z Rock,"April 29, 2016",5,Go-to app for professional growth With the fairly recent redesign the new LinkedIn app has become an invaluable platform for professional growth.

There needs to be a function to clear the junk this app stores on locally either in the usage screen or in app settings.  Also, there is a word wrap issue (lack of) when you type in a comment.  You can see the lines you are composing after the first line.  Other than that, pretty cool app."
4032,Savasha,"July 3, 2014",4,"I like this App I don't like the fact that it's pushy that it wants to get into your contacts even after you tell it no, but the app itself is wonderful, and you can get connected with all your business professionals and friends and job opportunities in just a short time. When I am able to use the app more and get more familiar with the ins and outs I'll give it another review."

But I'm constantly reminded of how this app falls short whenever I get a LinkedIn email regarding a group topic I'm following...tap the hyperlink...redirects me to a page that asks me if I want to ""get the LinkedIn"" app (which I already have)...and then no ability to look at your groups with the app. Just not that useful without that or the ability to do advance searches like on the website."
4043,BrixD,"August 24, 2011",2,"Functionality? Thought it was just okay before this update, but it seems the limited functionality it did have is now gone. I found the favorites function useful but it is no longer there. The network updates are redundant. No folders for organizing. All in all appreciate the effort (and it is free after all), but not a useful app as it stands right now. Would love to see an update soon- and the ability to sync desktop and mobile account with folders or favorites."
4044,Lissssssxo13,"May 17, 2012",4,"Good. Love the app!  Its one of the better ones that are made for networking. The only thing I would change is that you are able to see the members who view your profile. I hate that it says ""anonymous LinkedIn member"". If they put that then they should just show you the name or something, even if the picture doesn't have to be shown. Other than that, works great."
4045,Eric Finnell,"May 31, 2013",4,All about the networking ! For the most part I really enjoy the network and it has also allowed me to connect with a lot of colleague's all over the country. I also like the fact that shared information has stayed private !!!

My only complaint is the the substantive info you see on the iPhone app differs from the desktop site. I didn't look at my own profile on the full site for a few months, and realized that there was some fairly significant outdated info that I had not been seeing on my phone. NBD, but it was annoying."

Still can't do everything that the full web version allows, but at least it doesn't crash repeatedly anymore.

4049,kennethwongsf,"November 11, 2013",3,"Local job search function--where is it? I like the sleek layout of the new app. Many of the functions work well or better, but the job search function still confuses me. It seems I can only search for jobs from all over the network, but there's no way to look for local jobs specifically, or filter the search results to display only local jobs. One would think this is pretty important function."

LinkedIn changed my life!

4063,harry fries,"September 5, 2013",2,"Weak Nothing in this app feels natural. It's very counter intuitive. It feels like LinkedIn tried so hard to not be like social media (Facebook) that they made it backwards. I.e. I'll get a notification, like the red dot with the #2 in it over the app icon. Then I'll open the app, find one thing right away like a connect request. Then spend 30 minutes looking for the other thing. I'll give up and have a red 1 on the app until I delete and reinstall. This app is garbage.  I feel bad for members with a paid sub."
4064,Foxclaw,"November 18, 2013",4,"Almost perfect app Why won't the LinkedIn app open when I click on an invite link in an email. It's the most annoying thin to click the link, then be prompted to download the app(which I obviously already have), or to open the app. Then when I open it, I'm at square one again instead of being taken to the place I should have linked to.

4065,Spondon4343,"November 18, 2013",2,Good but simple mistakes that are annoying Love the app overall. The one thing that drives me nuts is the messaging center.

Then I write again and look like a fool because I forgot which message I responded to already.

Not enough characters here for me to say what needs to change and how it should look. But this over pretentious app is frustrating and wasteful of the real estate on an iPad screen. Give me information not pages and pages of cr@p. please note I have not mentioned the security issue nor the way LinkedIn moves your calendar down to one of their machines. That is unforgivable.

4083,Tired of metro,"October 19, 2015",3,Hit and Miss I find the app a little bit uneven for the following reasons. To manage your contacts and social network it excels at this. However both the job search functions and the application functions are frequently disconnected. For instance your LinkedIn link will frequently fail when attempting to use your LinkedIn to apply for a particular position. Dropbox function is much more useful than the native API/link.

I was shocked when I tried to access Pulse yesterday and was forced to go thru LinkedIn, yet still could not access any of my previous favorite news sites.

4096,Hard2findgoodnickname,"March 3, 2014",5,"Much improved and now it's great! Didn't think this would happen when the app was first released years ago, but it's way better now. The interface is intuitive and I can do everything I need to do on a regular basis. I can't remember the last time I visited the desktop website. Was 2 stars now 5. Great app!"
4097,Wow1160,"March 17, 2014",5,Very Professional Social Networking This app has helped me find a lot of the professional people out there that have given me the great knowledge base I have with the industry I have worked in for 30 years. The advantage is I can now contact them with questions that are in their expertise areas and continue to add knowledge to my industry.

The ""in person"" feature was very handy just now in adding someone to my contact list.  I might put this on the front page."
4101,Appsuperstar,"August 14, 2011",2,"Could be so much more I agree with most other reviews, the functionality of this app is basic at best. An app should enhance or at least compliment the whole, we use apps because we are busy people being pulled in numerous directions and our smart phone allows us to be more efficient. How am I to efficiently moderate my groups when the app really does not allow me to do much other than check who sends me an invite. I hope the company does better than this in future updates."

Now if you could only redesign your actual website with the same principals..."

I should be able to do everything from my iPad and more!"

Even though my settings on the app say only send push notifications on receiving a new message, the app will actually send a new push notification on EVERY notification from the app, e.g. someone in my network has a birthday..... which happens ALL the time. This is an abuse of trust and privileges by LinkedIn, and I highly doubt it's an honest tech bug. Not cool! Because I use my phone for professional work, those notifications bugger up my work flow. So I've deleted this app."
4110,RandomNickname00,"September 9, 2015",2,"Email Functionality Can't even access sent emails within the app. Did the intern programming it understand that sent email boxes exist for more than a few reasons? Also, when I first installed it, it asked if I wanted notifications. I clicked no. Then, because it's LinkedIn, I had a feeling my request was ignored so I went into my notifications settings and could you believe that it was set into full notifications? Ha! Luckily, I nipped that one in the bud and disabled all notifications. Good try!"

For starters, not everyone uses their iPad in a portrait mode, so making your app only in portrait orientation is a huge mistake. Second, the overall layout and functionality is a non-starter. It's almost too streamlined and bland. Apparently, the LinkedIn powers that be decided that looks are more important than function. Also, take a look at all the 5 star reviews...I bet they were all written by the developers of this POS app...what a shameful and lame way to promote your crappy work!"

I have been using linkedin for over 6 years and saw the network and accuracy grow to a level where it became the whitepages for business people showing what we are are all about .... unlike other social tools who show what we wanted to be ...in nice pictorial views :)
4124,dancinkween1985,"January 12, 2015",4,Awesome! BUT the 'App' needs more capability! Love LinkedIn but I have a BIG problem with people being able to see MY profile anonymously! If people want to snoop into my info then I want to know WHO they are!! The app also needs to have an easy way to remove a 'link' and/or block them. How about also teaming up with IMDB to be able to link & edit both profiles via the LinkedIn 'app'?
4125,Akin242002,"January 15, 2015",4,Business App we all need This is a must have app if you are a working adult over the age of 25 years old.  I can keep in contact with ex coworkers without introducing them to my private life on Facebook or Google+.  Also an excellent venue to network and get business advice.  Only problem is the visual layout is ugly.  It probably drives marketing people crazy.  Other than that 4/5 for me.
4126,Songbird4_77,"January 19, 2015",3,Limited if you are using a cell phone as your primary resource. I signed up using my cell phone and intended to use Linked In as a networking and job search tool. I found the features limited with regard to job searching and once I set up my profile I could not adjust the photo or add skills over time ... I searched thinking perhaps I was just an uninformed user. Turned out i needed to use a computer to do these things. :/
4127,Jayelljay,"April 3, 2015",5,"One of my top 5 apps LinkedIn is my window to the business world.

However, I do wish that the Job Search feature worked in the app. I also wish  that it was easier to find/join groups of interest from the app, but other than that it's been a great app to have!"
4132,Ray&Tracy,"May 30, 2013",5,"Yes, but with some reservation. Not an app geek so can't give all the derails but the new features take a little getting used to. I kind of liked the ""dashboard"" design as a starting point. Don't like that in order to clear a new contact notification you have to go to their profile. But overall I prefer the new design."
4133,Ajw bfmw,"July 14, 2013",2,I like the iPhone version. This could be good but needs more. I have a problem where I don't get any updates. The main screen always says there are no updates. I wish this was more like the iPhone version but with more to maximize the screen. This just doesn't offer enough. I also agree with another comment that iPad never realizes you have this downloaded. It always asks me to download the app instead of just taking me to it. I love LinkedIn but this app needs a lot more.
4134,aNeKai,"August 1, 2013",3,"Nice app with a Few Limits I love having my contacts on the go and I also love the sister app CardMunch. The issue I've had with the app is it does not allow you to add a personal message when requesting to connect with someone. Also, it won't show me the connection's email address to write down or something but only wants to link to my email account and immediately send an email. Annoying. It does occasionally crash."
4135,Helheleh,"January 7, 2014",5,"2 accounts Thanks for your amazing service, that would be great if u guys could add a feature to link 2 LinkedIn accounts, I have an account for friends and family and another one for business I want to link or sync these 2 accounts to be able to receive my emails in one account"
4136,Ace31mastersniper,"April 1, 2014",3,"Good app, but ""who's viewed"" is a joke I've always been a fan of linked in, and can attest to its value in the workplace for screening candidates, as well as, marketing oneself for a new position. "

In 2014 you need to be linked in."

4139,710studio,"August 13, 2014",4,"Good App Not Perfect The LinkedIn app works good, runs fast on my iPhone 5c, but seems to try to cram too much information in such a little space.  Invites tend to be cut off, so they may be hard to see, making the decision to accept or not a little bit of a guessing game.  Other than that, the app is fine and works as one would expect it to work.  I recommend it without hesitation."
4140,BobNesta,"August 16, 2011",3,"Better, but still not there yet The new interface looks slick but the functionality hasn't changed much. While I can make a connection with new people or see updates from current connections, I still can't update my profile, my photo, or look at job postings. These features are no less important than what is currently on the app, if not moreso. Hopefully they'll be on a soon-to-be-released version."

I am sure the developers are working on this, but I would like to use an iPad version of the app as well.

I especially like the Linked In button which collapses the layout into 4 panes that host each of the most common areas of linked in. I was surprised at how fast it was. With it being free, there is nothing to complain about. I am happy I downloaded it."
4144,Kevmo4989,"February 21, 2012",3,"A pretty good app This does a great job of capturing the important parts of the website and it is great or networking. The only things I would change is allow people to edit their profile on smartphones and also when sending an invite to make a connection, make it so the person's name shows in the invitation instead of having to enter it yourself. Make those changes and I'll change my rating to 5 stars."

People posting quote images or pictures of themselves at a party or of what they're eating. If all I'm getting is daily useless notifications that I can't turn off, it's probably time to delete it altogether."

4149,Logoyo,"June 22, 2017",3,"Not Very Intuitive This review is more a suggestion than anything else. I find when I use LinkedIn that it is not very intuitive. Two specific things come to mind. Firstly, I cannot easily view my own profile. I ended up typing in my own name in the search box to find my profile to make changes and adjustments. Secondly, it's not apparent how to go about endorsing other people. I still haven't found that."

4152,HemiDave,"December 16, 2015",2,"Bad iPad Experience I am not a fan of the overall change but am especially upset that they took the auto orientation away. I used to look at this app on my iPad (on a keyboard stand) in the morning with my news and coffee but experience is not so much now. I only go in the app now only if I have a notification, mainly invite. There are some other UX changes that make me question where they are headed...seems like they are trying to be the big social site a little too much."
4153,PAR4DOX,"December 26, 2015",2,"Great example of fixing an app that wasn't broken Many software companies face the dilemma of having a staff that needs to stay busy, so they keep making changes to their app when it was just fine as it was.

It is now asking me to connect with on my computers, EVEN THOUGH they are not on LinkedIn. I don't trust LinkedIn anymore. It's a shame, because it was the last social network that is actually really worth it. Shame on you LinkedIn. You should shine by example and not by catching to other's poor privacy practices."

It does allow for cross experiential opportunities based on the network circle you build.

4177,site59Jeff,"April 1, 2014",5,Use it daily LinkedIn is invaluable and I use it daily before meetings and for research.  Some things missing in mobile version though. Like real email and contact info. And ability to write personal notes when inviting people. Please fix!  Also let passwords be remembered in Safari please!
4178,Briank MIT,"April 30, 2014",4,Invaluable. I use LinkedIn every day and obviously find it very valuable. Inspiring to see what others are accomplishing. The iPhone app is pretty good and always improving. Other reviews point out opportunities for more features and I mostly agree they will help. However the app is already a bit obtuse in usage so I hope they can control the complexity as they add features.
4179,thissavedgirl,"May 8, 2014",5,"Professional network in your pocket I've been using this app since 2010, and since it's redesign I've been able to contact, edit, share and network on-the-go. It's especially helpful at conferences when you want to connect with people you just met. Highly recommend this app!"
4180,Tahoeclay,"January 25, 2010",1,"Absurd After reading so many reviews saying the same thing it simply amazes me that a solid brand like LinkedIn would allow its developers to turn out such an obvious problem. To not be able to invite other LinkedIn members into your network, when that's the while point of LinkedIn, is just a head scratcher. I mean seriously, why? I just wonder how long the management will allow their good name to get slaughtered in the shadow of sheer annoyance. Please, for the love of God, fix your app. With confirmation that someone got fired over this I'll revise to 5 stars. Cheers for now."
4181,Stearnzy,"February 7, 2011",1,"A year later and the experience is just as bad. I just downloaded this app. I get email updates for my Linkedin account, but I thought the app would be good to use. I tried using this app a year ago and it was horrible. It crashed all the time, and it would not update reliably. I figured that after a year they would have the bugs worked out."
4182,daunchfamily4,"August 20, 2011",1,"I don't get it... I'm not sure what LinkedIn is going for here. They took a perfectly good app and made it more complicated, harder to navigate with no apparent new features to warrant the wholesale interface changes. This is one of the first apps that I ever wanted to downgrade back a version. I'm not sure what design house convinced them that the LinkedIn community was looking for this monstrosity of a user interface in a mobile app. This should have been field tested with a large cross-section of users before it was released. What a mess. Dump this approach and try again..."
4183,Hathabot,"February 2, 2012",5,"Good and Solid data, Gentlemen and Ladies! The LinkedIn Forums have been a surprisingly consistent source of revelatory datums for all sectors for which I have had the privilege and time to read.  LinkedIn's methods for community selection and aggregation of information communities and market sets allows a level of openness among tßrusted professionals along all reasonable  parameters, cross-axial analyses.  Good show, All."

4185,Nishitaaa,"June 16, 2017",5,"Must have app! This app is designed extremely well. They keep improving it and making it better with every update which shows their attention to customer feedback. Needless to say, it's a great and must have tool to create and nurture your professional network."
4186,Mr.Unknown,"July 24, 2017",1,"Fix the posted link preview issue I have updated now at least 10 times, hoping each time, that the new update will correct links showing in a preview.  I do lots of photography, I post my image links to my LinkedIn page to push my images.  When I share, or paste a link, all that shows is a little post it note icon because it can't figure out how to display...  Fix it, this many updates since it quit working is forcing me to look elsewhere, and not take this app seriously..."

I highly recommend it to all professionals."
4188,HellCat Heatha,"August 11, 2017",3,"Good, but could be better I like the idea of LinkedIn and its purpose. I just wish the app was more functional. Why is the ""jobs"" section a totally different app? It wasn't clear on how to update my personal page. Wish formatting was better. Overall I'll still end up having to use it, but there could be some improvements so that updating my personal info was easier to access."
4189,Paul of Arrakis,"August 19, 2017",4,"Pretty good overall I mostly use the linkedin mobile version. It is not as good as the non mobile version, but it does the job and now rarely crashes for me (I use the iPhone version). "

4196,RZil,"March 8, 2016",1,"Weak App Overall flow and design of the app are just not good. They were definitely more focused on making it look cool than having it be a useful tool. Since the recent update, I cannot use the app. I have several notifications and yet they do not appear once I open the app which constantly says ""no internet connection."" I logged out and cannot log back in. I had no issues with the actual site but the app is completely worthless and I will be uninstalling it promptly. I really expected much more from LinkedIn."

It's frustrating to write comments to post only to have a stupid error message tell me to try again. I'm not going to keep rewriting comments only to end up with the same stupid error message. This wastes time and really turns me off using this app. Yes, I've updated it, so that's not the problem. If all I can do is ""like"" others' posts, then there's no reason to continue using it."

I had another email address already established with them by which we communicated. The person advised that no attempt was ever made to make contact with me via linked in. If I ever figure out how to completely disconnect from linked in, I will do so."
4200,Tash. O,"July 11, 2013",4,"Pretty good I don't usually read all the scrolling articles, probably do not even use the app to its full capabilities.  The only complaint I have is it takes awhile for it to catch up with itself. For instance, I'll read a message and it will say I still have something unread in my inbox like I haven't read it, kind of annoying.  Otherwise, pretty good!"
4201,alzim4,"September 29, 2013",3,Cluttered It's way to easy to accidentally invite people to connect and endorse.  I was setting up a new phone and accidentally invited my entire contact list.  I didn't know until people I would never have connected with via Linked In started friending me.  I also find that the constant bombardment of suggestions to endorse people have rendered this feature useless.  I would put zero weight in the endorsements of people.
4202,jsdubbs,"January 31, 2014",2,"Frustratingly limited I find the app useful for staying up-to-date on invites. Otherwise I don't think the mobile UI provides  the same value as the full site. I don't see much use for it. Also when i get notifications in my email, it would be nice if they could open in the app or at least bypass the login. Furthermore, the ability to change settings like notifications and group memberships is either limited or not available."

LinkedIn itself is a great tool, but they clearly put few resources into their iPad app.  It is one of only a handful I've completely abandoned because it was so poorly done.  The limited set of functions available are either too hard to find or behave in such bizarre ways they are too unpredictable to be of any value.  None of the standard iOS apps work with it either, so if I get an email with a LinkedIn hyperlink, it brings up Safari & asks me if I'd like to go to the App Store to install it.  AAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!"

4211,Bclark8,"July 20, 2011",4,"Minor change would be major Great app overall, but the reconnect and invitations buttons should be combined to make room for a ""groups"" button.

4212,WookieDread,"January 19, 2012",2,"REALLY needs to be Universal please! I appreciate what this app does, but not supporting iPad at this point is crazy. Lots of the content, resources, etc. you have here would lend themselves to a larger view. I can see using iPhone version for quick updates, etc., but for deeper networking use, and maximizing the toolset you provide, the iPad is where it is at. I for one would use this much more if Universal- this looks like garbage on the iPad currently. Thanks so much- great product- just need some Universal support!"
4213,Lingling614,"April 21, 2012",3,"iPhone app on the iPad? I really wish this was designed for the iPad. It seems like you could get a lot more function into it with a true iPad app. Yes you can blow up the screen this version and on the new iPad it looks fine but it's annoying that there is more space that isn't effectively used. The iPhone app has to function a certain way because of size, the iPad doesn't have to function that same way."

I don't really like when app is enforcing me to give away my time and go over an intro of new features without giving me an option to opt out and go directly to the app. I understand what the product team is overly excited to announce new features, but being on the receiving end as a customer it sends a strong message how low opinion they have about users' abilities to learn it without any help."

Even before this problem, I disliked several features of this app. Why do I get an app notification to be forced to ""congratulate my friend's birthday or new job""? How is this notification worthy? Show it on website, but do not make it look like I need to get into Linkedin app, some people are expecting important messages through linkedin, and fake notifications like this just make it irritating. At least allow people to opt out."

It's just annoying with the amount of fake view notifications it sends and how it makes you skip through all these prompts just to use the site, when you can more easily get on your laptop and see the main page. Poor user experience in my opinion."

4231,AngelBurgin,"April 16, 2015",2,My Review I don't like it when people are allowed to look at my profile and  be anonymous. What if it is a person I don't want seeing it? That needs to be fixed where they can't use anonymous especially if it could be a person you don't want looking at it. You can't block them if you need to when you don't know who they are. Why are they choosing anonymous to begin with? What do they have to hide? I think the anonymous button needs to be disconnected.

And very little insight unless you buy one of their business plans that always seems to increase in price - was $10/month and now $50/month or more.

If main goal was to speed up the search I'm sure they could have done it without redesigning the entire app with such disastrous result. I am definitely not illiterate when it comes to gadgetry and can't even figure out how to endorse someone -- a fairly simple task. This was so unnecessary!

So for the lack of proper care for the users I gave it a lower mark, if this is fixed, ill change it."

It's easy to find on a pc, but I wish it worked on the app too. This review would for sure be a 5 star if this one little thing was resolved. Thanks!!"
4341,Worka lot,"May 25, 2016",5,"Great for Networking When starting out in your career, you never knew where to go, until there was LinkedIn. I absolutely love this app, it's convenient for finding colleagues in other areas, creating business leads, and recruiting talent. I use it for s variety of reasons, and it's part of my everyday routine."
4342,Mrs LG,"May 26, 2016",5,"A great resource LinkdIn is a great resource for anyone who is in business wanting to connect with others, to find out what the latest trends are or to find a job. The app is easy to use and free. You have the option to unlock additional features which of course will cost you."
4343,EileenMike,"June 19, 2016",5,"Great! The app makes it easy and convenient to stay connected via LinkedIn. It doesn't do quite everything the website version does, mostly account settings, etc. That said, I use the app 99% of the time. It's efficient, streamlined & pretty flawless in my experience."
4344,Scarfandgloves,"July 9, 2016",5,"The Biggest MMO game ever. I am awed at the scope of this game. Gameplay is super complex. Only some of your friends will really understand how to play. It is sometimes slow and could use more coin bonuses when leveling up, but otherwise decent. If you like Game of Thrones, LinkedIn is the mobile game you've been looking for."
4345,BCJ0719,"August 18, 2016",5,Gives appropriate guidance for maintaining professional relationships This app has recently been quite instrumental in helping me maintain my professional relationships better. It shows you when to reach out and gives you an example of what to say. I use LinkedIn now more than ever.
4346,BDKeen,"August 22, 2016",3,Deceptive Tactics This app will occasionally force you to go through a setup process of sorts even after you have set up the app. The deceptive part is they try to make it look like others have asked for you to connect when in reality you will be initiating the first request. This makes for a very poor user experience and deceptive behavior never makes me feel comfortable when trusting an app/company.
4347,Johnny Applesead,"April 21, 2017",5,Amazing! Fantastic!  Keep building up the great job features.  Love the ability for recruiters to discretely understand you are looking for new & exiting opportunities!  More options for this feature would be advantageous for those looking to move up or change paths in this world! Thank you :)
4348,BeverlyHillz88,"August 3, 2017",5,"Love it 👌🏼 It's like Facebook but just for the professionals. Love the Daily Rundown! Always keeps me up to date and sharp when carrying conversations with coworkers and patients. Kind of wish it would show me more people who I have a lot of connections with vs. people with one or no connections to me. Otherwise, love it! 👌🏼"
4349,HottyToddyAng,"August 12, 2017",5,"Use this almost daily Being a big networker and staying in touch with many different industries I found that this app is super helpful! It's easy to search for other professionals, looks at companies, see some jobs, and see the latest industry news."
4350,Oudiveboy,"December 3, 2015",1,Poor Redesign Dec 2015 update is EVEN WORSE! I got an invitation to connect and I went to the app and could not find the invite. Please listen to your users!!!
4351,NathanE227,"December 5, 2015",1,"Regression not Progression A poorly designed update, please offer the3 older version again as an option or go back.  The fact that on a tablet or iPad there is no landscape option should be enough to support the fact that this is a failed launch (supported by other reviewers).  Many more professionals are using tablets not laptops...and flipping back and forth between apps...this now looks like a 10 year old phone app that has never been updated.  Its not attractive and becomes less useful. Fix it, please."
4352,Poczbarb,"December 9, 2015",1,"The new version is bad I was very much happy with the old version...the new version although looks cool, it does not work... Often time when I try to view someone's profile I don't see their info, the app ""thinks"" and after a while I get an error message ""something went wrong, try again"" ... It's definitely not my internet connection so I hope someone at linked reads all these negative feedbacks about the update and does something about it. The App simply isn't as user friendly as it used to be."
4353,Charlie Frayer,"December 10, 2015",1,"DESERVES ZERO STARS!!! Is today April 1st? Because only a fool would find this update useful. First, it only supports portrait mode on my iPad? What!?! Yes, it's true. I can just see the LinkedIn pre-release meeting... "
4354,Lame?,"January 9, 2016",1,"New Version Frustration The new version of the app is really lacking in functionality. I have no way to see what companies and people I am following. So, if I know there's a particular company I want to check on, but can't remember the name, I'm stranded. It's also difficult to find info about people you're linked to. Rather, it wants to show me other people that were searched for. But,I'm looking at this person's profile for a reason, to find content related to that person. This version is really a let down."
4355,CDen630,"February 11, 2016",1,"When it ain't Broke- Don't try to fix it! Horrible update. It was great before the last update, it doesn't take in your info from profile, constantly asks if you want to add people without giving access to the contacts you have. It gets STUCK, and keeps showing the same feed of news, without updating. It's So Awful, I deleted it of my iPhone, and will use my desktop computer to access LinkedIn only. NOW- would be a Good time to FIX IT Please!! I won't reinstall the app until it's fixed!! :("
4356,Dmiller171,"March 24, 2016",5,"Amazing Job Search Tool If you are looking for a better job, or just searching for others in your field to share information this is the must have app. It takes time to grow your network so if your someone who expects instant results then get a dating app."

4358,Parksty,"May 2, 2016",5,Great update The new update combined with all the new stand alone applications makes the mobile  LinkedIn experience one that you can truly enjoy. I am happy where they have been able to take the mobile platform and look forward to its continued development.
4359,PaulinhaAPereira,"May 22, 2016",5,"Easy to use This LinkedIn app is very easy to use, very self explanatory and very useful.

4360,That Guy Doug,"May 27, 2014",5,"I Feel Connected, So LinkedIn! This app is awesome. It puts all other similar one's to shame as it is the best.

4361,WoollyJumpers,"June 29, 2014",5,"Easy access to most functions The app (iPhone and iPad) is not fully functional compared with the website. It does give quick access to email, connecting to new contacts, and viewing profiles--the tasks you're more likely to need on the go."
4362,Timmerbee,"July 10, 2014",4,"Buggy new release New release has a formatting bug in the Comment box. It's a text-wrapping error. If you try and type a comment longer than about 7 or 8 words the comments go off the right side of the visible screen and it's impossible to view your comments before posting - typing in the dark, as it were."
4363,Popofosho760,"September 2, 2014",4,"No complaints, mostly LinkedIn is obviously great, an incredible useful service. The app itself doesn't quite have the functionality of the website, and is definitely a pain to navigate sometimes. I think that it just takes a little while to figure out where everything is."
4364,Lilmama22,"September 25, 2014",3,It's a Little Buggy I'm happy with the changes of since my last rating of the app. But there's some minor bugs that should be addressed: 1) when you open mail it doesn't like to open at command 2) accepting a new connection    ...let's say I just log into the website to do that. 
4365,atlj,"February 9, 2015",1,Love LinkedIn...app is awful Sharing articles within the app is extremely difficult. See an article a contact posted. Open article within the app. Use social media buttons at the top of the article to share.  
4366,My iPod67,"March 5, 2015",5,What can I say? It works! I've been with LinkedIn for about a year. Over that time I have made a lot of connections and am now in the business I'm in right now and I love it!  But it doesn't stop there. I continue to use it for information and keep in touch with all my connections still.
4367,BrightxxEyes,"May 11, 2015",1,Terrible search engine I downloaded this app since it was difficult to search for jobs near my area using the mobile browser.  This app is just as bad as the mobile site. You can't search for specific administrative jobs near a specific area and then some window pops up to try their new job search app.. Really I thought I was already on a job searching app. Why should users have to download two separate apps to efficiently search for jobs? This why we visited LinkedIn in the first place.
4368,Its_Mo25,"October 2, 2015",5,Great Industry Connector ! I have been using LinkedIn to keep up to date on my industries news and have found it an easy way of connecting and socializing with great groups of people! The simplicity and sleek functionality of the app makes it easier to check and go on a busy day.
4369,teedubyaw,"November 26, 2015",1,"Does the LinkedIn exec team use this app? Because this app is almost unusable. The UX is horrible. To get back to the main menu after accepting a few connecting, you have to hit back several times beefier you can even get back to the home menu. Groups, bad on this app. Viewing shared connect, bad on this app. Sometimes you can share content, sometimes you can't.  Plus, Facebook updates their so every two weeks... We are lucky if LinkedIn updates every three months. Come on LinkedIn, get it together."
4370,Al Lane,"June 15, 2013",3,"App review Unfortunately, some of the same applications are not available on the mobile app that would be viewed on a normal desktop applications, For example, one cannot view someone's rawards and honors from the mobile app. Additionally, when searching for a new contact, the search feature only allows you to identify people already in your current list of connections.w"
4371,Craig 48512,"June 21, 2013",3,"Improving This latest version has gotten a lot more user friendly. Still, though, there are some annoying issues you wouldn't expect from such a large company. Even w/ a solid Internet connection, often times I get the ""Oops.  We can't pull this page"" message. In other cases, there's missing capability for no reason (e.g., how do I search for a group or company the same way I do a person?)."
4372,Hankergeoff,"September 5, 2013",2,"Decent, but... It's so, so glitchy. They never fix the issue where you choose a news story, but in between the time of your pressing the story, and the display responding to your choice, the app updates and your story that you originally wanted to read is now gone. Really frustrating."
4373,MJR in CF,"September 6, 2013",5,"Great App Allows you to have access to most of the desktop application with all the news feeds and other customized data feeds.  Includes ability to see who has viewed your profile, search, news feeds, and other standard features."
4374,Polydistortion,"September 8, 2013",5,"Could be so much more With the app in three parts only one works well enough to be considered special and it's the new feed.  Finding contacts, links, and looking at an adjusting your profile is a less than stellar experience.  Needs a serious revamp.  Perhaps version 3 will hit all the marks."
4375,AmerRuski,"September 13, 2013",1,"mediocre The app is not only limited by its functionality in that updates, mail, and so on has to be read/performed on the website instead of through the app, it also has profile errors in at least one instance.  On the website, I updated my blog that was formerly hosted by Blogger but is now on Wordpress to reflect the new URL, which it does just find on LI's website.  In the app, the old URL still shows.  So, limited features plus bugs of this nature are totally unacceptable. I'd give it a -2 stars if it were possible."
4376,Springtime6287,"February 12, 2014",4,"Better but still needs work This upgrade is much better than before but I think it still needs to evolve a little more. The actual website is great but I wish that the app had more functions that the website has like editing your profile. If this could be done, it would be perfect!"
4377,Chimi.Changa,"April 4, 2014",3,"Do not download contacts I tried downloading my Linkedin contacts hoping that it will match the names and fill all other blank fields. But it tries to match email addresses, so if you do not have the email address of one of your contacts on your phone, you'll end up with duplicate entries in your phonebook. So now I have many many duplicate entries in my phonebook which us extremely annoying."
4378,VRod2,"April 4, 2014",1,Never log in.  Kmpossible You can't even log in.  You reset your password in the browser.  You click the link. It tells you it's successful.  You try to log in the app.  It asks if you've forgotten your password    If you say No it gives you an image of two words.  You type them in.  If you're wrong you get another chance.  If you're right it goes back to ask you if you forgot your password.  If you say yes this time it sends you to the screen to reset your password and there's never a way to log in.  AWFUL
4379,Northforkmom,"April 28, 2014",4,"Pretty Good The app for my iPhone is pretty good. I like that it shows you have messages or requests. There are still too many steps to do simple things & you can't fully use the site without going through your laptop. However, to retrieve quick messages or new job postings on the go, the app is pretty good considering I am using it on my phone."

4383,Cristobel,"September 28, 2012",2,"Great idea...if the app worked I am a reformed foursquare addict. I use to check in everywhere, see if I could get a deal, compete with my friends, and sing its praises. But it's gotten less and less reliable, and I don't have time to try to check in three times everywhere I go because foursquare can't reach the Internet (when other apps can, just fine). Now I don't use it all. It shot itself in the foot, because you couldn't've had a more engaged user than I was."
4384,Scwcc,"October 10, 2012",2,"Works ok but functionality and integration poor Nice to be able to use on iPhone... But sometimes limited functionality makes I more frustrating than worthwhile. Simple things... No in mail. Can't edit invitations. Links from email go to safari and then ask if want app. Open the app. Also if opens in safari, can't also open app, as sees two logins and kills one. Group info and notifications not clean. No decent query parameters to search for people on app"
4385,jobohe,"January 3, 2013",2,"Generally a good app but the interface still needs to be cleaned up so if will make more sense. It's a bit wonky in how one searches for other users, for example, and apparently connection requests can't be customized when sent from here as they can be when sent from the web site. This doesn't have all the features of the LI site, but it's hard to tell which ones it has!"

One thing missing though - add locations to jobs please. It's really not difficult. Then I'll rate it 5 stars"

4391,Stefania H,"February 19, 2016",2,"Disappointed with lack of features The app is basic and lacks a lot of features that you can use on a desktop, such as job searching and advanced searches of people. I wouldn't download a second app just to job search. It's silly that I can't do both on one app. LinkedIn overall has gone down in features available and gone up in the price of membership over the last few years. So disappointing."

Really like it. Well done 😎👍"
4403,Turkish1801,"January 24, 2015",2,"Unable to remove connections? That's unnecessarily inconvenient While the app works fine in connecting to folks and browsing, it is a one way street. You can not disconnect with one of your connections via the app, which is EXTREMELY annoying and undoubtably intentional. I'm not a fan of intentionally bad programming as a means of getting customers to do what the company wants you to (in this case, acquire and keep as many connections as possible, even if they are no longer wanted)"

4409,Xyzqr,"January 1, 2016",1,"Huge misstep The latest version of the app is buggy and unresponsive - huge misstep and LinkedIn needs to address.  It takes a long time to load users, let alone your profile.  When a profile/screen does finally show up, it takes a long time to scroll or perform any actions (editing, scrolling, etc) on the app. More often than not the app just crashes.

Inspecting these files in the backup folder seems to reveal they are “person records” of people I’ve never heard of."
4421,fleurde_liz,"August 20, 2011",5,"I don't get all the negative feedback, I like it It's simple to use, with the newest update it looks and feels fun to use and it provides what I need, easy and quick access to my contacts, to search for other contacts and my inbox and my profile etc."
4422,Mehungie2,"September 6, 2011",5,"Surprised I'm shocked people don't like this update. This is now one of the cleanest and most stable apps I have ever seen. It's gorgeous. Very easy to navigate and just feels like what an app should feel like. Only wish would be to be able to make some profile changes while in app. Beautiful app, thank you."
4423,ItsAlwaysSuni,"April 22, 2012",3,"Two pieces of feedback 1) it's frustrating when you try to click on a link someone else posts to something in LinkedIn and it makes you login again.  I'm on the app, I'm already logged in!"
4424,FramptonsCamel,"April 28, 2012",3,"Not intuitive at all Having been a long time user of the previous LinkedIn app, I have to say that this new version, while being something that we iPad users have been previously left out, this one is not intuitive on how to use at all. I am completely lost. Also, In the older version I could enlarge the photos in profiles. Now I can't.  So far, I have not found myself embracing this 'iPad' update."
4425,Noisegui,"April 28, 2012",3,"Website is better The app interface is certainly nicer but it lacks much of the functionality that the website provides. Key things such as in-mail, advanced profile search filters, and saving profiles to your premium LinkedIn account are not available in the app. A nice simplified version, but needs much improvement to be an equal to the website experience."
4426,stephgallina,"September 28, 2012",4,"Good overall - one suggestion I enjoy using this app on my iPhone and iPad. One suggestion though is to give you the option to send an introduction (that you can edit) when sending a LinkedIn request. You can do this on the regular site but not the app, which I'm disappointed with. "
4427,Boomass,"December 3, 2012",1,"Nearly Useless Links to LinkedIn on iPhone don't work. Browser hangs forever. The redirect logic (to this app) is flawed. Worst of all, many have brought this to LinkedIn's attention, and it has not been fixed. I've run into this problem ever since the app was first launched and it's still broken."
4428,Rather-b-riding,"February 16, 2013",4,Decent but has some bugs Works pretty well for the most part. Has a couple bugs with regards to sending a reply to a message that was sent to you. And it would be nice to be able to delete connections from within the app as well. But overall works pretty well and I don't have much to complain about.
4429,Schmidt21,"March 8, 2013",4,"Great app, though buggy lately Great app for tracking contacts and knowing who you are meeting with.  After recent release though the integration on iPhone which allowed downloading/merging with contacts will no longer work.  This was great to get profile pictures into your address book.  Please fix this in next release."
4430,HughAK,"July 13, 2009",5,Well done I'm glad LinkedIn saw fit to put out their own app. I've seen a lot of apps before that try to tie into 3rd party web sites but nothing works as well as ones designed by the sites developers themselves. This app is a keeper and I'll always be installing it on my iPhone even after I reset.

4432,Chris73BruceLee,"September 21, 2016",5,"Use it everyday - Well done! I use this app everyday, to check the updates, to reply to my connections, to share. You can easily ask to connect to someone. I think I like it better than the website itself for some features. Good job!"
4433,Stëfüsh,"October 17, 2016",5,Love it Joined to keep in touch with professional contacts in a more professional setting. Enjoy not wading through endless pics of everyone's dinner or vacations or  whatever we're posting today. Also enjoy the discussions & articles from people in my field.
4434,nhmtnbkr,"October 19, 2016",2,"Latest version buggy and prone to failure This app used to be a handy complement on the iPhone to the desktop version, but over the latest two updates or so has become useless more often than not.  When you can get it to open, it frequently shows things like connection requests or profile views have occurred, but the won't show them to you.  It also bogs down and processes endlessly about 80+% of the time."
4435,DJ MoRy,"October 21, 2016",5,The best version 👍🏻 I use Linkedin apps for few minutes before i delete it because of the impracticality! 
4436,pixelwulf,"January 13, 2017",4,"Great free app to help you grow This is a great free application that allows people to connect professionally and allows someone to find personal career growth.

4437,Mememememememeeeee,"April 27, 2017",5,Such a helpful tool! LinkedIn has helped me find potential jobs and actually got me employment. This tool can be crucial in finding a job.

4438,Randall R. Edwards,"May 8, 2017",1,"Randall R.Edwards, Sheriff (Retired) I have had a free LinkedIn account for about eight years, I have accumulated over thirty five hundred contacts. LinkedIn will no longer allow me to accept any new contacts. Every time I try to accept an invitation to connect, it just goes to ""building contacts"" and ""calendar sync"" and offers me an opportunity to try LinkedIn premium for a month free. I have tried to contact LinkedIn with the problem and have not been able get a response, I'm guessing they no longer allow free accounts!"
4439,kraddy_007,"September 2, 2017",5,Great professional app I created LinkedIn in account however started using only from weeks..

4441,The Advocate of Faces,"June 10, 2015",5,Love this app I love this app because it allows me to connect with customers even after hours. We can communicate without any middle men and time constraints.
4442,Dnayro,"July 24, 2015",3,"Freezes too often Although convenient, it is frustrating that I have to retype comments and messages multiple times due to the app freezing. Also after reading a few articles it usually freezes and I have to close the app (stop in the background) and reopen. It would be nice if there were more setting-features on the app."
4443,Kjvdp,"September 2, 2015",3,"Not bad, but not great. I got the app looking to network out a little bit. It has it's positives, but every time I open the app I am asked to upgrade and to see ""who I know."" If I didn't add people in the first time, I'm not going to the 100th time either. Also, cannot search for the skills that I want to update. The interface tries, but fails, to be a Facebook style. Just an overall poorly designed app."
4444,NicSchultz,"September 8, 2015",1,"Very annoying I want to like this app. I want to use it and grow in my industry and take advantage of all it has to offer.. But the terrible design of this app makes all that impossible. At least on mobile. The last straw is now I can't even use the app because it's asking me to download it's sister app and won't register me pressing the ""not now"" button. Fix your app LinkedIn!!!! It shouldn't take several minutes to open a discussion, especially when you email me All The Time about them. Poor show."
4445,copyright1971,"December 2, 2015",1,"Still terrible LinkedIn consistently has the worst mobile experience of any professional tool that I use regularly. The web site has viewport and text field issues, but the iOS apps are even worse, and the recent update doesn't change that. Why they are unable or unwilling to present a mobile experience comparable to the desktop web interface is just baffling, and it really limits my on the go usage. Competing app developers take note: it's a perfect opportunity for disruption."
4446,Hoots in Boots,"December 4, 2015",1,"One Step Backwards for Mankind Despite the value of LinkedIn as a professional social networking application, the decision to force the tablet version to mimic the phone version, banishing the landscape version without giving the option to choose, was unintelligent to a remarkable degree.  It's an arrogant and callous decision, not unlike ACT!'s decision to move to the SQL database, which caused many of its loyal users to leave it enmasse causing it to virtually disappear from favor overnight.  My only regret is that there are no negative stars with which to rate this new (spew) version."
4447,iScout707,"December 13, 2015",1,"The worst design update I had become used to the original UX, this latest update just ruined it entirely.  The only thing good is the Messaging section at the bottom - the entire message threads are well organized.  Everything. Else is bad - profile summary is collapsed, my network section has two icons on the top, they aren't intuitive.  I couldn't even find the Who's viewed my profile section.  This is an ugly update, and I hope users are given an option to revert to the original one."
4448,Joy Ozzie,"February 12, 2016",4,"Easy to use, and could improve I like to speed at which I can make contact with my network. "

Has some stability issues to work out. I hate that some users confuse its intent with FB by posting inappropriate content: selfies, personal updates with no business context etc. Hope they can get that under control."
4450,Laag_mba,"October 16, 2013",3,"No new features, and even reduced funtionality I like the app but it is still a far cry from the web version in terms of what you can do. I also notice that the ""view original article"" feature is not showing the article at all and now I have to open it in the browser!?!?"
4451,greenleesh,"December 3, 2013",1,Older was better If you haven't updated from version 6 yet then DON'T!! This new version is HORRIBLE!!! They took away the ability to see who's endorsed you and let you endorse others on iPad. Now when you click on a link or profile it creates a new window and they just stack on top of each other and are as annoying as crap. You also can't edit as much on your profile. Yea it looks prettier... But I want function over fashion! Going to your profile through Safari or chrome is more efficient!
4452,dxbrebel,"January 22, 2014",4,Great progress Works fairly well for accessing LinkedIn on the go. A bit too much focus on pushing a FB/Twitter style newsfeed. Would be great if they could integrate CardMunch functionality into this app and allow scanning of business cards. Not easy to find contact info of people or sync it to your phone. Tries to force you to message on linkedin's platform.
4453,Bubbsies,"March 23, 2014",4,"App Review I cannot figure out how to edit my profile in the app. Like change or add a photo, for example. "
4454,Rj92010,"May 10, 2014",4,"Works well I like the current iOS version. While you cannot do all of the same things as you can from the desktop version, you can still get caught up on updates, search for people, search for company info., and receive and send messages. These are the functions I need while I am on the go."
4455,Stephen MacIntosh,"July 18, 2014",4,"Cool App LinkedIn is cool...connects us to lots of other people in a professional way at the click of a mouse.   Only complaint I have is when I see I have new connections in the drop down menu, I try to click on one of them and it takes me to all of my connections...top of the alphabetized list.   This feature is lame.  Can't they fix that??"

"
4461,nameistaken1984,"December 31, 2012",2,"Lots of work needed!! This app is OK I guess for when you don't have access to a desktop. My messages constantly mess up or won't send and I've missed numerous important emails thru this app. Luckily for me, the people had my personal email and sent them to that also so being that this is suppose to be for ""professional/business"" networking, it's worthless.

4462,Lirpa22,"January 2, 2013",1,"Works better on desktop & phone than iPad Just started using this for iPad mini and am finding it very cumbersome to use (; even on my iPhone it works much better. There's no way to use the Linked In jobs function when I look at the iPad app. Maybe using the full website is better for iPad. Not impressed at all. Hope they fix this! Also, can't view my full mailbox - not only inbox, but sent mail, etc. please make this more like the full site or at least the way it functions on iPhone."
4463,Arcman85,"January 2, 2013",1,Linkedin Had this App for a while. Went through a few updates and it never worked correctly. Over half the time it wouldn't open correctly and it would ask whether i wanted to download the App even though i already had it installed. After having to decline downloading it again it would open only some times then it was just plain cumbersome to use. Just got so frustrated that I finally deleted it and will wait till hopefully the creators develop one that works.
4464,Emkaytoo,"February 26, 2013",1,"App over. Crash = very yes This app loads the main screen fairly quickly, and provides three main navigation choices. Once you make your selection, the app will promptly tell you to ""eff off"" because it will crash. LinkedIn is an amazing service, and this app is embarrassing to the brand. Whoever okayed this app for distribution (iPad mostly) should be promptly fired for gross negligence."
4465,AdKel,"April 18, 2013",5,"Good news aggregator I mostly use the LinkedIn app as a news aggregator for business articles. Works well for that. It's nice that its also a social network at the same time. This version is a little less user friendly than the last, but works just as well."

4467,Ds wvu,"June 14, 2013",5,Best version of LinkedIn for iPhone yet The new update makes LinkedIn more user friendly than before and the presentation of content is cleaner and more accessible.

4469,Acfotester,"August 9, 2013",5,Great App I love this app and website. The app gives me access to everything on the website seamlessly. It's very easy to use. If I had to criticize one thing it would be not being able to access an email thread from the mail section. But I am sure that will come soon.
4470,Shani Uwimana,"October 20, 2011",5,"Easy and smooth The new app is extremely easy and fun to use! I love the new interface for all the sections (email, inbox, groups, etc) and i love new interactions available such as the groups. Linkedin had made a tremendous improvement which had made me use it more. Keep it going!!"
4471,Devyn5,"May 1, 2012",1,"Clunky at best For a company born in the social media spotlight, I expected much better. For all that you can do in a browser interface on a pc, I expected to be blown away with the iPad interface, add to that how long it has taken you to go from an iPhone app to an iPad app, and my expectations were apparently too high. All I can say is that I have come to depend on LinkedIn as a necessary business tool that I have to use daily, unfortunately for now,  I'll keep accessing it via my pc or my iPhone. You guys are capable of MUCH better, this is sad."
4472,3shaman3,"August 4, 2017",5,"If you're on social media you GOT to be on LinkedIn!! If you use social media for business, perhaps not every platform is right for you, but EVERYONE should be on LinkedIn.

4473,Cofield64,"August 12, 2017",5,"Positive & Motivational networking 🙌🏾 I really enjoy networking on LinkIn not only does it gives updated information in the business world but, it promote encouragements & confidence to move forward to bigger and greater advantages that you may dream about but never thought about putting into action."
4474,Bruins1919,"August 12, 2017",5,"Nice alternative I've been using Facebook to keep up with friends and family, but also as my news source.  The negativity and unreliable sources is just out of control anymore.  With LinkedIn, I feel like I just found out where the grown ups are hanging out."
4475,minecraft194792,"August 18, 2017",5,"Great business tool LinkedIn provides one of the best business connection and development tools in the market.

4480,w_Dennis3445,"October 6, 2016",5,"Hdl39 Great app. Love the new job search and career search tools, it's like having a headhunter in your pocket, who's letting you know about opportunities and what you need to do to prepare for careers.

It included congratulating people, birthdays and accepting invitations. After speaking with the LinkedIn help desk it turns out that the product management team deprecated this feature. To accomplish the same daily task that used to take 5 min I now must go to three places and even then it still does not do a good job of telling me what is going on. Product Management please bring this feature back."

4483,EbethBerkeley,"January 19, 2017",1,Latest update broke the app I am very disappointed in the latest release. My feed won't update for more than a week now and the search function doesn't work and keeps returning 'no such profile' when you search for someone (who you KNOW is definitely on LinkedIn!). This is horrible for such an important and heavily used app.  This should have been fixed ASAP.  Fix it please.  It's starting to look bad.  I have resorted to using the LinkedIn Sales Navigator app. At least that is working!

I hope the suggestion does not go both ways."

4507,Mstggrl44,"March 4, 2015",3,Needs some tweak in for whatever reason my app keeps crashing as sain as I open it Since the last update the connections of the people I'm connected to are no longer displaying. Also you really need an option to edit from the Facebook app. It would make it far easier than to have to keep trying to use the full site using my phone.
4508,Anothermark2,"May 30, 2015",5,"Linked In Excellent site for professionals and job seekers with serious intention of being all they can be. The contacts you make and help snd suggestions you can acquire through participating in this site can not only promote your efforts, but enhance many aspects of your life and career. Get involved, get Linked In."
4509,yulanalytics,"September 23, 2015",1,The LinkedIn app gets worse with every update It would be nice if LinkedIn actually QA they app prior to release to fix all the bugs that are introduced in every new update. It would be even nicer if LinkedIn fixed some of those annoying bugs but with the latest update they really went over the wall. Every time the app is launched it asks you to connect to your contacts and no matter how many times you choose to cancel the prompts still come up with no way to stop it.
4510,Dreamripple,"June 5, 2013",5,Nice Improvements! I used earlier versions of this app and stopped due to a lack of functionality. That has been changed for the better!
4511,ArizonaKyle,"October 9, 2013",1,Terrible The LinkedIn app interface is too bulky to be useful.  This app is only good for messaging and approving invites.  I need to use my PC for all the heavy lifting.
4512,sumansen,"October 17, 2013",4,"Overall very good! Like the new update and the overall presentation. Navigation is very easy, although accessing groups is a little tricky."
4513,AnetMac,"December 28, 2013",5,Business owner I have seen linkedin from the beginning. I like each upgrade and change. Great work. Continue to advance and move forward improving and making better. Just as we are in our life and post about ourselves right here on LinkedIn ;) upward and onward!!
4514,md_21,"January 7, 2014",3,"Staying in touch Works great to stay in touch with colleagues including good people you may have met only once.  The user interface has some shortcomings - confusing between laptop, tablet and phone versions.  Some desired operations are not intuitive - ex, how to search for a specific influencer to follow.  (finding companies is easy) Disappointed the current reading interests were removed."
4515,adambianchi,"January 13, 2014",5,"Useful Daily Great app! I use it almost everyday. I find this version to be more stable and I can get to more of the features I need. There's always room for improvement - continue evolving the mobile version toward the website version. Overall, one of my most useful apps."
4516,Emria,"April 3, 2014",5,"Linked In Is the BEST! LinkedIn is so live & so busy. There's a lot of interaction & feedback from viewers & people always appreciate what one does, whether it's Music, Acting, IT work, they are always complimenting other's work & are very inspirational , uplifting & mature individuals. They're definitely supportive & are always ready to cheer! "
4517,K12Reformer,"April 19, 2014",2,"The NSA of apps LinkedIn is a good business resource.  But I've got this love/hate relationship with it.  Using the website is so much easier... I find the iOS app to be awkward at best, and downright confusing at worst."
4518,Gronk if your horny,"April 28, 2014",4,Removal I think the overall app is very good. The only thing I would suggest adding is a way to remove contacts. I have a handful that do nothing but constantly spam or like pictures of women. I know I can do it from my laptop but 99.5% of the time I am using my smartphone. Just a suggestion. It's a great tool for the professional person.
4519,Juniorraz,"May 20, 2014",4,"Good app, great for networking. Very good app. The networking ability is great but the poorer business card integration with Evernote is a disappointment compared to previous integration with CardMunch. I would like the connections filters from the web-based version to be available on this app. That would make it easier to contact certain groups."
4520,g_l_h,"November 17, 2008",2,"New Release is a Step Backwards I'm a Linked In addict and WAS very pleased with the application's features. Yesterday, I downloaded the latest release (after receiving notification). Now, when someone in my Linked In community adds a contact I can only see the name of the added party, but can't click/touch their name for more information (unlike the first visual shown).  Dilutes the whole point of the application. The previous release was better.  "
4521,aaa25,"September 11, 2009",5,"Not functional Beenusing the web site for years and love it. However, the app is useless. Too few features. Search options are of no use. Would love to use this app on the road but can't. "
4522,GaMeBoY439,"November 16, 2011",4,"Great app, almost perfect This is a really smooth, easy-to-use app for LinkedIn and it has a lot of great features and functionality, however it is lacking some features as well. For instance, people should be able to search for and join groups from this app. So far, I only saw search for people. Other than that, great app!"
4523,cowgoesrowr,"December 16, 2011",3,"Spotty performance For all the supposed improvements over the last version (there has been some, at least), this app's performance still has some leaps and bounds to go. Too many times do I get stuck on a page that just keeps loadin' and loadin'and never loads! "
4524,pbnpres,"February 17, 2012",3,"Patience is Thin with Linked-In After all this time, how is it possible that Linked-In has not made a native iPad version.    For a service that prides itself on being the platform for professionals, Linked-In behaves most unprofessionally.   Most users I know have the same complaint .   Will Linked-In please tell us whether and when they will catch-up with every other social network by issuing an iPad version."
4525,Spacedrum,"April 9, 2013",1,Worthless! LinkedIn... Your days are numbered... ... and that means you'll have to got to craigslist to get another job! This app is a total mess!!!
4526,App reviewer 05,"May 29, 2013",2,"Privacy Issue Great way to connect with  business professionals, however the app interface isn't great. Also, my least favorite part about LinkedIn is that you cannot block a user who is creepily stalking your page... even after reporting it. Users should be able to block people.  I am about to deactivate my account because a person will not stop looking at my page and it's making me very uncomfortable for my privacy and safety..."
4527,la234567,"August 13, 2017",2,Too busy There are two major problems with this app: 1) It has WAY too much going on. The UI is too busy and I can't see what I want right away. 2) It is constantly trying to trick me into giving it access to the contacts on my phone so that it can spam everyone I've ever met and invite them to join my network. The fact that it asks me this over and over is the worst part. Just ask once and then go away.
4528,Havok084,"August 24, 2017",5,"Great place for business professionals to connect I love LinkedIn, it's a great place to connect and network with like minded business professionals. LinkedIn allows you to showcase your skills and abilities while connecting with potential recruiters and job postings. Great app, great website, great business platform."
4529,CERTIFIED DJ B,"September 8, 2017",5,"Thankful! This app has the tools to give you an express network, and connection to numerous opportunity. It gives you motivation to do more , in order to increase your profile . It has been an excellent tool for my career. Even with my recent opportunity to attend Yale's SOM. Thanks LinkedIn!"
4530,Mikey33358,"March 8, 2016",1,"Creepy How does LinkedIn manage to make a bad app worse? Download the update and find out. It's still laggy. Shows less relevant data. And also now is much more creepy. Somehow it's tracking my location because it ""suggests"" that maybe I want to update my profile to a new City which I happen to visit frequently. There are no location service settings for the app so I don't know if it's bypassing privacy settings or somehow reading my IP and broadly knowing where I am with no way to turn it off."
4531,Haider12,"May 26, 2016",5,"A great app My use of Linkedin has increased after I started using latest app. The way it is organized for notifications, headlines, connections and suggestions make it easier to use. In seconds you congratulate people on their roles. Sharing news is easy and fun."
4532,Karennadoll,"July 28, 2016",1,Watch your privacy setting Yesterday I updated my APP. Today I Woke  up  only to get a calendar notification from Linked in. They said the new APP will periodically search my calendar and connections to make better suggestions.   that is a horrible feature they just hacked my phone info and put it on their sever.   
4533,Brianc768768,"November 13, 2016",2,LinkedIn review App is fine. The idea of it is great. Sadly the only thing I have to say negative is that it is slowly turning into Facebook. It used to be a site for networking professionals. It has now turned into a politics and opinion filled site with rare professional job postings or job related things. I deleted my Facebook because of those reasons and I feel I'm going to do the same with LinkedIn unless it changes back to what it's intended use was for.
4534,Phantomr4g,"January 18, 2017",2,"EXTREMELY BUGGY The app is terrible. It keeps thinking I recently created my profile and registers none of my updates as if I didn't have any because I just created my profile...even though I've been active on it for a while. It keeps crashing all the time. I can't even look at my LinkedIn profile through safari because it shoots me back into the app. Fix it, it shows how poorly linked in cares about their users..."
4535,Bo Duman,"February 17, 2017",5,"Best app to network and ultimately land you your dream job Linked in is by far the best way to get recognized between the professionals in your industry. And get recognized. And if you have some character, write an article now.. and see what reaction you may get. And it spreads like wild fire from there. Learn linked in well"
4536,MaryluBPL,"March 22, 2017",5,"Love it Easier search, super fluid, not too busy, really nice render... also love notifications and ability to continue to share, search for people, post, like, etc. when I'm on the go. Could use an easy integration (back and forth) with sales navigator app but all in all I love it!"
4537,GeoffGuss,"June 8, 2017",4,"Love it but needs tweaked Love the app, but why not let us sort our feed by most recent like you can on the full site?  Also, please consider allow sorting the people we may know by number of mutual contacts.  It's silly to see people is share 3, 5, and 7 contacts with and then scroll down to find one with 345!"
4538,iamabthomas,"June 30, 2017",5,Facebook for Professionals It's not my phrase… But I love it! I recently read somewhere that LinkedIn is positioned to be the new Facebook for professionals and I totally agree. From applying to jobs to finding great articles or just keeping up with past and current coworkers… LinkedIn has changed my life!
4539,nevertotallygrowup,"July 13, 2017",5,"Great app Sometimes in life you just find things that just work.  This is one of those times.  I am very happy at my current job but I log into this app at least once a day.  I learn something new about one on my connections or how one CEO treats his staff.  The range of informations is fantastic, Great job."
4540,T568B,"February 9, 2015",5,"Convenient I don't have a lot of time to spend on LinkedIn, just being honest. So I like that this app notifies me of the important things (messages, connections, etc.). I can check them, reply and quickly get back to work. I also use the LinkedIn Connect app. It works great as well."
4541,Obroberg,"February 14, 2015",5,My main networking app I have become s reliant on the LinkedIn app I can't imagine what I would do without it.  This iPhone app is well designed and fits all the important features into a compact package. I do notice sometimes it does not communicate right away with my LinkedIn app on my computer.
4542,Turkish Express,"April 18, 2015",2,Another social exploitation network... Being able to connect with actual coworkers and people from your industry for networking is fine but often you're exploited by mass recruiters. You have to pick and choose carefully or you will be receiving useless messages all day. Also every time you open the application it puts you through the same information/setting you skipped purposely. I just don't use it anymore.
4543,Matthewdon,"June 8, 2015",2,"Stop showing emails and asking me to add contacts First, LinkedIn displays your PERSONAL email address to all your contacts. Because of this, I changed my email address and only included one that is for LinkedIn. I kept getting spammed from contacts. "
4544,Chaz174279752,"September 17, 2015",4,"Simple, effective I'm a fan of LinkedIn. The app will unexpectedly close from time to time, and gives me a new user tutorial a little more often then I'd like. It's a very small detriment to the application though. The application is very simple to use, and I recommend it for your portable device as The LinkedIn website has more function."
4545,kwadublin,"November 10, 2015",5,Best app and site for professional networking My one only site and app for professional networking.  I use it almost daily.  The iOS app is very useful for getting info before going into a meeting or quickly jogging my memory about people/names/mutual connections when I'm out.
4546,serg718,"December 13, 2015",1,Revert back immediately This the first time I ever taken the time out of my day to write a review on a APP but this new update is horrendous.
4547,GoPitt,"December 15, 2015",1,From everyday user to a never user Where do I start to list the ways in which this app is totally useless? The whole app seems to minimize the ways in which I can actively manage my network of both PEOPLE and COMPANIES while maximizing LinkedIn's opportunities to collect more data about me (i.e. fill in more profile data or create more connection).  The whole thing just feels like a scam now for them to leverage our data while providing little value to the users.  Such a huge step backwards!
4548,By JMC,"December 22, 2015",2,"Improvements, suggestions and frustrations... I'd been an avid LinkedIn mobile user, but the updates have seriously reduced my enjoyment and time spent using the app."
4549,Waldonese,"January 1, 2016",1,"Why!!!!  Terrible Update!!! The new update is awful.  What used to be a 5 star app, is now a waste of time.  Please change this app back.  The new updates are convoluted, they in no way help.  We used to be able to endorse with ease, find connections with ease, edit with ease, now it's a jumbled mess. Was a huge fan, now I'm just disappointed.  Poorly done.  Anybody who gives this new version of LinkedIn a good review, obviously had some hand in designing the new platform.  They did a terrible job, completely dropped the ball."
4550,danboy777mi,"May 11, 2014",4,"Clean interface, Always Improving Nice user experience. I think it's great but my one complaint is the clunky-ness in giving and receiving reviews. Even the desktop experience makes it hard. I have people willing to give them but LinkedIn makes it really hard to find and execute the process. Anyway - that's my big gripe so 4 stars."
4551,Frenchy1967,"May 14, 2014",4,"Linked In I have joined several groups and most of the others in the group are CEO's or somewhere high up. I have lots of hands on experience but do not have a PHD. I am ignored and feel that I have nothing to offer these highly learned people even I may know as much as they know. So I have a high school diploma, experience can put me equal with someone else."
4552,Divotdope,"May 20, 2014",4,"Good app for working professional disciplines This app is beneficial for individuals who have a trade or skill to easily look around to other disciplines or fields to seek future opportunities. Although lately I have discovered material that is more along the lines of an individuals' preference and not of the individuals' profession. Be that as it may be, this app is very useful for a person who is seeking new opportunity."
4553,Mrs.Dlynn029,"July 11, 2014",4,"I ENJOY this App BUT... LinkedIn has allowed me to connect and network with a lot of different professionals across the world; however one thing I wish they would fix is letting you review a job description after you've already applied to it...sometimes I have to revisit all aspects of the job entails just in case I get an interview, but I can't!"
4554,Lmcmayo,"September 17, 2014",5,"Best professional social media outlet out there! From managing your online profile, resume, connecting with people in your industry or not, I recommend being on LinkedIn for anyone. It's been a great marketing tool for me and I've met a lot of clients through this outlet that I've developed solid relationships with."
4555,Abusser,"September 20, 2014",3,"Poor flow The app is generally clean, but the workflow is poor.  For instance, when I get an email from someone wanting to connect, I have make 4-5 clicks to accept it instead of just one, and I have to find each of the clicks.  A better way to do it would be for the email to have a click to open the app and go directly to the page where I can accept or decline the connection."
4556,Dogwood Threads,"December 4, 2014",5,"Love this app. It is simple and easy to navigate. Unlike most social apps, LinkedIn kept it basic and user friendly. I only have one complaint and it's not having the option to remove a connection unless you're on the desktop site."
4557,JDubinsky,"January 19, 2015",4,"Good, stable app. Other areas of improvement Overall the app is good and stable and does what it's supposed too. My only complaint is as a student there should be a cheaper version of the pro subscription. Down the road after students graduate they would be more likely to pay the higher subscription rate."
4558,Vinny 0601,"February 8, 2015",5,"Great App, and Powerful Tool Excellent app.  The interface is really easy to learn, and the news stories are always an interesting read.

4559,metafedora,"February 9, 2015",3,"Great for networking, OK for social media For many professionals, a LinkedIn profile is essential career component. It's where recruiters find you, and your colleagues will actually visit the site so there's a chance for actual networking."

4571,Lheurung,"November 19, 2011",1,"Terrible USer Experience I'm not sure who thought up dividing the inbox from updates, profile, and friends--but this app could be natively designed for half the price of this custom app. Nothing makes sense. A 5 tab bar at the bottom would make a huge difference is UX and user flow. This app looks cheap and was not thought out. It's one of the most frustrating apps to use, especially compared to its desktop website. Every website should have a similar feel to its mobile app and vise versa--not here!"

Its trying to be more facebook like but turns out not user friendly at all."
4584,Jennahealsberg,"March 10, 2016",1,"Not a fan since the update I was a daily LinkedIn app user, but am underwhelmed by the recent update and can't get into this redesign.  Notifications are irrelevant (and not all adjustable) - my preferred action is certainly not to send a prefabricated DM.  Settings are buried, jobs section gone, and the LinkedIn jobs app doesn't hold the same relevant value.  The shown content also seems to have lost value (new algorithm or personalization attributes?).  I really want to like it, and gave it a shot, but believe the team can do better."

I guess that's what happens in the app world and sadly why Microsoft phones will struggle as long as app developers give half hearted attempts to support lesser used platforms.
4597,Chrisszl,"February 11, 2015",2,Ought to be called LogIn It is unbelievable how frequently I need to RE-login to this app. It's annoying as hell to have to login over and over and over. I'm not rebooting my phone. This doesn't contain my credit card or password information. Yet LinkedIn doesn't seem to be able to keep my logged in. 
4598,Gtbcpa,"June 3, 2015",5,"Love it Since I don't do Facebook, Twitter or other social media, Linked In is my way to stay connected with professionals and to network. I really enjoy seeing what people are up to professionally and reading the articles that others post as well as posts from contributors I follow."
4599,up-island Cory,"June 19, 2015",4,"Essential App Have been using app for years. Keeps getting better and better. My most used app by a mile. Use it for hours everyday. Essential for business. One piece of functionality that I wish could be added is the ability to send shared LI content to email addresses outside of just LI connections. Aside from this, I love the app."
4600,Kindra,"May 26, 2011",2,"Needs Groups and Profile Editing! The one thing I use linkedin for on a consistent basis is connecting with groups.  I rely on groups to further my professional development.  It is an asset that makes linkedin special.  So why isn't it available through the app?  Also, perhaps I want to change my picture or other personal data while on the go.  Adding these two features would boost my rating of 2 stars to 4 automagically."
4601,Mixyplixl,"May 3, 2012",2,"Missing key functions, confusing interface My excitement over the new app quickly turned to frustration and disappointment. The navigation is very confusing, and the main function I use all the time-- my contacts-- is buried within one's  profile with no way of easily searching them.  There seem to be all sorts of additional pages of content that I am not going to use, while I can't use the ones I need."
4602,Love joy 2,"December 20, 2012",1,"This version keeps crashing I have the latest version and it has shut down three times tonight when I was searching for colleagues using my iPad. I could not enter names in the search box without the app freezing, flashing, and then shutting down back to the icon. This does not happen on the iPhone. I performed the exact operation on my phone and it worked perfectly.  I have had zero problems with earlier versions and loved the app. Am hoping this is fixed so I can give a stronger rating."

"
4605,jk mavs,"April 21, 2013",3,LinkedIn app needs plenty of work Tried to connect with a friend but I couldn't because the iPhone app requires you to input an email. I didn't know my friend's email and couldn't connect even though I found his LinkedIn profile. So close to connecting with my friend but yet so far. Facebook doesn't require you to know the friend's email to connect when you find their page.
4606,Jmarinuc,"June 17, 2013",3,Can't search for groups I am using the iPhone five and I downloaded the LinkedIn application and When I try to send out invitations to connect with people from my phone it tells me it sends but when I go into my inbox and click under sent invitations it does not show that I sent any invites at all! Does anyone else have this problem! I can only add connections via my computer!
4607,William Rosenberg MD,"June 28, 2013",1,"Poor implementation Unfortunately, I have to agree with the poor reviews here. The most frustrating is that the app at first glance seems to be very promising. Once you start using it for a while, one can see it's a very poor implementation. On the iPad,it would have been better to just improve the Safari experience. One example - if one tries to leave a comment, once the words exceed the small provided box, they run off the box and cannot be seen. The whole experience is a lesson in frustration."
4608,Dman666666,"August 8, 2013",1,"Why LinkedIn why??? LinkedIn, you have an amazing concept. How could you possibly allow such an awful app for the iPad? Do you think maybe we could update our profiles? We can't even search for jobs (yet that's available on the iPhone?) if I were you I would fix this quick before you turn into the next ""my space""...Facebook came around with the same concept and better user interface.

4612,BIZ_PYLET,"April 29, 2017",1,"Notifications are ridiculous While the LinkedIn platform is useful, this app has a serious problem with bombarding you with notifications. I have every notification option turned off, yet the badge counter continues to show notifications. All. Day. Long. It's incredibly annoying to open the app and see that, yet again, there's nothing of importance about which to be notified, yet notified it does anyway. One star until the company rethinks its notifications."

4618,Mr. David M.,"August 24, 2017",5,"Helpful and Friendly The LinkedIn app encourages users to stay in touch with their connections by wishing them happy work anniversaries and birthdays. Messages are pre-crafted, and are customizable. The pre-crafted messages are helpful for busy professionals like me. It continues to be helpful even a year later."

4621,TJTaege9009,"January 23, 2016",1,"The Layout and Usability are Terrible Since the redesign j find it impossible to figure out what's going on in the LinkedIn app. I just have to go to PC to see if I have new notifications. There are multiple red dot notifications for the same thing in several different places, then when you click that section there is a bunch of irrelevant information. The layout makes no sense. The old app had similar to logic to the website which makes much more sense. Unusable at this point."
4622,ris4mis,"March 2, 2016",5,Mobile LinkedIn - don't leave work without it. Having this app on my phone has allowed me to keep up with LinkedIn whenever I have a few minutes here and there. It is extremely easy to use and well organized.

4630,Highminded,"September 1, 2015",4,"Flawed Interface Due to a flawed mobile functionality - an errant hand movement automatically sent invitations to connect to everyone of LinkedIn's ""suggestions"" - whether appropriate or not.  This was extremely upsetting.  There was no dialog box/warning saying ""are you sure"" or any kind of fail-safe/safety measure.  This I find is a major flaw."

4634,Fransua Frank,"December 2, 2015",5,Compliments desktop LinkedIn I think that desktop LinkedIn is better than mobile LinkedIn. I should be able to do everything I do on desktop LinkedIn in mobile LinkedIn but I cannot right now. But still a good compliment to desktop version.
4635,Th3d0n1,"December 5, 2015",1,"New interface is buggy and does not work The new interface is beautiful, would be more useful if it actually worked. I cannot read messages or receive alerts.

On one marathon session I dismissed over a hundred contacts I didn't know only to have them reappear later. Like my dead mother, for instance. I am not kidding. LinkedIn really wants to insist I link up with my dead mother, and it won't take no for an answer."
4637,Snowtorn,"December 11, 2015",2,"Missing landscape. App doesn't look like LinkedIn. This app seems to not know what it is, who its audience is. iPad users use landscape view constantly. The lack of landscape view is the kind of oversight you'd expect from a novice app developer."
4638,Wgoren,"December 13, 2015",1,"Linked in new app I completely agree with the reviewers that say the new linked in app is beyond horrible. In addition to what has been noted, I find the pastel concentration is very difficult on my eyes as is the added brightness. JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Should have never upgraded but was finding it difficult not to do so because content was being portrayed in new version. Also, not all my groups migrated over and getting to groups is difficult. Also, my groups did not all transfer over."
4639,Jend80,"December 16, 2015",1,Hate this update!! 0 Stars. LinkedIn get it together. This latest update is so awful I'm considering taking it off my phone and sticking to desktop only (unless you plan on screwing that up too). No...I'm not going to download multiple apps for 1 site. I hated it when Facebook did it and have no idea how that's still around.  This entire experience is clunky and irritating and I haven't talked to 1 person that disagrees and we are all young and tech savvy so that's not the problem. Please change it!

When you use this app, it is slow, cumbersome, and scattered.  It is sad that the web version on a tiny mobile screen is better.

If I could give it a negative star rating, I would."

Performs the basic functions with ease. The bad reviews must come from people who are technologically challenged or from those who use LinkedIn very intensively.
4684,Marcus Anderville,"December 14, 2015",4,"Why so many bad reviews? I would consider myself a ""normal"" user of LinkedIn, meaning I use it casually or when I need to. This update seems to be an improvement to me. I'm knocking off a star because the initial update to this new version kept crashing on open. I reinstalled it and it seems to be working fine now."
4685,Brett Rocket Scientist,"January 5, 2016",1,"2 big requests The folks at LinkedIn don't give any way to submit feedback or feature requests so I'll try it here. If I could get two changes on the app, the group posts should show all entries in chronological order. Option for popular discussions. Now it's some weird subset. Second, give us a Create Post button when we are in a group!! Outrageous it isn't there. Thanks for reading and providing the biggest professional online network. Definitely still a tremendous value."
4686,TraySee2345,"May 24, 2016",5,"A convenient way to keep up with colleagues Having given my Facebook account up over fears of identity theft, LinkedIn is so much more secure and convenient. Because it's business-oriented, I don't have to wade through people's status updates, superfluous requests, pokes, etc."
4687,masterofchickens,"May 31, 2016",5,Nice I often find myself annoyed by websites that feel the need to create an app to view the same content I could browse using safari or chrome. This is one of the few such apps that I actually enjoy using. Highly recommended.
4688,DSD Houston,"June 19, 2016",3,"Buggy The app is functional, but it's pretty annoying to continually get notifications about someone sending me a message over and over again. I get a new notification every day for a message that was left about a week ago and I've already read. This happens all the time, unfortunately. "

I turned my phone off and maybe thought it was just a glitch it never came back up. I even went on my app profile and looked to see if it's still there. It was there as if the app was never deleted but when I check my screen it's no longer there. Can some one help figure this out please I love LinkedIn and I want to fix this problem."
4691,Dano372,"April 12, 2014",5,"Great site, great app LinkedIn is great for networking and the mobile version is great. If you have an upgraded account, the mobile version doesn't carry over all of the features, but it keeps most of the overall functionality."
4692,Alant26,"April 23, 2014",5,Easy navigation and interface I enjoy using this app on the go! It's similar to the desktop version making it easy go move around and it can access your phone contacts to find connections too! Great job developers.

4697,amg1957,"January 7, 2015",1,"Buggy and poor experience LinkedIn is one of the worst iOS apps out there.  Clearly it was written for the browser/PC versus written for Mobile first.  It is very buggy for example try to address a note, the search function for the contact hangs up and isn't intuitive if you don't type the exact name.  You need to scrap it and write the app for Mobile first ground up with some new mobile first developers."
4698,LilyPads777,"March 17, 2015",5,Still learning my way around... Became a LinkedIn member a few years ago. I can see and sense the power of this social engine. My problem – too many things on my agenda and not enough time to explore. Thanks LinkedIn! You're definitely in my to do list.

4706,Starr_02,"August 19, 2013",5,"Great for networking tool Easy to use application.  When I look at someone's profile it speaks volumes to me how assertive they are with their profile (ie updated, recommendations by others, helpful information about the individual).  It help to gain a better image about the person."

4708,yellowshorte,"October 7, 2013",5,"Decent to use when not around a desktop I don't use it for updating my personal info but to search people, find people I may know and see who has viewed my profile I will definitely do. Makes a good quick reference on the go."

4712,Bakrub,"August 19, 2011",2,"LinkedIn Fail LinkedIn was a way to keep track of business/ professional associates on the while on the go. The current update looks fine but removes all functionality.  I can no longer respond to my messages, can no longer get to my list of contacts without going through multiple screens that were not needed before.   B+ for look of new app, D- for functionality. Here is hoping they fix it soon."
4713,Dogsdogsdogs,"August 30, 2011",5,New version is great! I like the new version of the app a lot better than the old one. I like that I can see my groups and read discussions. And the layout looks better too. I can't understand why some users would want to go back to the old version.
4714,SherwoodSEO,"November 6, 2011",5,"Better by far than the website Smooth as glass, and a very different and unique interface. Different from the site and better for it, because it puts the options you want right now, right here, on any given screen."
4715,aschreiber,"December 9, 2011",3,"Good, but not great The app gets better with each new update. The new features are certainly welcome but it seems that they are never executed fully."
4716,Michael Balka,"February 14, 2012",3,I give it three out of five It works well for what it does- a quick review of things and the ability to send short emails to linked in contacts.  But---a frustrating process to find out one cannot update a profile and emails can't be forwarded to anyone not in LinkedIn;  hard to share your contacts outside of the LI environ.  Maybe it will get better as it evolves.
4717,J in Bama,"July 24, 2017",1,"I really hate one thing about this app So, in fairness, this is a pretty good app once you get past the 96 million steps of the intro EVERY TIME you open it. I don't want to go through connection suggestions or whatever else is in there when I want to read a message or look someone up. Why would anyone trying to serve a community of professionals design an app that wastes my time like this? Get rid of this annoyance and the app would get 4 or 5 stars. This BS feature takes it down to 1. Vent over..."
4718,kaara10,"August 5, 2017",5,An exceptional social media LinkedIn gives a new meaning to the trends of social media.

4721,shankarajaya,"September 19, 2016",5,"Useful, fun to explore, educational I think people who have more negative things to say about LinkedIn *may be taking meaningful work and relationships too seriously!

4722,45zzag,"September 30, 2016",5,Perfect mobile version Works perfectly for its purpose. Just as functional as the desktop edition in my opinion. Latest update seems to have fixed any log in problems I was having before.

4724,Mariza21,"March 1, 2017",5,Best professional networking social app out there! Love the new version with the ability to write blogs and share news and information on our industry.

4726,thesavvyeater,"March 16, 2017",2,"Too many notifications Love LinkedIn and the app works great. But it drives me absolutely insane to get so many notifications about birthdays, work anniversaries, profile updates, etc. I have an All-Star profile with over 600 connections so you can imagine how often I get notified. Why can't we just control which items notify us?? I don't want to turn off all the notifications, just the ones I don't find useful. Thanks"
4727,RC0075,"April 6, 2017",5,Great for business and networking I have find myself using this app daily. I have read articles on here that I would have never looked up on my own that have really helped me professionally. This app has helped me increase my network capabilities.
4728,Xanthines,"April 21, 2017",1,"They add secret ""features"" without telling you One of the latest updates tries to connect to other Bluetooth devices nearby without any mention in the update description. Just google Rik Ferguson and Vocativ for more info if you don't believe me. The app was already pretty questionable about always, ALWAYS trying to get at your contacts in your phone and email. I the default should be that *I* decide who my business contacts are. I don't need my mom as a LinkedIn contact!"
4729,PFAguitarguy,"May 27, 2017",4,App says requires update Update: AppStore took an hour or so before showing the new version. The App Store is cached and it's possible there was a time gap between LinkedIn deprecating the old version and the new version propagating to my App Store. 
4730,helladaniel,"January 18, 2016",1,"Hate new redesign When people change jobs, now the only option is to sending a private message. Takes away the social aspect of something exciting. Liked it way better when those updates would show up in the newsfeed and users could like or comment. I find myself using this app less and less because most of the pundits who pay to have their updates show up in everyone's feed have pretty useless information"
4731,CAMLA_d,"February 12, 2016",3,"Too different from desktop site For a short time the LinkedIn app looked and felt a lot like the regular desktop site that we hard-core users had come to like. Now the app is very different again leaving both rather hard to use and correlate. Stop redesigning and just give us a nice, simple representation of our feed, messaging, notifications, etc."
4732,Saylor Family iTunes,"February 19, 2016",3,"LinkedIn needs more integration LinkedIn apps need more integration. They shouldn't need multiple apps. Everything should be accessible through one app (network, jobs, articles, etc). It's too fragmented. Same goes with their desktop websites. Mail and messages from the standard LinkedIn, sales navigator, Etc should be integrated with one's regular non premium version."
4733,patstats,"March 16, 2016",3,"Confusing and often annoying This app and entire social app leaves much to be desired. It had great potential when I first downloaded but now, I receive more information and contacts via email than through the app. If I wanted to flood my email, I would have signed up for that! Make this workable or I'm deleting to create more storage on my devices."
4734,Kuhlsam,"April 26, 2016",5,"LinkedIn stepped up to the plate I'm super impressed with how much better this app has become.

4736,Aprilthoughts,"June 18, 2016",3,"Good for basic searching This app is a good clean way to digitally present your resume to pretty much anyone who has the interest in employee searching.

Unlike the desktop version, the app doesn't allow you to see who has accepted your requests to connect. I only see that my number of connections has increased.

4742,Fairfax Frank,"November 3, 2015",4,"Great app but learning curve is a bit steep Like many other comprehensive apps, LinkedIn could use some overview documentation for new users. It's hard to blame them for the lack because almost no other apps provide such help to users. So we will continue to muddle through. Over all, it seems to be a powerful  and useful app."
4743,taverner,"November 9, 2015",2,"Navigation This is one of those ""necessary evil"" services. You feel like everyone in business is using it, so you have to as well. And really, that's fine. It's not a bad app. The constant badgering to rope more friends in is VERY tedious, but I get it. Free service has a cost. That said, i don't use it much. Too much of a pain to have to sign in so often. Seriously, take a cue from the competition. Leave me signed in unless I tell you otherwise. Or hey, how about Touch ID?"
4744,Kpinkerman,"December 2, 2015",5,MUCH easier to use The new card format for handling connection requests and news items is OUTSTANDING!!  It now takes seconds to process my queue where it took several minutes before. Excellent UX design has moved this from a 2.5-star app to a 5-star app.
4745,CicadaSong,"December 3, 2015",1,"HORRIBLE UPDATE...Go back to previous version!!!! Where should I begin?... Upon opening the app, the first thing I noticed is the screen rotation no longer works. The screen is stuck on portrait. Next I no longer have the option to archive previous ""email"" messages. When I accessed the messaging section, every messaged was visable from years ago. I was keeping some older messages as a reference. However, I was forced to delete them since the messages were converted to ""messaging""."

Now I can't view my profile views, nor can I view or get to all of my groups or companies that I follow.  When I have a new connection, I have to figure it out by combing through my existing connections. I also have to perform several clicks just to get to anything whereas the previous app was 1-2 layers.  Very poorly done. I will use my laptop before using this terrible app. Hope you change it back asap."
4747,Cthomas11111,"December 10, 2015",2,"Cuts off experience section This new version puts the 'See More' link below Education instead of below the experience - for most people it looks like the first 5 lines are the only experience they have.

Otherwise the redesign is quite nice."

4749,Whowlit,"January 17, 2016",1,"One of the best, now the worst I don't review very many apps, But this one is special.  Since the UI update, this app is pretty much useless and is absolutely horrible.  You guys seriously just need to go back to the way it was.  I get push notifications but can't find what they were.  I'm about to delete the app and just use the web version.  Completely awful.  It was one of my favorite apps now its the worst.  With 2 overall stars, LinkedIn obviously is not listening to users at all."

Although over the past couple of years most of the major bugs have been resolved making this app stable it still lacks some basic features like having to log in from an link in my email or more intuitive navigation.   On a brighter note each build is incrementally better then before.
4751,JMLBecker,"January 30, 2015",5,"Excellent App The really enjoy using the Linked In app on my phone.  Furthermore, it seems to have more of the desktop site features within the app than other website-based-apps (generally profile management features)."

4766,Restinsuredllcaz,"August 7, 2014",3,Decent I would like more functionality out of this application. I like the way updates look when you provide a link. I dislike the very limited information provided when you click on someone's profile. Not being able to edit your profile is weak too. I give it a 2.5 but rounded up in homes this billion dollar company steps up.

Please look into this....thanks!"

4866,Loulita159,"May 10, 2016",4,"Great for on the go! I like seeing my feed and my connections on this app, and getting notifications of who has viewed my profile as well as messages. Probably would not use this app to update my profile, which is why it loses one star for me. But overall served the purpose I expect!"
4867,Ebconnolly,"July 4, 2016",5,"Marketing manager Great app for knowledge sharing and business learning. I used the job search app, which is separate when I needed it and it worked really well as it was set up to focus on and support that search function specifically."
4868,Awal_526,"August 1, 2016",1,"Miserable I would rather drag myself up stairs 5 times to get my laptop and use the website than use this app. The notifications don't ever come through when it says  you have one, the notification history removes your most recent ones so you can't go back to access them, the newsfeed is never in chronological order so I just see a bunch of the same stuff every day, and there's so much more that makes this download a complete waste of space."
4869,Kirsti N,"August 4, 2016",3,"Group discussions are impossible to find I receive emails from LinkedIn notifying me of a group discussion that I want to read. When I click on the view discussion link in the email, it opens the site in chrome that I have to log into. Alternatively,  i let chrome open the app but there's no way to find said discussion. It is extremely frustrating"

4872,Angscat08,"July 29, 2015",5,"Does what I should - no problems yet Good app- obviously doesn't do as much as the actual site on a computer would do, but it works well and notifies you when you have a message/request. Good way to check out someone's work ethic on the go."
4873,ARod00195,"August 28, 2015",5,"Networking Actually, I really do like this program. It allows me to get in touch with other professionals in my area and outside my state. It also allows me to get together with old friends and see how they're doing and what their success story has been."
4874,Mr. Machine 2 Machine,"September 7, 2015",5,Phenomenal App for business development! I would give this 10 stars if I could. The suite of apps and remind you and encourage you to keep making contact - makes this a phenomenal business development tool!
4875,Black audio book,"September 25, 2015",3,Connect Phone Number The app works very well for what it is but I subtracted two stars due to the fact that there is a blaring bug in your program. Every Time I switch screens or start the app it asks me to connect a phone number for security. I've done it previously so this popping up over and over again is getting ridiculous. Fix it!
4876,Nelsonal760,"December 8, 2015",1,Latest update was a bad move I disliked the latest update so much I came back to change my review.  The new update makes it harder to read the screen...that's just for starters. It's not as user friendly.  I felt that before it was easier to get things done.  For example when you found an interesting company it was easy to see what job openings they had.  You can't do that now.  I will keep using the mobile app and hopefully you don't update that.
4877,Jcw74,"December 19, 2015",1,"WORST update!! Hate the new update. First, the constant ""spinning wheel"" as it tries to update and the tells me ""Hmm lets try that again"" after each time a refresh doesn't work is redonc!  Its an app, it should refresh!!! Also, it's harder to find what I'm looking for. I can't just ""like"" a persons new job, I have to send a message and I have to look at jobs in a different app (touching something 2x). I'm all for change and improvement, but this last update was done for change sake, NOT the UX. Booooooo"
4878,Evening nova,"December 28, 2015",5,"Priceless This new and improved app is just about all you could ask for: accessible, user-friendly, intuitively designed and warm....all while maintaining LinkedIn's core virtues.

4879,App Review Service,"January 14, 2016",3,"App features and privacy At times, when launching audio/video features in the application, the audio does not work.  Also, repeating prompts to link FaceBook contacts to LinkedIn can be annoying to those who do not want to link contacts across these social networks.  One prompt and a ""No"" should be sufficient to keep this prompt from perpetually appearing."
4880,Jonboynlove,"September 6, 2014",1,"Lacking everything For one of the most popular and business orientated sites, this app sure isn't up to parr. I can not edit my profile from within the app!? I can not see the full profile, exp. certifications!? It's annoying that I am and apple ipad user and have an app that I have to close just to go to the browser version of your site to edit. Obviously I'm going to be doing some editing and revising and not just clicking and viewing(like a Facebook stalker) please fix."
4881,ArtsTechie,"October 17, 2014",2,"Irritates me The app is sleek enough, but it lacks some basic functionality.  The biggest annoyance is that it only works within itself.  If I get an invitation via email, when I click to accept, I only get a Safari page to login, not to the app.  It doesn't even tell me that I have the app installed and give me an option to switch.  So I rarely use it, because I have many other logged in spaces to spend my time."
4882,Stepjack,"October 24, 2014",3,"Wish the app stayed on my home screen Linked in is great, but the app is suddenly buggy.  A couple months ago the app disappeared from my home screen.  Randomly it reappeared. Last week it disappeared again. I go to the App Store to install and it says it's already installed. I try to open it, and it won't open.   I'm on an iPhone 5s less than a year old.  What's up LinkedIn?"

This is the sixth time I have tried to input this and each time it tells me that nickname has been taken. If that is the case, why not return to the nickname field and leave the message alone until an unused nickname is found? Alan Myers (LinkedIn) passed away several months ago and you say he has a new job and six new connections."
4885,PAJager,"March 4, 2015",1,"Immediate Crash at Start The latest release causes an immediate crash at start on iPad Air running iOS 8.1.3, which is the latest version available. Have deleted the App and will try to reinstall to see if that corrects the problem."
4886,Dwight Kiser,"March 6, 2015",4,"Annoyable Fix Overall a very good program. I enjoy keeping up with my friends, associates and contacts. However, as previously noted when I accept a link I would expect to be taken to that persons home page...not a Un-endless list of others to link with. This seems like a reasonable expectation and fix."
4887,Gunshipgator,"March 17, 2015",4,"Works pretty well, with some annoyances So the LinkedIn app works fairly well.  The biggest drawback is the app isn't recognized on my device when I open an email and use a link to a LinkedIn feature - it takes me to the sign in page.  Easier overall to use the web version."
4888,Gushy1007,"May 3, 2015",4,"Great, but not there yet! I find the experience of using the App enjoyable. It is a great feel for reviewing your home page and looking at profiles. It really provides the features you need for networking on-the-go, but... The App is missing the ability to customize your connection request, the golden rule of networking!"
4889,PeaceOnEarthAndGoodwill,"May 16, 2015",5,"Integration with mail, app, browser in iPad is NOT. OK, so why if I get an email about a group update d.es it take me to Safari to the mobile version splash screen and tell me there is an app available when I have the app installed?  Duh!"
4890,Chicago Zipper,"November 8, 2013",4,"Great for Basics on the Go I mostly switch between app and website. Don't like the limited capability in the app to update the profile, specifically the bio section. I just want to tweak the wording but looks like I have to rewrite the whole thing."

4894,Johnj386,"December 11, 2013",2,"Not able to Edit profile I was a big fan of this app for ipad for viewing profiles and adding people. However, I am unable to edit my profile or endorse people from this ipad app. I think it's a big deal I can't edit any information on my profile which is why I rated it so low. If your just looking to view profiles and add others, your fine. But sadly you cannot edit your profile content."
4895,PDXRay,"December 28, 2013",2,"Stop trying to trap your users Some of the new interface changes have helped make this an increasingly usable experience, but the absolutely obnoxious practice of preventing people from moving from LinkedIn content into the browser actively keeps me from using LinkedIn as a content resource.

Time to get hot LinkedIn. Test test test before you push your updates. The community uses your service as a tool though when the tool breaks too often do you keep buying the same tool or move to another brand?  Get the point?
4902,Juanferdiez10,"April 18, 2013",5,"The best networking tool I use this app in iPad, iPhone and Pc everyday and enjoy a great experience in all 3.

4903,Komalchile,"April 22, 2013",3,"Improved but ... The app has improved its design very much and  you can edit your profile easily and some other wonders but it still shows some errors to me saying try again later..Moreover, when I click a LinkedIn link in the gmail or mail app it jumps to the website and when I log in its not the same experience as the app."

Trying to figure out how to navigate the app and find certain features is a nightmare. I cannot find out how to write a recommendation in the app at all so it seems certain key features are missing. My recommendation: fire your designers but keep your programmers. Sorry for the 1 star but the UX really is that bad that it overshadows everything else."

It is impossible to scroll through the suggested connections without inadvertently touching someone's picture and instantly sending a friend request without the ability to cancel out.

4909,AndyRShaw,"October 26, 2013",2,Confusing I like the Linked In website but the app is awfully confusing. The last app was tricky to navigate but I got used to its quirks This one looks cleaner but has some nasty traits. I accidentally accepted a connection because of the non intuitive way this is set up. Also I have a notification showing on the app icon but no idea what it's for. I'm pretty close to uninstalling this and going back to the website through Safari.

4920,Yaniv27,"July 30, 2011",2,Whatever Add a freaking option to clear your current status rather than only add a new one.  Thought they would have thought of this in the last 5 updates but they haven't.  Programmers must be too busy blowing their stock option money from this mega inflated IPO on drugs and hookers.  Quite a few other things this App lacks.  Amazing how two of the leading social networking sites (Facebook and LinkedIn) have two of the poorest iPhone apps.

Like all good spam apps, every time I open it, it asks me to connect my email, with apparently no way to tell it to stop. And why would I open the app at all? Because I get cryptic notifications of non events, like work anniversaries, and once I'm in the app, rather than put all the notifications in a single place, they're sprinkled all over the app so that I'll never find them.

Trying to keep track of all the people I've known in my career is impossible without a tool like LinkedIn. It works for me. The endorsement element gets a little over done because it's very subjective and most often not based on true first hand experience. Otherwise,👍👍"
4955,MichaelBrennan,"January 6, 2015",1,"Poor I am just starting to use LinkedIn as it is becoming a popular way to professionally connect with people. It is unbelievably hard to operate on a mobile device (iPhone, iPad) and it is incredibly cluttered and the fact that the layout has not been updated for the newer iPhone sizes makes it even harder to understand the items on the screen. Hoping for an improvement as soon as possible, otherwise... I will stick to handshakes for connecting!"
4956,BunsenBerner,"January 26, 2015",3,"Has room for improvement I'm a huge fan of LinkedIn as a professional social networking platform, but I'm not impressed with the app. For me, it does not flow well and is not intuitive.  I also find that Messages and Notifications are not always up to date. I just think there is room for some UX improvement on the mobile side of the platform."
4957,Sport king,"April 8, 2015",5,Great App The college I attend required all students to have a Linkedin account and I use and check my account daily. This app allows for quick connections and editions to my account. This has to be one of the most valuable assets for business professionals.
4958,irishryan78,"April 10, 2015",5,"Networking at its best! I love LinkedIn. A friend introduced this to me some years ago and it has helped me in many ways.

4959,xJEBIIx,"November 23, 2015",5,Nice app and nice service Helps using the tool on a smart phone. Fast and had not crashed on me like other apps that are SaaS and their app is not up to par. Not here! If you use LinkedIn on the web you will want to download this app for access from your phone.
4960,KayIzzy,"November 16, 2013",3,"Doesn't work as well as computer The app is easy to use, but I find that it doesn't relate well to the computer version. Comments and messages don't show up when they are actually posted. It seems to be good for viewing other people's profiles, but it is much more efficient to use the computer to reply to messages and such."
4961,Marcelladovale531,"January 30, 2014",3,Not bad but could have more features Nice overview of posted info. Nice to be able to invite connections. Would be even better if u could accept invitations and have the ability to edit profile. I was not able to find my groups either. Still with the download. But more could be added to make this more functional.
4962,Greg foucher,"February 18, 2014",1,"Garbage I tried to sign in multiple times, every time it asked me if I had forgotten my password. After numerous failed attempts I followed the instructions and changed my password and the app continued to ask me if I had forgotten my password and won't let me sign in. I just created my account so I know exactly what my password is. This does not happen to me on the desktop version, only on this mobile app. I deleted this app quickly as I had next to no luck with it."

4965,Onimic,"March 28, 2014",1,"Terrible app I love LinkedIn but the support on the Apple products is just plain terrible. The app doesn't flow like the website, it's a copy of Flipboard but a bad copy and you can't copy and paste from another app into the LinkedIn App as the keyboard and the screen keep jumping up. On top of it all the web page in Safari you can't like anything and I accidentally open profiles or send invites to people I don't know all the time because the website isn't responsive at all. Get it together!"

The simple fact is, LinkedIn fails to make products that just work. I wish my firm could retain clients as well as LinkedIn does and provide a half complete product like LinkedIn seems to think is okay. I mean come on, the app practically has a mind of its own and always has. LinkedIn really needs to step up it's game."

Linked in and Bing totally lost me. Deleted both after last ""improvements"" SUCKED. Bye bye linked ""out"". I had to give it 1 star to post review.... But there was no minus 5 stars."

Once you're finally there and you click the ""view full profile"" button, it does nothing. Moreover, your messages aren't updated in real time. I was on LinkedIn on my desktop and saw that I had 2 new messages yesterday and the app still hasn't reflected that (1 day later). "
4996,wcoast23,"January 2, 2017",1,"Terrible defaults and senseless notifications No one needs to be notified via a little red number in the upper right corner of the app that someone has a work anniversary, but the default is to share your work anniversary. There's not an intuitive way to stop this because LinkedIn knows that they aren't driving users to the app enough with their content and user engagement. My solution is to delete the app until LinkedIn provides an incentive for me actually use the app."
4997,MachTurtle,"January 5, 2017",2,"Push notifications LinkedIn is a handy app to have, but PLEASE fix the push notification system. I selected the notifications I want to receive in app, but then get hit with a ton that I don't care about. It was annoying enough that I disabled notifications from the app in general.

It took me tries to actually load the proper page in the app (each time I was bombarded by a new user modal instead) and when I finally entered the chat/inbox screen the iOS keyboard was forced open with no way to hit any of the buttons :/ I had a better experience on their mobile site but it was still pretty jank.
