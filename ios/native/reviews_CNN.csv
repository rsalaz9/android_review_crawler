0,Bms270,"October 18, 2019",2,"To the developers of the app Please understand the difference between UIControlEventTouchDown and UIControlEventTouchUpInside. You need to stop using the former. It drives people crazy when they are scrolling while reading. UIControlEventTouchDown is triggering the navigation as soon as a finger is placed on a text/ad. This leads to unwanted navigation away from an article while scrolling. This is so ridiculous. Any junior dev should know this and avoid using it for links. I end up going to multiple places at least 10 times while reading one single news article. This has been happening in CNN app as long as I remember. If you are doing this intentionally to get more clicks, then shame on you on your bad practice. This is sacrificing user experience to mislead the advertisers. "
1,Qweerty1,"October 26, 2019",1,"Constantly opening links and ads I’ve used this app for years but I’m deleting it over a recent dip in usability. I can’t read the articles anymore because the links included in them open if I tap my screen even slightly near them, it is constantly opening new tabs, ads, or sending me to other articles when I’m just trying to read the one I’m currently on. I haven’t been able to make it to the bottom of an article in weeks because I inevitably give up in frustration."

3,Dbiii_agent_of_change,"December 12, 2019",3,"Love CNN hate the App I love cnn and it’s content. The app always freezes, crashes, has a hard time loading, will drop signal and send you to commercials in the middle of a program. Makes you watch adds over and over when trying to regain access to live streams even when it’s the app that is failing. Audio cuts out unexpectedly and randomly. They use to update Inside Politics or State of the Union over the weekend but for a few months now you can no longer access that content except when using an actual television set so the mobile app is limited by comparison. I’ve used this app for years and very often but it’s always been on the struggle bus regardless of “bug fixes” or updates, the core of whatever is wrong continually gets worst. Disappointed by the decline to say the least. I know I can’t be the only one dealing with these issues regularly. *And full transparency I am writing this after over 10 failed attempts and over 20 minutes of waisted time just trying to get the live stream to load.*"
4,Ceharpe,"October 30, 2019",4,Great app/ hyperlink issue It’s a great app. It delivers all the news of the cable news channel in a digestible format. It delivers rapid updates and clearly defines opinion pieces from news. It typical has less than a 30 second delay from major news networks for breaking events if you have alerts on and the alerts aren’t so cumbersome or numerous that they impolitely beg for dismissing the app. 
5,emiguede,"December 26, 2018",4,"Great app, but advertising is annoying I like the app a lot, the content is well organized, varied and deep. It’s my go-to news app. "
6,J_Freddie,"October 28, 2019",4,"5-Star App, riiiiggght .... UPDATE ... MUCH BETTER UPDATE:  I can report that with IOS Version 13.2, and the CNN app Version 6.4, released today, the hyperlinks and scrolling issues that I previously complained about have seemingly been fully resolved.  Not sure how they did it, but it seems like you have to press the link very deliberately (slightly longer duration?) to be taken now to the external links.  The app seems to be functioning fully correctly now."
7,BmoreRobin,"May 8, 2019",4,Love It but So SLOOOOOW This is my favorite news app and I’ve had it for a long time. I like that it thoroughly covers all the categories of news. I only have one major complaint and a small complaint. The major one is that the pages take SO LONG to load. For a while I thought my phone must be the problem but a little research shows it actually is caused by all the ads on the pages. I mean it’s really slow. Isn’t there another way?  It’s annoying. 
8,Doña Elle,"September 7, 2018",5,"Constant Loading & Freezing Issues What is causing the increasingly long load times? With the nation -and world’s - scene so rapidly changing, it’s incomprehensible that a major news outlet would allow its app to take a ... full minute ... or two ... and sometimes even close to three(!), to fully load. That, coupled with the constant delay in navigation responsiveness and freezing, has made CNN’s the most frustrating app I use. Having followed primarily CNN’s coverage of the news for many years, imagine how high the level of frustration must be to prompt consideration of deleting this app altogether so as not to continue the waste of storage space or my valuable time. So, am about to download another update, which one hope’s will address these issues by correcting or, at the very least, significantly improving the app’s performance."
9,ToneDeafRabbitt,"October 25, 2019",3,"Login Problems and Article Selection Still a Problem The CNN app provides written news articles, short videos and live TV.  It does this well but with two app-killing problems:  (1) in order to watch live streams of CNN, one must login to a cable network over and over and over again.  This increases the time it takes to get started and makes me use the app less.  Complaints have gone unheeded with each update.  (2) low-brow journalism heavily populated the articles and videos with such items as “Mother stays up all night after finding this in baby’s crib.”  Its like the editors of buzzfeed and national enquirer choose every other article.  This degrades the CNN brand and makes them less credible when their hosts decry the entertainment journalism of a certain other news network.  All in all, I love being being able to watch CNN on my phone but these two problems greatly reduce my use and have led me to find other news apps."
10,Lady TSB,"December 1, 2017",2,"Disappointed in New Version of CNN App! I am so displeased with this latest version of the CNN App! The developers have totally stripped away the control and flexibility the user once had. I used to be able to Go Live, click on Schedule and select a show to watch which had previously aired that day. I LOVED that feature and now it’s gone! If for example I missed the airing of The Situation Room which airs at 2:00 pm PST here in Cali, no worries. I knew that I could watch the full show, in its entirety anytime later that same day. I could click to watch any show that had already aired by Judy clicking on it. Now I can no longer watch a show that I missed...How could the developers remove this important feature?!"
11,jenniferjoy,"August 10, 2018",1,"What happened to CNN? We all get they’re on a war path against Trump, and he’s a fool, no doubt. But now their headlines and articles are so slanted against conservative principals, it makes them look foolish. Which they’re not. Not historically anyway. Every story is another chance to take a shot at conservative causes. The fact that they refuse to say it was a jihadist compound found in New Mexico was the last straw for me. CNN continues to treat its audience like kindergarteners. They won’t tell us anything that might be misunderstood, misconstrued or misused. I’ve used this app for a decade as my primary source of news each day. But I’m very close to deleting it for good. I love their journalists and I know there’s nothing “fake” about them, but the way the spin is coming at us now against this administration is nauseating. I hate Fox News so I’m not sure how I’ll get my news if I remove CNN. I just wish they’d go back to being fair and critical of both sides. Or maybe just less critical altogether. We could use some good news these days."
12,Gabi for truth,"October 24, 2018",5,"Variations of Trump lies Fairly well reported on but the President not been questioned directly about the lies. So far, lies by him have been just again reported on. Please, if anyone in the administration is interviewed or a speech recorded, it is important that the “fact checkers” immediately enable a reporter or analyst to say straight out “the President, Vice-President, politician or Senate or House majority/minority leaders be held accountable for telling an “in-truth”/lie by saying xxxxx.  As “ no, the Democrats are not financing the immigration of illegal aliens, GOP isn’t responsible for allowing pre-existing medical conditions in the health insurance,” etc. "
13,AWRosey,"January 2, 2019",2,"Please Lose the Links I switched to CNN News from other news apps for two reasons; 1) The commercials are only 15 seconds prior to a video as compared to 30 seconds for others, and 2) the other apps had these annoying underlined links to related stories or media that always got in they way of scrolling through a news article. "
14,Stugots Shake N Bake,"February 13, 2019",1,"I’ve Finally Had Enough What CNN touts as “breaking news” is baffling. However, the most frustrating part is when I receive a breaking news notification that is objectively truly breaking news, open the app, and much to my surprise said news story is absolutely nowhere to be found. The remainder of the breaking news title is non-existent. No reference, nothing. But what are there plenty of? Advertisement. Not just standard ads, I understand the dynamic of finding a business. Ads are necessary. But it appears CNN has no standard for what they will advertise. Click slide shows for the top 20 balls of yarn in America. Blatant scam supplements from questionable sources. Couple this crap with your “news stories” Where the title is the exact same thing as the caption to the misleading photo, that is the same thing as the opening sentence of the first paragraph, that is the same thing as the quote in the body of the article. It’s unreal. Absolute crap. Not reporting facts, produced media like an awful soap opera. Deleting the app. Not that you degenerates care."
15,cjbrill,"February 24, 2019",2,"CNN Should Stick to TV CNN was my go-to news app for many years.  When I first started using it in 2015 or so, I did so assuming all news apps would have similar quality.  But last year, CNN posted several articles with bait and switch titles—the kind of nonsense you would expect to see posted on Facebook by your high school class clown.  So I downloaded the New York Times app and started using my few free articles a day. (I assure you, I do not work for NYT.)  It’s then that I realized how truly bad the quality of writing is on the CNN app.  CNN articles seem not to be proofread, checked for flow and consistency, or sometimes edited at all.  They are often short, stream of consciousness diatribes with no thesis or conclusion.  So I have taken the plunge and bought a New York Times app subscription.  I only look at the CNN app when I want to see some of the more “out there” stories (same reason I sometimes look at the crazy Fox News app)."
16,acc1978,"March 16, 2019",5,"Advice App is excellent. My only complaint is that when opening subject-specific links such as “Sports”, the news stories never automatically update themselves from the last time that I checked that link. The updating of news stories to include all of the more recent/current stories only occurs after opening and then closing one (or multiple) older news stories that are still present at the top of the page."
17,koremusik,"February 4, 2020",3,"Sports reporting I am very upset that you Reported the results of the men’s final of the Australian open very early on Sunday morning, before any Americans really could’ve watched it at a reasonable hour. You didn’t write spoiler alert or anything like that, you just plastered the picture of Djokovic on the headline of the article. So I knew who won and you really spoiled the final for me. That kind of breaking news will not get you more viewers, in fact I have to avoid reading the news on days when there’s a sporting event but I have not watched yet. I would understand if it was in the USA and everybody and had an opportunity to see the event, but this Australian open was airing at 8 AM on Sunday morning, but it was already past due to the time difference. You could at least not post the picture of Djokovic on the headline. Thanks to you I didn’t bother watching the final which I was looking forward to. I already know who won I didn’t want to waste my time."
18,Wolf Denning,"October 11, 2019",4,"4Stars/ HATE THE LINKS I feel it is important to diversify what news outlets you watch and follow. The reason being is because to truly comprehend the worlds’ many events, you need to know all sides of the story. All things considered. I love the CNN app and everything bit of information that it has to offer. However, I despise the links that are in the articles. Many times, they are abundant, and while I am trying to read the latest about President Trump from a CNN point of view, I will accidentally touch the link hidden in the text while scrolling and get thrown into another related article forcing me to return to the previous page and search for where I was before I was displaced. This will happen to me two or three times per article. Otherwise, thank you CNN for being what you are and keep all things considered."
19,Nocountryfan,"December 18, 2019",2,"Misleading headline on puppies I am very unhappy with the misleading way you began your article on “puppies making people sick.” It should have read “Puppy Mill Puppies from pet stores making people sick,” I read the article. It specifically says some puppies from some pet stores are making some people and pet store employees sick with an intestinal type bug which has not proved fatal in anyone infected. The public should be warned that pet store puppies virtually all come from puppy mills which raise the dogs in horrible, unhealthy, unsanitary, inhumane conditions. It would be amazing if these pups didn’t pass on disease. All puppy mills should be illegal and shut down, as they are in some states. Why don’t you write a more productive article including that information! Your headline, as it reads, simply scares people away from adopting any puppies. You should know many people don’t read anything in depth in order to get the full story. The very reason our country is in such a mess now."
20,average.dude,"September 12, 2017",3,"Slightly relaxed. I've noticed a more fair trend recently in regards to popular issues, especially of course the president. Let me be clear, CNN is a HIGHLY biased news source, but frankly who isn't? I own both the CNN app and Fox News and they're about the same when it comes to bias. I had it at one star after the reddit debacle, as that REALLY angered me. However since then, they've chilled out and been a little less obsessive over Donald Trump and their ""meme wars"". They report important things like impacts of hurricane Irma and Harvey (the first time I've seen an article not attacking the president as soon as I open it). They didn't use the birth of his grandson to attack him either (and I was expecting them to). It's an encouraging sign and I will give them credit for relaxing a little and getting back to important stuff to an extent. Keep doing it and I'll throw 4-5 stars up there."
21,Jul13206,"September 25, 2018",5,"CNN news is not fake news! I really like watching CNN news you get both sides of the story you typically have supporters from both sides of the issues that  you are interviewing. I don’t find the news biased, however some of the stories about the weather in various areas can be a little bit skewed to show the worst-case and Are meant to make people aware/keep them from being complacent when there’s bad weather. I am currently about 2/3 of a mile from the coastal inlet in Socastee and luckily all the worst productions hopefully will not happen. But we’re keeping a close eye on it Situation. Thank you for your wonderful news reporting and for your unbiased opinions and the ability to show both sides of the story. I love CNN news"
22,iPhone over BlackBerry...,"November 7, 2018",1,"Typical of mainstream media these days... This app is fairly well coded, and the UI is nice. There are some shortfalls, however, such as having to click “close” when you’re done with an article as opposed to simply swiping - like the rest of good news apps. The reality is, the coding, UI, and the app developers are not the issues; CNN is the issue..."
23,Drdrdaddeo,"April 8, 2019",2,"Pathetic download times and long commercials This App would be great if it was actually designed specially for iPads, instead of strictly for sponsorship profit.  The many CNN video snippets generally take 10-15 seconds to download from the internet to the iPad (even with high speed WiFi), then you have to wait for a commercial to slowly completely open up, then you have to endure a boring 13 second commercial....all before you actually get to see the real video.  Thus a 30-40 second waste of time to view a 15 second snippet.  This App is not optimized for anything other than video viewer annoyance.  If I didn’t like and respect CNN so much I would delete it out of frustration.  I prefer Apple News as it is much quicker.  Wake up CNN......you’re supposed to be the most trusted news network.  I trust you should be able to do a better job of optimizing your video management."
24,iPhone Chief,"October 8, 2019",2,Great but ... It’s really difficult to use now! When I try to scroll through a story on my phone I am CONSTANTLY getting thrown into a linked story. And sometimes they have links that run for several lines and only small sections of the screen are not a linked ad or links to another story. If they wanted me to engage with a story maybe make it so that I can scroll. This does not happen on web pages in Safari or other apps with links. There is something wrong with this app. The stories are great but this is maddening. 
25,Irishlass98,"February 4, 2020",5,"Truth Matters While CNN is constantly lambasted by Republicans as a liberal mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, I am always amazed how CNN takes what the President says, and in a very nonpartisan way, simply illustrates the many lies and false statements this man makes everyday. CNN proves the old saying, “Do you know how you can tell he is lying?  His lips are moving!!” Unlike the Senators and people in Congress, who are so afraid of this man in the White House, that they forget they don’t work for him - they work for the people who elected them.  CNN does not buckle under the barrage of insults thrown at them by the President and his minions. CNN strives, every day and night to present the truth. Keep it up!! There are so many viewers who depend on you for the honesty this President and many in his party obviously lack!!"
26,UnkemptChipmunk,"October 24, 2019",3,"Please fix the links within articles! It seems like ever since upgrading to iOS 13, the links within articles (which seem to be everywhere within every article...) instantly go to that article, even when you barely touch them with the intent to scroll further down. Previously, you could touch them, but as long as you moved your finger to scroll then it wouldn’t go to the link. Now you have no choice; it just goes, and it’s very annoying. Please make the delay longer on going to links, if that’s possible, rather than sending the reader unexpectedly to another article because they weren’t looking (and shouldn’t have to) where their finger touched to move the article up. It’s jarring for the mind to get pulled out of what one is currently reading simply because they put their finger on a hyperlink."
27,RandomUserOfYourApp,"November 14, 2019",1,"Too much click bait So many CNN stories now (I mean real stories, not the fake story ads they also place) are doing a really tricky, annoying thing."
28,Barbie-Marley,"December 7, 2019",3,"Links! I really love this app. CNN is my main news source. So having the app is very convenient for me. I check it several times a day. But after I updated the app, the links have been driving me crazy! I can’t get through an article without being redirected at least 5 times. It keeps telling me that I need to update the app. But the app is fully updated. When I was notified that you guys were going to be fixing the problem, I was relieved. But it’s been weeks and weeks. When is this going to get fixed? Lately, I have just reading The Point! articles that I’m subscribed to through my email and I have been getting the rest of my news through NYT and Politico. It went from being seriously annoying to kind of phishy. I don’t like being randomly redirected to a link I didn’t click. Fix this, please!"
29,LegallyBlondeInUtah,"December 13, 2019",1,"CNN ruined their own app with malfunctioning linking related stories I used to love this app. I would use it multiple times a day to get my news, and have done so for years. Several months ago, CNN added links to articles within the selected article. It sounds like a great idea and something that would help readers get easy and convenient access to more information. The problem is that CNN used malfunctioning link technology that continuously reroutes the reader to different articles without the reader selecting to do so. It’s become so horrendous that scrolling to read any article is now impossible. There are so many links and the sensitivity is so remarkably light, that just trying to scroll through an article results in being redirected dozens of times. Come on, CNN. You should have access to better technology and capable programmers. You’ve ruined your app and have effectively redirected me to a different app for my news."
30,❤️bgodfrey❤️,"October 12, 2017",1,Please be more positive CNN is so one sided. You guys rip on our president non stop. I’m open to both sides but I’m am appalled at how you are set out to destroy Trump. What this world needs today is for people to show support and love for each other. What the US needs is to be supportive of our president and let him do his work instead of NIT PICKING every single little thing. 
31,rjhld,"October 19, 2017",5,"CNN news I find that CNN makes every effort to back up their news stories to be accurate and quote their sources for their stories. Most of the folks that complain about CNN are only listening to Fox News which presents a slanted view in favor of the President. So when they log on and or listed to CNN there is no wonder they seemed shocked. They are hearing and learning news that that was not reported by Fox possibly for the first time. They also seem to believe the President when he repeated that all news is bias and fake, except Fox of course. I read and watch many different sources Fox inclusion included and then research to see which is the most accurate. I bet most Fox watchers do not do that."
32,stevenseanj,"November 7, 2017",1,"Bad setup, bad app, bad bad bad This has nothing to do with the content, we all know CNN’s bias. The app itself is horrible. I’m not sure which audience they’re trying to appeal to but I’d argue none. Lengthy ads before every single video make their coverage unwatchable. As you scroll down the home page god forbid your finger swipes past an ad because it blows up full screen. I wish I could rate this twice because honestly the content isn’t horrible (obviously NPR is a way more reliable and thought provoking source). But even with that said, there’s more going on in the world than Trump. Honestly I’m starting to turn to Buzz-feed for my quick morning recap even though I have to weed through 50 personality quizzes, simply due to their user interface, accessibility, and the fact that I’m not gagging on an ad for a TV station that will be obsolete in 6 years every 3 minutes. In desperate need of change, (same goes for their website)."
33,ThankfulForNews,"December 7, 2017",5,"Actually Presents the News While searching on my phone for the latest news on the investigation of possible collusion or innocence between Trump and Russia, I noticed in my other news app that came with my iPhone the initial search results would pop up, but within a few seconds without me touching anything the news titles suddenly changed to different news stories supporting Trump. This happened repeatedly. Now that I've downloaded the CNN news app, at least the news stories don't mysteriously disappear without me touching any part of my phone. The CNN news stories stay on the screen of my iPhone without disappearing. Thank you for presenting the news!"
34,Mattfnlar,"December 29, 2017",1,"Biased and unreliable If you want a news app that is going to reassure your leftist views and always tell you that you are right and everyone else is wrong then this is the app for you. However if you want a news app that is going to report on real, unbiased news then you need to move on. This news network is a joke to journalism and will twist anything that can to bash president Trump or any one on the right constantly with no regard to actual news or any type of real journalism. And I am in no way saying that other news apps don’t twist stories at all such as Fox but my god CNN is soooo bad about it that it doesn’t even compare. CNN either stands for counterfeit news network or Clinton news network. Mind you I do have this app downloaded, but it is in my entertainment folder. I find it amusing when a bs story pops up, or they do videos that clearly bash the right, it’s funny to see them think they are in charge."
35,ColonelSandman,"October 5, 2019",1,"Totally Biased Take on News CNN obviously hates Trump. You know what, I hate him too. But that doesn’t mean they should construe every article so far to left and tear down every conservative principle while they’re at it. I’m actually a moderate and see good points on both sides from the left and the right. I sometimes vote republican and sometimes democrat, depending on the candidate. I detest Trump and find him unfit to command due to his many lies and acts of conduct. I did not vote for him. But that said, I would expect less bias about him and about any political article in general. CNN has become shameless in their angle of news. It’s so staunchly to the left now, it’s nauseating. I want moderate news that dares to speak the good on either side, regardless of party. Even Trump, at times, has his good moments. Dare to report on it and say it. CNN never had a negative thing to say about Obama, though he had his flaws too. If you call yourself news, then report in an unbiased manner."
36,RedEfire,"December 15, 2019",3,"Great, except... The app would be better if not for HOW they advertise. Click the live TV button, you will be granted 10 minutes of live coverage (per day (lame)) but half of that time will be eaten by advertising and if when the ad ends the live broadcast goes to a commercial break guess what? You get more ads. Then let’s say you’re scrolling through their pinned news stories and videos. If you even slightly touch an ad pane it will promptly attempt to open that ad link in your browser, but only the first time so that seems by design not a flaw."

I have noticed since upgrade to iOS 13.1.2 that if I happen to put my finger on a part of the article that has a hyperlink to related content, I can no longer scroll like I used to. Now, it automatically opens the hyperlink. Please fix this. I used to be able to put my finger anywhere, and if it happened to be a hyperlink, it wouldn’t open the link if I scrolled. But now, it opens the link. This is especially painful if the link is to a Washington Post or NYT article, since I only get 2-3 of those, and then I’ve used up my freebies.

Today they are biased and virtually every one of their reporters are pushing a left agenda.  Their news is slanted and their guests all seem to be anti GOP.  If someone does not agree with the likes of Don Lemmon, Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper, CNN’s hand picked panels belittle the person or play the scare tactic card.  Fake News fits CNN because they do not present evenly and fairly the many sides of any debate.  Their stories about our President are all negative with what appears to be a motive to take him out at all costs.  So let’s call this a sophisticated well funded mouth piece for progressive policies with no care, respect or regard to those who do not agree.  The Real News is that CNN lost their goodwill as a unbiased media outlet!  Even when I do watch them, it has become so difficult to trust their reporting."
41,Jalawbaugh,"November 10, 2017",5,"Now Independent I listen to many sources to get a complete picture of the news. I find CBS to be honest and un biased. I find FOX to be very biased and kissing up to the president. They are careful not to report the negative, but true, stories about the president. I find CNN to be truthful and forthcoming on a wide range of news. Having observed their reporting for years I find the presidents claim that they are ""Fake News"" stems from the fact they report the good and the bad about his presidency.  CNN has fired people for reporting stories that haven't been properly vetted. They are very careful not to broadcast anything that hasn't been properly vetted.

If you touch ever so slightly in the wrong spot on a frame, you get thrown into advertising window without a clear way to get back to what you were trying to read or view in the news. Then there’s the annoying, floating ad that shows up after every sentence — it’s usually the same ad that shows up everywhere, and I’m constantly scooting the ad out of the way so that I can read the news.

I have no issue with opposing views, in fact I welcome measured, intelligent arguments, but this mindless shouting by the Trumpers who seem to have little familiarity with the laws or the constitution of our country. Why have them on at all? They do little to sway the audience and are the number one reason why I have to turn over time and time again. Your competition, MSNBC, don’t feel the need to do this and most of their programs are intelligent, informative and happily absent of the shouting and ill informed guests. Get your act together CNN. I gave you two stars because you do tell the truth and you must get credit for that. Raise the bar. You could do so much better."

Thank You CNN keep on fighting for the truth. This idiots presidency will forever go down in history as the worst president EVER and CNN’s “keeping em’ honest” exposing every lie just makes my day.

I also would like to say that , while shifting through the news stories on my tablet, I get news stories from many different news outlets.

What Trump has done to the office of President is shameful. I’m hoping bit by bit his lies, his racist views and actions, bully tactics, hatred of the LGBT community, hatred of women, etc.. will be exposed for all to see. I’m sorry John McCain isn’t here to help straighten up the Republican Party, because there’s plenty who really do know better.

It was obvious from day one and every single day nonstop hate, hate, hate. I could not even bother to watch CNN news in the morning because it was non stop “ Breaking news” or “Bombshell” and every single time nothing came of it. I started to feel it was all agenda and not facts. Consistently giving my hopes up. Trump’s doing this and Trump said that “see” And then after fact checking it CNN either made a sound bite of something he said and would cut out the most important part of the speech, or response to a question. So basically if you have two friends and the one(CNN) constantly is telling you how horrible your other friend is with nothing other then they don’t like them. Check your friends you are who you hang out with. The same goes with your new."

Ever since President Trump won the presidency, you have done nothing but bash him and his administration on everything he does and you have totally disrespected the office of the presidency. Your reporting is totally biased and nowhere near being balanced when it comes to your political reporting. You even take everyday mundane news stories and manage to find a way to blame the President for everything that goes wrong. I am not at all surprised that 95 per cent of these reviews are negative and your tv ratings are the lowest you have ever had. I have lost all respect for CNN and will be deleting this app. I haven't watched your news broadcasts for months.

It’s almost impossible to read an article on it with out stepping on a mine “hyperlink” that will open instantly without you actually meaning it. Scrolling up or down an article is a nightmare because it also automatically click embedded hyperlinks and they open new pages and new articles for you on their own. Before the update, I was able to finish reading and article in 1 minutes, now it takes me 5 minutes because it keeps opening links and links in me each time I touch the screen because they have a click bait hyperlink everywhere now.

While reading an article you inherently have to touch the screen to scroll down to continue reading.  Unfortunately the number and sensitivity of the links to other articles makes this extremely tedious as 99% of the article seems to suddenly be a link to another article.  This means you are constantly inadvertently being rerouted to a different article while simply trying to scroll down.  I can’t believe this was intentional, and if it wasn’t, then how did this get past testing?  Either way I’m at a loss as to how this made it in as it ruins the experience.

However, I have some problems with the app. First up is the links in their articles. They are way too sensitive. You have to careful watch your thumb as you are scrolling down the page but if it hits those underlined words, the app immediately sends to to another page, and this greatly decreases the readability of their articles. Also, the live TV preview option has rarely worked for me in the past two months or so. When it works, I really enjoy that 10-minute-per-day option, but it has consistently not allowed me to access it recently."

We are fortunate that so many good people are willing to risk their lives to bring us the truth especially during these very disturbing times. They hold corrupt officials accountable.

It would be great if CNN would hire a conservative on their staff, but the owners would not approve of someone who had different views on staff. When I went to college it was to learn how to review both sides of an argument and determine which one was more accurate.

I much prefer watching someone else in that slot. You don’t have to shout the news. Overall I much prefer MSNBC and have started almost always switching to it instead of CNN. I never watch Fox news.

Nothing is wrong with the functions but the functions are much too sensitive to the touch required to scroll down. This is the only app I have that has this problem!

It’s difficult to cut through all the lies spewed by mr Trump and it’s organization. Ruling by hate fear has torn this country apart.

The reality is that Mr Trumps own actions put him in a negative light, CNN just reports his actions, Fox try’s to spin the news in favor of the president.

When their boards, directors and management more accurately reflect the experience of all of us “Americans” and humans in general, including women, people of color, variations of gender expression, sexuality, “class”, and identity, they will do a great job.

As for the people complaining about credibility, it’s mostly due to the free press catching their politicians making untruthful statements or not being transparent as democracy demands of elected officials.

I read an opinion piece about female representation in government and it was interesting. I enjoyed reading it. CNN, if you want to bring in a larger audience, may I suggest more stories and articles about other parts of the country.

It’s one shortcoming is its presentation of extremists views, particularly in science, with almost equal footing and prominence as well-settled, credible factual conclusions (such as global warming) thus confusing the issue in the pursuit of “fairness.”  Hiring right-wing, Trump advocates to enliven debate is fine but not if the commentators continue to misinform and regurgitate proven falsehoods as if they are true without the host condemning the misrepresentations immediately (as does Don Lemon).

Every article you try to read is full of links to other articles.  Which that by itself is not bad.  The bad part comes when these links are super sensitive. As you scroll down to continue reading you can’t help but to touch one of the links and it will immediately take you to another article.  You then have to go back to the article you were reading and then probably get sent to another article down the line because there is no real way of avoiding all the links scattered throughout.  Scrolling through the article is like walking through a minefield, trying to carefully navigate without touching one of the links.  It’s trash."

On top of that, when I click an Icon, it just says ""button"" instead of telling me what the button says. I understand being blind isn't very common but it is not rare either. Shame on CNN for not factoring in how their app will work for disabled people. I understand why a little apps would do this but CNN is a big-time network and should know better and update their technology so it works for everyone. they have the means to do so. Shame on them for putting together such a horrible product. please do not download this app until they fix their problems and make it so it works for everyone like it should. Thank you"

They had correspondents reporting from all over the world with diverse and interesting topics.  Now it’s  panel after laborious panel and as everyone else has commented on, nauseatingly repetitive news.  I am a psychotherapist and know that Trump is not fit to be the president of this country with a Narcissistic  Personality Disorder diagnosis (and yes he can be diagnosed with out being seen in person as enough of his behaviors are available for all of us to see and experience).  That said, between the Trump minutia laboriously focused on and the the repetition of it all, I’ve taken to mostly listening to NPR on the radio.  Yes, CNN needs to be the fact check police for Trump, but get a little more scholarly please."

My only criticism is the constant interruptions of the panel of guests and regulars who, much too often,  all talk at once. The hosts need to step up and shut the rude interruptions down.

The user experience is terrible as a result of having to vigilantly avoid hyperlinks like land mines. I finally became so frustrated I deleted the app and now can read CNN along with other news sources through Apple News. And guess what? Even though almost everything in Apple News is clickable, nothing launches unexpectedly unless I intentionally click it, proving it is possible so CNN has no excuse for their terrible user experience."

American citizens, regardless of cable subscriptions or premium account status, have an undeniable right to see these debates, as they are an integral means through which we determine who we will be voting for in the primary and general election. Suppressing people’s ability to view this material is a violation of journalistic integrity of the most egregious variety and, consequently, I can no longer support this app and will actively discourage other from doing so as well.

I’m sure my review has plenty of typos so who am I to cast stones. This lack of editorial review is not just on CNN articles but is becoming more prevalent in other news articles I’m seeing online. Writing an intro paragraph, with typos, followed by screenshots of twitter posts is not journalism.  Is it?  Showing my age perhaps?

I could care less that Anderson Cooper got into a heated exchange with a commentator. I would like to know where to get more investigative reporting where I am able to learn about the events affecting the world, but sadly the journalism economics of the times seem to follow the way the wind blows in terms of what creates a popular headline. Opinions are cheaper than investigation and reporters are becoming columnists instead of journalists. It’s too bad because I actually like most of the reporters.

With articles heavily doused in links to other articles or sources, it becomes an exercise in patience to read an article when you are being switched to your browser every few seconds.

They still seem good for event/disaster coverage due to broad resources but even then they secondarily bring in their Dem supporting politics.  Use the app and trust their news with caution I’d say.

156,All nicknames taken stupid,"December 28, 2018",3,Needs Work Not enough categories of articles on app or enough articles per category. Not everyone wants to read only stories for 2 day window. Biggest problem with the app is the Watch CNN feature. Audio is always messing up. Video freezes and cuts out frequently. I end up watching 5 minutes of the same exact thing I already saw when the app randomly replays/rewinds the feed. Can barely watch a full hour without interruption. The other huge issue with the stream is that you can’t play it in the background. One of the most frustrating apps I use.
157,younguy1979,"January 13, 2019",2,"Too much bias CNN used to be my favorite, but for whatever reasons we know, CNN has made it clear they don’t like Trump and now write constant biased news and opinion sections like “analysis” i find this sad because they should just report the news and just let us readers make the opinions instead of giving theirs. It’s not news."
158,rgunther,"January 19, 2020",2,"Apple TV experience is miserable I use this app occasionally to listen in on news events when I’m walking. It stops the feed as soon as I turn off the screen, which is useless if I’m trying to just listen in."

I’m tired of being asked to subscribe for a daily briefing or whatever it’s called every 10 - 15 minutes.  It’s utterly annoying.  If I said no once, I shouldn’t be asked again unless it’s an updated app version. I’m not subscribing to anything.  If this isn’t fixed soon I will end up deleting this app.  There isn’t a setting to disable this either."

Now, I get push notifications for opinionated articles against the current president. I could care less about what some whiny millennial thinks about the president. I want news, real news. I want facts that are true and not skewed to CNN's political agenda. I'm finally fed up and am deleting the app today. I've had this app for over 4 years and now it'll be gone. If you want actual news updates, the CBS News app is great. Many say CBS has a liberal bias, but it's much less than NBC or ABC and the cable networks. The app is great because I get NEWS updates and that's what I care about. I hope you're happy CNN."

We all know Trump is goofy...so please don’t give him anymore attention , that just adds “fat to the fire “!

People don't like CNN because they think that they trash the President but in reality they are doing honest news reporting. This country has been blinded recently by Trump and have chosen self or party over country. Thank goodness CNN has been there shinning a light on the truth. History will look back on this time as a dark period but will see that there was honest news reporting and CNN will be at the top of that list.

164,The Nocturnal Butterfly,"June 19, 2018",1,"Get Google News Instead Downloading the app of any specific journalistic outlet is a severe mistake for anyone who is trying to keep an open mind. This is not a criticism against CNN in particular. I am simply acknowledging that no one is perfect and to trust that a single news source is being perfect is a folly. Some people may download this app because they appreciate getting news that ‘fits’ their political agenda, but I personally feel that a news aggregator is the best option. Apps such as Google News collect articles from a wide spectrum of sources so that by comparing and contrasting the journalism of the whole gamut of news sources, one may get reasonable, unbiased, and well informed news which is really all we want from an app like this."

So many of the information and articles grab your attention, but then one has to listen to it instead of being able to read it. Listening I’d fine in certain instances, but all articles need to be readable. I and many others don’t carry headphone or ear buds! And in public places listening is annoying to others. Even in my own home, if spouse is watching a tv show, deeply engrossed in work, she doesn’t want to have CNN or anything else playing in the background. "

The most recent ‘update’ though is immensely irritating in its constant switching to links imbedded in the stories.  When I choose to read a story to read I want to read that story and not be constantly re-routed to other links, some of which have only very tenuous relevance to the story I am reading.  If there are links relevant to the story, insert them at the end of the story or in a bespoke section somewhere else, not ALL over the story so that is becomes a huge annoyance."
168,Qweposnkeo,"March 12, 2020",1,"Needs basic fixes Whenever one tries to scroll down to read an article, any link that's simply touched (whether by tapping or scrolling) sends you to that page/link/site. CNN knows this, a basic programmer can fix this. Yet, they don't. It's most-likely because it ultimately adds to additional revenue for CNN. I applaud CNN for their news coverage... just not their sell-out decisions to leave their app broken (a feature that can be fixed by basic programmer), and stay greedy money-hungry because their broken app adds to their bottom line. Also, their ads are like a plague from MySpace. Clean it up, kids. This ain't ""Jim Bob's News Shack"". This is CNN, it's supposed to be looking somewhat professional."

170,Ed1201,"September 20, 2017",1,"Do they use it themselves? There are many small details that are just not that user friendly. They have improved the pictures slide but the videos are even worse than before. Viewers should be able to read the brief description before deciding whether to watch it or not. The video titles are sometimes unclear, and i really don't want to watch a video when I'm outside. Some of the old problems such as the page jumping to the top when you accidentally tilt the phone is back. One thing that has improved is they now show how recent the article was posted or updated. Other than that, my opinion on the cnn app is still the same, good news source, bad app."
171,Grandma Tyseen,"January 29, 2019",5,"In CNN We Trust! Integrity, honesty, balance: despite criticism, CNN is and always has been the most reliable source of domestic and global news.

I want my news to come from human beings, not programmed, brainwashed automatons. Kudos to you, CNN. Jim Acosta is welcome at my house even if he’s not welcome at the White House.

The links are too sensitive and should require a double tap, because the way it is now I am sent to a linked article several times for every story I read, especially if there’s any glare on the screen making the underlining a little more muted. It’s distracting to watch for links and it is positively maddening to be removed from a story, so much so that I often find myself giving up and going to a different news app."

For instance, simply moving my finger over an embedded link in a story opens it immediately.  I used to have to click on it. But in iOS 13, simply touching an embedded link opens up the linked item. This makes the app unusable. Also, the app sends out way too many notifications. All I want is Breaking News notifications.

I have awakened on Sunday morning to find my iphone 7 battery almost totally drained. Checking my battery performance report on my iPhone settings it says that most of the battery drain was from CNN running in the background.

The slightest touch activates the links, so I find myself trying to completely avoid them while scrolling through articles. This is not my experience in other news sites.

Even the most careful fingers cannot get through an article without this rude and very annoying interruption. Whether this is intentional or poor thought process by app developers, it definitely hinders any productive read time on this app. I’ve started using other news apps as a result."

Trump has already done so much for this country and the American people, but all you people want to do is make up bad things to say about him because you don’t agree with making our country great again. It’s truly sad to see, but thanks for showing us who true democrats are (crying little children who throw tantrums when they don’t get their way while calling everyone bigots, racists, sexist, homophobic, etc if you don’t agree with them).

I’d have to scroll, wait for it to pause a second or two, then try to scroll again hoping it had caught up to me. Third, and finally, it started freezing and I’d have to close the app and re-open it.  Deleted!

But I haven’t watched your programming lately and as of the writing of this review have deleted the app. All that your coverage/reporting is doing is dividing the country and I can’t stomach another Trump hating diatribe by one of your liberal anchors.

If you do not, you’ll find reading any news article is painful to do as you’ll get halfway through it, only to be redirected to a link in the article while Safari or the app opens up something that you had no intention of reading.

Why can’t we do it with the super great stories like the one posted the s morning? “Inside the Air War on ISIS” I really wanted to read it but alas! I cannot since I foolishly clicked the banner notification (which is now gone forever when you do this) went to the story and bam! No way to save the story. I would have liked to read that.

I’ve been a CNN reader/viewer for two decades but with the recent changes to the website I’ve stopped reading it on my PC.  I’m deleting this app and since I assume the old app will soon go dead it will go too.

I didn’t vote for trump believe it or not because I believed the news I was hearing about him via CNN. I would support the man now though because I realize that your reporting on him was nothing but a leftist bombashing of a true leader. The man has gotten things done like he said he would.

It’s like a minefield.  You spend more time trying to figure out how to scroll without setting off chaos that you forget what you are reading.

It makes it nearly impossible to scroll through the articles and there’s no visual cue in the article itself that indicates touching that area will cause it to happen.

ALSO, when I get a notification, I touch the story and it NEVER seems to go to the actual story...but some main page...If I wanted the main page, I would open the app and not ask for push notifications...How much of my time can an app waste in a day!

More important to its functionality however is the lack of a smooth and reliable interface. Clicking on a story that you may want to view in the app routes you first to the store, even if you have the app open and running on your phone, and then from there to the Landon page of the app and not the actual story you were trying to view.

Quickly making stories up on how he could have killed the koi fish when moments before, the Minister did the same.

It’s very jarring and frustrating.  Besides that it’s really an excellent app.  You just have to mind where you touch to scroll.

I sometimes give up because it’s so frustrating. I appreciate you are linking the source but it’s made me so mad that I had to write a review which I don’t do often. Please look into this issue."

I can not scroll through any article without inadvertently clicking into another article or link at least 3 times. It’s become maddening. I spend more time trying to navigate back to the original article than actually reading. Incredibly frustrating but I suppose it gets them a few more pennies from advertisers every time it happens."
346,Can player,"October 9, 2019",1,"Newest update to App has flaw The app is now operating differently than before in the iPhone 11. It is nearly impossible to scroll down through the story without it switching to the story to the right (as though you did a swipe right gesture). This happens when simply touching your finger to the middle of the screen to try to swipe up. It is hypersensitive.  Sometimes you can’t scroll on a  story at all, sometimes it happens after being able to move half way through the story. Very frustrating and basically the app is mostly not useable as is. Please fix."

Where you used to be able to scroll through an article and only go to a linked article or ad upon a clear finger tap AND release, now merely touching a link when scrolling instantly takes you to another article or to your browsers. This behavior is idiotic as it’s very hard to scroll the text wall without dropping out of the app. Fix this with haste!"

MSNBC and other competitors are happy to let me watch, but CNN app shuts down after 10 minutes, regardless of my countless efforts to sign in or to uninstall and reinstall the app.  I even wrote to CNN using its help feature, but no one has bothered to respond.

It has become increasingly disappointing to open the CNN app to have to read negative headlines and articles that are more like opinion pages. It is obvious that CNN doesn’t like President Trump and anything that isn’t on a liberal agenda.  The stories are so left leaning that even a middle-of-the-road person like me has trouble believing if it is just hate and discontent or actually news.  I believe in giving second chances so will hold on to my app for a bit to see if CNN goes back to being an actual UNBIASED news app.

Try and find news from around the world on this site.   Try and find something other than Chris Cuomo’s unrelenting self-righteous opinions.   I am not a Trump fan.  But, I want news.

But I am using it even less now because the links are too numerous.  Within one article, I mistakenly hit a link, 5 or 6 times that takes me to another article.  It is extremely annoying.

359,👎Update Stinks,"October 9, 2019",1,Link sensitivity I too want to echo the complaint about the hyper-sensitivity of links embedded in every story. It’s so frustrating and makes me not want to use the app. This is a recent frustration. Other than that I would also recommend offering text versions of “news” stories only offered as video clips. Many people use the app in environments when playing video is inappropriate and I just find it annoying to not have the option to read what the video includes. It’s click bait. I however would update this review if the link sensitivity is corrected.

You also cannot click the notification again because it disappears from your past notifications on your phone. And, like I mentioned before, you can’t search for the article.

410,Andrew Browne,"November 13, 2017",5,"Love the site and app Not as liberal as it made out to be.  Rather moderate actually in my opinion, when you really consider what CNN is saying, but definitely leans left on some things.  Lots of video to go with articles in clear concise prose.  When it is an opinion piece it is clearly marked as such and they have conservative counterpoint articles usually.  I like it."

Navigating it is kinda weird and there are some stories with big pictures and then there are smaller stories under them that can be overlooked. Reading articles is kinda clunky too. The content and all is there, it’s just a little weird and difficult to find it. Would like more clarity and less clutter"

415,Pankaj1958,"December 16, 2019",3,Too many hyperlinks Content is good. But any article is very hard to read  because of a preponderance of links to other articles. Every few seconds you are thrown out of the article you are reading and a new page opens in the browser. It is very annoying and makes the app almost impossible to use unless you just watch the video. Text articles are near impossible to read properly.

It makes it impossible to read an article without being directed to another page at least 5 times whenever I read an article.

I am uninstalling the app in favor of making the switch to MSNBC.

422,PhoneVoterTVexec,"April 3, 2018",3,"One left hand clapping is boring. CNN’s bias, diminution of comments and iReports years ago, shows you are not interested in your audiences’ viewpoints. You have become a polarized advocate for a combo fascism and socialism, and offer little in the way of opposing panelists, or opposing hosts. Same with Fox’s right hand clapping solely. It’s no wonder any city’s talk radio that at least has a handful of feedback from listeners, has better ratings than you or Fox do across all platforms. That will change."

I stopped using the app months ago and today I got a notification of most read stories in the last year explaining it was not politics.    I clicked it and again it only showed Trump.

People are complaining. the new iOS 13 link preview changes has caused links in your app to become too sensitive. When you are scrolling trying to read a story the slightest touch takes you to the imbedded link. This is annoying and frustrating. So much that I’ve pretty much stopped reading your news. But don’t worry FOX news has the same problem. The question is are you going to allow FOX news to beat you in technology?
427,JoshuaJohn1911,"October 4, 2019",1,Remove the hyperlinks in articles please!!!!!!!! This app is great overall! Besides while reading an article as you start scrolling down it is filled with hyperlinks to other CNN and non CNN related articles. As you naturally scroll down you accidentally click on the other links “SOOOOO ANNOYING!!” Taking you away from what you are reading. I’ve stopped using the app as much mainly because of this... please move them elsewhere. This is the absolute most frustrating part of the app which is essentially the main point of the app-to reading the content. Smh

Just barely touching any link as you scroll moves you to other articles and opens web browser pages.  And the number of links in an article seems to have increased.  Unsure if it is the new Apple iOS or the new CNN version but it is super frustrating.  Is it a marketing ploy because they get paid for every click?

If I stop after reading a story, there is often an ad from CNN to sign up for more clutter which I have to dismiss before I can just read more or close the app to do something else.

So out of the 10 minutes allotted to my “preview” 6 minutes of it was a repeated content punctuated by 4 minutes of commercials.  To boot, tuning into the actual CNN proved that the claim of “LIVE” was actually a pre recorded propaganda video about how “poor little” Michael Jackson was discriminated against by MTV.  Meanwhile on the actual CNN live broadcast was continual Trump bashing as expected from this network. In fact to prove I’m not exaggerating, they were discussing how Trump’s Russian issues were worse than ever.  Sourced by some former Clinton official."

Simply trying to scroll down will cause you to accidentally tap one of the 50+ links they put into each article. I cannot stand this app. I love reading the articles but this app makes simply reading the news extremely annoying. Fix this. At times I will even be very careful where I put my thumb to scroll down and still somehow manage to hit a link. Worst design of any news app.
585,rmchil,"October 19, 2019",2,"Articles contain way too many external web site links. The articles contain way too many words that are also links to external web sites.

591,貓澤東,"December 16, 2017",1,"Significantly Worse — Why?! CNN, your app “upgrade” is worse in every way. I get it that you want to showcase video, but you have dumbed down the app, instead of adding more features and control, and made it harder for news lovers to find the news they want. Your advertising system is buggy and freezes on ads. Fail. Actually, you should learn from the New York Times and give your viewership a way to give meaningful feedback. You are devolving not evolving, even though you have plenty of good content."

I don’t want every article I see to be so biased and skewed, that I can’t even try to read it from a middle of the road perspective. I am an independent voter, and frankly I am disgusted.

601,mpm227,"November 15, 2017",2,Liked the older version much better This new app is definitely a much more pleasant view of the news.  It was easier to scan the older version for items of interest.  Now it’s like reading a newspaper without headlines.  However I find it humorous that people who spent 8 years bashing Obama object to the fact that the Presidunce lies to the people multiple times a day and label any facts they don’t like fake news.  That’s fine since we have a fake Presidunce.

604,almac90,"December 14, 2018",3,"Good stories too much opinion CNN covers a wide range of interesting topics and there are actually facts in their stories, but there is also a little too much opinion.

Also a audio only feature would be welcome."

810,Sean2466258,"July 6, 2018",1,"Worst news app ever Completely one-sided news reporting that is losing credibility with every article posted. The opinion articles are the absolute worst and they are only written from the liberal left point of view. Also, I’m pretty sure this app had a solid 1 Star in the App Store at one point, and now it miraculously has 4.7 somehow. Just goes to show how fake it is deleting legitimate reviews to increase the rating. I only use this app for the breaking news features."

This app should have 0 stars. You have CNN but you took off info wars, I hate the guy but guess what CNN is propaganda that lies just as well. Your a joke Apple and so are you CNN."

How about non-stop coverage on how difficult it is to survive on DISABILITY SOCIAL SECURITY...and how those on SSDI should have their disability income at least TRIPLED!  THERE ARE EVERYDAY AMERICANS BARELY SURVIVING, but CNN is so wrapped up in saving illegal immigrants.  How about this?

Deleted the app.  I’ll check back in a while to see if they’ve changed it, and if so, I’ll reinstall.  I give the app 4/5 stars if this issue wasn’t present."

Your app keep pushing pop ups to LIVE TV. And I have to keep putting the read more options.  You have a section on the app for watching LIVE.  Leave the part that is for reading for READING.  This is very bothersome.  If you can leave the reading part fir reading. I will just have to stop using this app.

4177,Ebo1972,"October 15, 2019",3,"Love lost over links The CNN app is the first thing I look at every morning to get quickly caught up. CNN, more than most, tries to keep bias at bay and make it obvious when what you’re reading is opinion. But for a while now the links in articles have  been a problem. It’s not that the links aren’t relevant, and real reporting benefits from being able to cite sources directly and share further information. The problem is the links open instantly at the slightest brush of a finger or thumb. Until fairly recently the links opened in the CNN app, be they to another CNN article or to an outside source. Now most links open up in my safari browser before I can even react. Not only does this literally take me to another app, it also is constantly opening up web pages that I know nothing about and have no idea if they’re secure or not. Even the links that open other CNN articles for some reason usually open that article twice in a row. Since I switched to OS 13 the problem has gotten even worse. I have links open when I’m simply too close to them but not even touching them! Often there so many links it’s nearly impossible to scroll through an article without touching one. It’s like trying to read a paper while someone is constantly shoving a different paper in front of you! I’ve reported this directly to CNN through the app, but I’m now taking my grievances public. PLEASE do something about this CNN! A quick scan through the reviews shows that I am by far the only person experiencing this! It doesn’t happen in other news apps so I know it can be fixed! Be all the app you can be! Earn the love back and let links be links instead of instant warps to another news dimension! "

When past presidents have attempted the same things CNN posted favorable coverage. Has anyone thought about the country that our president represents and what he could accomplish if he had some support. An example of this: in the past leaders of North Korea have made all kinds of threats and violence to the US and other countries and when that occurred our presidents always tried to pacify them with talk and many times giving in to their demands or at least partially. None of that worked period. So now we have a new president with new ideas, one that was elected to run the country. And what happens does he get support, no just the opposite. Federal judges wanting to show off stop him cold , news media publish their BS polls that I think they get out of their butts. When he attempts to stop or scare Kim when Kim threatens us with nukes he reminds him that we also have nukes , but then what happens while Kim is shaking with the thought of losing his position in life: a bunch of elected officials and again the news media all quickly announce that president Trump doesn’t have the power to make a first strike or use our nuclear weapons. Wow way to go I’m sure Kim in North Korea was able to breathe normal again with that bit of good news. Wake up America if president Trump loses the country loses. United we stand and divided  we fall. Old news, yes but we better wake up or we might just wake up to a whole new world, one that we may not like."

If something mildly weird happened somewhere in the world, it is sure to find his way to this app.  And, while I am no Trump fan, I get the feeling that I am inside my own echo chamber while reading CNN, because as much as I appreciate reading Articles detailing our president’s incompetence, I suspect he and his administration must occasionally do something right – – but you would never know by reading CNN."
