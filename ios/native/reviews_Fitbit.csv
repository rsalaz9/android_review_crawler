0,Jane - Eastern Cape,"March 23, 2019",4,"Awesome...but needs a little tweaking üòâ I am absolutely hooked on my Fitbit! I bought the Charge 3 and I hate taking it off. I love the notifications it sends if I haven‚Äôt moved from my desk each hour, I love the fact you can challenge other friends and colleagues to weekend, or weekly challenges as well as track your own performance. It‚Äôs got me more motivated than any exercise book, or personal trainer. The only downside I find is that it‚Äôs not 100% accurate. My resting heart rate on an ECG machine compared to my Fitbit has a difference of 10 beats per minute...that‚Äôs a big number when you‚Äôre trying to work in fat burn mode or/and cardio. In addition, when I train with other people my steps are pretty much the same but when we e all walked a 12km walk (as we‚Äôve done consistently this week), my Fitbit comes up with almost 2km less than the others! The only time it‚Äôs accurate is if I walk with my GPS on my phone and then sync the data after my walk/run. In addition the calorie counter has very limited good options and scanning them and sending them off is too time consuming. I find I‚Äôm using the ‚ÄúMy Fitnesspal‚Äù app to monitor my food intake...please look at their app and try and make the Fitbit calorie counter more user friendly. Apologies for mentioning the bits that need ‚Äútweaking‚Äù,  but it‚Äôs constructive feedback that I feel is important. All in all I am so chuffed that I have a Fitbit as its now become a way of life for me! Thank you to the Fitbit team of developers ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,noaccountname,"October 26, 2018",5,So much for bug fixes.... and they were fixed! Previous comments earning the app 3 stars a week ago: First time that the app has failed in over a year. So averaged out the number of stars to give it‚Äî with this week being 1 star and rest of year is 5. Since the latest update my Flex 2 wont sync. Ironic timing since I actually managed to finally do some serious exercising every day this week. I think the tracker is still storing data since I‚Äôm still getting silent alarms and notifications when wearing it. I hope it‚Äôs storing everything til bugs are fixed. Please!
2,Mssmith0516,"May 22, 2019",4,"FitBit app is pretty good, minus some frustrations I love my FitBit Versa and the FitBit app, but my one complaint would be the overwhelming number of clock faces to choose from and no real way to filter through them. The categories are broken down to only a few, at most, and the search feature isn‚Äôt really all that reliable for what you‚Äôre truly trying to search for. For example, when searching for ‚Äúbeach‚Äù it only shows a few options, but IF you have a large amount of free time to search through the extensive library one by one, you happen to come across several more while browsing. Maybe having a ‚Äútag‚Äù feature for clock face developers to add search keywords would be nice. It would also be nice if there was a feature to filter clock faces by which ones are free from those that you have to buy."
3,GG245777543236,"October 6, 2018",4,"Feel Naked w/o my Fitbit! But.... I‚Äôve had a Fitbit for 5 yrs now and use both it and the app religiously. There was a frustrating Firmware issue with the charge 2 and another device crapped out on me but Fitbit replaced and has since fixed everything. I now (still) have a Charge HR that has been running strong for 2.5 yrs... the App itself is great, I love the challenges and the navigation is easy/intuitive for the most part. One part I don‚Äôt like is the adventures area. So far it‚Äôs just places like Yosemite, NYC, Boston... Why? There are so many grand walks/hikes in so many areas of the world. There are also lots of other sites and apps that have countless walks/hikes mapped in whatever area you happen to be in but I‚Äôd much prefer to be able to access all of this from the Fitbit App. I‚Äôm stumped as to why Fitbit hasn‚Äôt extended the selection when it would be easy to load other walks and in turn be much more usable for everyone! It would also increase Fitbit usage and engagement. I remember thinking this when I first saw adventures on the front page of the app, clicked on it and saw just a few areas. Today I decided to check again and... 3-4 years later they still have the same few walks/hikes. This is so odd I‚Äôm kind of scratching my head as to why expanding this section hasn‚Äôt occurred to anyone at Fitbit, what the obstacles are (seems easy/doable and cost/benefit smart) and why it hasn‚Äôt happened?"
4,seely rd,"June 8, 2018",5,"Great gadget I am giving my Fitbit Zip five stars, even though I only use the steps portion. It is fun, gives me good info about a job I have, where I am on my feet for my entire shift, and it is easy to use. "
5,Hilexi12,"December 18, 2018",4,"Loyal fitbit customer Hi I‚Äôve had my Fitbit for a while and it is consistently helpful in tracking my sleep, food intake, drink intake, and menestral cycle. And of course, fitbit is known for tracking of activity and steps as well as heart rate. There is one complaint I have. I need a competitive atmosphere to enhance my healthy living. With the friends option you can challenge friends to like three different challenges. These challenges can easily get boring and unmotivated users if your friend runs track or something. I think it would be in fitbit and the health of the world‚Äôs intentions to have challenges dedicated to drinking enough water and reaching calorie goals and sleep goals as well. Activity is a big part of our health, however, when it comes to hydration, sleep, and nutrition many people are falling behind. With an increase in steps and activity. Fitbit should provide reminders to drink more water and to eat some food for more energy. I think that your healthy diet begins in the kitchen and ends with the right amount of steps. Without doing too much out of my way, I can usually achieve my step goal, but I often struggle with hydration and have fainting spells and sometimes get hospitalized due to lack of hydration. It is vital to a person‚Äôs well being to stay hydrated especially after working out or moving a lot. Thank you so much for listening and I hope you take my advice into account."
6,Eschfineart,"September 20, 2019",3,"Love my Fitbit Versa, but... I bought my Fitbit Versa Lite after weight gain due to a back injury. It has done a wonderful job motivating me to move more and eat healthier. I‚Äôve lost four lbs in just the past few weeks. The sleep Score and record would be awesome if it worked accurately, but it is not working well at all for me. I‚Äôm in my mid-60‚Äôs and I wake up to go to the bathroom a few times a night. Even though I‚Äôm only up for a few minutes and usually fall right back asleep, the app splits my night into several segments, each usually under 3 hours so I only get the simplified sleep details for each (or sometimes for only one or two of them) even if I‚Äôm getting 5 hrs and 30 minutes total. I don‚Äôt understand why it doesn't just keep tallying my sleep noting those 2-3 min bathroom breaks as awake periods in the total night. Last night my Fitbit only recorded sleep from 3:15 am to 7:10. I actually went to bed at 11:30 and slept very soundly until 1:15. Went to the bathroom and right back to a sound sleep until 2:45 when I woke up briefly for another bathroom break, then, right back to sleep again. My app doesn‚Äôt show or count any of my sleep from 11:15-2:45 and there‚Äôs almost a 30 minute gap between me going back to sleep at 2:48 and 3:15 when it actually did begin recording my sleep. What‚Äôs up with that??  "
7,Road Runner 1971,"May 17, 2019",5,"My partner in fitness I‚Äôve had my Fitbit Ionic for a year and a half and am very happy with it. This is my 3rd Fitbit and the Ionic addresses the issues I had with my first two ‚Äòbits, namely a one-day battery life and the fact I couldn‚Äôt immerse it in water. The data collected by my Ionic is logically and usefully displayed on the Fitbit app. I‚Äôm a recovering heart attack patient and the heart rate data compiled in the app is essential reading for my doctor. I transcribe the heart data onto my own spreadsheets and provide them to my doctor every time I have an appointment. The accuracy of the readings is impressive and consistent and when my numbers are taken three times a week at my cardiac rehab sessions at the hospital we‚Äôve come to use the Fitbit‚Äôs heart rate number over that of the nurse‚Äôs oximeter because my Fitbit tends to do a better job filtering out the ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù of my a-fib condition. Medical science is a data-driven discipline and being able to provide my doctor with hard data each visit is immensely valuable. My last doctor‚Äôs appt in April lasted NINE MINUTES - all because I provided the spreadsheet numbers compiled by my Fitbit and displayed on the app. If you‚Äôre trying to talk to your doctor about your health and how you‚Äôre feeling and don‚Äôt have numbers to quantify your opinions, well, you‚Äôre only guessing."
8,CCW223,"December 17, 2019",1,"I switched to APPLE! I like the FitBit app BUT the watch always has glitches. My text no longer come on my watch face like they did before and I have done every check, measure suggested and reset my watch to know end. Every time my husband and I do an update something else goes wrong and you half to guess which part of the watch or phone app won‚Äôt work this time. I have owned my watch for three years and the battle is constant. My husband two years. Since my last review and update my watch will not turn. I have cleaned the charging points, roughed them up with a brush and cleaned my charger, still it will not do what it is intended for. Also FitBit DOES NOT have the capability to change the battery which means a $200 Versa watch (at the time) is JUNK! So our solution to the problem has been to purchase Apple watches. It is spot on and has ZERO glitches in the month we have owned them and we have done one update. Where Apple lacks is its ability to have sleep, diet, and caloric monitoring in one place. IE you have to have a separate app for these things so for example I use FatSecret, pillow and 8Fit for these items. So in comparison if you want something that works use Apple but if your looking for a program that works half the time but is all in one place Fitbit is your solution. The only way I would go back to FitBit is if they made the batteries changeable because batteries loose there ability to charge over time even if you let them go dead and then recharge."
9,tmdbeagles,"June 25, 2019",1,"New Version is Terrible I love my Fitbit, just updated my hardware for the third time to the Charge 3 and I love it! However I had to leave a review for the first time ever to say how much I HATE the new version of the app. Before, you could customize the tiles and then you wouldn't have to mess with it ever again, now that's not the case, the challenges have been moved to the main screen, I constantly have to move the challenges out of the way, since they default to the very top, so I can keep the water tracking tile at the top. Once the challenge is over, they take a while to go away, which before it was on the main screen was fine, now that the challenge is on the main screen, they are just in the way of any new challenge. Plus you can't tell the difference between old and new challenges when you try to move them. And the main screen doesn't remember where you were when you click on a tile, so if you click on a tile, when you go back to the main screen, you return to the top, this is especially annoying if you have multiple challenges you are checking, since they are all named the same you have to find a new way to figure out which challenges you've already looked at and which you still need to look at."
10,Aceyourface,"September 15, 2017",4,"Creeps in the community Firstly I would like to say, the app works great. I hadn't used a fit bit in a year or two so I had to figure out how the new look of the app worked but it wasn't hard. I loved that my history from my old Fitbit was there because it gave me motivation to get back to how I used to be. "
11,The Zenth,"October 17, 2017",3,Overall a great pair (app & Fitbit Flex) except some bugs My Fitbit Flex works great with this app. The app works great most the time except for the few ‚Äúbugs‚Äù that it has. 
12,Kendal_Toby,"March 20, 2018",4,"Great Fitness App! üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëèüèª This is a great app, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. I love all the different features that can help you stay fit. This app encourages me to stay on my diet, or keep working out, or just maintaining a healthier lifestyle, even when the time gets tough. In addition, I really appreciate how you read and listen to these reviews. Just a suggestion: where you log your food, you can create a custom food but you can‚Äôt  delete or edit them. It would be very helpful if we could do both or either of those. I created a custom food because it wasn‚Äôt listed in the provided foods but I forgot a word in the title and it made it a completely different product from what it was. I really need to edit it and change it but that is not an option. Also, another thing that would be cool to have is if you could create a custom workout for your exercise. There is a limited number of options and I make up my own workouts and I would like to put it in the log. Likewise, where you can track where you run, hike, or walk is a very helpful feature! Could you, by any chance, add biking to that? It would make it a bit more useful for me. These are just a few suggestions that I believe would improve the app. Overall this app is great and I am so thankful for it!"
13,the dalan,"April 17, 2019",5,"Huge fan I love my charge 3. I love how it tracks sleep and keeps track of my sleep stages. I love that I can track my runs, the splits, distance, and shows a map. Battery life is great. Notifications are great as well. 100% waterproof. The only time I take it off is to charge which I only have to do once a week. Also very durable I play basketball 3 times a week. Sometimes it will get hit by someone‚Äôs hand or the ball and my Fitbit shows no damage. I love Apple. Im bossed with my Mac and iPhone. But the Fitbit is way better than the Apple Watch and a fraction of the price. "
14,Nattt22222,"February 8, 2020",3,"2019 update significantly decreased my Fitbit use I‚Äôve had my Fitbit for over a year now, and I love checking the app through out the day to check my stats. The old tile dashboard made it so I could open the app and see all that I needed to see without scrolling. When they did the update at the end of 2019 and changed it to the white list screen, I was so upset, but hoped I would eventually get used to it and it would be fine. Six months later, not only do I still hate it, but I just realized, because I rarely bother scrolling, that I haven‚Äôt used my water intake feature or the steps per hour feature in months because I just kind of forgot they were there. I used these every single day before the update because they were right there when I opened the app in a visually pleasing and user-friendly tile dashboard. I‚Äôm writing this review now because I ended up scrolling down today and was like, woah, I totally forgot about these features. I don‚Äôt understand why, with such a huge amount of negative feedback from users, Fitbit doesn‚Äôt at least provide the option of switching back to the old dashboard - or at least, design an optional new dashboard that offers users the features they lost in the new one. Simply put, the new dashboard is terrible, and after giving it time to see if I‚Äôd get used to it, I still hate it."
15,Kate.151922,"September 18, 2019",1,"New App Design Turning Customers Away!! I think I speak for the whole Fitbit community when I say the former app style was far superior to the new one. I have no desire to even open the app anymore. It is not appealing at all. The old dashboard style was WONDERFUL ‚Äî you could open the app up and instantly view your stats in each little box without having to open each individual tile up, the card style was extremely visually appealing and fun to use, the fonts and colors were great. Now, the app is a major turn off with its new list view, small and uninviting font, and the stat previews are unfamiliar and no longer easy to understand. I am always open to change and updates but this new app style is definitely not a good one... especially when there are thousands of others complaining of the same thing. Fitbit, I hope you can incorporate a different app design similar to the old one, or I think you‚Äôll be losing a lotttt of customers. The old dashboard design was one of the most appealing things to me as a Fitbit user and I used to be excited to check it every day. Now I can‚Äôt stand it. :( Please have your design team look into this. I know that apps must always be streamlined and keep up with updated design styles, but there are ways to keep the old basics (card style, bright colors, large fun font and lots of icons) while still making it look fresh and new. Please consider this. All of us at the Fitbit community will greatly appreciate this!"
16,Roseredsiren,"October 24, 2019",3,Had a good product Quit messing with it. Every time you make a significant change in your algorithms around data collection it messes with the quality of the data set. For example when sleep stages came out it made changes to the resting heart rate calculations and I started getting new weird data patterns and I could no longer see the patterns in my menstrual cycle in the graph. Now you‚Äôve added this damned useless and meaningless sleep score that I can‚Äôt get rid of or change the prominence of and I have to dig to find the info I really need and want which is how long did I sleep and maybe how much REM did I get. Though I don‚Äôt trust that measurement anymore because around the same time as the update that brought the score I suddenly started getting much higher REM readings regularly with no changes to my behavior around sleep or my experience of my sleep. All this makes me distrust the data more and more. And let‚Äôs be honest- the fact that there are now all these new extra measurements and ‚Äúinsights‚Äù is a money making scheme because they are locked unless you subscribe to a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù account. I‚Äôm probably not going to ditch my Fitbit all together but I would no longer recommend it to someone else. It was a good product. Don‚Äôt go changing it just to change it or try to drive consumption you end up ruining it.
17,3rddegreenos,"September 25, 2019",1,"Disappointed My first versa didn‚Äôt even last a FULL year before it completely shut down and stopped working for good. Got my second versa about two weeks ago and it started giving problems today when it began to incorrectly record my caloric count while I was at the gym. I also noticed that the previous day, I racked up a total of almost 3k in caloric count and it reset on the watch and in the app around 8pm the night, so it ended up not recorded my caloric count that day. So I decided to do a hard reset. After hard resetting and setting up device (which took multiple tries since it didn‚Äôt work correctly the first few times) my device now won‚Äôt sync with the app. It currently says ‚Äúlooking...‚Äù I‚Äôm fed up with fit bit. I chose this watch over the apple series because the battery life last almost 6 days with a full charge and I‚Äôd be using it to track my physical activity as oppose to Apple Watch only lasting about 2 &1/2 days. I suspect my first versa had water damage (even though it is advertised to be waterproof) since I swim a lot, the screen went blank and the watch continued to work until it eventually died. I‚Äôm worried now because my current versa is giving the same software issues my previous one did leading up to its demise and it‚Äôs only been about two weeks since I opened the package. Please do better! For $200 this isn‚Äôt worth it to be honest and I really had high hopes for this... Very disappointed."
18,g026026,"September 7, 2019",1,"Sleep Score is Demoralizing I‚Äôll start by saying I loved my Fitbit. I got it last Christmas and it has helped me to feel motivated and accomplished, as well as accountable. However, the new display that includes a sleep score is horribly demoralizing. Every morning I wake up to check my sleep - hours slept, when I woke up, how it compares to other nights. I use this information to try to improve my sleep and my stress levels. This morning, knowing I had a long, challenging day ahead, I saw that my sleep had been given an arbitrary 70-something score which I cannot remove to just view the actual data. It‚Äôs on every screen. That‚Äôs a C on a test. I felt miserable and like I wanted to give up, and now feel like I have to remove the sleep feature (a key reason I wanted a Fitbit to begin with) to avoid feeling like a failure every morning. Please make this feature optional or remove it altogether; you‚Äôve ruined the start of my day, where my Fitbit used to make me feel excited and happy to start the day off productively."
19,JaMminBritishLuv,"October 14, 2019",3,"Love the app BUT I already wrote a review about the new app update and how terrible it is but I also wanted to write a review about how terrible the period tracker feature is! The interface on that has been horrible since they added it and I get frustrated EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to edit my period dates. The whole ‚Äúdrag the bar to fine tune your start and end dates‚Äù is annoying and does not respond well at all. It often gets stuck on one day and no matter what I do I cannot move it. Or I can‚Äôt get it to stop on the day I want. Why can‚Äôt we just select the dates manually without having to drag a bar? Also sometimes periods are irregular and maybe last a day or two and then go away for a day or two and come back, but the way this app does it currently is that you cannot add two separate periods in one month. You can only add the one so you cannot get it to display accurately at all. Make it so you can manually select each day and put in whether or not your period was on that day. I use Flow for my main period tracking since that app is dedicated to that and a million times better but I‚Äôd also like to track it in my Fitbit app since that‚Äôs where all my other health data is stored. Please please please fix this feature because it is terrible as it is right now."
20,Pcrystal,"November 16, 2017",5,"Switched back to Fitbit So I switched from Fitbit to Garmin back to Fitbit. Had I looked at the Ionic prior to switching I may not have switched at all. I disagree with other users that say the Ionic will not receive phone and text alerts. Mine is doing it fine. It was tricky to set up, requiring changing settings on my phone itself, but knock on wood, it works fine. The app is MUCH easier to navigate than the Garmin. My biggest complaint to date is that there is not a way to delete messages received via the Fitbit app. So some other Fitbit user whom you don‚Äôt know, can send you an inappropriate message, and you have to see it for the next 30 days. My last one was a user asking if ‚Äúmy pants are on.‚Äù I blocked the user, but I still had to see that message for 30 days. Seems like it should be an easy thing for developers, and I have seen many other requests for the same, so hopefully Fitbit listens soon. Other than that, having seen what the competition has to offer, I give the app 5 stars. And I recommend to other users to google how to set up your phone in addition to the Fitbit app so you can receive your notifications. Mine was an easy 3 second fix."
21,UPSET WITH UPDATE 9999,"July 23, 2018",4,"Update of July 12, 2018 I have been a loyal Fitbit customer for over 3 years, often recommending the trackers to friends and relatives.  I credit the app and device for helping me lose 90 lbs and keep it off.  I especially like that the app includes food tracking and that anyone can add foods that they use and are not already included."

23,Rockin' Grammy,"January 21, 2019",5,"Life Changer We are seniors, age 73 and 78.  We started walking with Fitbit almost 3 years (me)/2 years (my spouse) ago.  We were diabetics.  Having the Fitbit prompt us is like having a personal coach living with us.  I also used the Fitbit to track my eating.  By having the ability to see calories in our food selections almost instantly, helped us with our food selections too.  Now back to why I titled this ‚ÄúLife Changer‚Äù.  My husband was a couch potato his entire life.  Fitbit got him into a daily walking routine.  We both lost weight - about 110 pounds between the two of us!  We both reduced the number of meds we needed each day.  And last quarterly diabetic check, our A1C was 6.2, prediabetic range.  We will always be diabetic, but thanks to the use of Fitbit, we can manage the disease.  We can not say enough good things about Fitbit and how easy the app is to use.  As a side note, I also like being able to walk with ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù.  I live in VA and walk with cousins in FL and PA.  We like cheering/taunting/messaging too.  I never get to see them so it is fun knowing our Fitbit app connects us through our walking - every day!  As I said, I could go on and on and....üíï"
24,Victgum,"April 22, 2019",1,Hacked. Updated Account hacked and given no time table for getting information back. I need this for work-insurance discount.  Have trouble syncing after every time there is an update with my ionic and this last time my account was stolen somehow. Customer service stated they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything without my email and in the same breath said they saw my account synced at such and such time....contradicting. Disappointing.
25,Victoriaanne2012,"June 8, 2019",3,"Great; Could be better This app is great but I think it could be better. It‚Äôs one of the first things I check in the morning to see how I slept. It‚Äôs really easy to use and encouraging to see all the numbers change.  The only thing this app is missing (and which I have to use another app for which is SUPER annoying) is the ability to create custom recipes so I can accurately put in dinner. Currently I have to put everything in by hand which isn‚Äôt the worst except I always have leftovers do I have to divide the recipe by thirds or something. It‚Äôd be a lot easier if I could just enter it once and say the serving size. It‚Äôd also be a lot easier if you could copy one meal from one day and place the same exact meal in another. This goes back to the leftover thing because if I make a complex dish, I have to remember everything I put in it for multiple days (thinking about the math) and it‚Äôs vaguely irritating. I also think that you should be able to track your macros more efficiently. The percentages are great and everything but they seem a bit useless if you‚Äôre actually trying to measure your protein or carb intake. But other than those things I really do enjoy the app. I just think it could be a little better and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be hard for them to do."
26,DD_1976,"January 27, 2020",4,"Keep on stepping... I have been using a Fitbit now for almost four years, initially purchasing one to motivate myself to walk to work and not waste money on cabs. That worked and of course I paid for the Fitbit within weeks! I now monitor my steps daily and find its pretty accurate. I have noticed that the distance is always off substantially (am guessing maybe I could set the step distance to correct that but haven‚Äôt bothered.) I love the challenges and connect with family and friends across the globe on a daily basis as we motivate each other to move. I‚Äôve even gifted multiple Fitbits to include some of my loved ones. My only gripe is that within the challenges, the comments have been incomplete for quite some time. I keep waiting for one of the updates to fix the error, but months later I am motivated to write this (seeing that many comments get a reply. üôÇ) To be clear, the wording such as ‚ÄòThat step goal was no match for...‚Äô is often cut off so that I can‚Äôt see the persons name. I always like and cheer comments and achievements but at times I am liking my own achievements due to the incomplete statements. I hope this makes sense and that Fitbit will rectify the issue soon."

28,getting to the edge!,"February 5, 2020",1,"Takes forever to sync Edit: every time I want to sync my Fitbit, I have to remove the Fitbit and reinstall it! The ‚Äúhelpful links‚Äù the company sends you is ridiculous and useless! It is beyond frustrating to invest in a product you were happy with in the past just to have it flake out when you switch phones! I will be switching to an Apple Watch if this is not fixed soon!!!

29,Lisscal,"March 1, 2020",1,"Loved Fitbit, hate the new location thing I have had 3 different Fitbit watches and I absolutely love them and the software over the years. I run, bike and hike all the time, something every day. I love the heart rate data and fitness scores, sleep tracker and female health. I think they are great health tools, whether or not you‚Äôre as active as I am. HOWEVER since the update right before GOOGLE BOUGHT FITBIT, you are now required to keep location on ‚Äúalways‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhile using app‚Äù, which uses a ton of data and drains your battery. My phone told me one day that Fitbit had fetched my location 49 times that day. FORTY NINE TIMES. No wonder my battery lasted half a day instead of 2. "
30,Yenyem,"October 1, 2017",5,"Please please work together !! So I had my Fitbit for a while now and then my fianc√© got me an Apple Watch as an earlier wedding gift.

I feel there should be some middle ground to the preferences of everyone. Some are ok with their Fitbit watches, and some just want Apple Watches, and we would all love to be able to both continue competing with one another. Please make this possible! I‚Äôve read that sync solver app helps but then I read that it only syncs your data but it does not put the steps into the competitions. Any input on this would greatly be appreciated!

With my previous Flex (1), it would work if I changed the type of exercise (used hike or run instead of walk) but wouldn‚Äôt work for walk (kinda indicates it‚Äôs a problem within the app) but that won‚Äôt work now, either. I will literally be sitting on my couch, using WiFi, and the tracker shows me moving all over the place...I ‚Äúwalked‚Äù 2 miles in 7 minutes while sitting on my couch!

34,Cappyra,"May 7, 2019",2,"I would have given it a better rating if... ... I were asked to rate this app a few weeks ago. Recently I was forced to use a new dashboard. Their community board said that select users were asked if they wanted to try a new dashboard but all I remember is opening the app and everything had changed. I think this is a rather sneaky way to get feedback from a beta of your app changes but I could get past that point if there were significant improvements. There weren‚Äôt. The new dashboard was more difficult to read, very bland, no visible animations when goals were achieved and did I mention that once you got the new dashboard you could not roll back?  I have been a Fitbit customer for about 3 years now. Up until the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I would have given the app at least 4 stars. I used the Fitbit and app to track my activity, food, sleep etc and have lost over 20 pounds. I loved it. It made it even more disappointing to me because of how much I depended on it for my routine. It still works... mostly... though I have had issues with syncing lately. I would recommend checking the community board. Three weeks ago I would have whole heartily recommended this product. Now I can‚Äôt. Fitbit if you are reading this please give us back the old better dashboard or an option of dashboards."

It had worked seamlessly for a long time.  I loved that I could receive texts and notifications.  The notifications stopped work months ago.

They used to have the Chicago routes that you could run through as well as the vernal falls route, valley loop route and my personal favorite, the Pohono trail, but Fitbit has cut all of the Chicago adventures and the vernal falls route. Please listen when I say that the adventures to me are the most important element to this app and I really want more. Aside from the adventures I have a Fitbit ionic which has failed me a few times but after talking with people at Fitbit, we managed to get it working to the best of its abilities and I for one love the exercise features, there are so many that are given to me in such a simple manner that it is easy to know accurately everything that was going on during my workout, I am primarily a runner and I think the Fitbit ionic is best suited for these types of people because the GPS is the best that I have seen in a smart watch. And what is even more is that the battery lasts so long and I‚Äôm two years into using my Fitbit and the battery still doesn‚Äôt seem to be faltering. The app is, to me at least, the best fitness app out there and I would love to see more adventure races come to the app."

From time issues because apparently not syncing right to battery issues to app issues to it freezing up and most importantly it is poor quality and falls apart! I have super glued this countless times & even called & had it replaced but still had same problems. Customer service was rude & questioned me & gave me hard time about my daughters and why my daughter under 16 had one... They would only replace one even though we were having problems with both. Later did same thing to my husband and wouldn‚Äôt replace. His doesn‚Äôt work anymore, mine is completely falling apart and my daughters won‚Äôt sync right! Now I just did an upgrade well tried to anyway & it is completely frozen doing nothing but has what looks like a charging bar across it. Held button down & reset 4x, attempted to charge, sync it & try update over & over & still nothing!! So fed up! Will be looking into different brand! Otherwise I love everything it does & track & that lots of friends were using & could compete but many friends stopped using and I wonder if this is why... I know others complained & I have seen others whose are falling apart! To many other brands out there that do same thing to stay with the crap product!"

I have a crossfit membership so I don‚Äôt have to come up with workouts, but I think the trainer section is pretty cool with built in workouts even though I don‚Äôt really use them. However, I would love a section of weight loss tracking. It‚Äôs great to be able to set a goal and update your weight when you want. But I‚Äôve not found a feature that lets you track the progress with a graph or even a table of previous weigh ins. Seeing that chart go down is super motivating and My Fitness Pal is a much better option for that.  I also just found the hiking challenge section which is really interesting. You go to a ‚Äúdestination‚Äù and as you accumulate steps you hit landmarks on the trail with really awesome photos. The only challenge I have with it is once you‚Äôre in the photo the only way I can figure to get out of it is to ‚Äúshare‚Äù to the Fitbit community. I don‚Äôt love that. Overall, great app."

I hit a point where the constant notifications from my Apple Watch were stressing me out so I ditched it and got a Fitbit Inspire HR and I have to say, I‚Äôm really loving it!  I have a nice mechanical watch that I like wearing on my dominant wrist and I wear my Fitbit on the other wrist - I didn‚Äôt really need a smart watch, just a fitness tracker.  I really like how the Fitbit is fitness-centric and I like the small form factor of the inspire.  It encourages me to move when I‚Äôve been sitting for too long and I love having my steps right on my wrist - seeing them regularly pushes me to hit and exceed fitness goals.  Also, the app is second to none.  Aside from my Apple Watch, I‚Äôve also had Garmin devices in the past and from an app perspective, the Fitbit app is way better than both.  It‚Äôs intuitive and loaded with tons of valuable health stats - it‚Äôs kind of your go-to dashboard for all things health and fitness.  For the price you pay for a Fitbit, this is all a tremendous value.  I think I‚Äôm going to be a Fitbit user for a long time."

Customers need to know that Fitbit has essentially sold out and made the app absolute trash. It used to work great before the company sold. Now, it doesn‚Äôt load properly. To see your stats it has immense lag to load your basic information from previous days. Basic information that was once free is now premium. The app, which was once colorful, fun and motivating to look at, looks awful and ugly. Worst of all- new challenges with other players are displayed at the very top of the page and supersedes your basic info (important info like heart rate is buried under all the challenges so you need to scroll ALL the way down to see it, whereas previous app (prior to Fitbit being bought) had everything upon opening the app... customizable and easy to read, with all need-to-know info at the top). New customers won‚Äôt know the difference perhaps and can just adapt, but you‚Äôre alienating your old loyal customer base by doing this. "

I have no tried following all the steps given on the Fitbit app to help resolve this issue, I‚Äôve tried emailing fit but with still no response, and still having the same issue with not receiving texts although phone calls now all of a sudden come through. Being that my fit bit was not cheap when purchased I would think customer service would be more helpful and any issues regarding the way it should work would be resolved. Disappointed this feature is no longer working being that in my job I depend on texts coming through my watch while I‚Äôm working and knowing if I‚Äôm needing to get back to a text ASAP being it‚Äôs a client of mine or knowing I can continue doing my job and get back to whoever it may be later.

Until now. iOS 13 seems to have thrown the IT department for a tailspin and all functioning capacity of my Versa has dissipated like a passing rain on a southern Florida afternoon. The feature driving me the most batty is the messaging which once provided me a bit of privacy to my locked phone. I was able to keep it locked, hide previews of any content on screen to curious onlookers, and decide for myself if I need to pick it up or just let it go. NOW, thanks to the bizarre manner in which I have to go about resetting my phone, making all private matters open for any onlookers, and other troublesome bumble, wandering eyes are yet again set to the screen of my phone every time it alights and whatever visible content displays is no longer mine alone. I‚Äôve more than once thought of ditching the Versa after this fit of nonsense but I‚Äôm waiting for the bugs to settle down and I‚Äôm hoping Fitbit will see fit to restore one‚Äôs sense of privacy as was previously given.

I tried changing the wake up time to 5 minutes from when I was playing with it (to test some theories) and it goes backwards 2 hours. They need to fix this issue. Also, I have a Fitbit blaze and am very disappointed with the information about the device that is provided online. I Should have spent $50 more for the Apple Watch. I bought the Fitbit specifically for the health tracking benefits, but you can't change the target steps per hour (the standard is 250 steps) The device doesn't track steps unless your swinging your arms. I sit at a desk all day for work and if I swing my arm while shuffling papers, it tracks that as steps. If I walk on a treadmill and put my hand on the heart monitor to compare devices, it doesn't track steps. If you don't swing your arms, you don't get steps.

Another is that if using iPhone X and you win a challenge, there‚Äôs no way to X out of the display of your trophy because the X is nested too high on the left of the screen. Third is intuitive functionality. It should be easy to tap something on the app to see your day, week, month stats. Also, the ability to set a date range for step calculations.

The challenges with friends/family are like having a workout buddy to keep you accountable without actually having to coordinate schedules. I rated it only a 3 because the app has been excessively buggy lately. The new feminine cycle tracking has yet to be even remotely correct and frequently freezes the whole app only showing a white screen when I try to log anything in that portion. The meal tracking also doesn‚Äôt work lately. I‚Äôll find the correct food and hit save then it glitches an logs a completely different food if it logs anything at all. Fitbit notes that they know there‚Äôs a problem and they‚Äôre investigating but considering I like to log all my food to pay attention to caloric intake and macros, it‚Äôs really annoying when it doesn‚Äôt work. Bottom line, I like the idea of having workout tracking, friendly competition, food logging, feminine cycle tracking, heart rate and sleep logs etc all in one app but pieces frequently don‚Äôt work as designed."

I knew I wanted to start off slow (just tracking sleep, heart rate, and steps), and I was able to figure out how to adjust the notifications and layout of the app almost immediately.

First of all, I would prefer that we could have a reminder to log our food, water and exercise. I sometimes forget about doing this and then the app thinks that I haven‚Äôt eaten anything that day. I also would like it if we could log things from the day before so that if we do forget we can just log what we  ate the day after. I also would like it if we could name the alarms we set, like you can on your phone so the we can remember what we set that alarm for. This issue may not occur in some of the newer more advanced versions of Fitbit but that is definitely something that would help me. In this app you can customize many of your goals, but for some reason you can‚Äôt choose your water intake goal. Other than those things I definitely love this app and my watch. I am now aware of my activity and live being active."

When looking at ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù, ‚Äúfeed‚Äù is the first thing that pops up, which nobody I know uses, and it shows one post from a friend of mine from 944 days ago. Fitbit, you‚Äôre not a social timeline feed. You are the best step and stair tracker on earth. Give us more ways to slice and dice data. More ways to compare with others. More ways to track.

Also the Garmin‚Äôs tracking of intensity minutes was very inconsistent.  It turns out tracking steps is pretty useless.  The guidelines on activity call for 150 minutes of ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù activity, not shuffling around the house or the office.  Bought a Fitbit Ionic.

Very annoying especially with more than one kid who are consistently wanting to check it. It also randomly stopped sending my text messages and phone call notifications to my Fitbit Alta and started sending them to my son‚Äôs Ace, which is unacceptable.  So far I have not figured out why or how to fix it.  The app also takes too long to sync in my opinion which has always been an issue but when trying to look at multiple ones it becomes even more frustrating.  We‚Äôve bought 7 Fitbits in total over the past couple of years.

I‚Äôve been willing to overlook some inaccuracies in tracking my running/walking, but I can‚Äôt overlook the fact that in the 2 years since I got my Versa I‚Äôve had the sensor die (or some other malfunction) after about 6 months. This most recent time is after installing the new firmware last night; it paused in the middle of doing that and poof, couldn‚Äôt get it to do anything(through it apparently is still tracking my sleep). And this is a new sensor that was sent to me in October 2019, after a similar incident. On the plus-side, each time I‚Äôve had a malfunction Fitbit has sent me a new device free of charge, so I do appreciate that.

It just feels clunky. Also I feel like there are a lot of things that aren‚Äôt intuitive in the navigation- especially when it comes to the apps for the verses and the workouts. I‚Äôve synced my Alexa account to the watch, but I have to log in through the app every day- it doesn‚Äôt stay synced. And I was interested in searching the workouts by certain criteria, but you can‚Äôt do that- only browse.

One, my data will not update without being connected to a WiFi-a secure WiFi. The app will record it and know how far you walked, sleep pattern and let you add your intake data but it will not upload your steps, calories etc. second, adding your liquid or food intake is not the easiest to do. Should be a little easier like how you add your water intake. Lastly, deleting your notification messages. How do you do that?

I've managed to reach my goal, and work daily on maintaining it. Much to my surprise, maintaining is just as much a challenge as losing ! But this little tracker has made my life so much better.  The walking makes me feel good, and energized.  I've gotten a routine now, and feel lost on busy days when it can be hard to work in all the steps.  At one point my one tracker didn't work right, and the Fitbit support group helped me try to fix the problem. Ended up the tracker was not going to work right, so in no time at all, they sent me a new one and I'm on track again. I read some comments about others not having good results with the support group, but my experience was very good !  I'm grateful to have been introduced to this tracker and the Fitbit world.

Not sure what the problem is but the host of recent updates breaks the exercise tracker function of the app only for the next update to ‚Äòfix‚Äô it. After applying an app update and then starting to track an exercise the app will drop tracking in the middle of an exercise and try to log it while you‚Äôre still going, only ever recording the first couple minutes of a workout. The next update seems to restore functionality but again with this last update it has reverted back to a broken status. The reliability issues with the app are a big concern now, it‚Äôs frustrating to go through the process and do the work only to find out post-workout that app couldn‚Äôt perform the main job it was built to do. I cringe now when I seen an update notification for the Fitbit app. I have been a Fitbit user for years now and have been relatively happy for the most part, but with the durability issues of the all the wrist trackers I‚Äôve had in the past and now the app bugs I have begun to look elsewhere."

I have also tried all of the troubleshooting again and it still will not connect to my phone. It shows connected to my IPad but I still don‚Äôt get the notifications on my Versa. I know that there was a notification that came on the Fitbit ap that says that you guys are aware of the issue but it is still not connecting for the text or call notifications. It has been probably 6 months that it has not worked even after several updates on the Fitbit and iPhone.  Can you please advise of how to get the notifications to work?  Thanks!

Earlier this year, I decided to get serious about getting fit, so I started using my Fitbit daily, and also logging my meals and exercising on My Fitness Pal, which synchs with Fitbit. It‚Äôs so easy to track calories on and out, and I love all of the new features on the Charge 2, like how to tracks my heart rate, how I can choose the type of exercise I‚Äôm doing (elliptical, weights, running, etc) and it will track my route, the distance, my pace, calorie burn and how many minutes I‚Äôm in cardio or fat. Burning zone. It even tracks my sleep patterns. I could not have dialed in my eating and fitness programs without the Charge 2 and the Fitbit app working with My Fitness Pal.

I‚Äôve used other nutrition tracking apps in the past and like that this one is pretty comprehensive (has a lot of food already in the database) or can add custom foods or scan barcodes. The one feature I find is lacking is that aside from keeping a limited list of ‚Äúrecent‚Äù and ‚Äúfrequent‚Äù foods I ate, there‚Äôs no way to mark favorite foods or an item I know I‚Äôll eat again but not for a while. So for example, if I enter a particular Trader Joe‚Äôs bread by scanning the barcode but don‚Äôt remember later what it‚Äôs called or when I last ate it, there‚Äôs no easy way for me to find it if I don‚Äôt have the package in front of me (to either search or scan).

I have had a Fitbit flex for years now and I don‚Äôt go anywhere without it. The app that has been designed for the Fitbit is amazing and love all the new features that come around. My favorite addition to the app has been the cycle tracker, it is so helpful for me to not need seven apps to do seven things, it is all right here. I love being able to add my symptoms and my flow so quick and easy. However, I feel limited in my choices of symptoms. I understand that it is impossible to add every symptom every female has, but it would be nice to have a note feature that I could input my own symptoms. I have a medical issue that I have to track my symptoms for, and I would love to do it within the same app but currently I can‚Äôt find a way to do that. So as much as I love the app this is a big thing that I think would be useful for all the women who track themselves. "

I then did some research on the community forums but to the same end. I then contacted customer support who barley spoke English. They simply read the same trouble shooting steps off fit bits website which I had tried earlier, and even told me that they were doing so. I ask if there was someone who could help me beyond simply reading me what i had already tried, which drew an angry response. The customer service representative told me that mine was a known issue and that I simply needed to wait for an app update. I ask if there was a timeline on when this might be fixed, to which she said no. So instead of sitting with a broken product with the promise of a customer service tech who barley spoke English, I have since returned my product. Very poor experience all around.

I have it enable for when I am using the app but no other time as I do t need it then, it drains the battery, and leaks more privacy information than I want. The annoying part is that while I‚Äôm running it always pops up. I slow down to take a quick break and go to hit pause, only to be hindered by the location services ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù pop up, slowing down the process. EVERY TIME!!  Did I mention it‚Äôs every time and it can‚Äôt be disabled. Ugh. That and whenever I ride the motorcycle, it thinks I walked to the moon and back.

Fitbits calendar is very easy to use, edit and predicts periods, has a lot of features for your symptoms, medications, activity, and notifications.  Just as easy as my other one!

My other fave is the food tracker. With a scanner included for most packaged foods as well as pretty much any produce you can think of, this calorie counter goes beyond just counting calories. I can see how my macro intake is doing and adjust accordingly, and also track my water intake. I can see how my calories are adjusted based on my activity and also adjust as needed.

It motivates me to get my steps and I loved challenging friends.  I decided to upgrade to a blaze Christmas 2017.  I was so excited for how pretty it was and had more features, but I‚Äôve been disappointed in the Fitbit itself and I‚Äôve contacted Fitbit.   But the app has been a huge disappointment lately.  In challenges with friends it doesn‚Äôt read my steps.  This week for example you go through and add the steps daily I‚Äôm at 63,000.  The challenge I‚Äôm in says I‚Äôm only at 47,000.  I went on a 5,000 step walk tonight and it read 500 of those on the challenge.  This isn‚Äôt the first time that this has happened either.  So one of my fave things about having a Fitbit is not up to par.  The app also doesn‚Äôt get my active hours.  Today for example the app says I have been active 4/13 hours.  But my Fitbit itself says 9/13.  I‚Äôve reset my Fitbit numerous times and I‚Äôve gotten on live chat with Fitbit.  I‚Äôm to the point think I might be choosing a new brand.  So disappointed"

Unfortunately, FitBit decided to take away the most important feature which was averages of sleep for the week. Now we get ‚Äúsleep scores‚Äù which are not at all explained as to how they are determined and are just random numbers. Some nights if the FitBit doesn‚Äôt track heat rate then there is no sleep score. So average of how week I sleep that week is inconsistent and basically mean jack squat. I don‚Äôt understand Fit Bit took away and made it a premium feature to see amount of time I sleep for each night and the average for the week. It‚Äôs absolutely asinine. With them stripping away the useful features and then asking me to pay for them to get them back as well as being sold to Google, I‚Äôm no longer the FitBit fan I was.

I do think a few tweaks would make this app even better. For one, I wish there was a different way to log custom foods. For instance, right now if I want to log pancakes, I have to log each ingredient separately under a meal, or I have to total up nutrition facts and input each nutrient into the custom food. It is a painstaking process either way. If I could choose my flour, egg, milk, etc. and combine those into a custom food, it would be much easier and more than likely more accurate calorie-wise. Secondly, when posting to the community, I wish I could post in more than one group at a time instead of having to recreate the same post to add it to a different group.

If you don't fit into any groups or challenges, there is no way to search for or make your own. I would like a feature that if I was interested in ""XYZ"" then I could search for it.

Percentages have no meaning because my peer group is in bed for different amounts of time. For example, I see that others my age group are awake in bed around 15-30% of their time in bed. For example, one person may be in bed for 9 hours and the other person may be in bed for 5 hours.  In this example, let‚Äôs say both are awake for 30% of the time.

Today, I open the app to find that it hadn‚Äôt synced in a week, despite having ‚Äúall day sync‚Äù turned on. This has happened so many times before, and it is extremely frustrating. I reset my Fitbit, unpaired it then reconnected it, turned Bluetooth off and on, and deleted the app, then reinstalled it. It seemed to work after I reinstalled the app (which the Fitbit took 10 minutes to connect to), but then I discovered that I had lost all the tracking for active minutes for over a week, as well as sleep tracking. I remember hitting my active minutes goal multiple times this week and my Fitbit celebrating, but on the app, it shows that I have 0 minutes every day this week. Nothing is getting uploaded to the app, and I don‚Äôt know how to make them sync easier than by reinstalling the app. Please help‚Äî I would love the app, as well as my Fitbit, if it wasn‚Äôt for this constant, exasperating issue."

If I use elliptical, it automatically tracks on app.  This problem is due to phone GPS is not being recognized in the app.  The exercise on the tracker shows it uses the phone GPS.  I have already contacted customer service, but nothing resolved yet.  I was told to turn off Wi-Fi when using tracker.  This does not work and we should not have to turn on or off any settings just to get the app to work properly.  Also, the Treadmill exercise does not recognize walking.

The company had gone belly up but the servers that made the app fully functional went down. The new company Jawbone Health had promised to maintain the servers but weeks went by and the app was only partially working. The app was dependent on them to display data properly. As far as I know they are still dawn 8 months later. I got my Fitbit 2 and feel it is more robust than the fragile Jawbone Up series. However they too depend on servers and should they go down, so would their Fitbits. This is a design flaw and should be fixed. It would be a good idea for you to download your data from time to time if it is important to you I case Fitbit goes belly up. Realistically these are relatively inexpensive devices and if the company fails will be worthless. If you need a medical grade tracker because the data is important then Apple watches are the best but requires daily charges. Fitbit is better in this respect."

The developers really need to be listening to their customers since this seems to be a long, ongoing issue that has yet to be addressed.

Second is the poor quality of the band that this comes with the product. My two-year-old watch is held together with duct tape. Third issue is the battery.

Want to see if you‚Äôve gotten your 250 hourly steps? You have to click on the hourly step line. Previously I could see all that info from the home screen.

Fitbit and the app are fine, and would normally give four stars, but the dev team repeatedly ignores the glaring issue everyone has regarding driving. Yo have to enter driving as an activity in order to negate th steps/floors that accumulate during drives or bumpy rides, and that works well enough. But doing this counts driving as an exercise, and is counted toward your daily activity goal. So even if I don‚Äôt exercise that day, making driving an activity counts as an active day and counts towards my weekly activity goals, thus making the entire concept of reaching your activity goal useless."
192,Lawyer SCE,"January 26, 2019",3,"Won't Sync by Bkuetooth The app worked fine UNTIL I took my fitbit on a cruise. Even though the fitbit supposedly connects to my phone by bluetooth, it will NOT sync unless the phone is connected to the internet.  With no Wifi on a ship, it would not sync and my sleep and activity data became worthless because there are many days of gaps when it would not sync data. For example, 2-3 days would go by when the ship was out to sea and when I would get to port (and have an internet connection), it would sync but only the recent data during the past 24 hours or so.  So the data was unreliable without a constant internet connection.  Also, it appears that the motion of the ship while cruising totally messes up all sleep data. Sleep data is apparently based on body movements during sleep and the fitbit became totally confused by the motion of the ship and would not record my sleep data in any reliable way."

Of course I do use it for that, but I have found that by setting hourly reminders to move - I have a desk job - that I have less overall body stiffness at the end of the workday and a higher step count. Also, I was pretty sure I was spending a good portion of time awake during the night. The sleep monitoring part of the app settled that. For example, it tells me I was awake twice. My memory says the same and it seems like it was for quite awhile. The app says one event was five minutes and the other was only one. So less worry about losing sleep. Currently I am working on increasing the number of times a week I am active for a set time. As I hit the goals I can increase them. The visuals on the app give me a lot of information and incentive."

I am so angry I wish to heavens I had not invested in my Versa. Also, thousands of users are angry & about to throw their Fitbit in the trash because, in addition, they are now rating our sleep hours as poor or fair... It is just plain awful this new rating system. It is making most everyone feel bad especially those with serious sleep issues. Fitbit has made a GARGANTUAN mistake! It has been months of customers complaining and Fitbit is not responding. They are not listening.

It‚Äôs insane that they charge you $200 for a device then make you pay $9.99 for basic features. I kinda get charging for additional workout videos and programs. Personally I think paying $9.99 per month for exercise videos is ridiculous, but that‚Äôs atleast additional content. However, paying $9.99 to see your sleeping heart rate data and sleeping movement data is outrageous. That‚Äôs data the thing already collects. It already monitors your heart rate and movement, it doesn‚Äôt cost them anything to show that data. So why do I have to pay $9.99 to see the data the $200 device I bought already collects? Are step and exercise tracking going to become ‚Äúpremium features‚Äù soon? Worst of all, now the app feels cheapened because it has locked features that say ‚Äúupgrade to premium‚Äù.

Same tracker, same position, same phone (iPhone 5) as before. The only thing that changed is the Fitbit app version. Furthermore, Fitbit engineering still has not fixed the bug introduced a year ago of not being able to sync if not connected to the Internet (I am often in areas with no wifi and no cell service. I used to be able to still sync and check my stats, but Fitbit broke that a few releases ago, and is apparently incapable of fixing that well-known bug.)

It helps me get moving since I usually forget to do so, and easily keeps track of my exercise so I don‚Äôt have to constantly carry my phone around. Plus, it‚Äôs a lot better than my phone at tracking whatever I do, not to mention the option of multiple exercises. I just find it weird that the Fitbit costs so much and on the app there‚Äôs another premium feature. Shouldn‚Äôt the customers already have an option for the premium feature if they bought the product? Why is there a premium feature in the first place? I understand it‚Äôs extra profit, but to me that just seems cheap because users won‚Äôt know about needing to purchase premium until AFTER they buy the Fitbit watch. Thanks for reading!"

I got a pop-up yesterday that they had an update for the display so I agreed. I don‚Äôt like it. I used to be able to see everything I needed in one screen. Now, even though I deleted some of the top stuff just to see if I could see the other stuff, I can‚Äôt. I have to scroll up and down to see everything. And the design is frankly a lot cheesier than previous. It seems like a downgrade, not an upgrade. I want to go back but they had warned me that there is no way to do so, so I guess I‚Äôm stuck with it. The one thing I like about the update is that now I can see 3-month or 1-year displays of things like RHR. Helps me to see trends which is interesting. Other than the display issue I pretty much love the app itself though. It has the information I need."

The other small issue is the wrist band. I am on my 4th one already.  The one with the beads kept falling off.  The magnetic one is pretty but I pick up various metal objects.  The straps that were lighter in color got dirty and I could get them clean, I even used a tooth brush to scrub them.   The black straps seem to work the best.  My battery is also dying quickly.

I've read that there is some kind off issue between apple and Fitbit.  They need to get it fixed. They are a big enough company who was just purchased by an even bigger company (Google) so this shouldn't be difficult for them.  It's been going on for months. Enough is enough.

Hate the location of this new ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù feature because I don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt use it, and my hand keeps touching it while trying to look at my stats for today, so I keep getting bumped over to discover. Would love the option to hide things like Community and Discover that I have ZERO interest in. And who in their right minds is gonna pay $$ to learn what secrets go into this ‚Äúsleep score‚Äù business.

However, now that feature is replaced by arbitrary sleep scores that don‚Äôt really mean anything to me since I know my sleep schedule is a mess. I also don‚Äôt know what they are being compared to so that also doesn‚Äôt help. What I would ask is to have the option to show average hours again instead of sleep scores too since and nights that were before the update now just have a zero and for me, that‚Äôs frustrating since I keep track of these things.

I walked on an incline at a fast pace on the treadmill yesterday for 2.25 miles. The FitBit only seemed to record about 1/2 the information. According to the treadmill I did 2.25 miles and FitBit registered only 1.11 miles in 35 mins. The GPS is also faulty, it registered me as going in circles and down different streets when I was clearly in the same space on the treadmill for the entire 35 mins.

I started out with the blaze and moved onto the ionic because it was waterproof as my coach had added laps to my workout. Then I was totally stoked when the versa2 came out because it was more feminine looking and waterproof as well. The only downside is that it does not track the laps as the ionic does plus why does it display only the time and the amount of time you that you have been swimming and that ‚Äúkeep it up‚Äù at the bottom is ridiculous! Please make it more workout friendly. The run was off a little bit until the latest update now that now is tracking accurately.

When I go into the sleep data on the app it will tell me how long I‚Äôve slept and the cycles I‚Äôve gone through during sleep but when I exit out of that it duplicates the sleep data over and over. When you delete the duplicates it deletes all of them and now it says ‚Äúsleep not tracked‚Äù. I looked this up online and found many people experiencing the same issue. Many people have come to the conclusion it‚Äôs not the Fitbit that‚Äôs the problem but there is an error in the app that‚Äôs causing this issue.

For females, it keeps track of your menstrual cycle (when your period is due! and ovulation period (if your planning to get pregnant).

The app does a great job of tracking this, but I do wish it had the capability for me to add notes to each night so I can see patterns better between how I feel and how I slept over the long run.

It would be nice if we could opt for a different background color or pattern other than bright white as it hurts the eyes. It also feels like you have to scroll for days to see your stats and info. The Discover icon seems not very well thought out.

My other problem is the weight start date. If you make any changes to your weight goal such as your goal weight it changes all of your reportable weight loss on the home screen. Initially I wanted to get to 170 and then changed it to 160 during my journey so now my current pounds lost move back to 0 as my current weight takes place of my start weight. This is the most annoying thing on the app, my start weight and start date should not change or I should be able to back date my start date after making changes to the ideal weight I am aiming for."

When I‚Äôm recording my symptoms, I see that there aren‚Äôt as many different types of symptoms to record as there are in other period tracker apps. Other apps let you choose the level of cramp pain and headache pain. You can also record symptoms like dizziness, the shakes, nausea, etc. I‚Äôd like those features added onto the period section of this app so I can use one app for all my health stuff. These added features that I am asking for can help with more accurate period predictions and stuff like that.

I am so disappointed that I don‚Äôt have more information. If the Fitbit can read and send to App this much impressive technical information regarding my steps and Heart rate rest, sleep, awake, exercise and formulate plans for health, it would be so easy to give more info like body temperature (unbelievable this is missing) and full blood pressure stats and 2. The information that is given, could be delivered in a more specific and informative way (actual data), instead of a simple basic color chart 3.  I‚Äôd like to see more groups.  I don‚Äôt fit into any of the available groups. 4. The Fitbit has so many possibilities and these are not being used on the device itself but, there is no reason why the app couldn‚Äôt take advantage of so much more. Should be practically endless.

Instead, everyday that I work out more than once, a check mark from earlier in the month disappears. If I work out three times in a day, then two check marks disappear!

The Fitbit recorded the event as 20 mins for a distance of 0.32 miles. This is known issue and I can appreciate that measuring treadmill or stationary bike exercise is different than running/walking or riding a real bike.

If I don‚Äôt check a notification in time, it magically disappears. If I check a notification as soon as it comes in, it only stays on screen without touching it for maybe 2.5 sec. Five days of battery life is great, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind sacrificing that for longer screen time since I mainly use the notifications feature.

Unfortunately you can only add an Ace device (the ones specifically made for kids) to a child account. So I have to create an entirely new account for my 10 year old.

I love that I am able to track my sleep, but my Fitbit charge 3 doesn‚Äôt do so good with tracking it. You see, I am one to toss and turn every night while being asleep, so my Fitbit thinks I am awake during the night. This is very frustrating because I strive to get 9+ hours of sleep each night (and I do if I actually count), when according to the Fitbit app I barely get 8. The other thing. Cardiovascular fitness score. This is a great new feature, but it needs some work. Whenever you take a run at a satisfying rate for the Fitbit, your score goes up. Go for a walk, your score goes down. Just because you want to take a walk outside doesn‚Äôt mean you are no longer fit. Please fix these issues on the app, it will make a big difference."

For example watch faces are really awful - by Fitbit and non Fitbit developers. They are simple and only deliver time and fitness data. To this day they have not delivered on calendar capabilities. I bought the ionic so I can see what‚Äôs on my schedule and not just be alerted but I have to rely on a third party developer as suggested in their community? Fitbit needs to make some reliable trusted apps. On the plus side I found making an click face simple. But not everyone is a developer. Do I also have to make my own apps. Also fix the clock face selector - every time I go back to the list it always goes back to the top of the list.

It seems like there are a lot of useless and repetitive options when you search a food, and I have a hard time finding a good choice for basic things like vegetables. It‚Äôs also not as easy to input foods I use frequently as other apps I‚Äôve used because Fitbit automatically gives you the apps most popular foods for your search rather than what‚Äôs most popular for you.

I have spent an hour of my own time problem solving and another hour with tech support to no avail. My phone has the iOS version 10.3.3 but does NOT support the recent updates. Since getting the Fitbit a little over a year ago I've become less enchanted. The step counts and mileage are inconsistent since it doesn't work with GPS. The heart rate doesn't match what I see with other monitors. If you have a consistent mid to high level fitness routine this tool doesn't support mileage tracking accurately. Since the only thing I ended up liking is the notifications and I no longer get them then the product is of no use to me. I am not buying a new phone for that. If Fitbit can fix that glitch I may consider wearing the watch again. The tech support live chat did work very well and the agent was very patient.

I have emailed Fitbit on multiple occasions and have just received a response that they are working on the issue.  This has been months and I‚Äôm over waiting.  At this point I am doing research on other brands of fitness watches.  I receive all other notifications except my text messages.  If you are going to be relying on a watch for the functions it is supposed to provide you may want to look at other products."
380,Old and mostly grey,"December 20, 2017",4,"Just like your spouse First off I‚Äôm an older man who uses the charge2 for sleep tracking, step count, heart rate and phone/text notifications. Have owned it for 8 months and I do like it most of the time but occasionally it gives me a hard time. Syncing in the morning to check sleep pattern can take minutes and is pretty darn accurate unless I watch a movie and then it records that as a sleep mode. The battery lasts about a week and the charge time is very fast, less than an hour in most cases. It has fallen off a few times when the strap pin popped out when pulling on my shirt. Not crazy about the plastic rubber black band that it came with because it‚Äôs fit is very tight and not easy for me to latch. But it has served its purpose so far. "
381,Hplaura,"October 11, 2018",3,"Bugs I love this app but on days like today, when it gets stuck in a cycle that will not allow you to delete information, it makes me crazy. You can delete whatever you like but whenever you open the app again, it shows right back up. Sometimes it‚Äôs even jumbled around. Omg. Closing out the app 200 times won‚Äôt help. It will just do it whenever it decides to and in the meantime, all your averages are skewed and it loses its value to me. This is with the weight log specifically. "
382,kushhaaa,"October 29, 2018",5,I like Fitbit Fitbit is pretty good. There are minor things I wish I could add but aside from that I think it works well. 
383,Appluvr74,"November 3, 2018",3,Ok at best I‚Äôve had the Fitbit Charge 2 for 1 year. I‚Äôve had to call support at least twice and refuse to do so again because the original issues I contacted them about were never resolved. My Notification Center said I had new notifications for months when there were only two in the feed and I couldn‚Äôt even delete those two that were showing. Just now when I went into the app to set my alarm it kept changing it to a different time than what I set it for. So I deleted the app and reinstalled it and logged in. It is STILL setting my alarm to a different time than what I set it even if it‚Äôs a new alarm and I completely deleted all other alarms!! It has NEVER tracked exercise properly and always needs to be done manually. Frustrating & Highly disappointed in this product!
384,Noni0,"January 30, 2019",4,"Pretty good app What this does best is track one‚Äôs steps. As far as I can determine, it does that very accurately, and I‚Äôm fairly confident in the distance tracking as well. Further, it permits one to record other exercise. However, the sleep record is wildly inaccurate, as is the measurement of distance while swimming. (Although it accurately records time swimming, which is useful.) I have no way of judging the calorie burned estimates, but I have read that they are not very accurate. The optional reminder to move in each hour is a nice feature. "
385,KathrynL.87,"July 21, 2019",3,"Good But I Have Suggestions I love Fitbit but from experience with other apps have a suggestion. When you are logging food, I wish when you typed in a food to the search bar, foods you‚Äôve eaten before would come up. Sometimes the searching through is annoying. "

I get very few activity points for any water exercise.  The app used to let me go in and tell it that I had been doing water exercise so I could get the appropriate minutes, but it no longer does that.  For example, I did an hour of water aerobics this morning and received credit for 26 active minutes.  I was jumping and using my arms the entire time (this was not a little old ladies class, and yes, I‚Äôm exhausted), and my heart rate got high, but the Fitbit isn‚Äôt recognizing my exercise.  I really want to use my Fitbit to coordinate all of my activity to get a true picture of what I‚Äôm doing; after all, that was the whole point of purchasing it in the first place.  If someone can tell me how to solve this issue, I will gladly change my rating."
387,Grcook,"January 16, 2020",5,"This app is wonderful but needs a little bit of editing I love how you can choose everything from clock face to what your goals are. However, when it tracks your sleep sometimes it doesn't actually get the time when I start sleeping (it sometimes thinks I'm sleeping when I'm awake) so the time is inaccurate. It also thinks I've woken up when I see what time I got. (Like I wake up at 10 but check it at 10:30 and it says I just woke up). I love the estimate of sleep I'm getting but I would just like it to be more accurate. But all in all this app is amazing and it's helped me be more active to get 10,000 steps. (The celebration pictures are very motivating to me. It really appeals to me)"
388,ProjectK2017,"August 22, 2019",2,"Disappointed I have been an avid user and supporter of Fitbit for several years now. However, since getting the Versa, I am continuously disappointed in the lack of correct stats being posted in challenges. I have been told several times this is due to different time zones. (the other challenger is one hour behind me but I lose several thousand steps while I am sleeping??) The last month, my challenges have been held in the same county, yet, I lose between 2000 and 3000 steps every day in my challenges. I have NO activities that are entered manually. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I have restarted my watch. I have gotten a new verse. Same issues again and again. What's the point of using the device for health and fitness tracking when it does not provide accurate details? Fitbit, I think you will be losing a long time fan. üòî"

When I first got my watch it would vibrate when I got a text message. Which was nice for when my boss would text me while at work so I could get that message quickly. Which at times is very important that I get it quickly to handle any issues. And after about two months that stopped. I have checked all my settings and tried to see what had happened but can‚Äôt figure it out. Which is why I only gave 4 stars. It most definitely would be 5 if I could get this feature working again.

391,Hegotmadskilz,"January 30, 2019",5,"Accountability I researched the Fitbit because a friend could not stop talking about it.  Two months later, I saw him and he looked amazing. He was down 18 pounds and said he felt fantastic.  I purchased my Fitbit in November.  I started wearing it in mid-December to gain perspective prior to working out and eating better.  On January 2nd, I committed to a daily weight and cardio routine and linked my Fitbit to the MyFitnessPal app (daily food log).  As of today, I have hit my daily goals (accountability) and have seen great progress in weight loss, but even better how I feel and how I look.  Did I mention I was 50 years old?  We all need some type of accountability and for me, this was it.  Great product and great support.  Thank you."
392,rdterrel,"February 11, 2019",5,IONIC My FITBIT ionic is an absolutely fantastic product.  It intersects with so many facets of my life that I hope will keep me healthy.  It keeps track of steps. It knows when I am in the gym doing cardio and weight training.  It tracks my sleep patterns.  The APP Uses my actual weight and body fat content from my FITBIT scale.  I log my food consumption throughout the day. It learns what i like  to eat and presents those as choices when logging meals.  When I sync with the app on my IPAD it presents me with a running comparison of calories used and calories consumed so I can keep myself on track.  The IONIC has been very reliable.  It needs to be charged every three days.  
393,Determined05218,"May 13, 2019",5,"Easy To Use Unlike some apps I have used, there is a large variety of food items in the data base.  You do not need to calculate the calories.  If an item is not listed it is easy to snap a pic of the barcode on the package.  You are also able to add your own recipes to the database.   I have been trying to lose weight for a couple of years.  I was surprised to see the total calories I was consuming from healthy and unhealthy items.  Being able to set my weight goal and have the app calculate daily calorie consumption helped me tremendously.  I have reached my goal, but will continue to utilize the app.  I have recommended this app to many family members and friends."

Even if profile is set to private they‚Äôll catfish with wanting to join challenges and meet goals then send you inappropriate messages. If you post a picture or try to congratulate someone on their success random profiles will tag your name and use that comment to try to hit on you or say crude things. I think people are forgetting on what this app is actually about and trying to use it to be inappropriate towards women which is sad. We want to meet fitness goals and find support too. Can definitely do without the fake profiles and harassment. This is a fitness app not a dating website.

That issue was fixed the next day and I‚Äôve since gotten used to the new dashboard, so I‚Äôm deleting that bad review and replacing it with 5 stars. I actually now like the new dashboard better than the old one because I can see everything for my day (steps, challenge status, etc) in one place without clicking another screen. I have been using the same Fitbit device (the old ‚ÄúOne‚Äù) for almost 7 years now, so I have to say that both the device and the app have been incredibly reliable."

I have been a Fitbit power user from day one. My only complaint is that Fitbit has stopped adding new top badges at the elite or top levels. I‚Äôve maxed out almost all the badge categories and there is very little to shoot for. Why??? Fitbit should be able to see when users are at the top badge levels and add more badges to shoot for. I‚Äôve made the request several times but keep being ignored. Seems like very poor customer service and is prompting me to consider switching to Apple when I‚Äôve been a diehard Fitbit fan.

At the end of the day I noticed my fitbit counts at least 3000 more steps. So, during the day I put my fitbit in my pocket and wear my Apple Watch on my wrist.  But, that makes it so I have to either look at my phone to see my steps or I have to pull my fit bit out of my pocket.

I paid $130 plus tax for my Fitbit device less than a year and a half ago. A few days ago, it started shutting itself off as soon as it was unplugged from the charger. I talked to Fitbit customer service for close to 45 minutes. They had one possible solution for me to try and when that didn't work, their next suggestion was for me to buy a whole new Fitbit. I refuse to give Fitbit any more of my money when in my personal experience their devices do not last long enough to make it worth the cost. I am very disappointed as I have only heard good things about Fitbit and I have family members who have never had issues with their Fitbit devices after years and years of wear.

I grew dependent on this data to ensure I wasn‚Äôt pushing myself too hard.  Suddenly at the end of July, this data stopped showing up in the app.  I know several other people who are having the same problem through the Fitbit community forums.  We have let Fitbit know and no one seems to be able to fix it.

The app now functions primarily to sell you more things, constantly inundating you with cleverly disguised ads for their premium service using the same look as their health insights. Mechanically, the sync feature is always trying to pull old/less used Fitbits instead of the one with the current data. It's almost enough for me to consider switching to an Apple Watch. ::gasp:: Considering you can't sync with Apple Health and it doesn't connect to other third party apps, the Fitbit, especially it's application, feels like it's pushing users away."

That is, until recently when they updated their app to display an arbitrary sleep score.

However, I find it very frustrating when I try to adjust the start date of my weight goal. Instead of letting me adjust it to the appropriate date (that is, when I started losing weight, which was before I set the goal on Fitbit), it resets it to the current day - today, erasing my previous progress and calling today‚Äôs weight my starting weight. That‚Äôs discouraging. Please make the date actually adjustable (as it appears to be). And please let us know if/when you change it so I‚Äôll know it‚Äôs ok to touch that again without risking losing my progress."

For example Incan arrive at work after a sweaty 40 minute ride and I show zero active minutes whereas when I take a short walk with my dog, never breaking a sweat and never getting out of breath I log a solid 10-15 active minutes.

The community boards are full of user complaints and the common company response is too bad for you all.  When it comes time for this family of users to acquire new fitness devices- Fitbit will not be on our list.  This current update makes the dashboard look like a child‚Äôs app- tiny print, ridiculous graphics and they did away with the celebrations for achieving daily goals.  Which is why the majority of their users purchased the devices in the first place.  This is not at all the first time they have taken away encouragement and achievement celebrations.

The devices only charge efficiently for a little over a year then they decline rapidly at which point they also seem to stop connecting to the app efficiently.   I guess this is how they force us to upgrade. The phone app goes through cycles where it logs me out every couple of days and forces me to sign back it. Although not detrimental definitely irritating and unnecessary as I have my phone locked and no personal info connected to my Fitbit account. 
441,Raja40,"January 13, 2018",1,"Security risk The Fitbit app on the iPad is attractive and informative.  It does not work alone but requires being paired with a computer.  But that does not work unless the computer has a USB dongle.  And, most seriously, all of this will not work if you intend to keep your personal privacy and security protected or selective.  In all, just under 80 ‚Äúentities‚Äù gained access to my computer through the Fitbit Connect app.  Since I would not allow anyone to invade my life so irresponsibly, I stripped a second computer, and set it up to see why my security software was preventing the Fitbit from working.  Voila!  My CPU suddenly was 80% engaged at 7GB working to try to feed all these companies information from my computer.  I had not done a secure erase, but no matter as my life is very dull.  It is the principle of allowing a ‚Äúhealth and fitness‚Äù company to ‚Äúgive away‚Äù my data that offends me to the core.  I reject this kind of exploitation."

One friends hadn't been wearing hers lately, so I checked to see if dissatisfaction was the reason before I purchased mine. She said it wasn't and that she would be wearing hers again soon for the summer. So far, I have tracked my steps and saw how many times I was restless during sleep. I use a different app for tracking food/water, but I am looking forward to using Fitbit for activity. Goal=10,000 steps a day. It will take a while to build up to that but I can do it! The bracelet fits well, too--not too tight."

And those are not accurate. The macros don‚Äôt change with the serving size. If you eat half a serving, it counts the macros in a whole serving. It‚Äôs just a calorie counter. That isn‚Äôt helpful at all if you have life depending diet restrictions. It‚Äôs important for a health app to include accurate totals for all nutrients. If people don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs wrong, they are risking their lives using this. People have asked that it be fixed for years and fit bit acts like it‚Äôs some new extra feature to add. It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs what is expected and needed. I certainly expected them to have an app that at least did what every other macro counting app can do.

Half the time it fails to capture any sleep data, and I no longer trust that it‚Äôs getting an accurate step count or heart rate. I haven‚Äôt received any notifications, despite following the troubleshooting instructions multiple times. The app has been ‚Äúredesigned‚Äù and half of it is now restricted to premium members, i.e. pay them more money.

So mid workout my calories and steps are tracked on the next day instead of the previous. Not a huge deal. Just not very accurate for daily steps/calorie tracking. If this could be added somehow to have a sort-of ‚ÄúNight Owl‚Äù setting where you work out at the transition of a day, your workout and steps before you sleep could be tracked for the previous day, it would be 5 stars for sure!

I‚Äôm not one to necessarily count calories anymore (it didn‚Äôt work for me & everything is different for each person) so now I‚Äôm counting my macros and it helps to loose weight and get a leaner body!

My last email has gone unanswered when all I asked was ‚Äòdo I just have to deal with this issue as is?‚Äô Prior to this issue, I would have given Fitbit 5 stars.

494,Gretchen_iowa,"August 12, 2019",4,"Great, only a few complaints My Fitbit Flex 2 is awesome, very sleek and the waterproof feature is excellent. The app is fairly user friendly, although the most recent update (early/mid August 2019) made the app much LESS user-friendly and more time consuming as the different icons, such as hourly step goals, require you to actually go into the icon to check your stats as opposed to previously being able to open the app, refresh, and quickly glance at the home dashboard to get an idea of where you‚Äôre at. One of my only other wishes is that they would add a macronutrient tracking feature (breakdown in grams, not just percentages) since I am currently having to use a separate app for that."
495,cdfbpilot,"August 10, 2019",2,New version sync problems Usually very pleased with my Versa and the app. But it seems every time they push an update there are sync problems. Didn‚Äôt have any problems until last night. After the app updated I keep getting dropped sync. Try all the instruction on how to reestablish sync and it works for a couple minutes then sync fails again. What it even more frustrating is that when to Versa can‚Äôt sync it will lose time. The Fitbit hasn‚Äôt been able to sync in a coupe hours and now it‚Äôs 6 minutes slow. Now it‚Äôs not even usable as a basic watch. I‚Äôm sure they will fix it in a few days and it will work pretty well until the next app update and then the frustration will start all over again. Very poor quality control in Fitbit‚Äôs software update process.

After talking to someone at Fitbit and they tried to find out how to fix it and talked to other associates they couldn‚Äôt fix it. Now mind you I‚Äôve been on the phone for about 1/2 hour. Finally the person called support as I patiently waited on the line, they came back on the line and told me that there‚Äôs a problem and not sure when it was going to be fixed. On the Fitbit app it‚Äôs says that the IOS update may have made issues with some notifications. My husband got a Fitbit Charge 2 and after setting it up the text feature works just fine.

It‚Äôs only good for alarms and tracking my steps. You guys said you were working on it, but it‚Äôs been a couple weeks and has yet to be fixed. I‚Äôm ready to shell out the money for an Apple Watch because at least it‚Äôll do what my Fitbit should be doing and I know it will work.

It has trouble syncing at least once per week and it has a lot of issues with the sleep function.

I slept a good 7 hours last night but it isn‚Äôt showing any sleep. I‚Äôm not sure what caused the sleep analysis to fail, but it does quite often.

Also wish my Fitbit (I have it paired with my Inspire HR) would adapt to the menu scroll order to the order I set on the dashboard.

They have a great sense of community and it's nice to compare stats with friends. This app allows me to gain access all that Fitbit has to offer. One thing that I would like to see in the future is the ability to use my Apple Watch to track my steps. I'd prefer not to use two step trackers and Fitbit already allows users to use their iPhones to track their steps. I also would like for them to allow the app to access Health Kit because I'd like my Aria to be able to write my weight info into Health Kit. I enjoy the app but those are things I'd like to see in the future.

Over the past 3 years the software they have passed off to us has deteriorated. I changed my Alta to a Charge 2 because it was giving me 1500 to 2500 less steps per day than my Apple Watch. Then again earlier this year to the Charge 3 because the data from it was not syncing properly with the Dashboard. This Charge 3 is even worse, it rarely will sync with my iPhone or iPad and when it does it NEVER transfers all the data between them and the Charge 3. 6 out of 7 days a week I meet my Hourly Activity goal of 14 in 14 hours, but the Dashboard shows I rarely achieve my goal.

It was very intuitive and user friendly with regard to daily challenges and weight loss input for example. Now just finding a challenge you have been invited to it like going through a maze. Not very clear and doesn't always show up on the first page. Have had to force close and re-open. As far as the new listed out way of displaying each option : food input, weight, etc., is much less eye pleasing and user friendly. It's also more work to scroll down to find what you want rather than just go to the larger box as in the previous version of the app. I would definitely recommend modification and would give it a higher rating as a result."

It also helps me keep track of my heart rate while I‚Äôm out and about. I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome so I have to monitor my heart rate and adjust my water and food intake regularly to avoid being symptomatic. This app really helps with that. My only complaint is that the app doesn‚Äôt take into consideration my condition so it says a 96bpm resting heart rate is poor cardiac health when 96 is actually normal for someone with my condition. Untreated my heart beats at 170bpm. If there were a way people could log their medical conditions and the app take that into account to make it more personalized that would be perfect.

Also I think that the watch should sink to your phone without even opening the app. I love the notification feature and that it reminds me to move and if I have a text message but I wish there would be more than just text and calls.

534,Nubiangyrl,"December 11, 2018",2,"That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. Ahhhh... Fitbit, it's clear that you didn't have any women working on your new Female Tracking module. Or maybe they were involved, but their input was not taken into consideration during the final decision making process. Here's a suggestion - how about you let users tell the app when their cycle starts instead of the app being so presumptuous to TELL the user when their cycle begins. I don't know if it's the hormone changes I'm experiencing, but it is maddening when the APP decides to reset my cycle to day #1 even when I'm really on day #29 (or whatever). A woman's cycle length fluctuates greatly so having the cycle day automatically reset to day #1 is idiotic and renders this function useless. But, on the bright side, the Versa is your BEST tracker yet and I'm really enjoying it."

You can also set on your Fitbit to remind you to walk each hour.  I love how you can set an alarm to wake up, and how you can receive text messages on your Fitbit.

Fitbit is the best tool I've used to accurately track calories in vs. calories out.

The status bar for the update goes halfway and stops and the Fitbit will not sync or connect or even allow itself to be reset. This is a known Fitbit issue and is greeted with a 25% off offer to buy a new product but no actual fix for the current product. Why does Fitbit push updates knowing many users will end up with devices that no longer work? Do they want to incentivize people to buy new trackers?

The text notifications are defective where there are some I do not get and one notification will not clear despite how many times I clear it. When I go to change the watch faces, the app is extremely slow and eventually crashes.

I‚Äôm hoping that you‚Äôll be able to fix this or give me some idea of how I have to fix it. It generally does a pretty good reading but this is happened two times this week and a couple times in the past month. It knocks my whole average off for the week.

My Fitbit is linked to my calendar which is great, but it keeps getting caught in an unending loop of reminding me constantly of events for the duration of the event. My battery is running low quickly and the new app version is not allowing me to find settings anywhere to change the calendar settings. It used to be so easy and now it‚Äôs just not here. Also, my reminders to move are lost since it‚Äôs so busy telling me over and over and over that today is someone‚Äôs birthday and last week that my mother in law was visiting all week. "

The colors are all over the place (since when are maroon and orange their colors?) and the actual info you use is organized in a completely inefficient way. They just stacked all your daily tracking into one giant column - you can‚Äôt organize them into a neat grid anymore. The actual navigation around the app also is new - but there‚Äôs no explanation for that. The update is clunky, unnecessary, and stupid (because the rest of the app has the original look).

562,VTcycleDad,"October 18, 2018",3,"Does most of what‚Äôs promised A lot works but a few improvements would increase usability.  For instance the heart rate charts use a scale that is not fine enough to discern the rate with much precision.  How about a finer scale, labeling min/max, and allowing two finger expansion of the chart to examine particular time frames?  Also the heart rate monitoring in combo with the new Charge 3 seems to miss spikes in rate.  It appears that heart rate might only be sampled periodically which misses the mark for aerobic athletes.  Also the integration with Strava is presented as easy but is maddeningly difficult.  Bike rides never show the heart rate in Strava for some reason so I may have to buy a chest strap for rides and had hoped to avoid that.  Not sure who‚Äôs fault that is but maybe Strava‚Äôs."

I stopped getting notifications for phone calls and text messages.  Months go by before I am able to get notifications of phone calls, but still nothing for text messages.  I have done everything the website suggests to troubleshoot the problem, multiple times, and nothing. Contact support for Fitbit and all they can tell me is that they are working on it. Extremely frustrating.  Right now, I just have an over priced watch that counts my steps.  The whole reason I purchased this was so I could see my text messages. If this is not resolved soon, I‚Äôm jumping ship and getting rid of this thing."
588,MudCabbage,"December 21, 2019",5,Love my Fitbit! I have been using this app since I purchased my Fitbit Flex 2 in December 2017.  I am not a fan of wearing a watch so I am glad they make a non watch style that I can wear on my ankle.  It would be nice if they would include an option in the setup to wear it on the ankle instead of only your wrists. I find that wearing this on my ankle is way more accurate comparing with my friends who wear the watches. It is awesome to see my steps and activity at the end of the day. You can also log your food and water intake along with weight tracking which would eliminate other apps that do the same thing.

Often when I launch the app to see my step count, I wait... and wait... and wait. It takes forever. Sometimes it just takes a second or two, but that's unusual.

This is so fantastic!!! Thank you so much for making this an option!

I appreciate all the additional features such as being able to track weight, food and water intake, along with menstrual cycle tracking. These added features are great for identifying trends. I do with the way the device charged was more universal and/or allowed for charging when the device has a protective cover on it.

Still no text notifications, but the phone calls come through and other notifications such as from my ring doorbell. Then I updated my phone to the iOS 13.3.1 software. Now my watch won‚Äôt sync at all. So my versa 2 is now useless until they figure it out. Fitbit claims this is an apple issue and they are working closely with apple to resolve the problem.

Yes, waterproof like the wishbone version but so much more data after swimming - lap split times; total distance etc. Love the heart rate monitor and average resting rate.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars in the review is the sleep monitor is too precise.

And it is easy to read my results when I‚Äôm done working out at the gym. The best part is, the more you use it, the more it knows your workout routine. Even if you forget to set your watch when you work out, it usually knows and record your data anyway. The only drawback that I can see is, in conjunction with the Fitbit App that needs a Bluetooth to sync up with your watch, is the amount of power that is drawn from your phone. It eats up your battery life pretty fast. Still, I recommend this watch to everybody!"

The app will say I was asleep for nine hours when the reality is more like four to five hours. Everything else seems to work fine. The only other thing is that there is not a way to remove notifications or the red circle symbol, which is just a personal preference. The exercise tracking, water and food counters, and community connections are all great!"

Also, when you think you‚Äôre inputting food data for the prior day then realize it‚Äôs all for TODAY there‚Äôs no way to quickly go in and shift it to a different day. You have to re-input it...which takes up a lot of time. If it was clearer on the food page which day you were on that would have helped.

Latest update basic watch functions no longer work like reminders to move. Fitbit tells you to turn your phone off and on 5-8 times a day to fix the problem, which isn‚Äôt good for your iPhone.

It gets so annoying because I DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING!!! If Fitbit were to fix these LARGE problems, I would most likely give the app a full 5 stars.

First off my fit bit counts my flights of stairs and for some reason it must be the way I move it says I'm climbing stairs when I am not. Secondly I to work at a desk and I'm constantly moving around at my desk. When I am moving my arms it's counting it as steps. So between my steps and my stairs I am never sure if I'm getting in the accurate count that I should be getting from the fit bit. I am also not receiving an alert that I'm getting a phone or text message it used to work but now it's not. Overall the concept of the fit bit is really great. It would be much better if we knew the accuracy was correct

I‚Äôd much rather focus on my Fitbit watch face which has a simpler  easy to read feel. This is what I used to love about the old home screen. Virtually everything you could need was on one screen, placed in a way that was simple and easy to navigate. I feel this update has over complicated things somewhat. Please rerun to past coloring, spacing and design that ultimately made it fun to open up this app."

It is so frustrating when I start up the App and get ‚ÄúFailed to find device‚Äù message on connection that had been working and shows  Connected in Settings- Bluetooth. Or failed when trying to set All Day Sync, which had been set up and was working an hour ago, but some was toggled off.

641,dnkyman,"December 19, 2019",1,"Ads need to stop The app does exactly what you expect it to, sync to your Fitbit. And it provides other services that can be enticing for other users who like the extra motivation. Personally, I just have it to track steps for a separate insurance program but I consistently get ads trying to get me into their own programs that I have shown no interest in whatsoever. You even receive ads on their individual products even though you own and are currently using one of their products. I would just like to sync the Fitbit without having to go through their extra hoops to use the product I‚Äôve already paid for."

I would like to see some sort of feature that pregnant women can use. I am not sure how, but maybe a mode that it can go in if you do become pregnant. I love everything else about my Fitbit!

643,hnasnorman,"November 28, 2019",4,Sleep I really like my Fitbit. This app is really helpful. There are so many things you can track. I love that you are not only able to track your movement but what you eat and drink and how much sleep you get. The sleep part is my favorite. I only have one complaint. Sometimes I struggle with sleep and am awake for hours but it records me going through my sleep cycle even though I‚Äôm not sleeping. I spent 2 hours awake last night between 2:30am and 4:30am but it thinks I was sleeping. It even says I got some rem sleep. I was sitting on the living room couch at the time watching tv. So even though the sleep breakdown is super cool it is still glitchy.

The challenges you can do with friends haven‚Äôt changed in many years and only focus on steps. What about a workout goal challenge? What about a sleep goal challenge?  Water goal or calorie goal challenge?  I would also love a way to integrate friends or family who have other brand trackers in the challenges instead of having to go to a third party app.

650,Disgruntled then some,"November 15, 2017",1,Half of a great watch I love all of the features of this watch. I had the Charge 2 and screen cracked without hitting it on anything. One of my favorite parts of this watch stopped working/ the text and incoming call feature. This happened within two months of getting it. Purchased the new Iconic which has text and caller ID notifications along with a bunch of other notifications from my iPhone 6s. These notifications stopped working in one day. It‚Äôs actually the favorite part of my watch. You could easily look at your watch rather than your phone while you‚Äôre driving or in the middle of working. Super convenient. Pathetic software. I figured out if I remove the device from the Fitbit app and reintroduce it it will work for another day or if lm lucky two days...like I said...pathetic software.
651,Smariej22,"November 20, 2017",1,"So many updates and none work Was happy with the app when it was working. Now I get notifications after notification about an update. I update and none of the problems are fixed. First issue is the app keeps logging me out and I have to keep logging back in or else Fitbit doesn‚Äôt sync to account until I notice I‚Äôm logged off and log back in. Second issue is because of all of the updates and iOS 11 (per Fitbit customer rep) the app is draining my Zip battery so I‚Äôm buying a new battery once a month. I was told by the rep that my only resolution was to ‚Äúbe patient‚Äù while they fix the bug. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm supposed to keep buying batteries or not use the Fitbit I bought. It‚Äôs getting to the point that I‚Äôm ready to go with another company. Not worth the aggravation and lack of customer service."

I can't log sleep time. I pushed snooze at 6:20 and just woke up 7:25am, which my Fitbit didn't recognize so I attempted to log it. It says sleep must be 10 mins and no more than 24 hours. Umm correct me if I'm wrong, but that's more than 10 mins. I hate it when they change things that end up being worst off for the customer. They (the changer) don't use the product or service, so they have no idea what works and doesn't work for the customer. It seems to amaze me that they have no idea about the customer, but somehow their authorized to make changes that they have no clue about."

One of the latest updates took away a feature I enjoyed and really need. I am a swimmer and use the Charge 3 to log my swims. I usually have to go in later and tweak my distance to make it more accurate due to drill or kick sets... They took this feature away! I can now only edit start and finish time. Same goes for cycling. Please bring back that feature.

This appeared out of the blue one day to take the place of the average hours slept per week. Each day the app rates my sleep with a score. What does the score mean?  Who knows?  Apparently if you upgrade to Premium you can find out. I can tell you this - I have toyed with the idea of upgrading before, but now I never will. I don‚Äôt appreciate that sort of pressure. Even if I knew how the score was derived, I‚Äôd like the option to turn it off. I don‚Äôt actually need Fitbit‚Äôs judgment each day over something for which I have limited control. "
660,fitnesscko,"December 13, 2017",3,"FitBit Review Overall, I have been happy with my FitBit and find it to be a great tool. However, I find the food logging to be inefficient and unnecessarily time consuming. For example, when I am packing my lunch for the following day and have logged all of my food and serving sizes entered, it oftentimes glitches and puts it under the food I have eaten today. This is annoying and I go back into my food log to try to change it to tomorrow but it doesn't allow me to do so! I also noticed that the foods I frequently scan do not show up in my recents.. Only foods I type in. It would be nice to not have to scan all the time. Love FitBit! But some parts of the app aren't as functional as they could be."

If you can get your stride level down and program it on the Fitbit website the Fitbit one will be accurate. I wear mine as a necklace and it rest on my chest. Wish they would bring it back I‚Äôm not interested in sleep or calories just 10,000 steps a day. If my Fitbit One quits on me I will be lost. I‚Äôve lost weight using it. Great motivation piece."

I am young and normally quite active, and I had gotten my heart score up to the mid 50s. I then got a bad cold and was totally out of it for a week, and unable to do any intense exercise for over a month. Now, my heart score seems to be stuck at 25 - poor. Why is this, and what can I do to get it back to normal? I can run several miles in an hour, I don‚Äôt think poor is an accurate reflection of my heart‚Äôs health. I would appreciate any insights from the Fitbit team. Overall, no other issues from the app."
665,Unusual Muse,"September 26, 2019",4,"Great; but Sleep Tracking could be upgraded Overall the app is fantastic. However, I see two upgrades that could make sleep tracking much more useful. The first would be to have the ‚Äú30-day-average‚Äù be able to toggle between percentages, which are less useful, and actual hours/minutes, which would be much more useful. The second would be to display the actual number of ‚Äúwake-up events,‚Äù which would be more revealing about the quality of rest one gets; 1 hour of awake time all at once has very different implications than 1 hour occurring 30 times throughout the night!"

Now it‚Äôs just a big sales pitch with management of MY data removed. Where has the weight tracking history gone? I don‚Äôt need to know only what I weigh today from my Aria scale. I want to see the history and my progress. Now, Everything is a pop up to insist you signed up for something else join something else connect something else. It‚Äôs no longer about a personal journey trying to keep healthy or get healthy. It‚Äôs all about blasting every single thing I do to Facebook.

No matter how many periods you enter, the prediction never gets better.   If you forget to enter one, it still calculates from your first period.

Now it will not sync to the Fitbit app.   Iphone will not even see Fitbit even though Bluetooth is on.  After doing research found a lot of people are having same problem.

You will find that it tracks floors that never happened and tracks a lot of steps while driving as well. Numerous attempts to get Fitbit to fix this makes one think that it is a hardware and not a software problem that can be fixed with an update.

My one major complaint is the 9 active hours. During the hours that Fitbit has set, I can‚Äôt always get up and move around due to being at work. I think it would be better served if it is changed to see how many hours we get 250+ steps throughout a 24 hr time period. I get more steps per hour after 5 pm than I do between from 9 to 5. I‚Äôm not the only person that this applies to.. I think it would be something that can be looked into."
695,Meglils,"March 9, 2020",3,Exercise Tracking Stops I bought the charge 3 a few months ago and everything was running smoothly until a few weeks ago. I take a HIIT class daily and my watch will stop tracking my workout without me knowing. I‚Äôll be halfway through a workout and notice it‚Äôs back to the normal clock face. It‚Äôs becoming more and more frequent and I‚Äôve noticed it also has trouble tracking a heart rate and all I see are dashes. This is extremely frustrating as I am constantly having to restart a workout mid class in order to keep tracking everything. I‚Äôve also downloaded the latest update so I‚Äôm not sure what else to do. Any help is appreciated!
696,Freckles4sale,"January 12, 2020",3,Wish they would add additional sync option I am happy with this app. I‚Äôve had a fitbit for several years and it‚Äôs been helpful in keeping me on track with my fitness goals. The one thing I wish the app developers/Fitbit architects would do is to incorporate a third option to automatically sync your Fitbit once a day. The only options now are to manually sync it (which I often forget to do so my weekly report is never accurate) or to sync it continuously throughout the day. This uses up battery and I also don‚Äôt like the constant radiation coursing around my body. Having a third option where your Fitbit and the app sync once a day would be great!

I recommended it to everyone. Now it keeps glitching, the dashboard is unpleasant to look at and takes longer to scroll to what I want to see, the progress meters are smaller and harder to see, it doesn‚Äôt show my sleep breakdown on the dashboard anymore. I don‚Äôt like that the sleep score replaces showing time awake on the dashboard. Also since the update my Fitbit keeps failing to sync and my exercise shortcuts are correct in the app but are now incorrect on my Fitbit. I don‚Äôt know why they had to mess with a good thing. I would not recommend it now. I hope they switch it back and fix whatever they did to mess up their awesome product."
699,melissasimpler,"August 31, 2019",3,"New update packs less punch Dear FitBit, I was perfectly happy with the older UX/UI and the update to the new version was forced. The prior dashboard let you have 4 tiles plus the main step count on the main dashboard. This one only 3. Less useful. My second issue is that the 250 step count over 9 hours is hard for me to achieve and I loved when I achieved that, that the gauge was animated and turned bright green. It may me feel good! Now when I do that it is static and blood red. Blech. I hope others agree with me and that you will make updates to enhance this.

I have had the Alta Hr for a couple years and adored it. The only pain was taking it off whenever I went swimming. I was thrilled when I heard the Versa was waterproof. I saved up and bought it Black Friday as a Christmas gift. My Versa started to malfunction mid January and after doing 100 step test, all the updates, and several factory resets....it still wouldn‚Äôt count my steps. I changed the sensitivity, switched wrists...even changed the clock face. When I spoke with customer service they told me it had been to long and I couldn‚Äôt even return it.

I am doing yoga three days a week. Aerobics two days a week and I workout two hours a day with weights and cardio. This is all tracked and calculated by my versa.

Also on a travel day where you are sitting most of the day, activity could be explained. Lawn work could be added also just to see the difference.

I assume this is due to app updates (though why they can‚Äôt update the app without losing your login info is beyond me). It is particularly annoying since up until today there didn‚Äôt seem to be any noticeable differences in the app. Today the dots for editing the Sleep Log disappeared. Uninstall, reboot, reinstall didn‚Äôt seem to fix it, but killing the app and restarting after the reinstall finally did the trick. Aggravating.  Please fix the lost login info problem!"

Also as stated in a previous review the top of messages are not visible, including your list if friends and their ranking, the top person is not visible unless you pull down on screen.

720,Seeking joy,"December 13, 2018",5,Use it every day Fun to see how sleep and physical activity impact overall health. Exercise really does drop resting heart rate and relatively quickly.

The alerts used to work great!!! I never have my phone in my hand, so I‚Äôve come to heavily rely on the notifications. Over the past few months the notifications NEVER WORK!! I have to go through a restart phone, uninstall app, reinstall app, turn off notifications, turn back on notifications, etc. routine multiple times a day.

726,one less fitbit user,"October 6, 2019",2,Used to be better I have had my Fitbit for 2+ years.  Loved it initially and my Alta HR is still going strong.  I give it 2 stars today for the recent changes to the app and the loss of HR function.   I hate the updated app and would go back to the old version if I could.  It‚Äôs just not as user friendly and in my opinion it‚Äôs a step back in overall  design.  It‚Äôs ugly but honestly I can deal with that.  What really upsets me is the loss of heart rate tracking during active exercise tracking.  Isn‚Äôt that why you buy a tracker with HR functioning?! I‚Äôm very upset that Fitbit removed this function (why?).  I know I‚Äôm not alone in my disappointment.  Was thinking about upgrading to a new Fitbit but now I‚Äôll probably go with a Garmin.

I have tried to update my tracker, it will not update, even when it‚Äôs on the charger. I have tried to connect to my WiFi, it just tells me that I have no WiFi connection.

Being able to actually log in what you're eating helps, and the sleep feature is really useful. My only problem with Fitbit is that it doesn't pair with the Activity app or your Apple Watch. I got an Apple Watch and wanted to see if I could sync it with my Fitbit app, but it can't. A feature allowing this would help because Fitbit can offer things that Activities can't, like food, water, and sleep tracking, but your Apple watch automatically syncs your step count to Activities."

If you select ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù it tells you about how much you should be getting in each area for your age. I find these things directly relate to how well I feel in the morning.

However suddenly I opened my app and fitbit changed everything automatically with out me even updating the app. I wish there was an option to be able to revert back to the old layout. 
748,RDragonSpn,"June 27, 2019",1,"A total fail The redesign with the latest update is a total fail. I went from seeing everything on one screen with nice graphics towards progress and that is gone. Furthermore I had to delete and reinstall other apps to be able to view anything other than the home screen. The ONLY thing that is good is that it now displays a battery percentage for my tracker not just full, partial, or empty. Following this initial post of this review I received feedback from the developer that shows they did not actually read my review or acknowledge my concerns. If it weren‚Äôt for the community and my current financial commitment I would totally leave the community. As it is when my current device hits end of life it will be harder to decide to replace it with on of their products."

However I was very disappointed when I saw that there was no option to show the number of steps I got in the whole week, which was the whole reason I got the fit bit. Besides that, j can say that the quality of counting is amazing and very accurate which I like, I just hope that in some kind of new update I‚Äôm able to see a weekly step counter as well."
750,Stefanie Jones,"December 7, 2017",1,Poor battery life I have been having poor battery life. Only lasts maybe two days! For months I have been working with customer service and tried everything. Then they noticed I didn't have the latest update. I was told to do that and deplete my battery then charge it all the way and that will take care of it. It made it worse!! Call customer service back and now they are saying there is a glitch in the update that drains batteries and they are working on it. It still didn't make sense because my battery lasts just the same. They refuse to send a new battery saying it will have the same problems but how do they know if they don't send one! This has been going on for months. And I need it for the sleep log really bad. But they don't seem to care.

I will say that the Fitbit itself though, is a five out of five. Yes, you need the app to set up the Fitbit, and it does that well, but if you want to track your daily steps, it doesn‚Äôt work well unless you open the app numerous times or after you‚Äôve completed your goal for the day.

This year, my family is moving so we empitied out our old house and we found my Fitbit. I was so happy. I even got new bands and everything! So then, when I put it on I saw that it was a WEEK off and TWO hours off! So I looked on the forums and found that I needed to change the time zone. Oddly enough, the time zone was right.

You configure all these features down until you get the battery life you like but there is still a feature that neither the app nor the watch address: two tap wake up.

I‚Äôve had the Charge 3 for 6 days and the sleep stage has only worked 2 of those six days. The other days it switches to sleep pattern which only tells you when you were awake and when you slept. Sleep stages seems to only work when you‚Äôve fully charged the fitbit that day. A little irritating cause that means I have to take it off once a day to recharge and reset in order to get an accurate look at my sleep stages. It seems a lot of people have had this issue with Charge 2 also. It‚Äôs sad it hasn‚Äôt been fixed yer.

Yet in every single challenge (no matter if it‚Äôs in the same time zone or a different time zone than my location) My step numbers (and many others users) are not syncing correctly the numbers are not even matching what the app claims your weekly steps are.

I can't update my exercise goals, it always reverts to the preset 5 days. It's much harder to navigate, and doesn't provide the same level of details as the older version. For example, it does a much better job breaking down the sleep cycle information and it details the amounton REM sleep on my GF's app when the new version doesn't.

I love that you can change the band and watch face and seriously make it your own. However sometimes the app is slow and crashes as well. I would also like to ask if you could make a watch face that can have multiple pictures transferring through (like on an Apple Watch lol). It‚Äôs hard just to choose one photo. I also wish that the faces were cuter and more ascetically pleasing. Thank you for taking in my wishes and thank you for making such a great company and app.

I have received an email telling me my battery was low, and then it was empty.

Also, if the all apps selection does load, if I click on view all for any category, that is the only thing that will show up no matter what I click on after that.

1028,DancingTay,"April 14, 2019",4,I would even say 4.5 stars Fitbits products and software are great!! I think they're just as comfortable as apple watch... Actually better because the apple watches have to be charged every night. The only thing I would change is that I don't think it always reads when I do things. For example my house has 4 flights of stairs that I walk up and down multiple times daily and I often can't reach my goal on flights walked. Or when I walk my dog I won't get credit for active minutes. But that's a pretty minimal complaint lol

My 1st Fitbit (purchased 2014) came apart  before a year in use. My husband tried using super glue on it. This only was a temporary fix. After awhile the strap came apart. Customer service was good in addressing this issue. Since they replaced my 1st Fitbit. Since 2015 my Fitbit served me well. It‚Äôs now 2019 and I‚Äôm having same issue with the strap. I did tell customer service to pass along the strap issue to their design team and manufacture team.

It offers great access to videos and sharing with other ‚Äúfit bit-ters ‚Äú and the ability to scan and type in foods; however, it would be GREAT if you had the ability to add your own recipe with the macros etc. because sometimes you can‚Äôt put in exactly what you ate. it would also be great if we could track our macros as well. Currently the app just tells us the percentage of protein vs fat vs carbs. It would be great to break it down even more."

I sure hope this one doesn‚Äôt fall apart.

I just got my Fitbit Charge 3 a month ago and I‚Äôve noticed all day sync won‚Äôt stay on and I have to forget device and then reconnect it with Bluetooth.

I love the calorie counter, sleep tracker, and text and call notifications. I love my charge 3. If the Bluetooth issue didn‚Äôt exist I‚Äôd be 100% satisfied with it and write a 5 star review.

Apparently if you sync your exorcise with more then one app it screws everything up so i had to unsync everything which got my steps back thank goodness, but it deleted my exorcise count for today. When I try to manually add it in the Fitbit app itself for the time I was hiking it constantly changes my daily step count removing hundreds of steps from my daily total.

UNFORTUNATELY I STILL DON‚Äôt GET THE DETAILED SLEEP STATS MORE THAN ONE NIGHT OUT OF EVERY SIX OR SO.  In addition to paying more for this device, I gave up my One, which can be worn concealed instead of on my wrist, and it had an altimeter allowing me to count how many flights of stairs I went up each day.

There are some places I go to eat (fast food, etc) that are not compatible with Fitbit, so I can't add that meal into my calorie count. Please create a ""create meal"" part, so when I go to my favorite eating places I can just quickly add what I already know I'm gonna order. Fitbit would then be perfect!"

It would be possibly counterproductive for Fitbit to create an Apple Watch app for that competitor device but I am sure that if they do that and charged and annual or purchase price for the application they could make money in that regard. The app is polished and nine times out of 10, works better than the health app for Apple because it seamlessly controls many different health aspects.

I reduced to 5 stars because I have so many friends who have an Apple or a Garmin &  I can‚Äôt add them as friends & I really need to be able to do this."
1133,AllOtherNamesAreTaken20190119,"January 19, 2019",5,Helpful I've had the Alta for over a year and love it. The sleep tracking is fairly accurate. It's great to confirm that I sleep well or like crap. The step counter is a lot of fun to challenge my family and friends. The active minutes for mine is all out of wack though. Somehow I get hundreds of active minutes each day doing normal activities. I've tried changing lots of settings to get it closer to realistic and nothing and to work. That's my only complaint though
1134,Dani-admas97,"February 7, 2019",5,"Useful, Enjoyable, and Easy to Use I love the Fitbit app! I‚Äôve used it for the past 6 months. It‚Äôs so interesting to learn how little exercise and sleep I get. It‚Äôs really cool to be able to track my active minutes, calories burned, and sleep schedule. The period tracker is rather accurate, and I like being able to 1) add in how I feel that day and 2) how my period was. I really like this app and highly recommend it to those who have a Fitbit or are comparing it to another fitness tracker."
1135,LivHawkDarkHorse,"May 6, 2019",1,"Loved it til my account was HACKED I‚Äôve had my Charge 3 for almost three months and have been very happy with the product. The sleep tracking feature is awesome! However last week I received an email from Fitbit saying my email address had been changed and that there was unusual activity on my account. I‚Äôve been locked out ever since. I‚Äôve contacted customer service multiple times and was told my case was sent to the ‚ÄúSpecialist Team‚Äù, but have not heard anything else. A product that is basically worthless after 3 months, is a bad product. They need to fix their security issues.

I am not sure what the developers were thinking on this one. The ‚ÄúAt a glance‚Äù layout is gone. You know have to scroll more. You have more clicks than necessary compared to the old DB. it looks outdated and lost its ‚Äúvibrant colors‚Äù this change may be the straw that broke the camels back and time for me to move on from the Fitbit.

I keep turning on the notifications and it‚Äôs telling me to connect my device which is obviously connected because it‚Äôs syncing my steps. I‚Äôve removed and added the device several times to try to fix it but it‚Äôs no luck. Which is highly disappointing because I upgraded from the flex 2 so I could get the notifications.

When you try to buy it through the app, it stalls in Applepay. I spent a week helping Fitbit troubleshoot this over Twitter and then they just shrugged and basically told me I should have bought it from their store and nowhere else. Appalling customer service and experience which is a shame as the Versa is a good, if over priced, product. And without the Fitbit Protection Plan you can‚Äôt return it if there‚Äôs a problem. I‚Äôm taking mine back to BestBuy (Bestbuy also doesn‚Äôt do a coverage plan for this device which enforced by Fitbit). Very disappointing!"

The Bluetooth sync just quite on me today for no reason whatsoever ever. The app does not automatically switch to using your phone to track anything if your Fitbit goes offline for any reason either. The food log feature is a pain to try to use, way to many different screens and selections just to add a simple snack.

I would love to be able to have my data to compare and build correlation graphics myself. Basically you data is not yours.

The app just isn't working correctly, and it just gets worse. It worked fine in the beginning but hasn't now for several months. It never tracks my activity even though I go over the time I  have it set to. I have it set to vibrate with alerts. (Texts,phone calls) but the only it alerts me of is when it's 10 minutes before the hour and when I reach 250 steps. Now I can't get the display to cone up unless I  bang on it several times. I m just so frustrated with it I'm about to forget about it."

And yes I have internet connection. Not asking for much just a product that works reliably.  If there is something I‚Äôm missing or should do to make the Fitbit work properly then I suppose your app should be able to tell me what that is, not blame it on no internet connection.

Now it‚Äôs been a few weeks with the new one and it is doing the same thing!  It counts my steps but that is it!  I‚Äôve done all the things the help groups say to do when this happens and it doesn‚Äôt work. At work we also have a program called GO365 and it won‚Äôt roll my steps over to that.

I don‚Äôt track my food, water, or menstruation, so I don‚Äôt know how well those parts work, but everything else has never given me issue. 4 stars because sometimes while tracking sleep, it only shows the simplified version. I don‚Äôt know what I do that makes it change, and it‚Äôs frustrating when as a nursing mother, I want to know how often I really was woken up."
1151,News hound1,"January 12, 2019",1,Woops Out of nowhere the ability to sync is gone and it quit tracking my sleep! Not just getting simplified data but none. Fitbit settings on device showed not tracking sleep but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to change it. Plus I didn‚Äôt turn it off in the first place! The device is useless to me like this as there is no way to get the data off it and onto phone or laptop. Sleep tracking is very important to me. Before this happened I normally just got simple sleep reports. Just got it as Christmas gift and maybe twice I‚Äôve gotten a detailed sleep reports. Of course since it doesn‚Äôt sync there‚Äôs no access to weather either. Not much more than a black wrist band now.

1153,BlueMoon3,"May 5, 2019",3,Great app This app is very easy to work with and as long as you don‚Äôt go too long between syncing your Fitbit it doesn‚Äôt take any time at all to sync. I truly HATE whatever change was made recently that makes a notification pop up when I turn my Bluetooth off & kill the app when I‚Äôm done with it that tells me to leave my app open- if I wanted it open I wouldn‚Äôt close it!

I open the app to sync it every morning and to check how much I‚Äôve slept because this log is so important to me as I am an insomniac.

I downloaded the app and grew very dissatisfied when I noticed you had to keep reloading it to connect your watch. I feel like it should automatically stay connected. I also think you guys should look into getting a battery widget added like how on iPhones if you have anything Apple it tells you the percent of that item without having to look on that item. Next to that no matter how many updates my watch has it will say I walked 300 steps but in reality I walked 10. Please respond back and look it these things. I‚Äôm sure they can be fixed

The Fitbit team told me that I should just create a new account with a different email address. That‚Äôs like Snapchat or instagram telling you that you have to create a new account because their system locked you out. Save your money and buy a galaxy or Apple Watch.  Fitbit is a joke and a complete waste of money.

I like how the Fitbit can track how many hours you sleep every night."

My only issue is as most apps or diets they do not include tracking the amount of sugar one eats. Eating healthy is not only determined by the amount of calories, carbs, protein, and fat you eat but also sugar. Too many Americans eat too much sugar that our bodies can not breakdown which can lead to several health problems. If you can not keep track of how many grams of sugar you consume daily. Then counting calories is a waste of time."

If you need an accurate period tracker don‚Äôt use this app, but it works great for literally everything else (walking, exercise, food, etc)"

1304,Airmantank,"September 28, 2019",3,Fitbit not showing notifications I know there's been some issues since iOS 13 came out and everything works great but the one thing that's important for me the the text message notification. I read the thread about how to maybe fix it but it did not help. So I would like to know if that's something that will be fixed soon. Other than that I do like the app and the products and I currently bought a versa and so far I enjoy it. However if the text messages issue doesn't get fixed I may be looking to get something else.

In particular, it no longer displays past sleep times, only ‚Äúsleep scores‚Äù ‚Äî I can no longer see my average sleep time for the past week and past year.

Well, don‚Äôt buy anything Fitbit cuz you need to know where to look inside the different apps to be able to do that.

The most glaring UI failure is the navigation between days -- so you're scrolling through your days to review your progress and trying to get back to ""today"" and all of a sudden the [now miniscule] touch target turns to ""Edit"". So you hit that by accident. The tile interface below the step count was nice, easy to configure, and visually useful.

The library of foods has significant errors: if the maker says 100 calories on the label, Fitbit‚Äôs data says 90.

The battery level does not ever update and I usually have to reopen and close the app and resync multiple times to get the accurate battery level.

Had no problems whatsoever with my iPhone 5s. Contacted and spoke with support twice. First time went thru all the steps and reinstalled Fitbit. It worked for a couple of hours.

One example was after a work out I manually checked and counted my heart rate at 192 and it said i was at 108.

1591,Bricalhoun,"September 5, 2019",1,"Awful Update to What Was a Great App I don‚Äôt know who conned the Fitbit folks into thinking their users wanted a Sleep Score, but they were totally wrong. There are many devices that provide a sleep score. This score is arbitrary and means nothing. Everyone calculates it differently and there is no standard. And now Fitbit wants a monthly subscription to find out more about a sleep score that I didn‚Äôt want in the first place! Just report the facts, not a score you made up.  I‚Äôm interested in the average hours of sleep per week and now I get some stupid score average instead. Clearly the Fitbit company has gotten greedy and is trying to justify charging a monthly fee."
1592,jason-California,"September 3, 2019",3,Mostly great but users should be able to customize their data better There needs to be more options to customize your data per users preference. The latest update wiped out your weekly sleep average times and replace them with an average sleep index score. The sleep score makes little sense as if I sleep 11 hours it says I almost have the same score if I sleep four hours .... yet as we all know four hours of sleep is not enough. Thank you for taking a step backwards with the latest update.

It seems every time the app automatically updates the time changes on my Fitbit backwards three hours and then the two won‚Äôt sync for a day or two. I lose the ability to track sleep info and all the reason I own the Fitbit are hindered and it happens TOO often to not be a complete annoyance. "
1594,AlexRGuitar,"August 31, 2019",1,"Absolutely hate the new layout!!! I‚Äôm disappointed in the new UI design on this app. My dashboard seems bland and hard to read. Makes me not want to use my App anymore. I don‚Äôt want to see challenges on my dashboard. My dashboard should be just for my data and should be easy to read with clear distinctions between sections. This new list view is just not as friendly as the square section view. I felt like I was able to see my all my stats at a glance,  but now I have to keep scrolling on this bland almost colorless list. Very disappointed with the design. Fitbit should hire a new UI designer. Maybe I‚Äôll start looking for an alternative to Fitbit."
1595,Isaiahdude,"August 27, 2019",2,"Quit changing crap!!! Yet ANOTHER app changing for absolutely no reason and just making things worse. It was such a unique design for the dashboard before which is why I loved it, but with the new update it looks like every other stupid scrolling list. It‚Äôs so much harder to read and not near as fun and endearing. The point of Fitbit is ease of access to track your progress on a myriad of items, but now I won‚Äôt be checking much til the old dashboard is back.

My resting heart rate is normal and healthy for my gender and age (average resting 64 bpm). It doesn‚Äôt make sense to go from the healthiest part of the scale to the unhealthiest part of the scale overnight. I contacted support but they weren‚Äôt able to resolve the issue.

Guess what, it‚Äôs not!  Add back the functionality from the previous version.  Make it so you can see your current status on the hourly step tracker and a quick action button to access silent alarms for those that travel and need to regularly change this."

He will walk with me and we will do 10 miles he was have 24 floors. I will have 10. We are the same height and almost same weight. I also do not like that if I sit down and rest it monitors me as sleeping. The same thing for him. If he does his work at the computer it is logging him as sleeping. Weird.

As of the time I made this post, the App Store images are still of the old dashboard which is much nicer. When I first saw this update I thought it was an older version. The iconography is not easy to read, they are significantly smaller, and the colors are not as easy to see. Plus you have to scroll down a lot to see everything on the dashboard as they are all listed one after another, and not in a grid. If at all possible, please revert back to the old version, or consider better icons and colors in the future."

The new program added to the app I do like the idea that is if it would work half the time. Most times when I click on the period tracker it freezes up not just that part of the program but the whole app freezes up and won‚Äôt work at all. I have to close the app down and restart it to work and even doing that the tracker still won‚Äôt fix it self I click on it once more it freezes up and I am restarting the app again! PLEASE FIX!!!!!
1611,nurapom,"June 25, 2018",4,Great app The app and the watch sync well. I think a five day memory on a watch is long enough to remember to connect to the app. Interface is user friendly and it‚Äôs great to see that now you can track women‚Äôs days too.

I have to use MyFitnessPal and a calculator in conjunction with this to meet my needs. Would be nice if the app could take into account specific dietary needs/diet plans to track macros better. Additionally you can find specific foods but if you change the serving size the app doesn‚Äôt adjust the macro counts only the calories. For this reason I have to go to another app or use a calculator to adjust  the correct numbers for fats carbs and proteins.

I go to the Fitbit website and have NO PROBLEM logging in and viewing my dashboard. I am now getting fed up because all I want to do it update the clock on my watch.

After 2 hours, I was eventually told I needed to wait for an app update to come out. This update did not fix the sync issue. I‚Äôm disappointed because the attitude of the reps has been so good. But even walking through all the trouble shooting, it really boils down to software engineering. The product matters so much. I‚Äôve had a great experience with Fitbit for 3 years. I hate having the sort of issues that points toward switching brands. "

The app is awesome - I love how it tracks my sleep (very important to me) and water intake and how I can scan a barcode to have calories come up for the foods I ate. The reason for 4 stars is because not everything comes up on the calorie counter (how can it though?! There‚Äôs so many variations of food). However, the rest of the app is awesome and switching between devices was easy too."

Then it was the app crashing constantly. Then it wouldn‚Äôt allow participants to sync their steps for days at a time. It‚Äôs gotten so bad the people are frustrated and leaving the challenge.

I called customer service and because it went past my 1 year warranty they refused to replace the defective replacement they sent me. I called within two weeks of receiving it and they would only check settings and do reset which did not work. It‚Äôs an expensive gadget to only have work for 11 months. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!

The ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù it says supposedly when it‚Äôs updated don‚Äôt actually fix anything. Fitbit needs to figure out how to make their products actually work right and connect with ISO devices. No notifications work through the app or on the Fitbit itself from the phone. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty disappointing product. Not pleased. I‚Äôd only recommend if you like keeping track of steps but likely it won‚Äôt log it in the app because like I said it probably won‚Äôt sync with the device.

Most times I want to do this, though, the app stays on ‚Äúsyncing and refreshing‚Äù indefinitely and doesn‚Äôt actually do it.  I have waited 10 minutes before and nothing ever synced.

Fitbit is aware of this (search Google) but hasn‚Äôt managed to solve it.  Nor does the generic Help article I was sent by Support solve the issue.  And good luck trying to get in touch with someone that can help. Nor have they EVER fixed the app issue where it no longer counts steps (since iOS 13) recorded by the Fitbit.

It seems others are having similar issues, but Fitbit just comes back with a canned response.

I updated the app and now I can‚Äôt log any of my food because it takes 5 minutes to load an apple. If it takes that long to log my food I‚Äôm obviously not going to use it and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. At this point if I can‚Äôt use it to track my food Its pointless to even use at all because then I don‚Äôt know how many calories I need to burn to make my goals.

As a shift worker I rely on my Fitbit sleep tracking to help me stay sane and sleep an appropriate number of hours in each 24 hr period. I regularly checked on my total for each week to determine if I should take a day off to sleep or if I was doing ok and meeting my goals. Now it uses a scoring system that is useless to me. I‚Äôd give back my 5 star review if I could option out of the new update and return to the prior sleep tracking interface (or something with all of those old features present).

I can run for 20 min in a row & it won‚Äôt record a single active minute. You can‚Äôt rely on the sleep measurement either.

Otherwise I‚Äôll be more encouraged to breakdown and buy the Apple Watch.

I have successfully lost the weight I wanted to lose and kept it off by adding a new habit to my lifestyle, walking. I could not have done it without my Fitbit. It keeps me motivated and moving; something I struggled with before. I am not a lazy person, but I work a desk job and was not moving near enough. I am thankful for this device."

Any time I move my hand, it counts it as a step. I assume keeping it in my pocket would be more accurate but not sure. It‚Äôs also confusing when logging a workout. I think it double logs the calories. "

When I open the app, the top bar that says ‚Äúsync and refresh‚Äù spins and spins but the completion bar never gets past a centimeter. If I tap the screen at all, it becomes completely unresponsive. I have not been able to use the app in over two weeks. I have a new Versa Lite tracker in the mail on its way to me and I would like to see this issue fixed ASAP so that I can use my new device."

I won‚Äôt update my phone to iOS 13 bc of the known issues with receiving text notifications which should have been fixed by now but, judging by the reviews, has not been. I also really hate that sleep data is premium, that‚Äôs just a slap in the face to customers who bought your product. I will keep my Fitbit for now but will definitely not be buying another one."

It will not sync no matter what I do, I‚Äôve tried unpairing and repairing, logging out and back in, closing the app and restarting, and even deleting the app and reinstalling. So in conclusion it‚Äôs basically a useless device except for the time. The app was a lot better before you changed the layout, this one is annoying to navigate and it makes me want to switch to a different brand. If it is not broken, why fix it?"

I have restarted and factory reset the watch a million times as well as restarting my phone and deleting the app and reinstalling. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.

Like I'd love to be able to document whether or not an animal is sleeping on my bed with me, or that I watched a certain amount of TV before I went to bed, or maybe had a lot on my mind... Stuff like that so that I can see if any of that is connected to how well I do or do not sleep. "
1844,n_hoops,"February 26, 2018",3,"Love the tracking. Hate the food log. The Fitbit device with the app is great to log calories burned, sleep, heart rate etc. but the built in food log definitely falls short of what I believe a lot of users need. Customization. Not even one conforms to the macro levels it sets for you, myself being Keto/Low Carb. I have to use a totally different app to log my food and macros and it‚Äôs annoying to have to bounce back and forth. "
1845,Amory California,"April 7, 2018",4,"Great app. But needs a couple things. The Fitbit app is amazing but there are several things to add. First off I think it would be pretty cool to have prizes for so many steps(in the entire time you've had you're Fitbit). For example, for 50,000 steps you get a special prize delivered to you're address, 100,000 you get a better prize and so on. This would motivate more people to get this app and to get a Fitbit. And people would get moving more often!"

Last summer my dog got it out of my bag while I was swimming and destroyed it. I found that I wouldn‚Äôt walk as much, because I wasn‚Äôt tracking my steps! About that time I saw that the Charge 3 was coming, and it can track swimming! I preordered it, and I love it!"
1847,Was a good game!?!?,"December 27, 2018",2,"Too many mods They ask me to review every year and not much has changed.  For steps, hourly activity and tracking weight the app does it.  Try to use it with something else because your Fitbit is dead and no dice. Try to track competitions with your friends!  Sure jump through hoops and multiple clicks to see.  The Community page wastes more of my time and you can‚Äôt customize it.  There are other devices that are cheaper and more reliable with multiple interfaces.  As of Jan 1 I am switching. Do your research as the devices average 13-15 months only."

I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled, more than once. I‚Äôve turned off background refresh, notifications, and even cell service for the app. Doesn‚Äôt matter. What‚Äôs up? I am less and less motivated to use the app now. I‚Äôve posted in the forum and no luck."

It vibrates quietly once when i have a text message and i can read it (but not respond) on the fitbit. Also vibrates when someone is calling me   Since ive only had it a few days i dont have much info tracked on the app, but the little i do have is easily accessed. I think this is going to be a very helpful gadget :)"

The app won‚Äôt sync with my Fitbit and now it won‚Äôt even let me login. I know I have the correct logon and password because it takes it with the only me dashboard. But without the ability to sync my Fitbit and track my exercise, water and food intake and see my progress  it is about worthless to me. All I have now is a heart rate and step monitor and i could have got that for a lot less money."
1912,Roni Davis,"March 1, 2018",4,"Great minus one thing! I love this app and use it constantly. It has been a great tool on my fitness journey. The only thing I don‚Äôt love is how the macro tracking section is set up. I know some people track their percentages instead of by grams BUT it would be soooo helpful if it where it showed you the percentages of carbs, protein, and fat that it told you the grams of each as well. I find myself using this app in conjunction with Myfitness pal to get the grams for my macros! PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING THIS FEATURE!"

As for the app...good idea and looks great but my Fitbit never syncs to it and drains battery life while trying. I set it to only sync when I choose instead of all day syncing but even with that it can drain up to 10% of my iPhone battery and still not sync to update the apps data. Very frustrating and have no interest in using their products ever again other than the fact that I already spent money on the Fitbit itself"

1916,Chewarca90,"December 12, 2018",4,"I like it This app is great to keep track of your activity level. It‚Äôs easy to use, pretty self explanatory. If you have the Ionic it‚Äôs fun to keep track of your heart rate and helps keep a good heart rate while working out. I had the flex for a while and it‚Äôs less interactive but still fairly fun and helpful. The app crashes sometimes when choosing a clock face for ionic and can be slow sometimes updating from your watch or Fitbit device."

Looking over the changes in my heart at rest I saw a change that scared my as it was going up and up. I would not have gone to the hospital because the only changes I felt was the loss of energy. I could have died or had a stroke. Thanks to my Fitbit I am well.

So far trying to ask Fitbit about it has been useless. They‚Äôre just another company that will send you on a loop of useless FAQs. The scale is just an additional piece of equipment in our lives setting the user up for failure. Over and over it‚Äôs seen that the app doesn‚Äôt work, the scales always have problems...for an extended amount of time and no correction. Fitbit has zero concern. I will put my efforts toward a much more worthy product. Basically anything besides Fitbit."

Also by monitoring my sleep and water intake I am able to keep those at a healthy levels. Now I am trying to balance out my eating habits and have started using the food log. It shows me a balance between fat-calories-protein. Would be great if it would also report my fiber intake. I know it must have the information because I input my food.

I'm a bit of a nut, but for some reason after the last update the app won't let me log in anymore. I tried the password reset and it goes to a dead link. Is this a common issue?

Informed them last night ... This morning I got a prompt to reregister my Fitbit as a new device and so I did. And now is working though I had to use a different email because it had me in the system with the email I opened the account in.   I am so confused!!!!! We will see how long this app version works!

It took forever to log in and a few minutes before I got ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù. It took forever and he/she was not helpful. I finally just logged out as I didn‚Äôt have any more time to waste.

I have to manually correct the amount in the app every time. I also wish I could track simple calories without having to open the app and enter specific foods ‚Äî for me, I really only want to interact with the app to view data over time or look at new apps my Versa can sync with.

1928,Randy Martin,"October 27, 2019",4,Not a fan of the big changes to color scheme Recently the look and feel of the app was changed in a major way.  It‚Äôs not better.

It‚Äôs less attractive-the new colors evoke the late 80‚Äôs and, the icons are flattened. Too bad this is the final version. Hate it!

I use the instructions from your technical support team that the wait time was over 35 minutes but they were very helpful. I believe I have a unit that is hopefully not the normal product you strive to sell because it is frustrating when it does not sync and there is no pattern why.I sent a response a day ago and not syncing again today.

I use to use my sleep and detailed sleeping heart rate to share with my doctors when would see if something wasn‚Äôt right. But now Fitbit got greedy. I can understand if they charge for coaching but not something that other watches will give me for no charge. It was nice while it lasted. Now I know why you are losing to others.

Also, I got a notification to update. The update failed because it said my battery, at 60% was too low. My battery is now 100% and it still said my battery was too low. In a way, I‚Äôm glad, because based on the last ‚Äòupdate‚Äô I‚Äôm not sure I want another one."

However, the app knows exactly how many steps I have taken all day long, so it is syncing some things.

Today I synced it and wanted to look at the run I just did, and it‚Äôs different and TERRIBLE! Not only do I have to go through a bunch of stuff to find hardly any very basic info about my run, but it doesn‚Äôt match what my ionic told me I finished tracking the run. This is so disappointing. I haven‚Äôt even gone into other parts of the app to see what other great things might have been ruined by the last update."
2105,hottubice,"February 21, 2020",3,Goal change fix needed It is super annoying that changing a goal impacts previous days rather than just those moving forward. It is not motivating at all to increase your goal and watch all of your hard work in the past disappear. This has been a complaint by many users for quite some time. Seems like it‚Äôs time to fix it. I look forward to changing my review and rating when that happens. Thank you in advance.
2106,johnc1949,"February 9, 2020",3,"Doesn‚Äôt Scale to iPad and slow to Sync This app is not horrible, but why didn‚Äôt the developers create a version that scales the screen to the device you are using?   There are very few apps the don‚Äôt properly scale and most are written by small or single developer companies.  There is no excuse for a company the size of Fitbit!  Also it can take 5-10 mins after you sync your Fitbit to the app before you can import the results into 3rd party apps like Weight Watchers."

Spoke to customer service many times and the response is ‚Äújust be patient we are working to fix the issue‚Äù. I‚Äôve been patient for months!

One of the things I used to love about my Versa was that it vibrated when I got calls/texts. I thought it would be fixed within a few app updates and I‚Äôve tried everything online that it says to do but nothing has worked. Really annoying because it seems like I‚Äôve lost a lot of functionality and not sure when/if it‚Äôll ever be fixed."
2109,PoppaTops,"January 3, 2020",2,"If only i could find my community Part of the appeal for me using Fitbit was being able to track and see my friends progress and compare my own progress to theirs. Ever since having downloaded this app, for some reason it tells me that none of my contacts have a Fitbit account, nor do any of my friends on Facebook. With a simple google search, I‚Äôve noticed that many others have had this issue as well and though it says the issue has been solved, it is far from it. That‚Äôs a shame."

I graduated to Fitbit half a year ago from the Runkeeper app and have been very happy. But if I can‚Äôt find a way to reverse this stupid update I‚Äôll be going back to Runkeeper.

On the X with the old layout, I could get most of an additional tile without scrolling and everything was nice and big and legible, very helpful during a workout. The single column view of the new UI is ‚Äúuninspiring‚Äù and certainly everything looks smaller and it‚Äôs overall one tile ‚Äúshort‚Äù without scrolling. Also the new color scheme took the fun out of looking at the data. Certainly a step back as far as the UI is concerned."

Recently, however, I keep getting mistaken messages about the number of challenges I am in and preventing me from setting up new ones. Please fix this as it is messing up the challenges and preventing my challenge mates from participating.  There are a number of minor problems that have always been there, the count of calories burned is ridiculously inaccurate and the step totals are usually off."

The changes make it more complicated to find your information, check your challenge status and see what family and friends are doing.  The app upgrades are so bad that we are looking for a new solution away from Fitbit. Check the community boards online and you will see we are not the only ones leaving fitbit because of the changes to the app."

I‚Äôm an insomniac trying to rate my sleep. Which Fitbit gets wrong. So it‚Äôs a lesson in futility with inaccuracies that make my Fitbit just a ‚Äòwhy bother‚Äô wristwatch."

Other than that Fitbit is great."

Before there were little celebrations, a cute moon when I hit my sleep goal, star confetti for hitting activity, lots of fun ways Fitbit would encourage you to meet your goals! Now everything is gross and washed out. No more celebrations, they just invert the color. The new design also makes it really hard for me to tell where i am on steps per hour at a glance, light grey and off white are hard to see on a white app background. Horrible."

I understand that it monitors movement and it is on my wrist and I flipped around when I sleep, but it is a little misleading.

2368,Can't Switch To Metric,"March 23, 2019",3,Watch and app don‚Äôt match! I look at my watch and I have a certain calorie burn so far in my day (today it was 1220) but when I open and sync my Fitbit app it dropped down to 1070. This has been happening a lot lately where I open my app and suddenly I have different data then what I had on my watch just a minute prior. Then the app updates my watch and the watch also shows the lower calorie burn. I‚Äôm so frustrated with the glitches lately.

It deletes what I try to add and I don‚Äôt want to try to add stuff anymore because I get annoyed when it doesn‚Äôt add it after 5 tries. Get the Fitbit just to track your steps on the actual Fitbit. Don‚Äôt waste your time with the app unless your goal is to annoy yourself.

Deducting one star. Before the last one or two upgrades the app filled the screen on my iPad - now it‚Äôs minimized.

On the Fitbit 3 it will not allow you to set the screen you want to see when you look at it- I want to see ONLY steps - you could set this in previous versions of Charge.  The sensitivity to when I raise my arm to look at time doesn‚Äôt work 1/2 as good as the Charge 2 SW- I have to constantly use my other hand to turn the screen on.  Fitbit used to be great - now I tell people to buy a different product.

That was till i updated my watch and it went from an average of 2.5-3 days to less then 10 hours on a full charge. There are many complaints about this problem if you simply search the concern. I wonder if this is intentional to get people to invest in new hardware ü§î. Long story short I bought a new Iwatch. I did not want to buy one because my ionic served every need that I had but I was left with no choice

2572,ivbails,"December 4, 2019",2,Fitbit used to be good but not anymore I have used Fitbit for 5 years and always loved the app. But the last upgrade when they changed tiles/appearance is just bad in so many ways. Since then it just getting worse. Constant glitches and tripping. I can‚Äôt trust any data. They removed ability to enter body fat % accurately. There is a big difference in 25.1% and 25.9%. Sometimes 10 lbs difference!  App got less user friendly and very disappointing on daily bases. I guess time for Apple Watch.
2573,Jared 0021,"November 30, 2019",1,Not family friendly Fitbit does a poor job of keeping posts in the community appropriate. Many of the posts have nothing to do with fitness. They involve half naked photos of people seeking attention/validation in the name of ‚Äúbody positivity‚Äù followed by disgusting sexual comments. Political posts are common and followed by hate speech from every niche on the political spectrum. It is sad that we can‚Äôt just be decent to one another. It is also sad the company does very little to regulate or warn users. This should be an 18+ app. I will be finding a different fitness watch after my Fitbit fails.

Most are visible in other reviews as well. Sync is very unreliable. Support and troubleshooting solutions to keep closing, re-opening, resetting are not an actual fix. Also the location service should not need to be ‚Äúalways on‚Äù to find Bluetooth. Bluetooth is separate from GPS. Don‚Äôt insult users or ignore clear privacy concerns."
2642,Sophers92,"December 1, 2019",4,I use it just about every day I hope we get more options for the paid content. Because all I want is the sleep info.

2647,RickG64,"September 12, 2019",2,Improvements made it worse One of the biggest reasons for buying a Fitbit was to track my sleep.  I liked that it showed time slept and time awake or restless.  The total average time sleeping for the week was also helpful.  The new sleep score is useless. I could care less about the score.  I now find myself having to convert my sleep times to minutes then dividing by 60 then dividing again by 7 to get my average sleep time. 
2648,LanieRegan,"September 11, 2019",1,Love my Fitbit...hate the new updated dashboard/interface This new update that recently happened is garbage. I have had nothing but issues with syncing and logging my food. It is slower and not as user friendly as the previous interface. I hate the new sleep score as well. I have been logging onto my computer rather than the app in order to view my activity and log my food. I seriously hate the new update. Others Fitbit users I have spoke to have had similar issues and are unhappy about new update! Please fix this Fitbit?
2649,LittleMilligan,"August 26, 2019",2,New interface more complicated I just opened the app to sync my device and the interface changed. It added this thing called Discover where you now have to go to see you exercise stats. You used to be able to get here from the opening screen. Now the opening screen is called Today with less information. I hate this interface. Please return to the previous one. It is less complicated and requires fewer clicks without stupid stock photos.

I hope you guys can do something.

I have to add up all my steps by hand and keep track of day to month step. I do like that it does by the week but it should keep track of how many steps you have taken for the whole month. Would make it easier than me writing down all my steps and add them all up when I should be able to open the and be able to see total steps for month

Also, my Aria 2 has disappeared from the app twice & I have had to re-add it to my phone. Makes trying to stay healthy very frustrating. Going to have to download another fitness app to record my food & stay on track until Fitbit gets this issue resolved."

If all you want it for is to track your steps it works fine, but a pedometer would work just as good for much cheaper. The challenges with friends are useless because my steps don‚Äôt update correctly to the challenge board. My water intake doesn‚Äôt save from one day to the next. Nor do the calories. Pretty much useless at this point."

I work nights so the sleep function is extremely important to me to see how much/kind of sleep I am getting.

This seems like a bug fix to me but it has significantly changed my opinion of Fitbit and customer service since I have been told there‚Äôs nothing that can be done about it and my device is ‚Äúdefective‚Äù (even though this only started happening after I updated the app...).
2804,mihbdufksb,"August 27, 2019",3,I liked it more before the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù graphics The app works great but the new graphics are small and kind of ugly compared to the original clean and open look. I know it‚Äôs subjective but in my singular opinion the new look creates anxiety where the previous version was much more relaxing to see. It‚Äôs amazing how much an image can shift your mood. I think it‚Äôs already time to come up with a new look and ditch the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù.

The only major thing I believe the app needs is your daily total or where you are at with your protein, carbs, and fat. You are able to see it on the website but not the app so switching over is a lot when I‚Äôm doing it multiple times a day. Other then that it is a 5 star app!"

My heart rate is all over the place. Not sure about that. The sleep record is helpful but again not sure of the accuracy. Sometimes it records as light sleeping when I'm reading.

Not only was it eventually forced upon me, even after selecting ‚ÄúNo‚Äù when prompted whether to switch, but it also hid / rearranged some of the core features (ie silent alarm), and added annoying advertising / tips / spam pop ups. The only reason I‚Äôve given 2 stars instead of 1 is because technically it is still capable of syncing with my Versa."

2994,Its_all_about_fre,"April 12, 2019",5,"So happy to have a Fitbit I enjoy my Fitbit a lot. One thing that bothers me is trying to get it to charge. For some reason it‚Äôs hard for me to align the prongs with the back of the watch. Also, I wish bootcamp and elliptical were options already programmed on the watch but besides that I have no other complaints."
2995,Mauch5,"April 12, 2019",5,"Great but I wish it could do more things This is a great app. And I love it. I wish it could do more things such as give you reminders when to drink more water, if you are trying to. There are some other things that I wish it could do, but other than that it is a wonderful app."
2996,Honeydrops18,"April 17, 2019",4,"Still my best fitness app to date Since the glitch was fixed, I've enjoyed the fitbit versa and particularly like that it can pick up on the fact that you're walking as exercise (though it didn't work on my 15 min jog this morning). I like that I can track my monthly cycle amongst other things in it, looking forward to other innovations."
2997,tjr66,"April 24, 2019",2,New Fitbit open message is real annoying The latest upgrade gives us a new ‚Äòfeature.‚Äô When you open the Fitbit app to sync and then shut down the app you get this new message upon closing: ‚ÄòOpen Fitbit  to keep your data synchronized.‚Äô Who thought this was a good idea? I am sure it has something to do with location tracking etc...I don‚Äôt care. I rarely write reviews but was compelled to write about this.  Give us the option to suppress please.
2998,Kimgale,"April 25, 2019",5,"Love Fitbit I have 2 Fitbit models and my husband has one also. We follow a weight loss program and love that their app syncs with our Fitbit to help us track our activity. We have the Charge 3, Alta, One and the Aria scale. We‚Äôve never had any issues with any of them. They‚Äôre easy to use just a great tool to help us get healthier."
2999,JoVT27,"May 20, 2019",3,Syncing reminders on exit Love my Fitbit charge 2 but the latest app update is annoying. I close my apps regularly. I don‚Äôt need a reminder every time I try to close the app. It keeps saying keep open to sync. I can sync when I want but don‚Äôt need a reminder every time.  Also would like a feature to Only get reminders when using app not all the time!! Guess I‚Äôll turn notifications off.
3000,RoxanneTessner,"January 19, 2019",5,Keeps Me Moving I love my Fit Bit Charge 2. I find myself now very aware of getting up and moving! I also love the fact that it syncs with my Weight Watchers app and tallies my activities and steps for the day. I also find that I am more aware of getting my daily water intake completed. It‚Äôs a huge thumbs up for me!!
3001,westcststruttin,"January 20, 2019",2,"Water consumption change When it works it‚Äôs great. When... The most unstable app of all smart watches. Just doesn‚Äôt work well, consistently stops recording steps. Constantly have to delete it & reload to get it to work. Two days of deleting Bluetooth ionic connection, deleting app & reloading... all the tricks to get app to sync to ionic. Been like this since I got ionic (replaced once too). Bigger question, ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt Fitbit fix this? Why are we expected to get inferior service as consumers?‚Äù"
3002,white2018,"January 20, 2019",4,It‚Äôs great I‚Äôm really enjoying the Fitbit. It‚Äôs awesome it motivates me to get my steps in for the day. the only thing that I don‚Äôt really like is when you‚Äôre in a challenge and you have to wait on the other person to sync in order to see where they‚Äôre at with their steps. I think It should do an automatic sync every 30 minutes or something.
3003,rosiek2277,"January 21, 2019",5,"Love it! I‚Äôve been a dedicated fitbit user for the last 2 years. It‚Äôs one of the best tools I use for my health. I‚Äôm a runner, HIIT trainer and yoga novice. I use it to gauge my effort and calories burned. My only complaint is I wish we could go smaller rather than bigger on the watches. I‚Äôm a Charge 2 user but I wish the same features came in the alta."
3004,fitbit for lyyyfe,"January 25, 2019",5,Will never leave Fitbit! One of my most used apps! Been w Fitbit since their first fitness wristband and would never consider leaving!

3005,Gr8fulrauch,"January 26, 2019",5,Does What I need to do. I like to sleep tracker. I didn‚Äôt realize I was not getting as much sleep as I thought. The heart monitor is great. I like that I can track all the steps I take while I‚Äôm playing with my kids. I usually leave my phone on the fireplace mantle so it was never tracking any movement when playing.
3006,PollyKPgh,"January 26, 2019",4,"Could be excellent if... It won‚Äôt let me back track to make food entries if I don‚Äôt do it before midnight.  If I do, it makes the entry the same for the next day.  If I try to back track and make entries, the same thing happens.  Also, too many foods made up by other people who are trying to make up it cheat on their daily intake mixed in with real calorie counts."
3007,BKSHELLY718,"January 28, 2019",5,GREAT MOTIVATION This app is a great motivation to stay focused on your health goals particularly with staying on the move throughout the day. It provides hourly reminders throughout the work day to get and move if you‚Äôve been behind your desk a little too long. The Fitbit friends challenge is super fun and competitive way to motivate each other!
3008,autodilla,"January 30, 2019",4,"All good on watch,l app spins I‚Äôm a soccer referee. Yesterday with a charge 3 I press exercise and run. Watch says cannot find, open app. So I hurry get phone back out of bag and open app thinking ok, but app is spinning. I look at watch and it still says cannot find. I had already put watch up & have to go on with the match. I get back to my bag and I have 1% battery. I shut app down. Not good"
3009,Niksecret,"February 11, 2019",5,"Keeps me on track and avoid surprises I love using the app for my sleep, overall steps, and period tracking! Hours slept helps me gage what amount I truly need to feel energized. Steps - keeps me moving to meet my step and fitness goal. Period tracker helps me avoid surprises especially when planning future events."
3010,LJ0099457,"July 16, 2018",5,"App is working great again! So glad the food-logging bug was fixed! The app works great again. I‚Äôve been using it religiously to log food intake, exercise, etc... by doing so, I was able to lose 20 pounds in 5 months, and get in much better shape. "
3011,jennscott91,"August 7, 2018",5,Love it!! It‚Äôs easy to use and keeps me motivated. It helps me push myself to go a little further and choose my snacks more carefully. One improvement I‚Äôd like to see is an addition of new challenges. Some new trails in other parts of the country would be really nice. Aside from that this is my favorite weight loss app!!!
3012,CForbes#1,"October 25, 2018",3,"Happy but unhappy I love my Fitbit, but lately I have been having issues with active minutes. For example, today I walked for 21 minutes which showed on my watch, but when I opened the app it showed 13 minutes which is what my watch now shows.  I also have a problem with it accurately keeping up with the number of stairs I climb each day. I hope this issue is resolved soon."
3013,Swampmiester,"December 11, 2018",4,"Still learning Have been using my Ionic for about 2 months and I‚Äôm still learning where things are. I can say the movements aren‚Äôt very fluid. More of a choppy feel. Often the touchscreen registers a touch but doesn‚Äôt do anything so I repeat step functions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it does everything I need very well, but for the minor operations I do the ionic should do them smoother."
3014,Crouching Tiger 2,"December 11, 2018",5,Charger HR This is a wonderful fitness wearable. It allows you to stay totally connected throughout the day on what you are trying to achieve.  On top of everything else is that it was easy to set up and start using it. 
3015,Quyen1225,"December 28, 2018",4,"Good app It has many nice features. My only complaint is it would be nice if the app actually tracked both sides of the messages. It only shows the messages you receive, it does not show my responses. Kind of weird, especially if you‚Äôre like me and sometimes forget if you responded to a message.  Overall, a good app that I would recommend."
3016,mtzfpx,"December 31, 2018",3,Change Charge 3 I have relied on Fitbit for years. It helps me keep track of all my key health factors except calorie intake. Get your smart guys to figure out how to do that for me. But my real irritant is Charge 3. I used to be able to rearrange the readings on my Fitbit but Charge 3 won‚Äôt let me do that. And I want to get rid of a bunch of info it displays that I don‚Äôt care about. I have a cell phone for messages. I don‚Äôt need or want my watch doing that.
3017,HWAlum,"January 6, 2019",5,Part of my everyday life! I use this app every single day and it has helped me to develop positive habits. I bought it for the step count but quickly started Tracking the quality of my sleep. Now I am using the water tracker and I recently purchased the connected scale. Love love love and highly recommend.
3018,MamaBearof01,"January 9, 2019",4,Record My Steps I am between 3 & 4 stars.  It does record my Steps well.  
3019,Filbert365,"January 12, 2019",5,"Five years and counting I‚Äôve been a fan of counting steps, tracking weight, and what you eat for years. Great to have it in one easy to use app. Love that it sync‚Äôs with a number of my other tracking devices and app. Hate that they did away with the One tracker. Hope they bring it back."
3020,Rebel051214,"January 29, 2018",4,"Almost 5 stars, just one problem!!!!! The app is incredibly user friendly and very functional my only complaint is that sexual inter course doesn‚Äôt count as an exercise nor does kissing. However driving and shooting do. Seriously you mean to tell me that you have more people listing shooting as an exercise than would list sex. Somehow I doubt that."
3021,surfthecure,"January 31, 2018",1,"Not accurate at all I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app or the watch. I walked on the treadmill for 45 minutes and did 2.88 miles with my watch on, yet according to the app it says I only walked for 30 minutes and completed only 0.2 miles. When it comes to the steps, I‚Äôll take let‚Äôs say 10 steps and it will only record 5. While on the treadmill I watch the tracker like a hawk and there are a lot of times that the number of steps don‚Äôt change yet I‚Äôm still walking. Maybe I have a dud, I don‚Äôt know... but I don‚Äôt recommend it."
3022,cortbrooke7,"February 17, 2018",5,Loved my Fitbit but... Loved my Fitbit but was given an Apple Watch as a Christmas gift. Really wish there was an app where I could use my Apple Watch to still compete with my family and friends who have Fitbits. I would be willing to pay for the app and I know others that would as well. Please consider it!
3023,ThatOne1010,"February 28, 2018",5,Great Motivation I purchased the Fitbit so I could track my steps and with the app I can track a lot more than that. I track my workouts and see how many minutes my heart rate is in cardio level or fat burn. I track my sleep at night. So far this is great and a great motivator to continue to keep moving
3024,Abc5798,"March 12, 2018",5,Love it! So far so good.. I love that it‚Äôs slim and comfortable. I‚Äôve had this charge last for almost 5 days and I have been wearing it constantly. Sometimes it takes a moment for the app to sync but that‚Äôs to be expected. I also love the bands are interchangeable.. perfect for those who don‚Äôt want one of the bigger ones
3025,sn0w10n,"May 4, 2018",1,"Unacceptable Ever since weeks app takes about half an hour to sync with the fit bit and constantly freezes!!! First I thought it‚Äôll be late on an update and it‚Äôll be fixed...it has been about 2 months and it‚Äôs still not working correctly! The watch is awesome but the app is lacking functionality. And now after the recent update it says device not connected to device and to turn on the Bluetooth, while the Bluetooth is on and the app is not connecting to the device ."
3026,Anonymous150,"May 14, 2018",3,"Used to be great...until update My Fitbit and app worked great until  a recent update. Now it won't give me any minutes of exercise for auto detected exercise on the individual listing. For example, it says I did an of outdoor biking wedding n the dashboard, but then on the exercise (which is what my work incentive program looks at) it says "" 0 of 0 active minutes.""  I have an iPhone 5c. Maybe they don't support it anymore?"

I was logged out of the app randomly, and when I try to log back in I get a message saying my account is pending deletion. When I click recover the error message just says oops something went wrong.

3028,Jeannie marie 12,"July 15, 2018",4,Fitbit versa I wish with the clock faces that they would have a folder for the watch faces you have selected and used before. If I have used it and liked it sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find again. Also it would be nice if there was a folder for the ones that were free. You search and search then find one you like and it isn‚Äôt free
3029,Disappointed Fitbiter,"July 16, 2018",3,Buggy It has been working fine until recently. It won‚Äôt let me log some food items and other items are completely wrong. I‚Äôll put in strawberries and it‚Äôll list granola instead. Very confusing. Not sure what to do with this. I liked using the food tracking with the steps and HR to give me a comprehensive look into my daily activity/food/etc but it‚Äôs not really working so...
3030,ProfCrash,"November 1, 2017",1,"Awful App The app works poorly and the overall support is poor. The number of exercises you can choose is limited, for example there is no spin class option or anything for a abs class. The food tracking tool is poor. You cannot easily add a recipe and then choose a portion size. I have to remove the app and redone load it weekly because it stops syncing. This is probably the last Fitbit I buy. I want something that doesn‚Äôt require downloading other apps to be able to fully use the device."
3031,fraustrated customer,"December 1, 2017",2,"Sync not working with iPhone 7 I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs the iPhone issue or new iOS software issue or the app issue. My Fitbit charge 2 works smoothly for syncing with iPhone SE. I can turn off my Bluetooth and turn it back on. The sync works great. But since I update a iPhone 7, if I turn off my Bluetooth, it is very difficult to syncing again after I turn my Bluetooth back on. I tried reinstall app or remove and reconnect the device. But still not working."
3032,Deborah's Iphone,"December 13, 2017",3,Bugs I‚Äôm hoping this update fixes a couple of issues. Some days it doesn‚Äôt show in the history that I met my goal. It may skip a day or more even though it is syncing with my device. 
3033,Cinemabuff,"April 24, 2020",1,"Worst app in the world This app is the pits. Every 3 or 4 days, I have to delete the app from my iPad and my fit bit charge 3 from my Bluetooth list because the app can‚Äôt find my Fitbit even though it is right next to my iPad. Furthermore, even though I have it on all day sync, it won‚Äôt sync unless I open the app. When I had a Fitbit one, it synced every time my iPad or iMac was on without my having to open the app. I don‚Äôt know if I hate the app or my Charge 3, but I am greatly disappointed with the way the syncing does not work."

The main screen where you can log workouts, water, food...ect, keeps freezing up. You can‚Äôt open any of the sub folders (water, workouts..). The only way to fix this is to delete the app and download it again. This is very inconvenient especially when you are about to start a workout. "
3035,ManhattanMama,"March 31, 2020",1,"Horrible Customer Service I got a Charge 3 for Christmas. It does not display notifications properly. The customer support group has told me over and over how to resync and set up the device. It was 2 months old when I first went to them. They would rather waste their time, and mine, for over a month than replace a defective device. The device retails for about $150. Yet they‚Äôd rather lose a long time customer and pay multiple employees, to try and prove I am incompetent rather than simply replace a bad device. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
3036,Jenh2531,"March 2, 2020",1,"Latest update cause sync issues? Last update is HORRIBLE. After the most recent update my app shows logged exercise at the right time but calculates it 8 full hours off.  None is the standard ‚Äòfixes‚Äô have corrected this glitch.  Example: if I log treadmill at 8:00 PM it will actually add steps to the wrong day because it adds them at 4:00 AM the next day. Had to use computer login to figure this out, wish you‚Äôd push another update to fix because it is extremely frustrating for tracking."

Today I‚Äôve had to delete the app twice and re-download it and I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll work this time. The first time, I deleted it because no matter what I did, it wouldn‚Äôt sync with my Fitbit. Tonight I deleted it because it keeps saying my username/email or password are wrong (they‚Äôre not).

I‚Äôm really sick of scanning everything for a PB&J every time and other meals. The custom option isn‚Äôt easy , and you lose all the nutrition info unless you put it in yourself.

More people have it so all your friends can compete and motivate each other. Also it is clear on how to add info into and usually syncs to a lot of Bluetooth devices and apps.
3067,ImJustOkay,"April 1, 2019",5,"Versatile I like being able to track my heart rate, time asleep, caloric intake, weight, water intake and menstrual cycle all in one place.

It is eerily accurate for me."

I can spend an hour in the gym and then get a prompt immediately after, that it‚Äôs ‚Äútime for a stroll!‚Äù - either I have a dud or it‚Äôs just not a very good device.

The reminders to get up and move every hour help a lot during the workday and it‚Äôs great to have something on your wrist to keep track of runs instead of a phone.

You scan items for the correct item to come up but the nutritional information is wrong. Then when you go to their information forums their fix to the problem is telling people they need to make sure they didn‚Äôt select the wrong food database and to use another app. So if you buy a Fitbit just ignore this app and use myfitnesspal for logging food because the Fitbit app is a joke.

3138,kellymcphan,"July 9, 2019",1,"The update is trash So the update seems to have screwed up the algorithm. I burned 2K calories for the day after my workout. Went to log my workout, and somehow Fitbit reduced my calories burned based on some inaccurate calculation? The whole reason I paid for the HR tracker was to have accurate calorie measurement. If the heart rate tracker says I burned 2K, that‚Äôs what I burned, not whatever formula you‚Äôre using says. "

3143,ibeanthony01,"February 6, 2019",4,Good but not great The food tracking section of this app is not good. There were issues tracking food that was eaten regularly was really a challenge and though reported to Fitbit nothing was ever done. The resolution ended up being to use MyFitnessPal. Maybe the answer is to remove this section of the app and only report the calories from MyFitnessPal?

3147,Mantorney,"February 25, 2019",5,Love the app almost as much as I love the Fitbit device I‚Äôve used the app since getting the device two years ago.

Sometimes it all goes through fine. I‚Äôve tried to choose other selections of the same food, just to see, and the same erratic behavior occurs."

It could be useful to incorporate being able to add/edit workouts to your profile activities. It registered me being active but not working out. It also doesn't sync very often.

3171,Otupaca,"November 7, 2017",3,"Glitchy When it works, it‚Äôs fine. Unfortunately, post iOS 11, the app never syncs two consecutive days in a row.

Super annoying but I like to see how I‚Äôve slept so it‚Äôs my only option.  Otherwise it gets stuck mid-sync in an endless loop.

3211,Fitloca,"February 26, 2019",5,I love this and all the motivation I love this app mainly because of the community that invite you to the challenges also the app does wonders tracking your period and sleep.

3212,I can't even send this critic,"March 2, 2019",1,"Unreliable Many times while reading in bed or when looking at my Fitbit in bed, the Fitbit says I‚Äôm asleep. Even watching TV at night it says I‚Äôm sleeping. If I don‚Äôt manually tell it that I‚Äôm awake it will not record accurately when I wake up,.  Also the pulse reading is not very accurate when I compare it to my doctors blood pressure machine.  I can see why The Applewatch is getting all the attention.  You won‚Äôt be in business very long if you don‚Äôt keep up with the competition.  Sorry to be so blunt.  I would like to see you succeed."

A lot of my friends have Apple Watches with the same fitness capabilities but I refuse to give up on my fitbit community! I love my fitbit and fitbit app!! the challenges keep me motivated and the first thing i do every morning is sync my sleep. I ‚ù§Ô∏è my fitbit charge 2!!
3214,Nashville Culross,"March 12, 2019",1,"Sync problems From week to week there seems to be more syncing issues. Whether it takes forever to sync or it doesnt sync, performance is lacking. Typically I like the smoothness of the app and how easy it is to log food. Only upgrade other than that would be being able to measure macros on a gram basis rather than percentage of daily intake. Gram goals for macros are more precise and I would like to keep up with that in this app. If those two things were fixed would consider this 4-5 stars easy."

Customer support was uncooperative, uninterested in resolution, and unwilling to help for almost a month.

After 3 weeks and 5 calls to supervisors the security team restored my account."

When I manually log my walk as exercise the app then proceeds to delete my active minutes and steps from the walk!!! So annoying!!!

I‚Äôve been having this problem for a year now and no bug fixes have addressed it. My steps are all in my Health app but somehow can‚Äôt make it to the Fitbit app? I don‚Äôt understand."

So it‚Äôs really not doing me any good but to keep time and see emails.  I really wanted to love my Fitbit blaze but I‚Äôm not. I can‚Äôt even find my receipt to return it.

3317,Elk Grove Red Sox Fan,"June 16, 2018",1,"Used to be great, until recent update After recent update, it no longer auto tracks exercise. There‚Äôs no way to manually enter it while still keeping your step count accurate. For example, if I take an hour long walk, it counts my steps, but does not log it as exercise. If I try to manually enter the walk, it will increase my step count. Tried to contact customer service, but have not received a response. It‚Äôs so frustrating. Why fix what ain‚Äôt broke? The app was great until the update."
3318,Akilla21man,"June 16, 2018",4,"Great app but... I like the Fitbit app but it does not allow you to edit incorrect data, clear daily logs in the event you have errors. And I see users have been asking for that feature since 2014."
3319,bobbi632,"July 13, 2018",2,"It‚Äôs OK when it actually works properly But the app regularly bombs on food logging - some things you will see entered for 2-3 seconds before they simply disappear, others change to something else (i.e. I have tried to enter my morning yogurt 4 times, able to select from the menu fine, however once it saves the log reports it as an ice cream sundae instead).

3323,Lexivh,"October 25, 2017",2,"Unreliable I have had the app/a fitbit on and off for about 3 years. The app works pretty well until it just stops. Then you have to begin the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the app until it will sync with the Fitbit again. There are also multiple bugs, such as ‚Äúlosing days‚Äù if you get your 10,000 steps after midnight (working the 7pm-7am shift at the hospital this happens a lot), or losing all data when updates are installed."
3324,Al4132,"November 17, 2017",1,"Garbage This app is total garbage. drains your battery and it constantly glitching out. ‚ÄúContact customer support‚Äù feature doesn‚Äôt work, impossible to find help with issues.

But Fitbit could take a cue from Jawbone that had a stopwatch feature that could be activated through the app to time an activity, any activity, that can be manually labeled later. The only reason I switched to Fitbit is because my Jawbone broke and the company went under. Otherwise, Fitbit would never have my business as Jawbone was much more user friendly for lifters."

It doesn‚Äôt pull him from my contacts - in fact it shows me only my contacts who are not on Fitbit which makes me think something is wrong with the app. I can‚Äôt add him through email either and it won‚Äôt connect to Facebook.

So pay hundreds of dollars for the watch, download the app and you‚Äôre set, right? Absolutely not. Fitbit expects more money to unlock much of the data your newly purchased watch collects. The poor rating isn‚Äôt because the app is terrible it‚Äôs because it is used to fleece their customers (you and me) out of more money. Do yourself a favor, do plenty of research and pick any  smart watch/ health tracker not named Fitbit."

3908,Windmuse,"February 6, 2018",5,"More step info I love it, but I‚Äôd like to be able to keep track of how many steps I‚Äôve taken during an hour. Sometimes I‚Äôm busy and it‚Äôs very inconvenient to catch up on steps in the 10 minute window given by the app. Otherwise it‚Äôs super!"
3909,GwennaElle,"February 19, 2020",2,"What Happened?!? I‚Äôve used various Fitbits for years. Whatever ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù they made are just terrible. It‚Äôs buggy and often not recording my entire night of sleep, it takes forever to refresh, and the pop-ups for ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù tick me off. I already dropped hundreds of bucks for your product over the years. Now you‚Äôre wanting MORE? "
3910,aprlshwrs,"February 16, 2020",2,"Not Syncing I am disappointed as the app no longer syncs with my versa. As of two days ago, the screen stopped shutting off on my versa so I had to do a factory reset. Now that I‚Äôve done that, it won‚Äôt sync. So...I can‚Äôt get my clock face with all of my stats back. What happened, Fitbit? This is the first time I‚Äôve ever had any issues with your product. No one has time to factory reset their watch 4-5 times. Please fix this!"
3911,Kitteneyez,"January 15, 2020",3,"Won‚Äôt receive alerts I was really looking forward to using my new Fitbit charge 3 and being able to receive message alerts from my phone. Unfortunately, no matter what I do, alerts are not going through. Also disappointed that I need to have a second app for the stats to sync to health app on my phone. "
3912,Heylola2,"January 2, 2020",1,I hate the new update It looks awful compared to the previous version. I have no idea why they changed it but it‚Äôs not better at all. Please put it back!!
3913,JHOIII,"December 25, 2019",1,Just about over with Fitbit Every Fitbit I have owned has failed after a year and a couple after less than a year. Presently my Charge 3 won‚Äôt sync. Quite upsetting as I really like Fitbits. I had the first one they made and several since this one. The Charge 3 first quit displaying Notifications. Then it stopped syncing. There is no way to force it sync so now it is just a bracelet. I am done with them. If I wanted an expensive bracelet it would have diamonds and be made of gold not plastic.
3914,L Terrazas,"December 19, 2019",1,"Verry disappointed with recent update versa 2 The last update 12/15 or 16th they updated the fit bit and my wife warned me that they usually mess up the watch once an update comes in, but I didn‚Äôt listen. The update went through and now I can no longer reply from my watch and good luck in getting customer support since it seems to go in circles. So, they sell a product with certain features and then take them away with no process for support. SAD"
3915,hi5283629,"November 28, 2019",2,Bad Quality Watch I have only had my watch for 10 months. I have started to have issues with the app and my watch. Since it is Black Friday I am think about switching to Apple Watch. It is a better quality. The steps on Fitbit are always off. For example I could clap and my watch would count it as a step. My watch has been laggy and glitchy. All I am saying is that Fitbit you  need to step up your game.
3916,Lindsey8841,"October 23, 2019",5,Thank you! Thank you for adding in the macro grams at the mobile app level!!! This is the change I‚Äôve been waiting for that has now made this app essential to my fitness lifestyle! No longer interested in Apple Watch with this update. :)
3917,Tookie Clothespin,"October 7, 2019",1,"Bad update I just noticed the whole layout of the dashboard has changed. There is way less information available at a glance now because everything is color coded to the category. I feel like I need to scroll more than I did before, which may or may not literally be true, but it‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs also EXTREMELY slow. It takes more than a second to switch days and have the dashboard refresh the information. I‚Äôm not impressed."
3918,imadokichild490,"October 7, 2019",1,New update is terrible. My watch isn‚Äôt syncing and the time is now 90 min behind. Come on. I‚Äôm very disappointed and it‚Äôs an all around issue not just with me. I‚Äôm in a ton of groups and the people with Versas are all agreeing their watches aren‚Äôt working or syncing. Update again please! Fix this?
3919,frustrated/almost lost my mind,"September 18, 2019",2,"iOS change then my phone won‚Äôt recognize fitbit. I love my fitbit & app but this is the second time that my phone has gotten iOS update then my app won‚Äôt recognize my device. My iPad luckily links up just fine for a temporary fix, but these IT ppl need to get it together. Online lots of people have this problem and some ppl are saying they‚Äôll never get fitbit again. Please fix this so I don‚Äôt have to switch."
3920,CrazyLAGrl,"May 30, 2019",1,"Was great, now disappointing This used to be such a great app. The colorful pictures you see today as examples are no longer valid. They changed the UI and made everything smaller and less relevant to regular user needs. Such a shame as I‚Äôve been a Fitbit user from the beginning having owned 5+ devices along the way and now I‚Äôm getting ready to transition to a competitor. Super disappointed at the change and the lack of response to the feedback in the communities as well."
3921,Light Up Please,"June 5, 2019",5,"Charge 3 face not lighting up! I love my Charge 3.  I just noticed that when I press the sides in on the Face of my Charge 3,  It does not light up! I cannot see the time or any of my results!  I know it is still working because my phone is picking up my steps etc. etc ... Help!"
3922,DLGuig,"September 11, 2019",1,UNHAPPY with new version I cannot find one thing I like better about the new version.  The main things I dislike are:
3923,Vlct0rB,"August 31, 2019",3,"Fitbit app design The app is great for function. However, the older version of the app used to look great and motivated me, especially when the whole screen turned green after hitting all the goals, but this version is like a huge step down in design kind of boring looking (sorry design team). I wish I could reinstall the older version."
3924,JDR 1952,"August 29, 2019",1,The new dashboard for iPhone I do not like the new dashboard and want the old one back. This is a regression from the old one. Completely inferior. You cannot see as much information without scrolling down. The colors are awful. Steps per hour is difficult to determine at first glance. Why is water so important that it is the second icon below Steps per hour. I cannot change the way the dashboard looks like before. I could go on and on. Please bring the former dashboard back.
3925,Krieger is a clone,"August 16, 2019",1,"Hate the redesign. I guess they were going for sleek or uncomplicated, but the new design looks like something that comes bundled with an offbrand fitness tracker, not the branded Fitbit app. It‚Äôs unintuitive and lacks the whimsy of the previous version (no more happy moon when you hit your sleep goals)."
3926,MaviesMom,"August 14, 2019",3,"Not as user friendly I just completed the latest update. The Alta is becoming harder to use, perhaps because they want me to buy a new device. lol You previously were able to set an alarm from the main screen now you have to backtrack several additional steps.  Perhaps when upgrading I should consider a different brand."
3927,Druskii124,"August 4, 2019",4,"Sleep Tracking I just bought my versa a couple days ago and the first night it tracked my sleep which I loved to see. But, the second night and every night since has not tracked my sleep. Other than that the Fitbit has been amazing but, sleep tracking needs fixing."
3928,outdoorlovingirl30,"June 28, 2019",2,"Bring back my old dashboard! I was dumb and clicked on the new dashboard button. I should‚Äôve known better. Everything is tiny, not laid out well and just in a list, harder to see everything and the graphics are terrible. I want the old dashboard back!!! This new one looks like a major downgrade and there is nothing new from the old one! Ugh!!! Why did you have to mess with a good thing?! Please give me back the old dashboard!!!!!"
3929,Ndotym13,"June 22, 2019",5,"Fitbit charge 3 I love the app it keeps me in tune, I don‚Äôt want to take it off I check it daily sometimes hourly it sends me my updates this is great it‚Äôll help me stay healthy and eat right I can‚Äôt wait for the update to see what‚Äôs going to change thank you"
3930,el khudder,"April 8, 2019",4,Title off gin Love iPhone display. Whole thing got a little twitchy and my wife had to organize update on phone but it worked. Sync a little slow to iPhone. Biggest effect was one watch back and my afib...daily pulse record got me off gin. Currently I like the sleep record the best (the heart lesion having apparently put a stop to the afib)
3931,robmdean,"April 15, 2019",5,Fitbit rocks! I have gone through 4 different models and it just gets better every time!  I have worn mine for the past 5 years and play with people all over the world!  I just wish we could be in more than ten races at a time.
3932,Bronx Blvd,"April 22, 2019",5,"Bronx Blvd Great app for getting feedback on weight loss, water intake, sleeping, heart rate and heart health and tracking exercise as well as steps. I highly recommend it and once you sync it to your phone you can get text messages and notifications! A great tool for keeping healthy!"
3933,Kelseycjim,"April 26, 2019",3,"Great, except for the horrible new notification. I am a big fan of Fitbit and this app. However, the newest update includes an annoying notification that pops up whenever the app is closed. The notification says ‚ÄúOpen Fitbit to keep your data synchronized‚Äù. Unfortunately, there is no way to turn this notification off."
3934,Sherrimiah,"May 4, 2019",5,"Versa I love my Fitbit!! It has totally changed my lifestyle. I work a very sedentary job and was shocked to see how few steps I was taking each day. At 58, I saw a heart attack just waiting to happen. My Fitbit has made me very aware and has helped push me into a much more active, healthy lifestyle."
3935,sunday mudder,"May 10, 2019",5,Helpful guidance When I
3936,tami carda,"May 13, 2019",5,This app is so helpful! I check the app every morning to see my how my sleep went. Through the day I check it to see where I‚Äôm at with my steps. I can use it to keep track of how much water I‚Äôm drinking and how I‚Äôm doing with my goal of weekly exercise.
3937,AllyR8848,"May 15, 2019",2,"How about you fix the ‚Äúpace‚Äù bug? So irritated that for workouts such as ‚ÄúWeights‚Äù or ‚ÄúCircuit Training‚Äù that one of the main stats displayed is ‚Äúpace‚Äù. Really? The walk that the Fitbit picked up automatically shows calories, but the two above shows pace. Absurd."
3938,gummyh,"May 17, 2019",3,Ok It does what it is designed to do; motivate.
3939,Lilly LR,"May 20, 2019",5,"Love when it celebrates I love when it celebrates after reaching my goal of 10,000 steps a day!  Also very helpful when I get a call or text and it vibrates.  I can‚Äôt hear very well so my family now likes it when I answer my phone all the time!"
3940,RVCLAYTON,"February 11, 2019",3,"Needs improvement This app needs improvement. The elevator rides throw off the stairs climbed tracking. When I am watching tv or reading at night, the tracker frequently says I am asleep but I am not. The food tracker doesn‚Äôt seem to have the ability to add personal recipe servings without adding every ingredient every time. This is very inconvenient. The rest of the app I really like."
3941,relynnmurphy,"February 14, 2019",5,"Fitbit Versa I absolutely love my Fitbit Versa.  I have always been a Fitbit supporter and the products keep getting better and better.  The fact that I don‚Äôt have to worry about a little rain, I can wash dishes in ease, I can sweat and swim in it makes it even easier in my extreme busy world."
3942,BSuccessful,"February 17, 2019",5,Very good app for tracking steps sleep and diet I have been using the app for over two years and it is great. The device was a little fragile at first but has improved a lot in the Charge 2 model.  Read the set up to learn how to use it better.
3943,MyMemaJ,"February 22, 2019",5,"Saving Lives Because of the heart rate tracker I was able to see my heart was beating to slow while resting, I went to the doctor to get my blood pressure medicine adjusted. On the other hand my sister‚Äôs heart rate and resting heart rate was to fast, she wouldn‚Äôt have known had she not had on her tracker."
3944,RDD Mom,"March 1, 2019",5,Keeping me moving Our son gave me my first Fitbit 6 months after a serious car accident I was in. The reminders each hour kept me moving and helped with my recovery. The challenges keep me going almost 2 years later!!!  Thanks.
3945,A.R.M.03,"March 24, 2019",4,Had it for years!!!! I have had this for about 6 years and I love it but I wish we could have different challenges like on holidays and with the charge 3 when you get a phone call that you could turn it off like the iPhone other then that I really like it and use it everyday!!!
3946,Cac121950,"March 25, 2019",5,Very useful and convenient I use the app to monitor my progress as well as friends. Works well and easy to use. Being able to clear old notifications and messages would be a nice improvement.
3947,2marsuccess,"March 25, 2019",5,"A very helpful App I use Fitbit everyday and find it very motivating to check my steps, my heartbeat and my sleep. I highly recommend the Fitbit. "
3948,Kimmerkeya,"March 29, 2019",5,"My new best friend Been wearing mine since 2015. Makes me accountable, reminds me when I need to move. Helps me with my blood pressure, I write down what I eat so I can be able to tell the doctor what I ate that day that my pressure spiked. I love seeing how many steps & stairs I‚Äôve accomplished. And I love the sleep app."
3949,adtdkd,"April 1, 2019",5,"Love it! I'm trying to be more active & the Fitbit really helps! It was easy to set up & use, & so far it has been quite accurate on everything.  It has made me much more aware of my activity level from day to day & motivates me to do more.  I'm so glad I got it!"
3950,peachfrombrooklyn,"January 23, 2019",4,"It can still use some work. Most of the features are decent. I dislike the family app as I don‚Äôt have children and don‚Äôt have the choice to remove it from my display panel. Also, it doesn‚Äôt accurately track stair climbing. I live in a walk up apartment (4th floor). It doesn‚Äôt seem to track this."
3951,Pollyglide,"January 25, 2019",5,Love the Zip I am very happy with the Zip. I really like the fact that it logs my total miles. Had battery issues & it was replaced three times. The last time I tried to set up the new Zip I was denied access to the website & cannot log into the app. Any fixes?
3952,NathanJD,"January 28, 2019",2,"Unreliable, Walled Garden Auth token seems to be lost every 2 weeks or so which is obnoxious for those of use who use strong passwords with a password manager."
3953,Laura42431,"January 29, 2019",3,Notifications not working Since the last update my notifications for this app aren‚Äôt working correctly. I keep getting an alert that I have a new message that I‚Äôve already read. It keeps popping up and no other new notifications come in like before. Also the fake profiles are getting old. We don‚Äôt like to be harassed.
3954,Skirts2,"February 2, 2019",5,"Great app for motivation Love the app.  I walk more, exercise more, and feel like doing more even though exercise is the one thing ‚ÄúI love to hate.‚Äù Who really likes to exercise.  I just know exercise is good for me and I feel better after I do it, just not while I am doing it."
3955,megankiller89,"February 5, 2019",1,"I don‚Äôt even want to give it 1 star it‚Äôs so bad My Fitbit has not been synching automatically with the app. I have spoken with several Fitbit help aids, but to no avail. Meanwhile, all of my precious data is being lost. It‚Äôs way too expensive to fail like this. It has been 5 weeks since it has properly synched. I saved and saved and saved for this device- it was a lot of money for me to spend on myself. It is honestly devastating to lose this data and the cost of this stupid device."
3956,S. Cody,"February 7, 2019",5,Liking My Fitbit I really like the flex2 because I can wear it in the swimming pool. This is my third one my first one was lost in a fire my second one I had it on one of those magnetic holders and I lost it while I was out walking. Hey the Fitbit is the best thing that keeps me motivated and love the work challenges.
3957,rolling oaks,"February 9, 2019",5,"Fitbit Really enjoy following my daily stats. The sleep monitoring is awesome and I check it out every morning. I use the exercise app three times a week when at the gym, following my daily step progress is cool and keeps me moving to make my daily goals. Love my Fitbit :)"
3958,Black Eagle 7,"February 9, 2019",5,"Tyree I think the Fitbit app  and the Fitbit watch are both fantastic. I‚Äôve had it for years and it‚Äôs been great and giving me an update status on my walking, exercise, sleep habits as well as many many other things.

3960,Creating Synapses,"December 14, 2018",4,KM I really like the fit bit app but I think the tracking of the menstrual cycle ought to be an option. A good percentage of your users no longer have menstruated cycles or are just not interested in that personal information being on the internet. This could free up a significant portion of the app for a more desirable option.
3961,Pitt Brit,"December 15, 2018",5,"Fitness motivation I‚Äôve often considered purchasing a different type of fitness tracker; however, I love the Fitbit app and the graphs to keep track of exercise over time. For those who want to use the food diary, the labels are actually verified rather than ‚Äúuser entered foods.‚Äù"
3962,Lazy Nana,"December 20, 2018",5,Best gift ever Enjoying my Fitbit very much. It has kept me motivated daily. Love that it is blue toothed to my cell. I also enjoy the friends connection. The Fitbit app is fabulous too. Keeping track of my calorie intake is also a great motivator. Checking on my daughters and cheering or even taunting them is too much fun.
3963,reeseeedog,"December 26, 2018",5,Fit They have excellent quality. They hold up so well I dropped it in water and on the ground but it still works so well. I will so recommend this product to you it is one of the things you will love so much and it makes you fit agin.

3966,Bo Barnett,"January 4, 2019",5,"Excellent I feel my Fitbit app is my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who communicates my every move to me!! I like the fact that I can gauge my daily fitness steps.

3967,JT0106,"January 7, 2019",5,Fun Fitness app I love this app because I like to see how I slept the night before as well as the challenges with friends! Sometimes more than others I get competitive with myself too and try to outdo myself from the day before. Overall just a great app!
3968,Shantell@23,"January 15, 2019",5,"In love!! I love the Fitbit, it has feel more happier to work out more and to watch what I eat.

3978,Cheri.c,"December 11, 2018",5,Highly recommend I'm pretty low maintenance and not interested in spending a lot of time in my phone. This app is easy to enter in my food choices and to see my activity levels and sleep patterns at a glance. It's been key in achieving my goal to lose weight.

The app loses login information constantly since iOS 11 and there is no way to keep it updated without continually opening and syncing the device.

4078,KAGANSAYS,"November 5, 2017",1,Evil They have made the Fitbit one nearly obsolete.   The device drains within 24 hours.    They have been telling people they are working on the problem for over a month.  If you can‚Äôt fix your own device in over a month you don‚Äôt want to fix it. You want us to move on to new devices that we don‚Äôt want.  This has been a great device and what they have done after they discontinued the unit is grossly unfair to the people who love the device.   Shame. Shame.  Shame.

4143,Dsivret,"March 2, 2018",3,Love my Fitbit except... The battery needs to be charged every other day. Does not stay charged up to 5 days as stated. Also the sleep portion shows I go to sleep 2 hrs after I go to bed. I know I‚Äôm not awake 2 hrs every night after I turn off the light and close my eyes. So I only really use it for my steps cause I don‚Äôt feel the other parts of the app are accurate.

4158,Shw_Confdence,"April 29, 2020",2,Pay twice! It‚Äôs extremely irritating that buying a Fitbit no longer gives you access to the complete app. Now you have to spend money on the Fitbit and pay them monthly if you want access to the whole app. And if you don‚Äôt? They constantly shove in your face that there are things you don‚Äôt have access to because you refuse to spend all your money with them.

4181,ms_t2d3,"May 16, 2019",3,Fitbit is a little off. My use of the Fitbit has been confusing. The Fitbit often says that I have reached the 250 steps for the hour but the app doesn‚Äôt give me credit for achieving the goal at the same time. It‚Äôs frustrating to be informed that you did reach your goal and not get credit for doing so; synchronization is not close enough for me.
4182,Joi11,"May 16, 2019",5,FITBIT I love this app because it is a visual way to see exactly what you are doing with your body.  It made me change the way I eat.

I have a Charge2 and since the update, when I get my Fitbit progress email, it has stopped counting the days that I don‚Äôt have time to open the app! It‚Äôs very disheartening to open it and see it only counted 15k of my steps when I have 5 days more logged on my Fitbit. This has made me come in last among my friends every week.

4196,Sandydad,"April 23, 2019",4,Better than most My wife and I gave each other Fitbit Versa watches and downloaded the app. It took care of other fitness apps we had had and filled in for others we were checking out. Our only complaint is that the watch-app connection drops out mid day

4422,Barf barf barf barf,"December 5, 2017",2,READ MY SUGGESTION You should incorporate a scanner that can scan food labels. This can monitor your nutrition. Not even the Apple Health app has it. They have it so you need to manually put in the amount of nutrients in everything you eat throughout the day. Utilize the phone‚Äôs camera to scan the food label so you save time and make it less of a chore. You can help users track their food choices and make suggestions!!!

I was wrong. This is a great piece of equipment that I would highly recommend to anyone. Thanks Fitbit for making me admit I can be wrong!"
4482,Emilioisiahalvarez,"February 1, 2019",5,Great app! Love my Fitbit! I love knowing that sometimes during a workout I feel sluggish and don‚Äôt go as hard my Fitbit will let me know by showing me how many calories I actually burned and I will just push myself harder the next workout.
4483,Moo-fasa,"February 7, 2019",4,"Despite app layout problems, still a wonderful resource The Fitbit app has greatly improved my motivation to better myself and develop healthier habits. Other than a few annoying glitches within the map of the app itself, I think it is a great complement to the Fitbit."
4484,jessicaann_jones,"February 13, 2019",4,"Love it But I‚Äôm having trouble with certain watch faces. I‚Äôve noticed that my watch doesn‚Äôt track steps per hour/sleep/etc with certain watch faces. Why is that? Other than that, everything is great. But tracking doesn‚Äôt work when I change the face. Hmm."
4485,Sassy lady 09,"February 14, 2019",5,My Fitbit I love the way my Fitbit keeps up with my steps and how I log my food and water intake. It also keeps up with my calorie counts.

4488,Stuffffffffffff,"February 18, 2019",1,Can only have one watch at a time Every time you switch between fitbit watches you have to go through the entire setup and lose your settings.  Pebble allowed you to have multiple watches set up and could select which one to connect to in the app.  Stupid inconvenient and not very user friendly.  You'd think a company would like people to have multiple of their product.  Apparently not fitbit.  Bring back Pebble.  Very disappointed.
4489,RhondaBG17,"February 19, 2019",5,"I love my Fitbit! I absolutely love my Fitbit! It is so nice to get that notification that I hit my daily goal, especially when the day flew by and I‚Äôd forgotten about my fitness goals! The only thing I wish the app could do, is let us label the silent alarms. Otherwise, awesome! Thank you!"
4490,Highlanderman05,"January 8, 2019",5,"Helpful app. I got my first Fitbit four years ago and downloaded the app. This event turned out to be an eye opening in terms of my sleep. Since then I‚Äôve used the app to log food, water, track sleep, and overall activity. Awesome app."
4491,darthren,"January 10, 2019",3,Great concept But I really hate how if I‚Äôm not wearing my Fitbit that it includes ‚Äúzero steps‚Äù in my daily average.I wish it would just not count that day because my average daily steps is way lower and completely inaccurate because of this. Of course I didn‚Äôt take zero steps. Am I not allowed to wear a different watch sometimes? Very frustrating.
4492,03789person,"January 13, 2019",5,Why I use fit bit I think fit bit is very cool because I can set alarms and track more than just my steps like I can track all the water I drink and the food I eat so I can stay fit. You should get fit bit to

4494,FitbitAlta_user,"January 23, 2019",4,Great app The app itself is great. The main goals are up front and center. Only thing I wish was a more zoomed in version of the calorie burn section to make it easier to see the calories burned durning particular areas of the day. Trying to click on the tiny lines is difficult.

4496,OahuGuy,"January 26, 2019",3,No VPN Do not try and use this App if you have an active VPN on your iOS Device.  It won‚Äôt work.  I have been using the FITBIT App for more than five years.  For privacy reasons I am running a VPN in the background on my phone.  This immediately killed the connection between my iPhone and the FITBIT App.  I do not have this problem with other Apps that I regularly use.

I am not sure what steps my versa is storing but I think it‚Äôs a bit disappointing especially since it‚Äôs giving me credit for things I didn‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs sad that after years of having my fit bits they are no longer accurate. So much money on a device that is no longer calculating data correctly."

4504,ps1811,"December 12, 2018",4,"Love my Fitbit, love the app I‚Äôve been a Fitbit user for years...since the original Fitbit came out. The app is easy to use and offers many tracking options. The only issue I‚Äôve ran into is syncing it with my other running app, but it may be an issue with the other app and not Fitbit."
4505,kersmom,"December 12, 2018",5,"Reliable, compact I love my FitBit One.  I‚Äôve had it 4 years and it‚Äôs been very reliable.  I wear it everyday so it‚Äôs a big plus for me that it isn‚Äôt obtrusive. It‚Äôs compact and easy to conceal in a pocket or on the waistband.  It logs my steps/stairs all day, ever day and this app lets me see my progress at a glance."
4506,good or bad or rad,"December 26, 2018",5,Love it!!! I love the Fitbit and the app. I just got my Fitbit but I love it!

I now look at the sides of water to see how many ounces in it! I love it!!!!
4507,DBS1981,"January 4, 2019",5,Won't Sync I loved this app when my Fitbit was new in January but I have since taken an IOS update and now it doesn't sync at all.  I have to manually sync and sometimes that doesn't work either.  I am very frustrated.
4508,Sperlia,"January 5, 2019",4,"Good tool I use it just to track steps and mileage and it‚Äôs easy to clip on and carry. Does about the same thing as my iPhone, which I usually carry, but it‚Äôs easier if I‚Äôm just walking from home. Got it for walking overseas when I usually have my phone turned off."
4509,aida545,"January 5, 2019",4,Great! I would give this up five stars if I had a smart sleep alarm. Many other apps have this ability. I would like to have a sleep alarm that wakes you up in your lightest stage of sleep- closest to your waking Up time. Please let me know if this can be done as soon as possible. Thank you.

4595,Rqnunez,"January 13, 2019",5,Useful This app is a part of my daily routine. I look forward to seeing how it analyzes my sleep and exercise. I also like how it syncs with MyFitnessPal when I am tracking my food intake. If you have a Fitbit you definitely need to use this app.
4596,Tuese1,"January 13, 2019",4,Posts and Chat I think you should be able to see the messages you‚Äôve sent to other people. Not just what they sent. Because I keep forgetting what I said to the other person when I‚Äôm chatting.

The device shows notifications is on but when I try to check it on the app it says I need to set it up. However it‚Äôs already set up. When I select set up and pair it just clocks not allowing me to even view the notifications settings. I have tried uninstalling the app. I have tried resetting the Fitbit and nothing works??
4601,BLGGEN16,"December 11, 2018",5,"Solid and Reliable The Charge HR hardware and software are a great combination for keeping track of exercising metrics and heart rate. Pleasure to use and support, although there is little need to use them, are always just a quick call or chat session away."

4606,lauurr_r,"December 18, 2018",5,Love!!! This app is so helpful and really keeps me on top of my game. I highly recommend. It's better than all those other food tracking apps and what not because this is the real deal and makes the most of your health journey!

Please fix this so I can go back to loving the Fitbit!"
4611,dmmunk,"June 7, 2018",2,"Buggy exercise log I like my Alta, but the app that pairs with it has problems. Specifically the logging of swimming is buggy and clearly gets the calculation wrong. I have noticed you can add one minute to your logged time and calories logged can be cut in half.

Why does Fitbit need to know where I am to monitor my activity? I don‚Äôt see a way of turning it off and it doesn‚Äôt seem to lessen over time. Had to turn off notifications because it would request access a few times a day without opening the app. Hello? Bullying shouldn‚Äôt be a strategy.

I wish the sleep and exercise and daily movements were the same style and at the top like they used to be. You cannot tell how well rested you were at a glance. I liked being able to see the pink vs blue. The new app takes forever to sync. And you must make sure to reconnect the Bluetooth after charging or it does not sync automatically like the old one.
