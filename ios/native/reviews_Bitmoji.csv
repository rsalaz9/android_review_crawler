0,grrrrr_sir,"March 13, 2020",5,"Hair I love this app! But there has been one issue that have been there for me and many other from the beginning. There are options for straight hair, kind of Wavy hair, and extremely curly/kinky hair. But there is not a single option for looser curls.  Afro texture is almost all there is, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. I‚Äôm glad they have so many options for those with super curly locks! But as a curly haired woman myself, everyone (a lot of girls) I‚Äôve met with the same hair texture as me have complained about this when it‚Äôs brought up. This includes every women in my family, we have been forced to use straight hair on our bitmojjis. And my god is it annoying that not one style of hair matches our incredibly common curly hair texture.  There is (being generous) maybe one hair option in-between straight/sight wave, and 4C kinky curls. Even just adding three or four generic options at different lengths in the very middle of wavy and kinky would make SO many people happier with the app.     If there were 4 groups of hair, moving from straightest to curliest, just to illustrate. Let‚Äôs say:    Straight. Wavy. Curly. Kinky.      There would be nothing for the curly category for women except maybe one hair style. Please make more hair!!!!!!!! I‚Äôve been waiting for it for years now! And am leaving this comment after silently just hoping for an update."
1,diany nails,"April 19, 2020",5,"Could improve but overall great app To be honest I really love this app but some things do bug me sometimes, I did see that you guys have different styles of Bitmojis and one of them is bitstrips. I have nothing against that style but why do they have more hair and the ability to have earrings? I hope you guys actually update the deluxe type because that would be great. I would also love it if you guys had accessories like necklaces, earrings, things like that maybe some chains you know get creative with it. Also I LOVE that we can now create our own outfits, I hope the clothing choice becomes bigger in the future but for now it‚Äôs really nice! I would love to see oversized sweaters and hoodies, more shoes and socks, high waisted sweatpants, skirts with patters, shirts with design on them, and basically just items that will make us look more fashionable and also let us express ourselves. now hats, they are really good believe me but I would love to see some bandanas in the ‚Äúbabushka style‚Äù or the new trendy look, clips, a plant cause aEsThEtIc, and some butterflies but again anything creative and fun is ok with me. That‚Äôs all I have to say but for now it‚Äôs a pretty good app keep up the great work! :)"
2,crawfishaquatics,"April 16, 2020",5,"Love it! But I would like to add some things I love bitmoji and so does my best friend. We use it all the time and love the new outfit update. I would just like to make a few suggestions on stickers and outfits. First, i use the YES MA‚ÄôAM soldier bitmoji ALL THE TIME and love it, so if you guys could keep it that would be awesome. Second, I would love if you could add a hair flip bitmoji because me and my friend do so many hair flip worthy things and we always wish there was a bitmoji for it! Third, could you guys add more shoes? I know that you just added more shoes but maybe some different styles and classy ones too. (I don‚Äôt think that 3 is necessary but I was just asking) Lastly, I would like to ask that you guys could make new shirts, and maybe a plaid one. The reason why I am requesting plaid is because I wear plaid all the time and wish that I could dress my bitmoji in the clothes I love to wear. I would also like if there could be swimsuit options that we could wear with shorts and whatever because being a swimmer, I do that a lot. I also would like to add more hair styles, I‚Äôm not too picky about that but just in general. I hope you take into consideration these few things and have a great day."
3,JD üòâ,"January 21, 2020",4,"It‚Äôs nice, but could use some upgrades! Bitmoji is a nice app. I think that it should let you customize your skin color, hair color, hair treatment color, and some other color stuff. I want to be able to customize my hairstyle. I also wish that you could customize the color of your makeup, clothing, and shoes. I think that chest size is another thing. They don‚Äôt have mine.... and I think that they just need more customizable things.  There should be more sweatshirt and coat options as well. They don‚Äôt have any options that I like. They should ask if you wanna customize your pants, and if you do, then they‚Äôll let you do it that. Shirt options is another thing. I don‚Äôt really like any of them. They‚Äôre way too simple, I want some more color options, and I want to be able to customize the length. I don‚Äôt want a full half top, but not a really long shirt. Or I want a VSCO shirt, a oversized top. I also want better looking shorts. I‚Äôm being picky, but it‚Äôs better then giving nothing at all. I also want more body type options. I‚Äôm going to be giving more of a review. But this is all for now. Maybe vans, the checkered, and shirts and stuff üòâ"
4,CerealGurl767,"November 28, 2018",4,"Great app!!‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞ Bitmoji is an amazing app! Weather you use it for SnapChat,Texting, whatever! I enjoy how you can customize your own little you. But there is so many ways that you could make bitmoji an even more amazing app! First off more fashion! There is already lots of clothes to choose from, but try to put even more in the app more frequently and that would be fantastic! Second, you should be able to customize even more, like your height, the length of your hairstyle, and have more options for breast sizes. Thirdly, you should be able to change the color of clothing. When I go to pick a different clothing item I want and it‚Äôs bright pink or some color that I don‚Äôt want I no longer want to wear that item, there should be an option to change the color of the clothing item. Finally, please consider being able to mix and match items, like have and an option to ‚Äòmix clothing‚Äô and select the items you want to mix. Please take this into consideration it and I would give it 5 stars, it would also make the app so much more amazing! But overall I totally recommend this app over any other, it is amazing!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
5,mbella2090,"July 17, 2019",3,"Men and Women come in all shapes and sizes! I love Bitmoji and have used it for years. My only issue with it is the limited body sizes and shapes. I hoped with the deluxe upgrade you would remedy this travesty but we‚Äôre already halfway through 2019 and from the chin down your Bitmoji editor is still failing to account for the majority of the population. You have 4 super skinny options and one ‚Äúplus-size‚Äù that could be mistaken for pregnant instead. As a large framed, hourglass shaped woman I find this incredibly disheartening. There are twenty different options for noses, chins, even ears, but when you finally get to body size you get 5?!? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more difficult to create clothing options for every size you offer, but I know I‚Äôm not alone in wishing my Bitmoji avatar reflected more of my real life curvyness. Read any women‚Äôs magazine today you‚Äôll be sure to find an article discussing how to dress for all the different body shapes. It‚Äôs time for Bitmoji to stop catering to a one size fits all market and start offering options for ALL the major body sizes. I would love to see you add options for Pear-shaped, Apple-shapes, Oval, Square, Triangle and hourglass body shapes plus different frame sizes as well. Please make this happen!!"
6,Limelight456,"June 29, 2018",5,"I love it but I have one suggestion. Bitmoji is such a great app. I love the new clothes, skin tones, accessories, etc. I love the new ‚Äúhair treatment‚Äù thing because so many girls have ombr√© balayage or colored hair in general. Everything is more diverse and you have many options. I have used Bitmoji for a long time now and I am obsessed. I recommend this to absolutely anyone and everyone. This is such a great app to have. Even if you don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My one suggestion is that I wish there was a section where you could create your own Bitmoji. Of course you customize your little person, but I don‚Äôt mean that. I mean, like if you can send a Bitmoji with a personalized message/pose/background. For example, for all the limelights, a Bitmoji that says ‚ÄúI said boom boom boom now lemme hear you say wayhoo!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúBoom boom boom‚Äù and a separate one that says ‚Äúwayhoo!‚Äù  Or for non limelights, a personal message that says something specific like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you later at the game.‚Äù Or whatever. Do you see my point? It would be nice to have a variety of Bitmojis ready and to be able to form your own."
7,kk_coolgirl,"December 7, 2019",4,"Needs Improving This app is really amazing and I love to use it whenever I text, on snapchat, or just to customize it just for fun. One really big thing that bothers me is for the hair, there is no option to put highlights. I feel like most people either have dyed or natural highlights which is why you should add it to the hair section. "
8,ü•≥ü§ì,"February 14, 2019",4,"Amazing app! üòÅ I think this app is good, but there still could be some improvements. First off hair. I think there should more options for people who have curly hair like me. I also think there should be more options for eye color. Some people have hazel eyes, not just one color. Another improvement could be with clothes. I think there could be something where u could customize clothes or make new clothes more often. And maybe u could have an option for people who have ear piercings. Also there could a setting where u could add jewelry or something like that. And maybe have more options for clothes. This app is really amazing, but just because something works well doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt make it better!! Other than this the app is really amazing!!! I have fun reading the funny things my Bitmoji says. If u r interested in getting this app u TOTALY should. I use this app everyday. It is so entertaining and u will find that ur bitmoji is quite the character!üòâ It is a fun app where u can customize ur character. I hope the creator of Bitmoji will consider my suggestion!!! Love this app tho!!! üòä"
9,celina_the_swiftie,"February 24, 2019",3,"LOVE IT but.. ok so i love this app. i use it on an almost daily basis when i‚Äôm texting my friends, and there‚Äôs a bitmoji for nearly everything. however, there‚Äôs not enough hairstyles. i always style my hair in an ariana grande ponytail but there‚Äôs no bitmoji hairstyle for that. plus, instead of dying the ends of my hair a different color i have highlights, blue highlights, but again there isn‚Äôt an option for that so my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me..please fix this and i will make my rating five stars. thanks."
10,Jeweleyes,"April 12, 2018",4,"Love it!! But.... I love this app!! It's so fun!!! Even got my co workers hooked on it!! Love that you have scrubs now!!!!!! I haven't checked recently, but could we make it easier to use for commenting on Facebook? Like that we can use it as a status update, but being able to comment without having to like screen shot or something, and then finding the post we want to comment on would be soooo much easier. Also could we get a selection of pjs and a bigger selection for maternity, I'm not that big yet, and none of those outfits are ummm my type, and I am sure other users feel the same way. Otherwise doin an awesome job guys!! Keep up the great work!!!!"
11,Shriya Muni,"September 7, 2018",4,"More creativity in outfits etc. So, I have been with Bitmoji for a while now, and have noticed that Bitmoji has actually been updating outfits, and other accessories pretty often. Something that I am just a little on the edge about, I really sometimes cannot find the correct hairstyle and have to keep changing it until I find the right one. I‚Äôm really hoping that you‚Äôll be able to add more long hair style options, for example, like space buns, of like French braids, or a sleek bun. And maybe make the hairs look a little less glossier because whenever I choose the 2 black options, it doesn‚Äôt fit my hair color (very dark brownüòÇ) And also, coming from someone who has quite bushy eyebrows, there isn‚Äôt really an option for people with big eyebrows. And one last thing :) try more natural nude matte shades for lipsticks colors, since most of them are glossy, they look different with different skin tones. I really hope that you can help me, and probably a lot of problems that others have as well."
12,bitmoji for life!,"December 27, 2018",5,"Love it but.. Bitmoji is great but you need to have more clothing few more ways to express yourself would not hurt either. On bitmoji their could be a chat room to talk to friends, but other than that bitmoji is great I use it a lot when I‚Äôm texting and for my profile pics on social media. But you could make it a bit more kid friendly I have some siblings and their to young for some of bitmojis content. Also the girl body‚Äôs are weird I know you can do better, (of course I have not seen the boy body‚Äôs but their most likely weird to). As I was saying before about more ways to express yourself, sometimes I want to use bitmoji but I can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt have the right bitmoji for it like ( I lost ). And with coughing you really need to step up your game bitmoji when I go to put on a new clouthing it takes me forever to find something I like. But in conclusion bitmoji is not prefect but if your looking to get the app I recommend it to you and I give bitmoji five stars to show l mean it!"
13,beersie3,"July 26, 2019",4,Puppies please!!! I just redownloaded the app after a year without having it and I‚Äôm loving it so far! All the new options made it so my Bitmoji looks more than just kinda like me! Buuuutttt I really need more photo options with dogs! There seem to be a lot of cats and only a couple dogs. 
14,"...........,.....,","August 19, 2019",3,"A good app but could be improved This app is fun to use if you enjoy making avatars of yourself but as someone who can‚Äôt make a bitmoji that actually looks like themselves I notice a lot of missing options for character customization. Things like the lack of curly hair and the barely enough set skin tone options can be bothersome if you want to make a character that looks like you. Back when bitstrips was still a thing I believe I remember the option to choose a wheelchair, which was really nice but it‚Äôs gone now in bitmoji. There‚Äôs a lot of physical features that could be added but something as big as the hair you have can be a make or break for some people‚Äôs avatars. Besides the customization features, every time I install the app, I seem to get more ads on my browsers and the bitmoji keyboard always sets itself to the default keyboard, which most of the time, causes whatever app I‚Äôm using to crash. I don‚Äôt really understand why we have to grant bitmoji full permission to use the keyboard either.  Despite all of the flaws, it‚Äôs definitely a fun app to use with friends, but it absolutely has room for improvement."
15,Kakashi Hatake 360,"April 18, 2020",5,"Great, but a few more options would make it even better Okay, I‚Äôm going to start off by saying that I love the customizable clothes feature, but it really doesn‚Äôt have many options or brands. So maybe more options for jeans, jackets/outerwear, and especially shoes. Could you pleeese put in some tennis shoes that AREN‚ÄôT Vans or Coverse? I know that those are both pretty gender-neutral, but Nikes, Adidas, stuff like that is still good to have on hand. Also in the preset clothes options I feel like there needs to be more winter clothes, like maybe more faux fur stuff, and also definitely more brands in general, maybe Under Armour, American Eagle, Aeropostale, etc. that would be nice. And both genders for all of this stuff too. üòÅ. Another thing. Tattoos! So many people have them now, so please make that possible. "
16,qwefbmrshhgjlpif,"March 29, 2020",4,"Lips, Hair & Clothes I just wanna state before I continue that i am talking about the options fir females & i have a few complaints. My First & biggest issue is that I strongly think you guys should add more variety to lips, the lips are awfully thin & theres people out there (like myself) who have very full lips, you should not only be able to pick the size but the shape as well (i.e cupids bow or a pout). My second complaint is that there are not many hair selections for girls with loser curls, especially on bitstrips. They go from very very loose waves to somewhat curly to kinky curls or theyre are very short cuts with no layers... There also should be an option for a part (left side, right side & center..) as well as an extension for bangs possibly. My last complaint is the mix & match, I really think you guys should add a lot more items to it (items from the pre-made outfits & such). As for clothing i think jewelry should 100% be added (hoops, pendants & crosses, bracelets, piercing & maybe even rings..). But overall i love this app a lot & new & amazing things cone out of it every time its updated ‚ô•Ô∏è"
17,Gamer Girl ‚ö°Ô∏è,"January 11, 2020",4,"Please read ‚ù§Ô∏è I love bitmoji! It's super fun to customize your own personal bitmoji, and I find that there's an accurate bitmoji for almost any occasion/situation. Plus, the mix-and-match feauture only adds to further customization. However, I do have a few ideas for how to improve this app. Firstly, I definently think that the designers of this app should add an option for braces! So many people these days find these mini metal machines fixated on their teeth for a while, and couldn't possibly imagine their appearance without them. And it's mostly teenagers who use this app, after all, and they are usually the people who have braces. That is why I think that it's important to add a choice for braces. In addition, the designers should include a low ponytail in the hairstyle section. It's one of the most common, easy hairstyle girls these days wear. The only ponytails available right now is this super high ponytail and an awkward side ponytail. We need low ponytails, please! As you can see, I only have two PRESSING requests. Please see them through as soon as you can. Otherwise this app is great!"
18,BigTownReviewer,"August 8, 2019",4,"Absolutely Love this App!! But... I absolutely love using this app for texting my friends. It adds a touch of fun in group chats. There are something‚Äôs that I wish were different, however. I agree with PuppyLover147 on things that would make the app better. Mix-and-match-able wardrobe would be ideal. Some of the outfits don‚Äôt match my personal style, or one part of the outfit does, while the other does not. Accessories such has earrings on brace are not available (at least I‚Äôm pretty sure). Also, the app IS rated for 12+, however, the language used makes me cringe every time I come across one. Once again agreeing with PuppyLover147, I suggest a parental filter, or something of the sort. One last thing. I personally don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My friends do, and I want to play Bitmoji games, too. The app Game Pigeon is an app that allows you to play numerous games with your friends over text. I was thinking that you could implement some kind of Bitmoji game like that. But, besides these few things, Bitmoji is a great app that I enjoy having so greatly!"
19,@dreamer081230,"February 22, 2020",4,"Good... wish it was better I appreciate all the updates they‚Äôve made and they‚Äôve all been improvements I just wish they would put all the updates together. For example, they have some great outfits and good separates but you can‚Äôt edit the given outfits. You also can no longer search for things. I also wish they would add pattern availability. If they would catalog all the items in the separates that are in the outfits and added a search availability that would totally improve the app. If there was a pattern section maybe they could let you design your own patterns to apply to clothing items. Another thing they could have is a color slider/creater instead of the list. For the hair section you should be able to apply various bang styles to any cut or style (bangs on a ponytail instead of just straight). Ik parts of this seem excessive but some of these things they already had and were good but replaced with something else good but not the same (taking away the search feature and adding separates). Rant over ;)"
20,mermaid_lover_GW,"December 12, 2017",1,"The Mishaps Before I updated Bitmoji, I had an issue with the picture not sending to one of my friends and I thought it had something to do with my wifi, so I paid money for faster wifi. I didn't send Bitmojis to that person anymore so when I tried with other friends it STILL DID NOT SEND!!! I finally figured out that it had something to do with my app, so then deleted the app, downloaded it again, made my character, and EVERYTHING was fine. When I got an alert that I can do an update I immediately did, it finished and I opened the app. Every picture was white and supposedly loading and usually it takes a minute or so to load. I thought it was loading and waited, but none of the pictures loaded. I am confused because I got faster internet. It might be because of the update or the app. It is still white and ""Loading"" right now."
21,Galaxy_Fandom,"February 24, 2018",4,I love it! Just need this added This app is Amazing! I love creating a little Character and using it text all my friends and family they new Version of the bitmoji the deluxe IS SO AMAZING. . . . But one thing I would love to be added is being able to customize your clothing. . . I mean I really like all the choices I get of clothes but some of them just look weird .  . . And the limited choices kinda get boring and I somethings check in to see if the app has new clothes but nope it just the same boring stuff. . . . Adding this for a update would be great!
22,raaydawg,"March 22, 2018",4,MORE CLOTHING PLEASE!!!! So I downloaded bitmoji when I saw it on Snapchat a couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. I managed to make my bitmoji look exactly like me and when the update came out w/ the camera feature my bitmoji looks even more like me and that‚Äôs what got me hooked into using this app a lot especially in text messages. The only thing I have to complain about this app is the clothing options! I wish there was more constant updates w/ the clothing. It‚Äôs boring not having many options and we all know that clothing is the way we express ourselves and of course in many other ways but for me clothing is how I express myself. There‚Äôs too much sports related clothing and not enough of day to day clothing. I check in every week to see if there has been an update to the clothing options and every time I check I get less and less enthusiastic about bitmoji. I find myself using it less too. Eventually I‚Äôm going to stop using it all together if we don‚Äôt have enough clothing options üò© PLEASE MORE CLOTHING DON‚ÄôT LET US DOWN!!!
23,Hakshbeshdidh,"August 24, 2018",4,One of my favorite apps Bitmoji is one of my favorite apps. I love almost everything about it. I wish that on bitmoji you could make your own outfits. Instead of having pre made outfits you could style whatever you want. I also think it would be cool to change the color of clothing. Sometimes I love the outfit but the color isn‚Äôt for me. I think it would be really cool if you could take a picture of yourself and it would immediately change to looking exactly like you. One setting I think would be awesome is to save creations so if you like a bitmoji you made but want to make a new one you can save it and come back to it later. One last thing I want you to add is more clothing options. You give us so many styles but I feel like you need to update. The summer styles you gave us last year are pretty good but I want you to add different outfits for more selection. If you were to make these changes I would absolutely give this app five stars. Please consider my ideas. I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è
24,AMay79,"November 17, 2018",5,"Still tickles me...consistently AWESOME I have 0 complaints. I never review apps, but this one is one everyone should have. There is now something for nearly every occasion. You don‚Äôt even need an occasion to use it. You can have a complete conversation using these personalized bits/emojis without ever typing a word. From expressing anger, sadness, boredom, sarcasm, anxiety, over-worked, tired, nonchalance, attraction/flirt, toilet break (haha), waiting, long distance, and new ones added ALLLL the time. What makes this app unique in my opinion, is the detail in the face expressions. It makes them not only stand out but also more relatable. "
25,MissCorrine916,"January 26, 2019",4,"So much Fun! I refused to download the app for a really long time because I thought creating an avatar would be too time consuming. It‚Äôs not! It was so easy and so fun! In fact, after the update to have the avatar look life like, every single one of my friends said that mine was the only one that they could say looks like me. I do agree with the featured review that there could be ways to adjust hair length and more styles for curly/wavy hair. I also would like to see more clothes options, or mix and match options. Some of the styles are too over the top or too simple for my liking. Some outfits I love except for one feature that I could do without and would love to eliminate it or swap it out for something else. They could be a really great feature; a ‚Äúbuild your own outfit‚Äù section ( like Cher‚Äôs closet in ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù!) Oh, and maybe change up the ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù options, those haven‚Äôt changed in months and they are getting pretty old. Still an awesome app. Love that we can add friends to our bitmojis when sending them."
26,Vanzilla01,"May 5, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs great! But... Ok, I still have this at five stars because it‚Äôs not horrible. There is only a couple things I wish they would add. There is no glitches I‚Äôve seen so far, and nothing is super inappropriate or anything for younger kids...it‚Äôs just the customization of my bitmoji. First, I am a teen, so I have braces. When all my friends see my bitmoji, they are all like, ‚Äúwhere are your braces??‚Äù I keep telling them that this app doesn‚Äôt have any. I look different and for me, I‚Äôm pretty picky, but I‚Äôll live. But if you guys do add braces, don‚Äôt make them look al weird and crappy (sorry), because that would just be worse! Second, clothes. I wish there was more clothes. Everything there which was recently added...it‚Äôs just too much. Just something basic, but cute! That‚Äôs all I really have to say. It was just ideas mostly. But if you want a little mini me of yourself you should get this app! I really enjoy it and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be deleting it soon."
27,hotpanda328,"April 15, 2020",2,"Outfits- MORE WHERE ARE THE NEW YEAR OUTFITS!!!! The outfits have been the same so much. The new mix and match closet is cool but in my opinion released at the wrong time, right before Christmas. There should be more modern clothes and more options for body types too. Variety is key. I wish there were more hairstyles too. I love bitmoji, it‚Äôs so cute, but my primary concern is, again, the outfits. The maternity section has lots of the older, nicer outfits which bitmoji decided to remove! I really want one of the outfits in the maternity section, why is it only available there? Do I have to get pregnant to wear exclusive clothes? Please make the outfits in the maternity section available for others. I also truly miss the hollister and forever 21 outfits from 2016. I wish those would come back, in my opinion they were the nicest outfits bitmoji has ever had and now they‚Äôre removed for uglier outfits which people aren‚Äôt wearing as much. I don‚Äôt see many people wearing anything from the sporting section which you have made so much room for, nor the bitmotees section. Please consider my opinions to improve this app and make everyone happier :)"
28,fastforward>>,"March 29, 2020",4,"Gender Options (or rather, limits) This app is great! I prefer using my Bitmoji over GIFs. My only issue is that I, as a FTM transgender person, do not like using the male avatar because the face and body shapes do not fit my pre-transitioned face and body shape, but the female avatar does not have the ""male"" outfit choices that I would like. This could go both ways. Gender is not tied to expression. Men should have the choice to wear crop tops and tights in their right body shape and women should be able to wear muscle tanks and cargo shorts in their right body shape if wanted."
29,IzzyMesopotato30,"July 8, 2019",4,"Soooo close to a 5 star but... I love love LOVE this app and have been using it for sooooo long. It never crashes, and it‚Äôs never slow and NEVER lags, but I just think the selection of STUFF to edit your avatar in general should be bigger...Especially the hair selection. I still can‚Äôt find a style just right for my hair, which is wavy and thick with a natural side part but it doesn‚Äôt BULGE out or anything. And also the outfits. Although only Boo! (Which I deleted because it completely doesn‚Äôt work anymore) had this feature, I just think being able to customize and mix and match different pieces of an outfit would be awesome. Also one more thing...eye colour. My eyes are brown but a light shade that most of the time leans more toward amber, but the only brown eyes that are offered are really dark. Maybe you could have some sort of bar that can adjust the lightness and darkness of each eye colour, like Boo! used to have. Also there‚Äôs no hazel eyes! Thanks for a great app anyway! I use it all the time!!üôÇüôÉüôÇüôÉ"
30,dat_girl1738,"February 3, 2018",5,"Love the New Style! I highly recommend Bitmoji because of its new realistic style. I recently just updated the app and received ‚ÄúBitmoji Deluxe.‚Äù Let me tell you all the details. You now get to add highlights to your hair and I read that they include over 100+ hairstyles. Your clothes stay the same! They always come up with NEW cute stickers almost every single day, featuring some emojis. "

32,Hershey kisses101201,"April 24, 2018",4,"Need more options I really like bitmoji a lot, and use it every day. The new update was great because it offered a lot more ways to customize your bitmoji in terms of body size, hairstyles, and a lot of other things. However, I think it would be fantastic if there were way more options for hairstyles, as my hair isn't that unique or uncommon but I can't find anything that looks like it. I also think that there should be more fun options for people with straight or wavy hair, like the two buns style there is for curly hair. Also, I think being able to customize outfits by mix and matching shirts, pants, and shoes would be a huge improvement as the outfit choices are kind of lacking. Another great addition would be to add an accessories option for jewelry, earrings, purses, etc as it would again allow for more customization and make the bitmoji look more like the real person. I hope the app keeps improving at the rate it is now because it's really fantastic!"
33,Bayseklyme,"April 25, 2018",1,"Very disappointed I have been using the app for about 2 years now and I was loving it. But now I find that they have taken the Superhero styles away. My Avatar was dressed as Wonder Woman this whole entire time until today, when I changed her clothes to a baseball uniform for a point I was making in a text to family members. When I went to change her clothes back to Wonder Woman, I discovered that I was not able to because the Superhero section is no longer there. For the most part the app is really pretty good and a fun way to express oneself, which I do frequently with this app.  But I am very disappointed that the Superhero section has been taken out along with other fun movie sections like Game Of Thrones and X Files. It seems that the clothing sections that were the most fun are the ones that have been taken out. Now I am left with either sports or boring attire for my Avatar to wear. Just to give you an idea of the type of character I am: I a 60 year old woman who owns lots of crazy sox because they are an extension of my personality, loves Wonder Woman, gaming, adventure, and I sport intense lilac color hair. Please bring back the Superhero clothing. PLEASE BRING BACK WONDER WOMAN!!"
34,Molly_dog lover,"December 18, 2018",5,"More outfits I love the app 10/10 quality. But I do think they should make an update with more outfits, colors, and personnel outfits. I think they should make it so that you can design your own outfit. It could have a selection of tops with different colors. A selection of dresses all different shapes and sizes. And skirts, pants, jumpsuits, and more. But you could change the style and color of them all. It would be a great update. Also if they could add strapless things I think a lot of people would like that. And if you could either choose solid colors or patterns for the design that would be so fun and amazing. Plus then it can help them look more like you by having more unique options. I would also like a selection of sport bras and shorts. Also more sports things like let‚Äôs say your a gymnast a leotard would be good. I also think that different shoes would be good. But overall a very good app, love it."

This is a BASIC feature and it‚Äôs irritating that it hasn‚Äôt been added after at this time.  I do a lot of conversing via text and I don‚Äôt have time to sit around and swap to the Bitmoji keyboard and search for a keyword (since we don‚Äôt know what each bitmoji is called), go back and paste it in. It severely limits my use of the app, which is a shame because I really do love it!"
36,pancake_nerd,"October 30, 2019",5,"Great. But needs improvement I love Bitmoji. My friends and I use it all the time. But with certain hairstyles, and when you wear hats, your hair still sticks out so it looks weird. I think that maybe you could actually make it look like the bitmoji is wearing an actual hat. It‚Äôs the same thing with straight and long hair. It‚Äôs all sticking out and it looks really weird. But other then everything is AMAZING. But with the Halloween costumes, I think there should be more costume selections. Such as a mummy, bat, wizard, Frankenstein, or even horror movie characters such a Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees, the Ghost Face from scream, a Ghost, e.t.c. Also we need more clothes. Like for instance, when I get dressed in the morning, I pick out pants and a shirt and shoes to go with what I‚Äôm wearing. But in Bitmoji you can‚Äôt to that. I would love to see that happen though. But I LOVE bitmoji and I would love to see more improvements. It is a great app. I think everyone should get it. Thanks for reading"

It has great qualities and is so customizable it is insane how much time it must have taken to build it. But I do have a few ideas. To start, I feel like having a few more hairstyles and lengths would be amazing, like really long hair or pigtails. Also, if there was a option for jeans to rip like the shirt tucking toggle, that would be very helpful. Another idea is that if you could give the option of streaks for your hair, like the hair treatment choice, it would really be great. Next, if you could add more outer wear like cropped sweatshirts that would also be awesome. Finally, if you could add a kid/teen/adult option that would be great. I mean, sure you can change the build of the character and the wrinkles, but that doesn‚Äôt do that much for height. So yeah, it is an incredible app, but there are a few things that could make it even better."
38,Lee-Ani,"January 26, 2020",3,"Could be better I believe bitmoji is good for customizing your Snapchat or keyboard and making it seem more like you but there isn‚Äôt much diversity. What I mean by that is like body and hair diversity. One of the few things that irk me about making a bitmoji is the fact that they are almost all skinny and the curviest one is made to look like a potato. Me and many other women believe that there should be customizable body parts, like the option to remove a thigh gap, get breasts that are as big as ours in real life and even adjust our waist size. That way our bitmoji can *really* look like us. Rather than having the same old boring skinny body that doesn‚Äôt even look like us. And for hair there isn‚Äôt much to complain about, there‚Äôs almost every style... for straight/wavy hair. For curls there needs to be a few more styles for women like me who don‚Äôt wear their curls in a ugly updo or down all the time because in all honesty no girl with curls wears it down all the time. That‚Äôs all I find wrong with this app, I‚Äôm looking forward to any updates :)"

42,Kandring,"May 8, 2018",4,"I enjoy this app, and I have suggestions I've really enjoyed this app so far, but like a few other folks in the comments, I have some suggestions. There are a lot of neat outfits, but I wish there was a way to completely customize for my character. Like some other folks, I am a gay female and tend to wear more masculine-style clothes, but the options in app are a little limited in terms of me expressing myself. If you included the ability to have the entire Bitmoji wardrobe available for all genders, that would be really cool! If you added a clothing customization feature, that'd also be really cool!"

44,M goodness 22,"April 20, 2019",4,"Great App But Some Suggestions I really love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs fun to be able to customize a cartoon character that looks like me. But I wish there was more options for hair, freckles, and body size. I think your Bitmoji should be more customizable. I have a lot of freckles and the app really only has the option to put a few on your face. I also think the hair section of the app should have a feature were you can customize length, waviness, and wether or not you have bangs. Also there are only like 5 different body shapes. I feel as if there should be more. The last thing I want to suggest would be the best change in my opinion. I think people should be able to customize clothes. You could pick a plain  item of clothing and then you could pick out patterns and colors and things like that. If that isn‚Äôt possible I still think the app should have more clothes. All in all this is a great app. If you read this I really suggest downloading it. üíú"

46,sjsel,"July 20, 2019",5,"Get this app! Amazing!!! I use Bitmoji practically everyday. It is so funny, and fun. I have a few suggestions. This would make it even better. Maybe more hair colors, lengths, and styles. Also, a bit more casual, but cute clothes. I would like to have something casual, but not like nerdy, but not like crazy. Maybe also a way that we can match tops and bottoms, and change their color. That way my friend and I aren‚Äôt all matching. I think a way to add things like braces would be good, that way it is more accurate. Bitmoji has awesome pictures already, though I think maybe a way to add your own text, or have moving images would be so awesome. Bitmoji is awesome. I would love to add these, but it is awesome already. You can communicate with your friends and express your emotions. It is amazing. I use it daily, and my friends always compliment our bitmojis, and change them often. Bitmoji is amazing!!!!! ü§©üëè"
47,luckyducky21,"February 18, 2020",4,"Just a few suggestions... First of all, I would like to say that this is a really fun app, especially for texting and Snapchat. Sadly, there are some things that need to be fixed. For example, the app needs more hairstyles! Finding the right hairstyle for me was the hardest part. I have medium length wavy hair, but the only wavy hairstyles were either too short or too long. Also, other hairstyles, such as pigtails or French braids, would make the app so much better! I also think you should add more hair colors and eye colors. I have dark red hair, but all of the red hair colors were either to pink or to orange, so I had to settle with brown. You should also add hazel eyes. Not everyone has just plain blue, brown, or green eyes you know. With these tweaks, Bitmojis would be so much more customizable! Again, this is a really cool app and makes texting so much more fun. I hope this review was helpful to you and you will take my suggestions into consideration. Thank you!"
48,cupcake in heven,"January 20, 2020",5,"Fun but needs a few things... I love bitmoji. It make me feel more like me. I use it to express myself. I use it when I‚Äôm texting my friends. The thing that bothers me the most, is that you have to change it on a website now. I have privacy restrictions put on my phone so I‚Äôm not allowed to get in it and choose what I want. That is the thing that bothers me the most. Also I thing they should have a little more accessories like the checkered vans and maybe hooded sweatshirts. Another thing is, it should have less inappropriate things for kids that are under age for this app but still use it. These are just a few things that should be upgraded in the next update. Thank you for being so kind to read my review of bitmoji. Other than the things that need fixed, I really love this app. Thank you so much for making it. You guys kind of saved my life from being a weirdo. Lol."

50,"Yo dawg,(:","December 13, 2017",4,"Maternitity Clothes!! I absolutely love Bitmoji to start off with. I use it all the time to express a plethora of different emotions and of course at all the wrong times. I sometimes forget it‚Äôs a separate app all on its own. I love to change my outfits to express my personality and now that I‚Äôm pregnant and getting a bump, I‚Äôve noticed there are very limited clothing choices in maternity. (And it‚Äôs winter and they‚Äôre all making my Bitmoji freeze to death!) As a 21 year old in modern times, I appreciate a good virtual outfit selection. Was hoping there could be a future update for other expecting mommies to showcase more personality and better fashion for the pregnant Bitmojis. Maybe even change the belly as a body type and adjust clothes accordingly. Sounds like that would take a lot of time, but just as a suggestion of how you could further your app. Giving 4 stars because like I said I‚Äôm obsessed, but wish for more options (:"
51,Awesomenessgirl12606,"March 17, 2018",5,"Fashion Recommendation Hello, I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for more than a year, and I absolutely LOVE it. However, I have a recommendation on the fashion. I think there should be more ‚Äúemo‚Äù outfits. That being more colors in earrings, possibly band shirts? That may need permission from the bands though. Maybe some sort of spiked jewelry? I don‚Äôt know, this is just a suggestion, along with many more that you guys probably get. I think this would be a good idea because the majority of people that use this app (and any social media) are teenagers. Teenagers are all just trying to figure out who they are, and what they wish to do with their lives. In the process, some go through ‚Äúemo phases‚Äù, as I am, along with some of my friends. If you were to add this into the app, I‚Äôd recommend doing a huge fashion update, so it wouldn‚Äôt specifically be for this. (Even though that would never happen. üòÇ)"

I and many others really enjoy having your technical creation installed in our cellular devices, but it is highly disappointing that it does not contain a plethora of skin colors that are decently adequate or even tolerable for the South Asian community of Bitmoji users, let alone the incredible world of multifarious races we live in. I am emotionally drained of the controversy my skin color gets and the fact that I can‚Äôt embrace it on an app that is supposed to display a supposed duplicate of my self is very displeasing. I understand that producing an app containing such a creative and unique concept can be arduous, but I don‚Äôt think it can be that hard to provide us with at least 5-10 more skin tones that will be suitable with a bigger reach of users of your technical creation. Sincerely, your loving Bitmoji user‚ù§Ô∏è"

54,Angelina334,"May 23, 2018",5,"The app is great but.... Bitmoji it‚Äôs a great app for anybody who likes to express themselves on Snapchat or through messaging friends. When designing your character I feel that there is a limited selection for the eye color and body shape. I have more of a glass figure shape while the ones you can choose from are mostly skinny. I feel that this feature should be changed to fit more body types. Also my eyecolor is not normal like the ones presented. I have something called sectoral heterochromia where my one eye is half brown and green while my other eye changes from green to gray. The eye colors are very limited to fantasy looking eye colors and not enough real eye colors. This app is great for anybody really, you just need an open mind when it comes to the features available right now. Bitmoji is a very unique app and I would suggest it for anybody who uses social media or texts a lot."
55,Cher Potter,"June 5, 2018",4,"Ideas I feel as though the whole app is adorable and fun! But, I do have some requests that I‚Äôm sure everyone can agree with you doing. I think the app would be better overall and more fun with more hairstyles, being able to design our own outfits, jewelry, and more options within the facial feature designing. I can‚Äôt really pick a nose like mine, my eyes aren‚Äôt really the shape my eyes are, and my hair definitely isn‚Äôt my hair, but they are all the closest I can get to myself. I love a lot of the newer outfits that have been added, but it would be great if we could pick what shirt could go with these shoes, and pick our colors. I like to wear earrings, so jewelry is a must. Also, braces should be an option! I have braces, and so do many other people around the world! That would be a perfect way to make it more like ourselves. Overall, I think you guys can do a lot better with these ideas. üòä Thanks for hearing me out!"
56,Cheshire Katt,"January 11, 2020",4,Just some suggestions on the customization I found that the skin tone is either too dark or too light and the skin tone that‚Äôs a little darker than the palest shade is too yellow to be mine maybe if there was something where you picked a shade and you could change the hue to olive tones or to warm tones?
57,‚Ä¢üê±‚Ä¢,"October 7, 2019",4,"Great App!! Maybe a few improvements I love this app and use it on a regular basis but I think there could be some improvements. One thing is the body sizes. There should be more options then the ones they have to fit more people. Also, I think there should be more options for curly haired people and more braids and such. I have seen this on other people‚Äôs reviews many times and I agree completely. We should be able to mix and match clothing options to fit our style. For example, what if you like a shirt, but are not a fan of the pants? I think we should be able to mix and match. One last thing- the language. There are younger users (even though it is for 12+) using this app and that are being exposed to the bad language on this app. I‚Äôm not saying take it off, but maybe blur it out a little better.

Also more of the good kind of camouflage hat and country hats, and everything is so boring you should add a game to Bitmoji. On the other hand Bitmoji has some things to correct next Tim I'm on it better have the changes because I want to see those changes it should have been made by now.

I have Snapchat too and I love that you can connect it. 2 things though. I had the Bitmoji keyboard for a while but then I got sick of it, so I disabled it but now whenever I go to the emoji bar it always shows that and makes me have to click out of it. It‚Äôs pretty annoying when I am trying to just send an emoji or two. The last thing is that I have hazel eyes and none of the options look like my eyes, plus I don‚Äôt really have any of the hairstyles available. I know you always update it and I love Bitmoji Deluxe and all the other cool updates and new options. But I think instead of mainly updating clothes you should start to try and update more features.

Obviously my bitmoji isn‚Äôt going to freeze to death but I like to keep with the theme of what‚Äôs going on real time so it would be helpful if there was more options, not just pregnancy wise but for every type of style for every type of person!

My hair is medium length but in the app, there are only options for longer hair or shorter hair then mine. The only one that KINDA fits me is the strait hair one on the top row when editing your bitmoji (3rd one). I would like it if y‚Äôall would add some more hair options in that length. The other thing I would like to request is more options on the lips and eye colors. My lips are full, but more on the top then on the bottom. I would like it if y‚Äôall could create some lips that are not just full on the bottom like it has in the app. Second of all, the eye color. My eyes are very different among other eyes. My eyes are blue but green at the same time. I think it would be cool if there were eye color options that were green and blue mixed not just green or just blue.

Oh and one more thing I think you should let people make there own captions for there picture they send or it at least be an option. I love to use Bitmoji to joke around with my friends, overall I think it‚Äôs a pretty good app it jut could use some adjustments. I recommend this to people who don‚Äôt like texting a lot. This app was made for you lol. Everyone should have this app !! And one last thing I wanted a funky crop top ripped jeans kind of outfit but it won‚Äôt let you pick a shirt and a different pair of jeans or so on you should make it to where you can pick any shirt and any kind of bottoms and shoes."

It‚Äôs very cool to use it with friends and family when you‚Äôre using Snapchat and messages, especially when you can use Friendmoji on Snapchat. I just have one TINY suggestion. Would it be possible to have some more hair options? I mean, all the hair you can currently choose from is great, but I think some people would prefer more hairstyles also. Anyways, that‚Äôs all I wanted to say and thanks soooooo much for recently updating the app!! The new clothes are awesome and MANY THANKS for giving the option of customizing our own clothes, like what shirt we want with want pants, shoes, etc!

I love this app I use every day on Snapchat the only thing I do not like about this app is that doesn‚Äôt really have my style and I think a lot of people say that and one way is to make it a style is  and have just shirts just pants or just shoes this way everybody can be custom but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to eliminate outfits either you can just add it on and I think people will really love it even more another thing isThere should be an option where we the people can make custom hair or something like that and of course everyone‚Äôs opinion is different so you can have a normal hair like it is now or you can make your own hair add more hair so you can have it pretty precise and I know some people don‚Äôt think this is like that important but it would make it a lot more fun and an app that people use more and I know that you guys want people to use your app more
76,Angie1234!,"April 27, 2020",4,Bitmoji Okay the clothes and everything are nice but when you can create your own outfit to me there should be more of a variety because there are country people in this world who don‚Äôt dress like all girly and everything. Like for an update or something (this is just and idea) there should be different FLANNELS you can choose from and BOOTS!!!!! Like I think this would really be nice for country people. Also I think there should be hair styles that you can create because everybody hair style is different and sometimes people don‚Äôt really care about the options it gives us because not everybody‚Äôs hair are likes the ones in the options. And also for the people who wear glasses not all glasses are the same colors people should be able to make the glasses their color not just black and white that goes for sunglasses too. But these are all just ideas and some suggestions.
77,SweetButterCakes,"March 12, 2020",4,"Love it, but would add I have had Bitmoji since it came out basically, and I have loved the updates it gotten over the years, but I feel like the hair style choices haven‚Äôt updated much. I think it would be an awesome idea to be able to have 2 colors in your hair. I think it would make the characters a lot more customizable and unique to you. I also feel that you could add more items for clothing, I know that the outfit my bitmoji has on right now is no longer an option, which makes it hard to do some of the new customizations because it will take off my outfit, and I don‚Äôt want to lose it, cause it‚Äôs hella cute. Add more shirt styles with prints or anything on them, maybe some ripped jeans and perhaps add some more color options to the shoes and jackets sections. Other than that I think it‚Äôs been getting better each update, and hope it continues to improve!!"

It‚Äôs not my favorite thing to do, but I do it anyway so that I can do well in competition. Anyway, I was wondering if you could add a feature where you can make your legs orange, just like the fake tan. Personally, I am really pale, so my bitmoji looks weird because I always have super tan legs. Also, can you please add an irish dancing bitmoji that you can share with your friends? Whenever I have a dance competition or class, I would really like to send an irish dancing bitmoji to my friends. This would be a really cool feature for all us fellow irish dancers out there.

Lots of people wanna be able to customize every part of there Bitmoji character to there liking. Also adding backgrounds, pets of every sort of animal even exotic animals, & even adding the option that y‚Äôall give on Snapchat of having your friend(s) with you at the same time.

82,Cailey b.,"July 16, 2018",4,"Great app! More options please This app has so many messages to choose from! It never glitches, and the graphics are amazing! However, there are some things you could add. My number one wish is BRACES! Most of the people using this app are in middle school, meaning there are individuals with braces everywhere! Braces are a huge part of a feature on someone‚Äôs face, it‚Äôd be a great option! Next, instead of having 5000 soccer and football jerseys, it‚Äôd be great if we could customize our own outfits! Or just add more outfits that are up to date with current fashion. Other than that, I think everything is great except the variety of hairstyles for bob cut hair. I only have two options since I have short, wavy hair :( . This is an awesome app, but please remember... braces, clothes, hair!

83,547292948,"July 17, 2018",5,"Great! Fantastic app, I love using it. There are enough facial choices that my Bitmoji actually really looks like me, which doesn‚Äôt usually happen in other programs that allow you to create your character. However, I would like more colorful clothing choices, for I wear a lot of colorful patterns. I also would prefer more hairstyle choices and definitely more hair color choices, because I am constantly coloring my hair but I can rarely match my Bitmoji‚Äôs hair to mine. Right now irl I have my natural brown roots fade into a beautiful teal color, but the closest color match on Bitmoji is brown on top (the the brown in my hair doesn‚Äôt go down that far) and an ugly shade of dark green that almost looks faded and rather weird. The green looks even worse when it is paired with the brown top. Anyways, fantastic app, but more choices are needed."
84,Just take the advice...,"September 28, 2018",4,"Update Suggestion I have had this for several years now and it has developed pretty good. There are more detailed styles which would allow the avatar to be more specialized towards you. (Anyone ever try to make yourself on the old style and say to yourself ‚Äúhey, that kinda looks like ‚Äòso and so‚Äô. Wait it also looks like ‚Äòso and so‚Äô ‚Äú and you end up with a list of 10 people) Anyways, getting to the point, anyone who has had bitmoji always has trouble finding a good outfit. You find an outfit with a shirt that looks like the one you wear often, but the pants do NOT. (Vise  versa) So being able to pick individual articles of clothing would be great! Rather than having an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù with the shirt and pants pre selected, you would be able to pick any shirt and wear any pants together. This would truly make bitmoji users able to make their avatars more like them."
85,l√´monsquare,"April 27, 2019",3,"More Features! Hi! I love your app, it is so fun! :) However, I am just frustrated about the lack of features. I calculated that there are over 20 more options for GLASSES than for HAIRSTYLES! I think that is ridiculous. You should also add more options for hair because there is literally no hairstyle that looks like mine at all. A ponytail would be great, but there are only two types of ponytails: The first one is like 1 inch and messy and the second one is like 8 inches and long and sleek. How about a little more detail? That would be awesome for me. Also more lengths and textures of hairstyles would be SO convenient. My hair is a little past shoulder length and slightly wavy at the end, but there is no option even remotely close to that, and imo there should be. Also, it would be amazeballs if you could add an option for braces! I noticed that lots of bitmojis have toothy smiles and therefore those of us with braces should have a bitmoji with braces. Thanks so much! :)"

One other option, and maybe it‚Äôs in there because I just did a new update or maybe this is in the works but sometimes I just can‚Äôt find the right saying/picture for my conversation.

87,sfspalding,"March 27, 2020",5,"Great app! (w/ suggestions) This is an awesome app! But I wish there were more specific features such as piercings, and more makeup options such as eyeliner and highlighter (I say those bc winged eyeliner and highlight are some of my trademarks). Just more variation in makeup in general would be nice, along with more customizable fashion options that look like the outfits in order to mic and match. Also, I have curly type 3b hair and I‚Äôve only found one (one!!) hairstyle that looks somewhat like my hair. Lastly, me and other people whose emojis have big hair have been having an issue with headwear. Hair should not be be sticking out of a hat. This aggravates me because I can‚Äôt use beanies despite being partial to them. Also, necklaces and chokers!! I am an avid choker wearer. Except for these nitpicks, this app is great and I highly recommend it."
88,horsesrpeople,"April 18, 2020",5,"Great! Ok I love this.  However I do not have Snapchat so once in a while it asks for full bitmoji access.  This doesn‚Äôt bother me but it might for some.  Bitmoji should be able to be on all keyboards without reading your private information though.  I was thinking there isn‚Äôt very many ones with gecko ether doesn‚Äôt that discriminate?  Maybe you can add horses, geckos or other reptiles and foxes. What I was thinking and pretty much the only reason I‚Äôm writing this review is maybe we can design some of those picture things.  Like there could be a section called private library and stuff.  We could have our avatar and write our own text, add little things and maybe you can add some more animals?

I think it‚Äôs a wonderful app. It allows you to create your own personal bitmoji, as well as placing your bitmoji into a little cartoon or pictures. I think it‚Äôs really fun and creative, but It‚Äôd be even better if there were more hairstyles, and hair colors! If some of the wavy hair styles were also available in a straight version it would be nice. I have the medium length wavy hair on mine right now, but my hair is usually straight, so if there was a straight version it would be a lot better! As well as more styles like braids or other styles of messy buns as well! Or even more lengths of hair! I also think there should be more colors! Like maybe some darker brown shades or other colorful options! Or even an option to create a custom hair color with a color wheel! I hope you can read my suggestion and take it into consideration!

The only thing I wish is that for outfits that come with some sort of hat, that the hat could fit multiple hairstyles. I have very curly hair and so does my Bitmoji and whenever I choose an outfit with a hat accessory my Bitmoji‚Äôs hair automatically becomes straight to fit the hat. I really wish that my hairstyle would stay curly with the hat or gives the option to take the hat off but stay with the outfit. If this become available I‚Äôll give it a full five stars! I also wish there were more curly hair options. I don‚Äôt see my original curly hair option anymore:( please go back to us having many hair options: wavy, straight, curly etc. and us choosing the correct hairstyle based on the kind of hair we chose. Not ALL hairstyle options are available anymore. Please bring back!!!"
93,SpeadTheLove,"June 27, 2018",5,"Soooooooo Fun!! One Small Request I love Bitmoji! It is a really fun way of adding yourself (literally) to conversations with friends and beyond. I have one request, thus being maybe adding braces into the picture. My younger sister, who is 16 years old, has braces and I think she would really like it if there was a way to add in braces. Now, I shouldn't be the one to tell u what to do because I'm sure this whole app coding thing is far beyond my abilities, but it would be cool. Maybe an option of having just top braces, just bottom braces, and then the option of having both. Once again, this is just a small idea on how to expand the horizons of the Bitmoji app, and my request isn't something I am particularly complaining about. This is definitely a 5+ star app and I applaud the creative team."
94,swag__girl__y'all,"July 13, 2018",5,"Great app Bitmoji is a wonderful app. It is very useful in my expressions in messages. Even though it is an amazing app, I have a few suggestions. First of all, on the home page when you open the app, they should have a search option so you can search for your bitmoji without having to scroll and scroll and look for the bitmoji you want. Second of all, can you make the bitmojis a little more kid-friendly? Some are inappropriate and uncomfortable. Also, in the summer, I wear T-shirt‚Äôs and shorts mostly and there are no clothes for that so I have to go with a tank top and shorts and I barely wear tank tops so I hope you update the wardrobe. Despite all of these suggestions, I really like this app. I would definitely recommend this to someone. Please take my suggestions into consideration."

But there is just one suggestion I have which would make this app a lot better for me and it‚Äôs super simple. On the bitmoji keyboard there is a little globe button thing that allows you to switch to other keyboards but because I speak other languages and also have regular emojis I use the bitmoji‚Äôs globe doesn‚Äôt let you hold down and switch to the keyboard you want. You either have to press it once and then switch or keep tapping the keyboard until you get your preferred choice. I would just like to switch back to my normal keyboard very quickly and save me some time and it doesn‚Äôt seem like something that would be hard for you guys to do so if you can that‚Äôd be great.

I just wanted to make a few suggestions for updates to come. First would be more customization options (even though there are so many right now which is awesome), I think it would be cool to have things like slit eyebrows, birthmarks, different colored eyes, tattoos, stuff like that so that Bitmojis can be even more unique and look the most like yourself. Another thing I think would be cool to add would be the option to mix and match clothing, like picking a shirt from one outfit and pants from another. This is just mostly because I see that there are parts of outfits that fit what I would actually wear, but rarely a FULL outfit. Thanks for reading and I hope you use some of these suggestions for the future!"
97,htdghogan,"February 7, 2019",3,"Versatile and fun Tons of varieties and more added constantly. Customizing characters is through BUT the lack of detailed customization for each item leaves basics to be desired, same goes for options to change direction a sticker faces, is like to be able to have extended hair lengths, left or right options for place of accessories or simply which side a hair part is on. There are many common colors for skin hair and eyes and even some cartoonish unnaturals ... but this should be given sliders and  allow for more precise cocooning. I AM TAKING THIS FROM 3 Stars down for the is next issue. THERE ARE TOO MANY OPTIONS FOR OUTFITS, there is no ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù option to make changing them easy, THEH ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE, You can‚Äôt mix and match tops with bottoms AND WORST PART, LITERALLY NO ATTEMPT TO GIVE COLOR PICKING AT ALL... they add new options in groups ‚Äúsports teams‚Äù ‚Äúseasons‚Äù ‚Äúcasual‚Äù ‚ÄúNike‚Äù or ‚ÄúFaux Brand That Looks Cook‚Äù but lack the simplicity of just implementing custom clothing."

I read that very long comment from a previous user about curly hair, personally you do have my hair style, but not it exactly. Maybe you could let users pick the hair type (straight, wavy, curly, kinky) like the 1,2,3,4, and abc strategy, and then let them choose different types of bangs, different lengths, and different styles in general. Also, PLEASE improve your ponytail and braid styles, they look weird, (I understand that it‚Äôs difficult to make them look natural, I use Apple Memoji as well and theirs looks bad too) and can‚Äôt you make the glasses color be able to change, like how you can change the clothing colors?

Also, the outfits aren‚Äôt exactly things that I will wear when I look for outfits at the forever 21 section all I see are bodycon dresses with bomber jackets and checkers. Not all teenagers wear this... and when I look for things in the bitmogi casual section all I see are the same pants and shirt on different colors.

105,gabbyholohan,"March 19, 2020",4,"We need more options for curly hair!! Bitmoji overall is a great app, however, there is one minor change I would make. The whole point of Bitmoji is to make an emoji that looks like yourself, but with the current hair options it is difficult for everyone to find their hair type. It seems like there are at least 25 different hairstyles for people with straight hair and there are about 3 hair types for girls with curly hair. To improve this, I would add 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, and 4c hair types to the hair choices so that there is at least one option for every hair type. I feel like hair types 1a-c and 2a are all that I see when I look through the hair section. It would just be a relief to those of us who have curly hair if you all added some diversity to the hair types. Otherwise, this app is wonderful, I would just love to see selections for everyone!"

In my opinion, (on Bitmoji deluxe) I think there should be a way to create your own color and style of hair, same with clothing. People throughout the world have many unique styles of clothing, and I think it would be appreciated if there could be some way to create your own style of clothing on this app. Also, I feel there should be an option to include piercings, birthmarks, scars, different skin tones, or anything along those lines really.

I gave it a 4 though because of all the inappropriate emojis there are, it says stuff under at least 16 year old kids shouldn‚Äôt know about. Also it says bad words like the f word in some emojis and one emoji even has its middle finger up which I think is really inappropriate for kids who want to send cute emojis to friends.

Every time I use my Bitmoji on Snapchat, I always have to draw my birthmark on my face. A few people thought that the Bitmoji app can let you put a birthmark on your person, but I told them that I drew it on there. If Bitmoji gave us an option to put a birthmark on our person, Bitmoji will be outstanding. Please consider the people who have birthmarks & please do think about making an update so people with birthmarks can put one on their Bitmojis. Let us chose where to put the birthmark & the size of the birthmark. I think with that update, Bitmoji will be an unstoppable fun app. Thank you! üíï"
111,KenzyC,"October 7, 2017",4,"Love it but if you could add.... Everything in this is so wonderful √±. Love using bitmoji but like another user mentioned we need more outfits, girls can never have enough outfits. It would be nice to be able to chance individual clothing like the shoes and jackets. We also need the hats to fit better. My husband‚Äôs bitmoji needed a country hat but it looked so funny because it didn‚Äôt fit it was just placed on the top like a little top hat lol. Also there wasn‚Äôt country style clothing. We need more outfits for both men and women. The clothing styles is what makes a person unique. We should be able to individually change clothing items. Also it would hurt if we could have a bitmoji text creator, where we can choose a bitmoji with selected expression then add our own words so it could be more personalized.  That would be awesome."
112,lachicaplastica,"February 1, 2018",4,"Needs a search feature!!! They think of everything! If you can't find a bitmoji for what you want to say... say something else. They're adorable and accurate and always current. But there's soooo many of them and all shoved into four categories, which means you have to sift through dozens to try to find the one you want. They need a search option or pop-out menu with categories like ""sorry"" and ""miss you"" and ""sarcastic"" and whatnot. I've opted not to send one more than once because by the time I found what I wanted, the convo has moved on. Otherwise, I love this app. Also, needs more ""miss you"" options. I have very dear people halfway across the country in opposite directions and I miss them and need more ways to say so. Like ""really miss you"" and ""missing you hard"" and sappy stuff like that lol. Great and fun app!!"
113,Leahlizp,"May 1, 2018",4,"Love bitmoji but we need more individuality I absolutely love the most recent update to make face and hair options more realistic and to give us more options, however, there‚Äôs no option for my hair style so I don‚Äôt feel my bitmoji represents me well. I had to compromise. I think it would be great to have the same type of style, length and color options, but let us mix and match and choose the texture, the length, the bang style, the way it‚Äôs displayed on the avatar (like tucked behind the ears or one side in front of shoulder, one side behind the back etc)."
114,Bocas173,"June 28, 2018",3,"I like it, but it could use some work This app is cool and fun to use, and works pretty well. Saying that though, I do have super long hair, and there really aren‚Äôt a whole lot of options for it. I would really appreciate a long straight one with a side part, as there is a long one with a middle part, but it just doesn‚Äôt look that good. I think that the feature where you can take a photo should actually automatically make you bitmoji match the picture, because mine doesn‚Äôt do it. I am not sure if it actually does it on anyone else‚Äôs devices, but it should. I also think that there should be better outfit choices, because i do have trouble finding ones i actually like sometimes. I‚Äôm hoping that the creators will see this review and fix some of these things. Regardless of all the issues, this is a pretty good app, it could just use a little work."
115,esmewolvs,"December 16, 2018",4,"4 things people will love to have in the app (my opinion) Really love this app! I think it‚Äôs amazing to use for showing cool emotions. But here is something I think many people will want. 1 I think some like piercings for ears and nose etc. 2 something I really want is different hair color styles, like for example my hair is brown but it have a kinda bling streaks/lines and the app doesn‚Äôt have that. I really think that should include in also. 3 maybe more makeup color or styles will be very nice to change. 4 something that also many people have and like to have because it shows people how they are is tattoos. I think having some type of tattoo making will be very nice as well. "
116,Ime GY,"January 15, 2019",4,"Blind Accessibility I am a low vision Voice Over user. Many of the Stickers on facebook have become accessible in the manner that Voice Over describes the image. Example,Happy dog running and jumping with hearts. Some of the sticker options in this app are described very minimally and some only say sticker when I swipe across it. That means that particular sticker is vertically useless to me. If a very brief description, example:Happy woman jumping out of cake, Text says Happy Birthday. This would be immensely helpful for your Voice Over users. I understand that this kind of accessibility is provided by the developer. :ü•∞ especially since some of my text groups with friends and family can become strictly Bitmoji communications...which is super fun, but totally leaves me out of the convo unless someone is around to tell me what is on my screen."

118,Plushie Gaming,"June 6, 2019",5,"So. Much. Fun! Let me just say this straight-away: this app is fun. It‚Äôs a great way to communicate using both pictures and words, and it‚Äôs ALL for free! No buying the outfits, hairstyles, or stickers. No FRICKIN‚Äô pop-up ads like all the other free apps (and games). The only thing that‚Äôs for sale here is CUSTOMIZED MERCH. Super cool. You don‚Äôt even have to buy that if want, at least not to get any other privileges in the app. My point is, this isn‚Äôt one of those money-making schemes that most developers are making nowadays. It‚Äôs an honest and free app. The only thing NOT to like is the fact that the want to access your texts? Kinda weird/shady, but all you do instead is use the sticker app at the top o the keyboard-UI. Simple as that! Would recommend to anyone who likes Nintendo Miis, and/or emojis."

But there‚Äôs just one thing left, can you add piercings? Like you can chose what the earring looks like, the color, and where it goes on the ear. I would love it if you could do that because me and all my friends have piercings and Bitmoji and it would make the app better if people can really, truly, make it look like them and not as close to what looks like them. But a mini them. So please consider! Thanks! (Also sorry for saying ‚Äúthem‚Äù so much)"
120,Seventeenths,"February 10, 2018",3,"some suggestions... if i have to be honest, Bitmoji is great. i love the little avatars. they're so cute! and i also love the new update where we finally, FINALLY got more options for hair and hair color. why did that addition take so long? i'd just like to suggest some things for Bitmoji that it's kind of lacking.

121,KolorJunkie,"March 8, 2018",4,"Uh oh.. I updated the other day and got to thinking tonight, while spamming my friends with mini me‚Äôs if there were new outfits released. So I go into the app and when I went to outfits everything is gone. I went into the keyboard and hit the new outfit feature from there. It did pull up about six outfits, none of which are new...bummer, so i optimistically hit more. It took me to the app with an empty closet. So not only was there nothing new but now everything is gone. Sad day. I along with many others love the app and would love to see more outfits. Or just clothes in general. I don‚Äôt mind putting my own clothes together and even maybe a color wheel so I can pick the colors. I would play with her all the time. Hope y‚Äôall get it fixed soon and maybe even add more options. Thanks so much!! üòò"
122,JQHDANCER,"March 18, 2018",4,"Update Malfunction This review is mainly just for a new update, because version 25 says that there is ombre hair and that there are more hairstyles. I haven't seen those hairstyles since I updated the app. Though my friends have ombre hair and some of the new hairstyles. For example one has Blue ombre. One has a messy bun and two others have a new short, kinda wavy hair style.I can't seem to find a way to get those. And I don't want to risk loosing my character if I delete the app. But other than my Update Malfunction I really do enjoy the app. One more thing, I think that for the outfits you should be able to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes all separately from each other so that we can create our own outfits. Because Im not liking the outfits. The only ones I like are the crop top ones and I don't really wear crop tops.üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
123,BarneeHoyle,"July 5, 2018",4,"Keyboard glitchy I‚Äôm a huge fan and user, but over the last couple months the keyboard has started to get glitchy. It will reset itself back to the first page of Bitmojis frequently... its almost impossible to use the search feature and find a selection before it resets itself. The app itself works fine and I‚Äôve resulted to opening up the app when I‚Äôm having the most trouble, but it‚Äôs less easy to find the Bitmoji you want because there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a search feature in the app. I‚Äôve gone into settings and turned off the keyboard and turned it back on, that didn‚Äôt help.  I even deleted the whole app and reloaded it, that didn‚Äôt help either.  I don‚Äôt use any other non-standard keyboards, so I‚Äôm not sure if it might be a larger issue, or just with Bitmoji.  Thanks!"
124,Second Madmax,"July 16, 2018",5,"Opinion of the People Bitmoji is awsome. And like everyone else, I think that y‚Äôall have done great. Now I don‚Äôt know what you all are doing, whether your working on new things, or trying to fix the ones you‚Äôve made, but I really think that, if it is not any trouble, not to mention possible, that if you could make it where we can choose our own styles, item color, and similar things. I‚Äôm just a country boy from Alabama, but it seams to me that this is what people have been wanting and unless it messes up your format or makes little changes to everything, I reckon it‚Äôd b a good idea to do it. And paying for the app is what I‚Äôd b willing to do if that is the problem. Thanks again for the app guys (and/or girls)!!!! OH AND WE DONT HAVE ANY COWBOY HATS!!!! Please do this for us lol"
125,InfinityAppReviewer,"February 20, 2020",4,"BITMOJIS ARE A GO! I enjoy using Bitmojis so much. It gives my conversations so much more animation. However ,I have one suggestion that would make it a 5 üåü rate instead of 4. That suggestions would be piercings/earrings . I‚Äôve seen some Bitmojis that actually have em already,not sure if it was a glitch,hack or magic but it‚Äôs 2020, it should‚Äôve BEEN a thing by now. Get on it Bitstrips team.

I cannot COUNT how many people I know with braces. I‚Äôm also getting them soon. It would be nice to have that as a feature. Also, hair.. as much as you have a ton of choices, maybe having a mix and match for that too? Then there‚Äôs shirts. They‚Äôre just a teeny bit plain. There could be graphic tees, striped tees, or polka dots. And finally earrings, earrings would be cool to have in the ear section.

130,JaiMonkeys,"February 2, 2018",1,"I love you but.. Ok Bitmoji, I truly love you I really do. You seriously make communicating more fun. However, you recently added the avatars in monkey heads for the hear, see, and do no evil. I‚Äôm giving you the benefit of doubt and believe it‚Äôs just a coincidence these popped up during black history month. I‚Äôm also going to believe ignorance drove this appearance of insensitivity regardless of the month of the year. This stood out to me because I love monkeys but due to my ancestors and their struggle I will never ever wear a monkey suit. "
131,mrsasia,"April 10, 2018",1,"Hate new version!! My FORMERLY beloved Bitmoji was 5 stars LAST WEEK for me. NOW, it‚Äôs a ZERO!  All of a sudden, it crashed and after attempts to save it, I had to delete it and start all over. My user name and password did not work anymore, so I had to create a whole new account and new avatar. You no longer have my hairstyle, my eyes, and nose. I just spent an hour trying to create an avatar that looks similar to me without success. The newly exaggerated facial expressions are ridiculous. Now, every one has HUGE teeth as a focal point, yet you don‚Äôt have a choice for teeth, as you would eyes. I used to use Bitmoji every single day, for every emotion, for birthdays on Facebook. Friends loved them, so they signed up too. We had them on our keyboards. I‚Äôm erasing Bitmoji ASAP. Luckily, I saved a few copies of my frequently used Bitmojis, so at least I will have my birthdays and love-you‚Äôs covered. It was a big mistake to change the avatar art choices. I‚Äôm not the only one upset by the changes."
132,Lol....no,"April 23, 2018",3,It could use more detailing When it comes to some styles there‚Äôs really not much of an option. Especially the body types. There‚Äôs 4 types of skinny sizes and 1 type of big person. I‚Äôm not saying they have to have a wide range of bigger people but have the decency to be more realistic and add more then one body figure. There‚Äôs no medium sizes and it goes straight to one big person. As if smaller people are the only one deserving attention they just make a bunch of smaller ppl people and make 1 big person to categorize medium and bigger sizes....really. I‚Äôm bigger but I don‚Äôt look that big and it‚Äôs quite pathetic it takes them this long to realize they shouldn‚Äôt not done this in the first place. Plus there‚Äôs not a wide range in curly hair in all lengths. I would of just let this go by but I felt that the body types needed to be discussed bc it‚Äôs offending
133,I_Love_Horses101,"June 13, 2018",5,"LOVE it, but needs some improvements! I have been on bitmoji for quite some time now and I‚Äôve always loved it. I think it adds tons of character to any of my snaps and I love sending them to people, however customizing my bitmoji is always a pain. I like to change up my outfit every now and again but I feel like there isn‚Äôt much to choose from. I feel as though there should be an option to make your own outfit because most of the stuff on there, I would never actually wear. I think another improvement would be to allow people to choose their outfit anytime they want even within an app like Snapchat or in imessage. However I really do loveee my bitmoji! Just wish it had the same fashion sense as me"
134,ironkid06,"August 9, 2018",3,Still needs a lot of improvement I just delete Bitmoji because I was getting frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt create the perfect avatar for me. I settled for an avatar that has darker skin that I do and straight hair but in the way I brush my curly hair. 
135,Hoodie Obsessed,"January 5, 2019",4,"Just Some Suggestions Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a great app, but I feel like there could be some improvements. For example, more hairstyles. As someone with hair just a little past my shoulders, I feel as if there isn‚Äôt really a lot of hairstyles for me. Plus I have wavy hair (straight when I‚Äôm not feeling lazy and want to fix it). There should also be an option to choose your own clothing. I like the idea of being able to personalize my clothing style, considering it‚Äôs lowkey kinda different than most of the outfits you can choose from. I also like the idea of being able to make your own hair color, kinda like being able to choose from the whole color spectrum. It‚Äôs good for people who‚Äôs hair does not really fit any of the given options. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great app!"
136,kkatxo,"April 3, 2019",2,"SIMPLE FIXES NEEDED TO MAKE IT A MORE ENJOYABLE APP 1. The biggest thing that I dislike about this app is that there is no ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù tab... you can‚Äôt save your favorite bitmojis.

137,aun15drea_ü§™,"May 14, 2019",4,"Some suggestions I have been using Bitmoji for a couple of years. Before the new style of the avatar came out. I was so happy to see if they finally had my hairstyle or the type of clothes I wear. I was sad to see it didn‚Äôt. My hair is curly and I usually have it in a high ponytail. But that wasn‚Äôt there. I also have a suggestion that I think every one would enjoy. It‚Äôs a create your own clothes feature. I think it would be cool to be able to pick the type of clothing, the color, and the design because it would be more personalized. I also would like to add that it would be amazing if you could add outfits with hoodies and maybe more adidas clothes. Also better shoes or just make that a custom feature too.

138,romo rojo ilove froyo,"January 15, 2020",2,"Crashed? So what happened in my case was that the first time I got this app was successful, I loved the clothes and everything was amazing! But, I accidentally clicked the guy gender and I didn‚Äôt notice. So when my sister got the app, I was helping her make an account and I saw there was a gender choice. So, I wanted to change my gender because of the girls clothes on the app. And after that I made another account because I have so many email accounts and when I was done with designing my character it booted me out and I tried to login and it said ‚Äúyour internet connection seems to be down, please try checking your internet connection and try again. So after making three more accounts and trying to login to my other ones countless times, I just gave up.

So many choices and options for your avatar. I like the recent update where you can put together an outfit with a shirt, bottoms, shoes, and outerwear instead of just finding one in the outfit section. I think it also makes it much easier to make your avatar look like you because you can dress it just the way you would. Just one suggestion. Could you please make a furry boot like uggs or bearpaws for the shoe options because I often wear those type of boots and I wish I could put them on my bitmoji too üòã overall I think it‚Äôs really great and super fun so I totally recommend it"
140,Cali redhead,"December 28, 2017",5,"Great app, super fun. Have idea I love the way this app gives you the ability to be more expressive. I think that with all the hair styles today which constantly change with what‚Äôs popular and with some people getting unique haircuts or dyeing their hair I think that the ability to make a custom hair cut and also be able to pick areas of the hair to dye would be a great addition to Bitmoji. I think that a plethora of different lengths, cuts, and the ability to have multiple sections of hair changed to better fit a person‚Äôs hair cut or style would be great and with the ability to toggle if you want detail in the hair or to have it with less detail. (ex. lines, texture, thickness) It would be awesome if the developer(s) did this."

I love all the different pictures to chose from and the outfits and everything. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that there are very few options for pregnant people like myself. üò© That makes me sad because all the baby bump outfits are more summer and spring like and it‚Äôs currently winter. It would be wonderful if the baby bump was a body type instead of an outfit because we all know it is indeed a body type and not an outfit. Us pregnant people would like to be able to wear any outfit and still showcase our baby bump! Over all the app is wonderful but I think this adjustment would make it even better. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be a lot of work and whatnot but it‚Äôs something to think about. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î I only gave it such a low rating because I noticed the lower ratings get more replies back than the higher ones! üòÇüòÇ I do actually love the app. üíï"

However, I felt like the new update offered a ton of options for clothing, make-up, accessories and such, but not enough options on facial/body features. All of the mouth options are super wide and the eye options are also limited. I feel like more mouth size and general mouth options are needed. The mouth in the new update is so distinct that since it is wide it automatically makes the Bitmoji look nothing like me so I switched back to the old version. As for the eyes, I think you‚Äôve got the shapes down, but the eye angles in the new update are very limiting, it makes many of them look the same. I do like that the eye size is now customizable. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt care if I have a million clothing and accessory options if I can no longer get the Bitmoji to look like me."
143,Andreaüôä,"June 1, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs great but it needs more... I‚Äôve loved Bitmoji ever since it came to Snapchat because it makes chatting more fun. I do have to say that I have a love hate relationship with the Bitmoji Deluxe because I can never make it look like me. I think it would be a great idea to add sliders to the app so we can change the size of our eyes, nose, and lips so they look more realistic. I personally have VERY small round eyes and less wide lips and adding a slider to this app would definitely help me create a Bitmoji that looks a bit more like me. Also, I agree with many other reviews when it comes to the clothing. ADD MORE CLOTHES! Dang, I haven‚Äôt been able to ‚Äúwear‚Äù clothes that resemble my style either... "
144,Puppylover0954,"July 29, 2018",4,"Amazing but suggestions I love bitmojis and I feel like there could be things to make them even better. First off, I think there should be animals/pets added to your character, maybe add another app called Petmoji where you can select any basic pet and add others as you improve. Maybe your pet could even interact with your friends and play games or something. Second, there should be more frequent outfit that are more of today‚Äôs style. Third, I‚Äôd really love if we could change the color of outfits because sometimes we don‚Äôt like the colors they‚Äôre chosen and we could personalize it with our own colors and/or patterns. Maybe even make our own style. "

I love being able to customize my character how I please, and with all the new hairstyle and other customization features, it‚Äôs very easy to do so. But one thing that would make me ecstatic is if there were Bitmojis with pride flags on them. During pride month they were available, but have since disappeared. The classic pride rainbow over the Bitmojis head is still available, which is great, but I feel that other flags of LGBTQ+ community would be a great addition. For example, bisexual, lesbian, pansexual, asexual, polysexual, aromatic, etc. I think that this would certainly make, not only me, but other members of the LGBTQ+ community very happy."

149,wypbp,"October 29, 2019",2,"53 ‚ÄúHair Treatment‚Äù options but no adequate curly hair styles? The thing that has always kind of bothered me about Bitmoji is how there are extensive options in one category, but then very few in another. For example, there are no medium-length curly men‚Äôs styles, and the one closest to my hair (which is the first curly women‚Äôs style) is, quite frankly, hideous and simply not a haircut anyone has. I‚Äôm really not asking for much, just a little more diversity in the hair department with styles that aren‚Äôt obscure, that people actually have. Also, hats still just overlap hair and you can see it around the sides, which looks really unnatural but would be an easy fix. It‚Äôs been years ‚Äî please take care of this.

As Someone Who Often Likes My Hair Done In A Pompadour Style, It‚Äôs Disappointing To See That There Isn‚Äôt An Option Like That There, And There‚Äôs A Lot Of Popular Hairstyles Not Being Represented On Here, And That Can Alienate Potential Users. 2. Please Change How You Can Choose Your Clothing. I‚Äôm Fine With The Pre-Made Assets, But It Would Be Nice To Have The User Choose Their Own Combination Of Shirt, Shoe Type, And Pants/Shorts Types.

Like others have said, there's not enough skin color and hair options. Maybe people have the darker roots look with ombr√© or highlights and as someone else said, it would be nice to have that option as well (I personally would want a dark blonde roots option with white streaks/lengths). Furthermore, the blush tones are sort of strange, I'm very pale so only one of them looks okay on mine (also, what's up with the jet black and stark white blushes? More taupes or light browns would be nice) and a contour option would be cool too. More body types are needed too--there's basically just variations of hourglass skinny and ""fit"" (with minimal muscle) types and one apple shaped body type that carries most of the weight in the gut.

152,Child of the true King,"January 7, 2018",4,"Awesome! But could use some more. I love Bitmoji, it has so many stickers that can match almost any circumstance you need, but there are a few things that I would add. It would be amazing if you could make more than one Bitmoji, like make your whole family or some friends. But most of all, I wish you could make pets. I really want to make an emoji for my dog, because being in Junior High I love to send pictures of my dog and I to my friends, and the dog Bitmojis in some of the stickers look nothing like my dog. And I am sure there would have to be some cats, horses and other pets in there too. Overall Bitmoji is really good, it just needs a few things to add.

My grands are just now getting to that age where I‚Äôm still cool! Yay me! Here‚Äôs the BUT... I don‚Äôt have the body of a young gal! I could cheat and make mine not look like me but then, well it wouldn‚Äôt look like me! And that‚Äôs the whole point of the app!

157,sans plays trombone,"November 26, 2018",3,"Pretty good, but... This is a pretty good app. It is fun to use, and it has a lot a variety! I use it all the time in texting, and I like to change the avatar around. However, one of the most fun parts of using the bitmoji app is designing characters, and It would be a lot better if you could save different characters designs. It would make the app so much better and worthwhile if you could have multiple avatars, that you could save and switch between. Even if there are a limited amount of avatars you can change, I still think it would be a lot better! If you could, I would 100% give this app a 5 star rating. Also, a few of the bitmojis swear, so if that‚Äôs not your thing, just be careful :). In conclusion, it‚Äôs a good app, make multiple save able avatars, and some of the stickers swear :3."

Anyways, I have a idea.  Your app allows the stickers to be put on text messages, so this gave a me idea.  What if you made a sticker where you can put down (Ex: High Five) the first person could put down a sticker of a person with the little high five thing.  Then the second person could look up in the search bar High Five.  There, there would be the one they pasted AND one to respond, so then you could put yourself into THEIR bitmoji!  You could do it with hugs, high fives, even make us into birds and allow us to fly over the sunset in costumes!"
159,VenerableLiquid,"July 20, 2019",4,"Fun App, But Needs More Variety Bitmoji is really fun, but like some of the other reviewers I would like to see more variety in the outfits. Period styles and some long, full skirts here, please. Not one of the outfits reflects my style. They are all very similar, no variety in the skirts, and no feminine dresses. All the dresses look cheap. There is one outfit that reflects how I dressed in high school, but that was a long time ago! Also, there isn‚Äôt a real option for med-long curly hair. There are loose waves, and an Afro, neither of which is right for me. I‚Äôm in between those options. Other than that, I feel there are a lot of options for facial features and you can really make it look like a cartoon version of yourself. The actual stickers are fun and have a good amount of expression."

I'm Jewish and during the holiday season I would like to see more hannukah stuff instead of just all Christmas, Christmas has so many option to choose from, hannukah only has one. It would be nice to see my bitmoji lighting the hannukiah or spinning a dreidel with another emoji user. Great app, but I think it needs to be a little more open to other religions, and not just Judaism either!! I checked how many things there are for Islam and bahai and there is definitely not as many options for those two either, even though they are also some of the most popular religions in the world. It would be great to see a bit more diversity in this app!!!"
161,Lsbbball,"June 13, 2018",4,"Great app with a few issues I love this app! It‚Äôs so fun especially with Snapchat, but one big problem is with skin tones. There definitely needs to be more options, a tanner option for example. Second big one is that there should be an option to add beauty marks. Personally, that‚Äôs one of my most prominent features and I would love to show it on my Bitmoji. Another problem is the noses. There is only one kind one nose that doesn‚Äôt look completely terrible, and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone use any other nose besides that one. Lastly, your main users are probably teenage girls, and the Hollister section was good, but there needs to be more trendy but casual outfits. Again, this is a wonderful app that I enjoy to use, but there could just be a few things changed."

EXCEPT i can give myself realistic eyebrows. i prefer the bitmoji delux characters but my eyebrows are always hidden behind the frames of my glasses which i guess wouldn't be an issue if you had better thickness for eyebrows. i look at your thickest options for eyebrows and want to rip my hair out because if THATS THICK for everyone else then i guess i'm just a monster cursed with insanely thick eyebrows. but i don't think it's even that thick? i don't know but i feel stupid when my bitmoji delux thot doesn't have eyebrows bc they're so small they're the thickness as my glasses frame. anyways i guess it's come a long way but jesus
166,CarenW,"April 7, 2019",4,"Suggestion, PLEASE add a search in the app itself The Bitmoji is bigger when you use the Bitmoji app itself as opposed to using from the text message app. keyboard. Can you add a search in the Bitmoji app itself?  For example, when using the Bitmoji app, you have to go through the entire selection at the bottom of categories to find the Bitmoji you want but when using it from the text message app keyboard, you can put in a search and it brings up the specific Bitmoji. To add the search in the Bitmoji app itself would be soooo helpful because the Bitmoji‚Äôs are bigger.  I was wondering why everyone‚Äôs Bitmoji is bigger than mine, it‚Äôs because they use the app itself rather than they keyboard in the text message app. It‚Äôs a great app though."

It would just take me to no clothes when I tried to switch the pants or shoes or the shirt when you went to the personalizing area even though I would like to keep either the shirt, pants, or shoes. My next complaint that my friends share is the hairs. There is straight wavy but not too curly and super curly.

I also think, that there should be a way to make your own outfits. I would love it if they also had more hair styles in the medium length range, there are some, but not enough! None of them line up with my hair, and my bitmoji, is supposed to look like me. Well I thought. I have been using the bitmoji app for a while now, I love the updates!

Saying this it is still hard to create an accurate Bitmoji when there are a limited amount of choices. I am not talking about different hat colors or t-shirt opinions. I am mainly talking about body choices. There are five different body choices to pick from. The first four are all skinny in different ways while the fifth one is really fat. I am not skinny but I am also not that fat and it is kind of annoying since you have thousands of clothing options and only five body types to count for the millions of people in the world. So like I said, the app is fine but really needs to step up its game."

I and many of my friends would appreciate if you added this single picture, it would make our lives complete. Thank you for your consideration, and this addition would make the world a much better place for those who understand the memery behind it.

173,darth diaper,"January 13, 2019",4,"PLEASE ADD DISABLED FEATURES I think that Bitmoji should have features compatible to people with disabilities. Some examples could be a prosthetic arm or leg, crutches, wheelchair, casts, and other things. If a Bitmoji is a totally customizable character creator, it should have totally customizable features. I have had a foot injury for a long time and would like to add crutches or a boot/cast to my character because my injury is a big part of my appearance now. I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt be the only person who would really appreciate this update because lots of people have much more severe situations than me, and they deserve to be represented as well!

I don‚Äôt get why some of the cutest outfits are in maternity. I doubt anyone is gonna make their bitmoji wear an outfit like that cuz it‚Äôs maternity. If you could make cuter outfits like some in maternity that would be great and if we could be able to choose clothes separately not a whole outfit that would be great.

Oh wait, one more think, I think it would be awesome if we could design our own Bitmoji expressions and if it‚Äôs approved by the creators, everyone could use it!

For body types I do wish that there was a size variety between skinny and wide. I would like to see the option of being able to create your own outfit look. Because as of now some of the article of clothes in a few of the outfits don‚Äôt look good together.

I feel that it is necessary to not reuse clothes from previous seasons. If you have new clothes, it gives Bitmoji a fresher, cleaner feeling. When you have the same clothes from the last year, it‚Äôs not as exciting and enjoyable. You still have fun customizing your clothes, but it‚Äôs with the SAME CLOTHES from the LAST YEAR/SEASON!!

As well as, eye colors my eyes are not a dark brown but a light brown and the next shade is a hazel-ish color but the hazel choices are not well chosen. I also wish there would be more outfit choice. There‚Äôs a lot of costume choices which I think is irrelevant but I really press for more on outfit choices. Every time I update, I cross my fingers to see if any outfits were added in the wardrobe but no luck. Please fix this and add outfit choices please!!!!!"
201,482993639272818:782727,"February 28, 2018",4,Amazing but needs some features I love Bitmoji and I love how it works with snapchat. One of the things I really like in snapchat is the Bitmojis that have your avatar and your friend‚Äôs avatar I wish they would put that feature into iMessages. Another thing that should be added is there should be a feature where you pick a shirt then you pick pants and shoes because sometimes I will find a shirt I want but I don‚Äôt like the pants or shoes. Another thing is there should be more straight hair styles and there should be double French braids. Also I found a hairstyle in bitstrips I really liked that looked like me but they don‚Äôt have that one in the Bitmoji deluxe version. Please put the hairstyles from bitstrips into the Bitmoji deluxe version.
202,Zebraface101,"April 15, 2018",4,"Cool It‚Äôs awesome to be able to customize your own bitmoji and see your friends‚Äô on Snapchat. However, I really think there are a couple things that couple be better. First, more hair options. I understand there are a lot but I just can‚Äôt find one that matches mine, and also more options for the color of hair, because I 1. Have a weird shade and 2. Have two shades but I have short hair so I can‚Äôt do dual or even triple, like my hair is. I also think that the way mine‚Äôs face is is kind of odd and I wish there were more choices for smaller heads/jaws. I think body types are okay but also need a little more diversity, and finally multiple bitmojis at once would be really cool, like switching between several."
203,Elle beissa c,"May 1, 2019",1,needs an update Bitmoji is a great app. It‚Äôs become an important aspect of the snap universe but there is one fatal flaw. The outfits in this app lack creativity my and basic style. If you are looking for any individuality whatsoever this app is not for you. I often struggle to identify my friends on Snapchat because as we are all basic we all have the same outfits in bitmoji. One drastic way to improve this app that I have heard from many of my peers is to add more outfits options and make the outfit processes more involved on the app. I would like to be able to wear and tank top that‚Äôs pink with a pair of jeans that are from another outfit combo - and what about jewelry or shoes? Becky and Jennifer and Kristen all are wearing the same outfit and it seems like the time more a change. This app could boost its ratings and activity as well as profit if they made an update that lets users creature out out looks. Thank you!
204,FalconEye95,"May 22, 2019",4,"More facial customization? I love bitmoji, so much so that I got my mom on board! The only thing I really - I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúhave a problem with‚Äù per say - wish they‚Äôd have? Is a few more customization options in terms of facial features, hair, and stuff like that. I mean they have a TON right now and I love it, but I know a few people who haven‚Äôt been satisfied with their bitmoji because some of the features about themselves that they love aren‚Äôt included. Plus, I‚Äôm a total sucker for good hair in character customization. It just seems like everyone I know has the same exact hair option, though. Maybe some variations of the same kinds of styles?

Although it‚Äôs a great app, there can be some features that will make the app even better. 1.)Make more emotions and stickers. For example maybe a bored sticker or even a wrestling sticker would be nice. People would be able to express themselves more. 2.)Hairstyles needs to be fixed with the hats. When you add big hair to a Bitmoji with big hair, the hat just looks like it is placed on top of the hair without actually covering up. 3.)More custom outfits, I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing hype beast fits or clothes you would find in real life"

The app has definitely improved and I love being able to customize my avatar and send them to my friends; however, there‚Äôs just one problem. For a couple months now, I‚Äôve noticed that the app freezes every time I open it. I have to close it out and reopen it an hour or so later for it to work again. It also freezes on the message app when I go to send a Bitmoji to someone. Also, when I go to customize my avatar sometimes it lets me customize but other times it will let me click on everything EXCEPT that. I hope that these bugs will be fixed within the next update.

215,Jampaaaaaaa,"August 24, 2018",2,"Cute but not practical! So, I communicate with my friends in 3 different languages. And the only way to change the bitmojis language is switching the phone language. Every time you do that you need to wait for your phone to restart. That‚Äôs not convenient at all. Why not include all the languages in the search, like the gifs keyboards?! If I‚Äôm searching for some word in Spanish - give me results for bitmojis in Spanish - if I‚Äôm searching for English, give me English results. And the same for other languages... Or at least come up with something automatic that the phone language doesn‚Äôt need to be switched in order to search for bitmojis in other languages. "

Can there also be more eye colors? The last thing I wish for is that there can be more lips, like bigger or some with piercings (I also wish that noses could have piercings).

217,hodgette12,"November 29, 2019",4,"Updated Clothes and Hairstyles As much as I love the many options that you have to customize your Bitmoji I believe that it‚Äôs time for some more. I feel like there should be more hair style choices, or better yet a way to mix them. Say you wanted a certain hairstyle but you wanted it parted on the left or the middle or the right, you should be able to do that (this is primarily targeted at girls hairstyles). Also I do feel that there needs be an update in the clothing choices. Using different brands, having more clothing choices in general.

That‚Äôs why me and my friends dress up our bitmoji‚Äôs as different things. For starters I think you should add a mask like ones you use if your sick because of this journey and second off  I think you should make it where you search something up, or you create your own ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù and outfits.

It‚Äôd be nice to have a few more realistic hair designs. Also, the outfits, I just wanna scroll through more options and exchanging clothes with one another instead of having a complete outfit done alone. I can‚Äôt find any that really suit me.

222,DONT EGNORE,"June 3, 2018",5,"Add this to your next update Ok I love the app and it is a good way to customize your Bitmoji . But I have some suggestions to add to your next update, braces, you can add braces to give people a less limited variety of add ons. Also you can add mini games to maybe attract more children to get the app. Also you can add edges so your hair can be slayed to the gods. Also nail polish and a wide variety of it like glittery,Crome,long,short and all different shapes these are just some new additions to the app you can make to the app to make it better if you add these You know I will be using it way more also if we could customize our own clothing it would be great"

I really like that you can use bitmoji with your friends in messages as well as Snapchat. One thing that I would like the app to have is a place where you can assemble your own outfit instead of having to pick from a set outfit. For me, at least, there are some outfits with a top that I would wear that looks good, but the pants don‚Äôt look good at all on my bitmoji or on me irl. I‚Äôm not even into fashion and wearing good looking clothes at all, but it would be nice to have the chance to put together an outfit that I would actually wear.

I would like to be able to make my own outfit instead of having to choose from the present outfits. I think this would benefit people to express their individual creativity and style. Also i would really like to see more relaxed styles. Like hoodies, sweatpants, leggings, ect. Most high school and college aged students use this app, and that is what most wear and are most comfortable in."

But I would recommend this app for anyone who has Snapchat it makes the world a little easier.‚Ä¶anyway the Bitmoji is kind of unsafe. For  one people can find out what you look like which could be kind of dangerous in the world.

The upgrade I‚Äôd like to see is the option to have a white background because some text are not visible on iPhone‚Äôs dark mode.

The only thing that I have to say is that there are some inappropriate Bitmojis, but the app is rated 12+, so it‚Äôs not meant for little kids.

I also agree with other people about the need to customize. Considering Bitmoji is a way for users to express themselves virtually through an avatar, I feel we should have options to change certain things such as the length of hair, how curly/wavy/straight it is, combinations of outfits as well as colors for items of clothing, and different stickers to showcase more of our different personalities.

I love the app and I love the diverse features you guys have given with skin color, hair type/texture...etc. However, i give it two stars because I think body type/shapes should be more diverse. You should include a size right in between the last two sizes because A LOT of people fall in between that...the size right before the biggest body type is too small. Perhaps you guys should think about including a ‚Äúspectrum size bar‚Äù or maybe have a more options to choose between different body part sizes. You guys did it with the chest sizes for the female Bitmoji. Consider adding different sizing for butts/legs/hips/arms so we can adjust our sizes accordingly. After all, the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part of Bitmoji is the fact that we can make our characters look like us."

I want to be able to make my bitmoji look like me and dress my style and wear something I'd wear like not a select outfit I guess? And maybe more freedom with jewelry cause I love chokers but I find I can't wear a choker with a outfit because it doesn't come with the outfit. I'm not sure I guess just more freedom on clothes piercings tattoos even maybe? And maybe even makeup because I love makeup and I'm not really able to express that with bitmojis current functions.

249,CybermanFord,"July 10, 2019",4,"Great, but here‚Äôs a few suggestions! I love using Bitmoji, but it would be great if you could do more things. I wish there was more freedom of choice when you create an avatar. I don‚Äôt like the fact that you can only choose one whole outfit, and even though there are many, it would still be great if you could actually separate clothing. Like, you could choose some pants, and then go and choose a shirt, and whatnot. I also wish there were more hats and accessories. Also, I wish there were more selfies and faces, and it would also be great if you could have a selfie automatically create a Bitmoji as an option, instead of it being a one-time thing."
250,I‚ù§Ô∏èBrooklyn and Bailey,"January 1, 2018",4,"A few problems This app is great! It‚Äôs really fun to change your avatars outfit and style. I have found a few problems with this app though. I have recently changed my avatar from the BitMoji option to a BitStrip. I changed it because I have long hair, and the longest length for the normal BitMoji is to your shoulders. I decided to try the BitStrips option. Sure enough, there‚Äôs long hair. I like the BitMoji look better than the BitStrips look, but I hate having short hair on it. Another problem I have with this, is that the eye liner or whatever it is on the BitStrips is a little off on it. It looks bad. But other than that, it‚Äôs great! Once you change those, I‚Äôll rate this app 5 stars."

They update frequently, giving you even more to love. The most recent update added different hair colors, better graphics, a wider selection of almost everything, etc. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever faced any problems with this app and the fact that it connects to Snapchat is spectacular. I don‚Äôt think I can make ANY suggestions to Bitmoji, it is just truly remarkable. I hope I influenced your choice and I know you will love this app! It is such a great way to express yourself over chat."
252,Sam.Perryy,"April 13, 2018",4,Too based on societal norms I love bitmoji however I‚Äôm a biological female who presents myself as a male and is more androgynous and gender neutral than female. I feel like bitmoji is very gendered to male or female I want my bitmoji to look like me and there aren‚Äôt many options for a female who dresses as a male. I only wear boy clothes and I feel that bitmoji should mix all the clothing choices together for others this way I don‚Äôt have to make my bitmoji a boy to have the clothes i wear. I also think piercings and glasses should have more options and that there should be facial piercings and different ear piercing styles. I think jewelry accessories should be added as well. Overall bitmoji is steered towards mainstream society it‚Äôs 2018 make a bold move.
253,Dena Ivey,"January 26, 2019",5,Totally love it!! I have always loved this app!  My husband and I text each other every day with conversations using nothing but bitmoji's. 
254,Cody801,"May 5, 2019",5,"Super awesome! I‚Äôm reading a lot of really weird and lame complaints. One guy complained because his avatars wouldn‚Äôt download so he purchased faster internet speed so they would download faster. He literally purchased faster net service for a cell phone app!!! Should I go on with this? Most others complain about the clothing options or other things regarding style. I get that but I‚Äôd like to bring that to the developers as a suggestion not a complaint. Whoever made this app worked hard and that‚Äôs why, besides the style complaints that we all love it. This app is awesome. Great job! I can‚Äôt wait for the next update."
255,Cheerfulelestia,"June 5, 2019",3,"A bit missing... It needs more clothing and hair options. I also think this app should be more customizable like adding hazel eyes, and being able to put more than one special feature on because some people have both freckles AND dimples. I feel like braces and one cheeked dimples would be awesome. I think it would be a good idea to add body scales as well so that the character looks more personalized. The skinny body‚Äôs are too skinny for me, but the bigger ones are too big.. Overall this needs more customization. My biggest request in definitely for more cute hairstyles. Other than what‚Äôs missing the app is pretty cool and there is sooooo many variations of each little picture you can send to your friends."
256,Sydthekid64,"June 8, 2019",4,"One little upgrade So I luv this app and all but some things they forgot, first off for the outfits there shouldn‚Äôt be just one whole outfit. U should be able to pick your top then your bottoms. Also for the boys there is not many great options. I am a girl but I‚Äôm with the boys on this one. My Bitmoji wears the boy clothes, and I do like the outfit it‚Äôs wearing but all boys r different. Also there should maybe creating your shirt and pants and maybe your own logo or saying. There should be accessories like earrings necklaces bracelets chokers and etc. And I don‚Äôt think there should be language there is some kids out there ya know. Otherwise luv the app. Well done and great sayings and logos(besides the language)"

258,kinglesbo,"March 20, 2020",3,"not enough diversity As far as I know, this app is meant to be a way to express yourself through an emoji format, yet it does a poor job allowing it's users full reign and choice. With the evergrowing amount of diversity in the appearance of today's youth, bitmoji just doesn't keep up. There's a lack of options that leads to limiting freedom of expression. There are no piercings, not enough makeup options, not enough hair options or clothing options etc. Furthermore, i think the app would benefit from better hat and hair interaction options, specially allowing the hairstyles to be tucked into whatever hat option you choose. Also, can we have a pink skin option? Honestly, the app itself works perfectly fine, it's just the lack of expression."

260,Catterox101,"December 10, 2017",4,"Update Customizing I love this app and it's great, but we need more options for hair color - darker red hair, darker colorful hair (barely anyone has neon hair anymore), and maybe some hair color that's balayage. We also need more skin shades because i am very pale but not as pale as the lightest shade which makes me look white. More hairstyles would be cool too because i have collarbone length pin straight hair and there isn't even an option for that.....i either have to have long hair or some weird short hair that looks like a mom's hair (no offense). also different body types would be great, maybe change it to a scale so people can decide how big or small they want their bitmoji width and height to be? thanks!"
261,Br¬£n[}@n,"April 10, 2018",5,"Great no awesome But... I love the feature where you can do collaborate in bitmoji with Snapchat. What I don't love about it is that you can only do it with Snapchat. Also the bitmoji closet is so small. Maybe you should make a feature where you make your own outfit. Where you could choose whatever pants you like, whatever shirt you like, and whatever ever you like. I absolutely love this app but these features would make it way better. I want to be able to collaborate with Bitmoji on Messages or Hangouts too. I want to have more accessibility to outfits and custom outfits. Please consider making this update."

And the only one lighter is to light. I would like more in between options for people with other types of natural hair colors. I wear colorful glasses (blue, pink and yellow stripes) and I think that the glasses should be customizable. And I think you should have little scales for bodies. Because everyone it different. And also. Can someone add in certain areas with highlights (my hair is brown with blonde highlights in the front) and I need to see things happen with the outfits! We need more clothing. It's spring and my bitmoji is either boiling or freezing. There is not in between. Thanks"

You really need to be able to search in Bitmoji like you can when you pull it up on Snapchat- like if I want to send a happy face I should be able to search the word happy and all the happy faces come up. Also, I really wish that you could save certain ones that you like and you know that you would use frequently. It just takes so much time to look through all of them and it‚Äôs difficult to find which one you really want to use without it taking forever."

It seems like Bitmoji has an expressive reaction to every situation I can think of!! Love this app! One feature that I would really appreciate is to all users to ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù inside the app for a specific expression, just like we can inside our texting apps. Since I save the Bitmojis as photos and use them in marketing and coaching materials (like flyers and email), I would like to be able to quickly access images without needing to take a screen shot or save through my texting app."

Those were the Bitmoji Deluxe and new clothes, but lately there hasn‚Äôt been anything new. No new clothing, no new hair styles, nothing. And like I said in my previous reviews, having the clothings all together doesn‚Äôt allow us as users to get very creative with our Bitmojis. I really hope that you guys are working on something big and exciting for this app whether it‚Äôs more hair styles, the ability to change individual clothing pieces, anything other than ‚Äúbug fixes and improvements‚Äù because it‚Äôs getting boring."
270,Use to like the game!,"October 6, 2017",5,Love...but why? The body sizes go from small and skinny to a potato. There needs to be like one more size between the last two where the Bitmoji has big arms and big legs but a smaller stomach. Like curvy I guess you could say. I‚Äôm not skinny by any means. But I am no potato. I feel fat shamed to pick the biggest one but it kinda puts my self esteem down. Please add one more size between the last two and make it more proportional please. Other than that I love this app. I use it for everything! People just always wonder why I use le potato build when oh nay nay I am none of those sizes. PLEASE CHANGE!

However, after using bitmoji for a few years, I notice that a lot of my friends bitmojis look somewhat the same. I realized there‚Äôs a bunch of short hair styles for girls but only a handful of long hair options. Maybe in the next update more long hair options for girls would be great. Even an update that could make outfits more customizable would help, where you could pick out the exact top, pants, and shoes to wear.

I went to Avatar on the bottom of the screen and I pushed it but nothing happened. Then I went to settings in the game and I pushed CHANGE AVATAR STYLE.

For the next big update, I would love it if you gave us options to chose a different top, pants, and shoes for every outfit. Just take the existing parts of the outfits (shoes, tops, pants) and make them into separate categories where you can change their color and create your own.

Especially now with how Snapchat is set up where your Bitmoji is kind of front and center. This represents a person and I feel like there could be so much more variety.

I would just like it to be more open and have the makeup option for both sexes and maybe add another gender other than male and female. Some people feel a mix and the question of their gender can be very uncomfortable. Please add makeup and more feminine clothing options, after all the world is changing in ways for the better.

Most of my girl friends have much longer hair than I give options for and so it becomes a choice of whether u want it to look more like yourself ‚Äîbut kind of demented?‚Äî or have it be cute but not how your hair looks.

Again, not too worried about it and not sure what the problem is but it would be really cool if that could be fixed."

I just uninstalled it for the third and last time until I read where they have fixed this issue. When I switch to the Bitmoji keyboard in iMessage, I kiss my regular keyboard goodbye. There‚Äôs no getting it back - even when I disable the Bitmoji keyboard in settings, it still won‚Äôt allow my regular keyboard to be used. Instead, when I reopen messenger after disabling Bitmoji, I get a message - where my regular keyboard SHOULD BE - that tells me the Bitmoji keyboard does not have full access and provides a link to my keyboard settings! My only option is to turn bitmoji keyboard back on. Thanks for being such a dictator. You‚Äôre outta here until you fix this."
299,Lulu Freij,"March 20, 2020",4,"Amazing but I‚Äôd wish it was better This app truely is awesome its also very fun to use, but I‚Äôd wish there were more hairstyles espacially for the girls because I can‚Äôt tend to find curly hair, all I find is really fluffed up hair. That goes to the bitmoji selfies, too. Another major thing I face problems with is finding a shade or colorthat matches my hair color because when we dye our hair you know we also want our bitmoji to look like us too. For example the purple colors are either too dark or straight pink. I hope you guys fix this and give in extra colors and maybe even add piercings like nose rings or studs. But like overall this app is one of the best üíô"

It would also be cool if there were new outfits with each update as well. Spice it up a bit- I get bored wearing the same clothes all the time. I like to pick clothes that are my style in real life, so I only have limited outfits to choose from so they look like me.

My bisexual friend actually cried when she saw it because she‚Äôs never been represented in an app like this before. The only note I have is that you add a few more hair styles (particularly on the curly variety) because I can‚Äôt find anything that really matches.

I also feel that we should be able to customize our own outfits because, some of the tops I like for myself but I hate the pants and shoes! I feel we should have the option of skinny jeans, or other kinds that people like and different shoes that we can change the colors on and style.

It‚Äôs so silly and funny to use when sending these to other people!!! I definitely recommend this app, especially for iMessage!

And I have a friend that has curly hair but is not as dramatic as the one in bitmoji so she has to use a wavy hair style that looks nothing like her natural hair.

The stickers you can send are awesome, and I love the many ways you can design your bitmoji. However, there are two major flaws with this app (in my opinion). You are only allowed to make one bitmoji, and if the game let you make multiple bitmoji saved as outfits, that would be amazing. Also, it would be great if they added more stickers and more outfits. It would be nice if they let you break down the outfits into different genres. For example, you could choose socks, shoes, shirts, pants, and jackets/coats/hoodies. All of these additions would make bitmoji more diverse and a better app."

It could be cool because you could make your friends who don‚Äôt have Bitmoji and also you could make your avatar saved with a different outfit on in case we are unable to find an outfit that was taken off and hard to search for.

But I would definitely like to see Bitmoji improve in trend wise, I think Bitmoji should make different hair styles and a forever 21 outfit sections.

320,Monkey18-,"September 29, 2017",4,Outfits The only problem I have with the Bitmoji outfits is that's I think you should be able to access old outfits that you've had on before because when I accidentally changed my bitmoji outfit I had a limited addition footlocker Collaboration jacket that's when I accidentally changed and now i don't have that jacket I want that jacket back because it's the only thing I like especially cause I'm picky with everything meaning clothes too and being a girl makes it worse so I'd like it so you can access you're past bitmoji outfits from the past even limited outfits from the past that you've worn

I often wear natural twists if my hair isn't braided or in an afro. I have seen a few variations of dreadlocks, but no twists. I ended up using a wavy male hairstyle in place of this. I wish you guys could add more hairstyles for everyone. The other thing is more of a suggestion. Maybe instead of having all the clothes as single outifts, users can mix and match different bottoms with tops to creat the ultimate unique look. That is all, and great app"
323,Cia.Reviews,"November 2, 2018",1,"It's okay There really isn't any curly hair to choose from even after this much time has passed. Skin tones are still limited, the curls are scarce and the types of curly hair you have to choose from are even less. The keyboard constantly crashes for me and the app doesn't even open outside of snapchat so I can't even use it. Theres a lot of straight and kind of wavy hair options but forget it if you've got classic spiral curly. In bitstrip there used to be a wheelchair option but that has yet to return, which is disappointing consider the demand for a more inclusive character customization experience has always been around. It's a good character/avatar app if you have a popular style of some sort. Not sure if anyone else has the problem with constant crashes but it gets pretty annoying"

First, please keep adding new outfits to wear, like t-shirts that aren't just one color, or a blazer with a bow tie (please add a bow tie).  Second, it would be really cool if we could make our own bitmojis, like with custom words, fonts, colors, clothes for our guy (without changing your normal clothes), and poses.  This would help me use them way more often because it's hard to find oune that's perfect for a situation before the topic goes away.

I like the premade outfit idea so maybe for those who like that instead, there should be a button or something.

347,"GreatGame,But...","January 11, 2020",5,"Amazing, but... I have used bitmoji for more than three years now, and I am loving it! It is a really fun way to express myself, so good that you could just have a conversation of just bitmojis."
348,Mattwick101,"November 4, 2019",4,Great but needs updated facial hair I‚Äôll give this five stars when you update your facial hair selections. There are tons of options with other aspects in the app but then it seems like you wimped out on facial hair. I always trim in unique ways and so it‚Äôs a blend of different styles and non of the presets in the app seems fits right. I need to be able to pick the different elements individually or overlap some of them so it actually looks like me. And there needs to be some extra clothing options as well. Like maybe choosing color from a color pallet for the clothing you already have would improve it greatly. Thanks.
349,Kass m rivera,"August 4, 2019",5,"Can you come up with bitmoji alive like Memoji ? It will be a great idea if the Bitmoji can come up with a similar look a like the bitmoji just like the memojis and Animoji Meaning we can take pictures and look like our own Bitmoji and video clips for Snapchat and Instagram just like the iPhone Xr has they can take photos with the face of their character and video as well for the ones I don‚Äôt have the xr will be awesome, Just hoping you guys can do something like that would be really great and everybody will love it I know it because a lot of people would love to have them memoji‚Äôs"
350,Rosey5282,"September 23, 2017",5,"I love it but... This app is great and I love that I can use it in snapchat and on my messaging app. The only issue I have are the outfits available. I think you should offer more skirt options as I'm Pentecostal and only wear skirts. Not mini skirts either. There should be longer lengths even dresses or maxi skirts. Skirts are always in season, but not that short. I think it would be nice to be able to coordinate your outfits like you do accessories. Separately. Other than that I love Bitmoji and will continue to use it but would like more options that are modest and not so skimpy."

I love the new style in bitmoji deluxe. Every time I‚Äôm texting in group chats I always use my bitmoji and someone says, ‚ÄúTHAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE U‚Äù. Then someone else would say we can look as hot as we want. But then again I want my bitmoji to looks as real as possible so I would like more short natural black hair for men options because I cannnot find a hair that suits me.

352,GPJ993,"September 3, 2018",5,"Hey Bitmoji creators I love it when you guys design new clothing and put it on the game! So awesome! Could you please do that more often? ALSO, the hair styles for girls are very limited, there aren‚Äôt really any medium sized hair cuts that really apply to a lot people. For myself I always hate the hairstyle on my Bitmoji because I feel that it doesn‚Äôt actually match my style, can you guys include some more designs please? Other than these requests, this app is super amazing and I spend long amounts of time always customizing my Bitmoji and creating a mini me! I really love this app and you should too!"

They‚Äôre totally cute on Snapchat and I appreciate the people who made them to put on Snapchat, but I would like there to be more options to change your bit emojis for an example more colors I mean who doesn‚Äôt love different varieties because I know I do. Maybe someone could start something new like getting coins on Snapchat for doing a certain thing on there and with the coins we could buy things to make things more exciting! I love what the Snapchat company did to Snapchat but again there could be some changes!"

I have used it for like two years, and I love having a mini me to express myself with on my phone. Everything is awesome except for one thing... OUTFITS! Where is the baggy sweatshirts and the vintage clothes and the cute hoodies? We need better clothes! I don‚Äôt like having skin tight clothes in every single outfit except for the jerseys. Could you please add some simple oversized sweatshirts with shorts or leggings? That would be great! We all would appreciate this. Also, could you add different teeth? Like teeth with a gap or teeth with braces? I have a gap and my bitmoji looks weird with normal teeth. Thank you so much!"

Also, my friend‚Äôs Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look her because there are no earrings! It‚Äôs a really cool app but it needs more hair, clothing and there should be earrings! Also, some of the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù outfits are to ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt make sense, some of the outfits that are for the boys should be in the girls clothes. Another thing is what if you bisexual/transgender there is not option it‚Äôs either boy or girl, which is not fair! Can you right back!?ü§®"
356,Charmed824,"February 27, 2019",5,"Fun! Love it! However, please do an update with more editing options. I would love to have more clothing/hairstyle options. It seems like the current choices have been there forever. Would be fun to chose outfits individually piece by piece (such as options to ‚Äúchoose a shirt or top‚Äù and then ‚Äúchoose pants or a skirt‚Äù and ‚Äúchoose your shoes‚Äù etc). In my opinion there‚Äôs way too many sports-type outfits and a lot of my friends bitmoji‚Äôs look the same due to everyone picking the same outfits. Other than those suggestions, I love the bitmoji app!"
357,ackj1234,"March 12, 2020",3,Pretty good (please read!) Hey guys! Today I‚Äôm going to be doing a review for Bitmoji.
358,kikiluv20,"January 7, 2020",5,"Needs more hair diversity for natural hair This is app is great and all but y‚Äôall should really take the time to diversify the natural hair styles and textures. Not everyone has cotton texture, there‚Äôs people who have curls as well.  There‚Äôs bunch of straight hairstyles but not enough for people with natural hair. In the future I hope y‚Äôall add curlier textures and protective styles like maybe box braids, lemonade braids, and bead options for certain styles as well. I‚Äôd also like to see different hairline shapes. Not everyone has a straight box hair line. Just a lil suggestion cause my Bitmoji never really looks like me."
359,Cruzn2,"September 19, 2019",5,"Still in love... but... Ok. So; I was glad to know you could revert to your previous bitmoji style. And although some changes didn‚Äôt revert totally to the perfection that was my bitmoji or as many call it Lizmoji. it was pretty darn close. However, the Hair styles in the deluxe version is waaaayyy better. Hair styles that suit and fit me. The curly hair is on point. I need that to be available on the classic version. Please!!!! Ooooooh, pleeease!!! Make it available for the classic version. Still love you guys but do that. Oh!!!! And how about some tattoos!!!! I‚Äôd really love to add some of those!!!! Ok. That is all. Thank you!!!!"
360,Aankane avjdud,"October 12, 2017",4,"Yayy Okay gr8 app and all the only thing that bothers me so much is that when you're picking the ""Bitmoji style"" or ""bitstrips style"" when you pick Bitmoji style you can't have long hair!!! I really like the Bitmoji style but I have to have my Bitmoji wear a ponytail even though I don't usually wear ponytails because I have long hair & if I wear a short hairstyle that just doesn't look like me. I recently just changed my Bitmoji into NFL gear because that's the only way I get to have long hair but I'd love for it to be like that with other outfits as well. I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate this if it were on the next update as well :)"
361,Sn@k3m@n,"November 29, 2017",2,"We need more outfit choices I think it is save to say that Bitmoji has not updated their clothing formula in some while. They should change it up so everybody could dress a little more differently, a chance to make Bitmoji more personal. It is annoying to see many friends have the same clothes because they don‚Äôt have the correct clothes. It‚Äôs 2017 and the phones have processors far greater to have just a couple of similar options. There‚Äôs many social stereotypes that Bitmoji could derribe inspiration, there‚Äôs goths, there‚Äôs swag clothing, winter, hot, gangsters, ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù, there‚Äôs many stores they can take look at and take inspirations, cmon Bitmoji, we need a new update with more coming options, more hair, more styles, WHILE STILL KEEPING THE HOLD ONES"
362,ravenclawviss,"February 10, 2018",4,Recommendations I think that if you were to add braces the Bitmojis would be more realistic because a lot of people have braces and there is currently no option for braces so I personally think that would be a great thing to add. Another thing that I think you could add is more choices on clothing because the clothing given is either sporty or has been there since fall or summer. And lastly I think you could is more eye colors because not all people have those eye colors. Maybe you could put like more mixes of colors into the eyes. Thank you for listening/reading and please consider these options
363,paawz3,"February 19, 2018",5,"Love Bitmoji! I love Bitmoji. Especially the new update where you can take a picture of yourself and it kind of matches your facial features for you. I wish that there was an option to add more piercings though so it matches the person more. For example: cartilage piercings, second and third hole ear piercings, whole ear piercings, (add earring options as well), eyebrow, tongue, nose, etc... I feel like people get piercings to be more unique/add character to themselves (not that everyone isn‚Äôt unique anyway, but still) and having the options to add them to your Bitmoji would be great!"
364,Butterflypoet,"March 24, 2018",4,Love it! I love being able to respond to messages with theses characters! The word responses & facial expressions are on point. I‚Äôm leaving this message to say I appreciate your push to add more ethnic hairstyles- my request at this time is can you just add the hairstyles from the ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù to the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù? In ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù the options to create certain parts of my face are missing so I don‚Äôt look like myself-
365,Big dack 202,"January 26, 2019",5,"Needs more clothes I‚Äôve been using this app ever since it came out, then everyone got it once they collaborated with snapchat. I love this app very much it‚Äôs so much fun making a mini you!! But I wish that they had more clothing options. I wear pacsun, Brandy Melville, and billabong and they don‚Äôt have any of these stores :(( it‚Äôs hard to recognize your bitmoji when you don‚Äôt wear the same clothes :(( my bitmoji wears the American eagle clothes but I think that collection is either too dressy or it‚Äôs too casual. Even if you guys don‚Äôt make pacsun, BM, or billabong I‚Äôll still use it !!"
366,QueenBhadB,"January 29, 2019",4,"Needs more! I would like for the app to have more hairstyle options, specifically different curls. I don‚Äôt see my type of curls as one of the hairstyles. Either it‚Äôs to tight of a curl or to loose so I would like more options. Maybe event have some half up half down hairstyles and braids. "
367,AriamWolf,"May 25, 2019",5,OBSESSED I am waaaay Obsessed with this app I use it multiple times a day I‚Äôm constantly editing my Bitmoji and constantly making a bunch of them and I have always been obsessed with character customization games and I have a suggestion that would REALLY help. Maybe be able to save Bitmojis? Like have a place on the app that shows all the Bitmojis you‚Äôve ever made like basically a gallery or history thing or whatever it would really help with the whole storage problem because most of my photos are screenshots of all the Bitmojis I make
368,Lnb234,"April 14, 2020",4,":/ Hi! I love this app, but i just wanted to give some ideas that you could use in the future.. I think pregnancy should be in a body type not clothing. There are sooooo many clothes in the maternity section. Also I think you should expand on the hair choices.(loose curls, braids,etc) also I noticed that clothes and hats were missing. I get it you have to replace them for new clothing updates but i think you should get rid of the ones that are kind of out of style or just don‚Äôt make sense. My old outfit is gone. it‚Äôs kind of upsetting, especially when it was an accident. (pls bring it back) thank you ‚úåÔ∏è"
369,Ally marie T,"January 4, 2020",5,"Great app‚ù§Ô∏èbut needs some more.... Don‚Äôt get me wrong this app is amazing, I‚Äôm in love with my friends can send each other them for hours. But in the pants/jeans section there are no ripped jeans, which a LOT of people wear so please add that, and I also love putting my hair in braids please add more options for braids with the hair ombr√©. Maybe in the sweaters/ jacket section you could add some more jackets like an off the shoulder one since some people like there jackets like that. If you read all of this, thank you very much, this is a great app to get, but they do need some more stuff."

The diversity in skin tone & the selection of religious headware is so much better than before. & the new hair colors and styles?? Golden. A++. I‚Äôm having so much fun with the color selections and combinations.

372,Cindi Lynne69,"February 15, 2018",4,"suggestions?? while the app consists of many new realistic looking type features there are still things missing. i believe there should be an even bigger amount hair styles. for example, i have short hair and the short hair options don‚Äôt really match up with the way i want my bitmoji to look but not only that the noses aren‚Äôt too real either. while on that note i also noticed that when you wear a hat it just kind of rests over like a sticker when it should actually look like it is on the bitmojis head, but also there aren‚Äôt that many hats and there should be more kind of beanie hats. almost done here. i think we should be able to choose any shirt or pants or shoes instead of having certain outfits and be able to change the colors of wanted. and lastly i think there should be different eye lashes and eyes because to me they just do not look right and i dislike that fact. so i hope you take some of my ideas into consideration. thank you."
373,BennyRay84,"April 25, 2018",5,"I love this update, but still a little room for improvement Great idea with the selfie transforming into the bitmoji!! The only things I would say that needs improvement (but nothing major to take a star away at the moment), is more options for hairstyles and for us to actually modify the body instead of preset ones. I thought about about this because I joked with my wife about changing her bitmoji after her hairstyle she's about to get, they don't have one. Basically, it'll be a shaved cut. I'm sure she's not the only one who has this issue.."

I want to use but Bitmoji but it just won‚Äôt load!! I tried switching accounts too. It loads the characters and clothing, just not the actual Bitmoji moji!! It‚Äôs soooo annoying!

And what if I‚Äôm using crutches? You can‚Äôt tell by my Bitmoji. Also, there‚Äôs almost NO cute but tomboyish outfits!!! I can‚Äôt seem to find any cute t-shirts with sayings on them, and there are like ZERO ripped jeans...that being said, I LOVE the variety in hairstyles and colors and the variety in all the face options. My Bitmoji used to look absolutely NOTHING like me, but now it is practically SPOT ON!!! Thank you so much for making this app!!

I know we‚Äôre getting more outfit options...but what about bodies? I think there are only 4...and it‚Äôs been this way a while. For the new year, new body types and should be a thing. Because some are so drastically different from one another...but as a plus size person without a belly, it‚Äôs hard to choose because of the inaccuracy. Not that it will keep me from doing my thing every day with mine lol."

I wish I could choose hair styles more accurately to what I do to my own hair like having a hair style with bangs but pulled back into a pony tail because that is how I wear my hair. I also wish there where more abilities to pick out my own outfit instead of taking on that is already built for you. I also understand that I can choose my cloths separately now but there still isn‚Äôt as many options as I see in the already built outfit. Other wise I love this app."
379,Miss old bitmoji,"April 25, 2020",1,So disappointed! I accidentally deleted Bitmoji and when I reinstalled it I was so upset at the changes!  It doesn‚Äôt have the same options as it did before.  I loved my Bitmoji and now I can‚Äôt recreate it.  I can‚Äôt find a good eye shape option. They all have thick eyeliner around the entire eye. I loved the flower headband and it‚Äôs no longer there even though they show it in the ad!  I can‚Äôt get the 2 tone hair color and that‚Äôs in the ad too!  Not as many clothes options.  Couldn‚Äôt find the hairstyle option I had before.  I could go on and on. Why did you take so many options away?  It was perfect before. I did the best I could because after looking at other apps it‚Äôs still the best but my new Bitmoji is nowhere as cute as it was before and I‚Äôm very sad about that.
380,Hayden Lovelace,"March 8, 2018",5,"Customizable Outfits I LOVE this app, and the creativity has been awesome. Especially with all the recent updates that allow you to make the Bitmoji more detailed. With that being said, if the developers could make more customizable outfits that would be fantastic. There are so many tops that would be cool with other bottoms. And shoes that would look cool on other outfits. What would also be dope is a color wheel along with clothing items. So you can customize the clothes to your style and liking. These are my biggest hopes for this app. Thank you!"
381,A.W. I love this game,"March 30, 2018",5,"Love it! Just a couple suggestions though I use bitmojis pretty much every day. And since it is almost spring, I was hoping there could be some more outfits out related to spring. Also I was wondering if you could fix the issue where bitmojis with some of the new hairstyles could wear all of the hats. When I was trying on the costumes, the headpiece wasn‚Äôt showing up. I thought it was kind of awkward that he headpieces weren‚Äôt showing up on the costumes. I hope you can fix this issue ASAP. Please and thank you. Other than that, I love the app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
382,good game 02 ves,"April 24, 2018",5,"In love I totally love this app it has such a variety. Personally I would have set it up better just with the outfits and facial stuff, it is NOT CONFUSING so you can instantly have fun. I have braces and I think they should totally add braces because that can really mean a lot when you have braces. Ear rings would also be a nice touch. I am taller than a bunch of my friends and some are taller than I am so having like a side scroll bar thet adjusts the height.  Those are just improvements it does not need them it would just be pretty cool. but overall üòç. ( I love it)"
383,Kelse2019,"July 5, 2018",5,"Love it!!! I really love the app!! I use it almost every day. But one thing I would change is the clothes choice and the hair choices. I love some of the outfits but then others I only like parts of them. I think I would be cool if you made it so users could customize outfits if they want to but also have the option of the outfits that are already put together. For the hair you need to add more styles, sometimes I want to change my hair style but all of the other options aren't really me. But other than that I love this app!!!!!!!!"
384,Wittlehay,"August 4, 2018",4,"Love love, but .. I love it! Everything about the app is pretty much perfect :) only one request I have would be the hair.. yes, there are now several different styles and colors now available however the lengths of those styles aren‚Äôt always accurate to the person.. like myself I have medium length hair but the only styles you have for medium hair are not what mine looks like.. I think myself and others would like the option of lengthening or shortening the hair to our liking and also how thick and thin it might be or how straight and how wavy just please add more customizable options to the hair section. Thanks!!"
385,Marshcream üíõ,"December 15, 2018",4,"LOVE IT!! Just a suggestion: I'm a huge fan of Bitmoji. The stickers are sooo cool and relatable, and it's easy and quick to create your own character."
386,Volmos2004,"January 15, 2019",4,"Hurry up! I have been using Bitmoji for a while! I love everything about it. One thing I will say is that sometimes they take too long to come up with new cloths(in my opinion). Another thing I will say is that an idea that I‚Äôve had for a really long time is that they should have a set of shirts and pants and shoes that you can pick on ur own. I say this because sometimes there is an outfit that I like(specifically the shirt) but I don‚Äôt like the pants. You guys should give a set of shirts to pick and then a set of pants, shirts, etc to choose with the shirt you chose. I hope that makes sense. Overall, I love the app!!!!"
387,lulusweet34,"January 26, 2019",5,Pretty good So I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for a few weeks and well I have to say is you need they need to make like a color wheel option to sleep I have glasses and they‚Äôre not black gray white or blue They‚Äôre more of a Navy and the Bitmoji does not have the option for Navy so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd say that they need to have a color wheel or something like that. All in all I do like the app though I‚Äôve just think that maybe they need to have more hair dye colors and hair color options because I‚Äôve got a really odd hair color but yeah I mean I think this app is pretty good.
388,Emily ‚ú®üíú,"May 17, 2019",5,"Outfits and customization I do like this app. But I do wish there was more customizing with like your hair, and your clothes. I know there already are a lot but I wish you could have a way to give your self multiple accessories, jackets over other clothes, and ways to change the colors of all the clothing items. And with the hair, I just wish there were more styles and colors for it. These are just suggestions that I do really really wish were in the app. Keep up the good work! Because I really do like the app on Snapchat üòÖüòä"
389,SeafordLove,"March 21, 2020",5,Star glasses I love this app and I use it for snapchat but my signature thing is star glasses and I felt a little disappointed when I saw there were heart glasses but not stars. I would love and very appreciate it if your added them as fast as possible. I‚Äôm very positive that many of the users of this would appreciate and use this option. There are a bunch of different types of crazy and natural looking glasses and I would love for their to be a star shaped glasses. Thank you and I expect to see this happen very soon. In fact I‚Äôll check everyday.
390,Alirob844,"September 23, 2017",4,"Good, but could be better I love Bitmoji but I think you could make the clothes options better. Like you could pick the shirt then pants they would be separate so it is like you are making your own outfit. Maybe just for fun you could have like cool accessories. Like wings and swords or backpacks and more. You could have more and cooler hats and hair accessories. For hair you could have something that you could have highlights for your hair, because some people has highlights. Bitmoji is great, you can hook it up to Snapchat. But every thing can always get better. I hope Bitmoji gets better and better.üòÅü§óüòú"

I'm tired of still looking at the ""spring2017"" outfits like come on! I want some to new outfits not the same old same old one. You also need to make new hairstyle, hair colors, skin colors, and body shape. If these things where all added the app would be much better. You guys seem really lazy that's you're not adding anything and that you're just keeping the same old same old. Consider making another update. Thank you."
392,Powergirl89,"February 1, 2018",3,"More body types please! The new deluxe bitmojis are so fun. I love all the new options, but what‚Äôs not awesome is the complete lack of body type diversity. Currently there are five options.... four of which are skinny. You can hardly tell the difference between any of them unless you click one and then four. The fifth option is literally just a circle. Why is there no in between? Before when there were limited options in every other category I was bothered, but I understood. Now you‚Äôre bragging about all the new options and somehow managed to leave out something that I would argue is one of the biggest factors in determining similarity. Fix this!"
393,Kiarushi,"February 7, 2018",3,"Why did you delete my haircut? So there‚Äôs a million new haircuts but the one I used to wear before does no longer exist why???

And there‚Äôs not like a normal ponytail :(. I was feeling better before now idk I feel like she doesn‚Äôt look like me. And there‚Äôs not a skin color for Latina women there‚Äôs the Indian looking color with a yellow shade but there‚Äôs nothing for latinas that are a bit brown like me but not to the extreme.

I agree that it‚Äôs better, but it needs to be a bit more accurate. Maybe you can add braces and allow us to choose the color of our braces by tapping each bracket and choosing the colors. You can also let us choose how many brackets we need. And maybe, to make it more accurate, allow us to have grills on our bottom teeth. Otherwise, this update really made things better. I love it."

The thing that blew my mind was able to customize your own outfit, (A second suggestion is overalls.) even your own socks! "
397,@MissTsundere,"December 21, 2019",5,"Wonderful I am so happy that you guys finally updated bitmoji to let us build our own outfits!!  I would love to see a customizable section added for accessories, like chokers/necklaces, hats, etc. It‚Äôd also be nice to see some patterns available for customization, like plaid and polka dots and stripes :-) Lastly, I suggest implementing a color slider option for things like physical features and makeup, while leaving the sample colors already in the app for those users who enjoy using presets, and others can just make whatever colors they‚Äôd like to use."

399,Kitkat7854,"August 31, 2019",4,Best emoji around The only thing that I'd ask for is to be able to have a favorites folder. There are so many emojis to search through that I often give up looking for the one that I'm thinking of. I'd cut the theme related emojis in half since they're trend is short. I love the frequency of new emojis. 
400,Mps139,"September 23, 2017",4,"Loving it... I love the Bitmoji app a lot, it's so fun to make your character look just like you and show your friends. Picking out the cloths is the hardest pat for me though. That's because nothing really has what I wear on there. But I think that it would be a great idea if they had it sorted by shirt, pants/shorts/skirts, shoes, jackets, and Accessories. So that you could make your own unique outfits that look more like you. I'm in love with there superhero outfits as well. Better than any Halloween costumeüòÇ. And I would just explode with excitement if they added more superhero costumes for the Bitmoji's. Then I would give this app the easiest 5 stars ever!üëçüèªüòä"
401,Be your true selfie,"April 7, 2018",4,Little tweaks I Love Bitmoji it‚Äôs much fun and super funny heartwarming and just plain amazing to have an emoji look just like you if you‚Äôre thinking about getting this app get it! It will not disappoint but only 
402,Bobo yoyo,"April 17, 2018",5,"Outfits Hi. I really love this app. For real. I think it‚Äôs an awesome way to communicate and it‚Äôs fun and interactive too and all my friends love it. Literally the only suggestion I have is letting people pick their outfits instead of giving them some to choose from, including shoes, because I really like some outfits but I want different shoes, ya know? Or maybe give more of a variety of outfits. I‚Äôm more of a skater girl and I wear crop tops, and ripped skinny jeans, and I wear timberlands, Adidas, and stuff like that so maybe give more of a variety of clothing. Thanks you and I hope this helped lol"
403,BiJeeJ,"June 4, 2018",4,"New way of expression lol I‚Äôm glad I finally made a Bitmoji. It says exactly what I want to say without having to use the same basic emojis over and over again. What‚Äôs even better is that there are more options available for hair, like the natural hairstyles for Black women. I wish there were more clothes options but the clothes available are fine. The only reason I gave four stars is because I wish there was a search option within the app like there is for the iMessage sticker app. It takes a while to find the Bitmoji you‚Äôre looking for when you can‚Äôt search."
404,VERYANGRYGAMER,"September 26, 2018",3,"Lacking There are 4 body sizes for smaller women and only 1 ‚Äúone-size-fits-all-plus-size????‚Äù We need more options because I‚Äôm definitely not a bulbous shaped overweight woman. Where‚Äôs the hourglass shake with larger bust and accentuated hips??? Not all plus sized woman has a large midsection with large sides like you provide. Can we get some body diversity here??? Also the nose and chin options are all WEIRD I can‚Äôt find anything that closely resembles me. I‚Äôm also on board with the clothing options. Separating the items would be great to better customize according to individual styles. I‚Äôm talking sections to choose scarves, jewelry, shoes, accessories, etc. Better makeup options would be nice as well."
405,Mommytomolly1904,"November 30, 2018",3,Falls short during holidays During the holiday season the app has fallen short and not lived up to my expectations. You can create a Bitmoji to look any which way you want. But during the Holiday season the only holiday represented is Christmas üòî. There are so many faiths and beliefs during the holiday season. When I search Hanukkah I get a sweater with snowmen. That has absolutely nothing to do with Hanukkah. I am extremely disappointed in the apps one sided holiday features. There was nothing else for the other holidays during this time of year either. Just Christmas. I would hope that is this day and age developers of widely used apps like this would be more diverse.

407,._.lindsey._.,"March 18, 2020",5,"amazing! but maybe a little more realistic things this app is amazing, but i would add more to this app (in the ladies clothing section) if i were you to make it more modern. for example, there needs to be more options for short hair. like for me, my hair is short(above shoulder length) and wavy, and maybe some that have one part of hair behind the ear, for a more cute look. it would also be awesome if you could add piercings!! i have many piercings myself, some cartilage and a couple on the lobes, that would be awesome if y‚Äôall added that. and, more modern outfit choices. like, overalls and strapless dresses/shirts. also with the clothing, you guys should definitely add some options for us to customize our clothing like patterns, stripes, polka dots, etc. that would be amazing, but y‚Äôall keep doing what you need to do, these are just some suggestions that in my opinion would be great for us ladies :) have a good day!"
408,Karebear3261,"February 20, 2020",1,"Good App... but Beware... while using this APP on iPad, you must give allow all access for it to work. This means you give permission for them to see any time you have used the keyboard to input personal information. This includes SSNs, credit card numbers, addresses etc."
409,GoldenRetrivers4ever,"December 16, 2019",5,"Need neckwear I love bitmoji and use it a lot when texting my friends. But they need neckwear, like scarves or necklaces. Then they could make holiday versions of them. Other than that, it‚Äôs awesome and you should totally get it. Even if you don‚Äôt have Snapchat. I don‚Äôt have Snapchat and I use it all the time when I text. One more thing, I think that we should be able to create a pet, so we can include it in our stickers. We could also dress it up. Then everyone could have there own pet even if they don‚Äôt have one in real life."
410,Ladeda de da,"April 8, 2018",4,"skin color!!!! I love how the bitmoji update gives so many more hairstyles, facial features, and skin tones, yet I still struggle to find a skin tone that resembles me at all. It bothers me that I can find purple, green, and blue skin tones, yet I can‚Äôt find my own completely realistic skin color. As a solution, I think it would be awesome to have a color gradient for people to choose their skin tones with rather than/in addition to preset colors so that everyone can get the skin tone that they identify with. Bitmoji is supposed to be a portrayal of people, and I find it hard for my bitmoji to truly portray me when I can‚Äôt even find my own skin tone."
411,xxeliselovexx,"June 4, 2018",4,"Skin tones, Hair and fashion The app is great! I love the stickers and the update totally blew my mind, but even though there were skin tones added I still feel like I cannot truly represent my color.  I‚Äôm like a golden bronze tan color but on the app I have to choose between a yellowish brown or a peachy skin tone, when in fact I‚Äôm neither. I love the hair styles too, but I think we can come up with additional looks and styles.  Maybe long ponytails, cute buns, or just different styles.  And the fashion goes up and down.  I never have a problem with the fashion provided but I‚Äôd love to see more stuff!"
412,Kharris99,"June 21, 2018",5,Awesome! Just a couple suggestions... I love Bitmoji! It‚Äôs super fun to use both inside and outside of Snapchat and browse through the fun little cartoons and see myself in them. I like how uniquely you can customize your Bitmoji and the functions they have on video for Snapchat. 
413,Hole.io is GREAT,"October 24, 2018",5,"Just a small recommendation üòâ Hi, I‚Äôm not here to write a bad review, just something to think of and maybe add. You should think of like a long sleep crop top, like you know the not so short ones the normal ones. I was wearing that but since it‚Äôs getting cold, I like to change outfits when a new season hits. So maybe you should think of that because I really recommend it, you really wouldn‚Äôt see people with a short sleeve crop top on in the winter! Tysm! Best app ever btw, it expresses literally all my emotions when I‚Äôm to lazy to type! Have a great day/night!"
414,doglover121üê©,"December 31, 2018",4,"needs a few things I love this app and I'll have full conversations using it, but I think a few things need fixed. For one thing there needs to be more clothes because I dont wear any of the options you have. Maybe something like skinny jeans and a hoodie. There just aren‚Äôt popular clothes on the app which makes it hard to decide what my avatar should wear. Also there needs to be more options and colors for glasses.  My last thing is the hairstyles. None of them look like my hair you need way more options, but overall I still love the app and I will give it 4 stars"
415,Linda Boo Mama,"March 24, 2019",5,Full Access I had to delete this app because I could not use the regular keyboard for some reason. So I deleted it and had to sign in when I downloaded it again which made me go through the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù process. To use Bitmoji you have to allow full access to the developer which means anything you type going forward and previously including credit card information is allowed to be seen etc. by the developer. They have no reason to see this information. So goodbye Bitmoji.
416,cleigh94,"December 15, 2019",3,"Something Missing I‚Äôm so happy that mix and match was finally added, but I wish the mix and match would also apply to the outfits that are already in the options. There‚Äôs a lot of pieces I love in the old outfits but not outfits that I love, so it would be nice to be able to mix those outfits together. Also, if mix and match would add cowboy boots too, and patterns instead of just colors."
417,jki,"August 16, 2019",4,Love the app! Just 3 suggestions I absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è Bitmoji I just have a couple of suggestions. I have to admit these were not my idea but I totally agree with them. (1)Outfits! I love all the outfits but I would appreciate if there were ways to mix and match outfits so they would really match the person‚Äôs style.(2)Accessories! I would love if there were a accessories button where you had bracelets and earrings and braces & wheelchairs etc.(3)Emoji! I love the idea of customizing your own Bitmoji message! Other then that I totally recommend it it is really funny I‚Äôve had for about year I think it‚Äôs totally worth it!üòä
418,VLONKA SHLONKA,"August 3, 2019",4,"AMAZING APP: few suggestions I absolutely love this app and my friends and I constantly use it, I even ordered a custom mug for my mom! The app has so many great features, and it‚Äôs so fun to use. However, I do have some suggestions. I‚Äôm not able to customize the face too much, which means I can‚Äôt add birthmarks, braces, or earrings, so it never really looks like me. Also, the app only allows you to trade friend bitmojis if you have Snapchat, so if I want to make my friend a personalized notebook or mug, I can‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt have snap chat. Other than this though, the app is incredible and I highly recommend it."
419,Grl26,"July 10, 2019",3,"Good, but could use a little tweaking I enjoy using Bitmoji and mainly use it in my everyday texting communication to change things up from the typical emojis. However, There are not enough updates to the app overall to keep the average user interested and the outfit options could use a major overhaul. For example, All the summer options that are listed are ones that were already there and just got moved under their ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù category. It can get kinda boring after a while not having new features added. Please reconsider adding new outfit choices to each season and just overall more frequent updates."

421,Emily Lrfin,"February 1, 2018",4,"I really like!! I really like this update its super slick. I really like all the hair options. Though we have more hair options, I feel like you kind of then took away the mouth (and other facial features) options. With the old version i had a facial feature that fit my face, but now you kind of took them all away. I really liked all the mouth options they had in the old version, but now there‚Äôs only 3, and they‚Äôre all the same width (and my mouth isn‚Äôt that wide). This is something pretty minor, but I did really like it. Otherwise I love bitmoji and I LOOVE how it‚Äôs connected to Snapchat :)"

423,L. Swaggett,"December 30, 2018",1,Racist and Sexist 1. There needs to be more legit skin color options. They have crap like blue and green but still not my exact normal human skin tone which I find to be a problem. 
424,Max_imum,"January 22, 2019",4,Much improved!! I had previously written a review for this app and had only given it 2 stars because the options for avatars were divided up by ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. The changes made to the avatar screen where you now choose your preferred silhouette made me extremely happy and made me feel as though my previous review was actually acknowledged! My only concern now is that I wish all clothing options were available in either silhouette style (I‚Äôd love for my non-curvy bitmoji to be able to wear cute dresses now and then)! I love this app and the changes you have made- keep up the good work!!!
425,Lilly Spinard,"March 18, 2020",4,"Add better outfits and accessories!!!! This will make my whole life if you just add chokers, champion sweatshirts, Nike shoes, UGGS, And hair part settings. Also, my hair is curly, but the curls are usually tight and look like tubes. Also maybe add scrunchies and other cool things like apple watches and fitbits. That's all I need. If it was like that, my whole life would be better. "
426,xoxolizzz,"October 22, 2019",5,"Bitmoji clothes My friend Eric told me to say this: Bitmoji I love your app ,but I would sometimes like to create my own outfit instead of it already being picked out for me. Although their may be a lot of options, I looked through all of them and tried on all the ones I like. So if you would consider doing this, it would make me enjoy the app even more. I agree with him because making our own clothes for out bitmoji would be so much fun and we could get super creative! I hope you consider this. Thank you!"

428,Dork face!,"August 24, 2019",4,"Improvement So I‚Äôve had this app for a few years now. But I have some things y‚Äôall need to tweak up there at bm headquarters. I really don‚Äôt like the options. The clothes are fine. But why can‚Äôt I have braces, or freckles? Those are some of the key features that need to be implanted. As well as custom clothing items. You could make your own outfit. Match skirts, tops, pants, shorts etc. Also, why can‚Äôt males wear skirts? Or dresses? I have a male friend (my best friend.) and he loves wearing skirts. But he can‚Äôt have them on his bitmoji. It breaks my heart to see him upset so please add these features. Anyway, it‚Äôs a nice app with potential."
429,Mai4Sim,"August 13, 2019",4,"Almost perfect I‚Äôve been using this app for over 2 years. I love the weekly updates / additions, and all the options. People say my Bitmoji looks just like me! I love that I can hold a conversation with friends with just Bitmoji‚Äôs!! The only thing I would like to see updated is the ability to SEARCH by keyword in the actual app (currently able to do so on keyboard), and also mix and match outfits or customize hairstyles. An added bonus would be to be able to, as another reviewer mentioned, be able to pick an expression and then add our own text. Either way, I‚Äôm a fan!!"
430,Caileigh Murphy,"December 1, 2017",5,"Request on some enhancements If it happens to be possible, this for one might be a minor challenge but is there anyway to make the avatar more characterized, I guess you could say somewhat like the sims and Mii(wii avatars) had a baby..for example more hair choices, body types, and clothes if possible would y‚Äôall make it so you can make your own..and PLEASSEEE add more earring/piercings choices..I have an industrial bar(ear piercing)and I also have a bunch of other piercings. I would be very much appreciated if you would accept my request thank you..ü§ó"

Add more highlights all kind of boys hair should have highlights. More shapes of lips and beard/mustache hair. More different hairstyles and like I was saying with the outfits it should be a section for shoes a different one for pants and shirts similar to the hair section or the lips section PLEASE make Bitmoji more realistic and you should make a game too like the sims 4 but better I know you can do it."
432,cutebutshy,"April 6, 2018",4,"Love this app!!! It‚Äôs so much fun to use this app for fun stickers and to change your bitmoji, but there‚Äôs one thing that bothers me. I think there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles, make up styles and clothes! If you‚Äôre paired up with snapchat, the best way to excite the billions of people connecting bitmoji on snap, is to appeal to them as well! I have long curly hair, but 99% of the curly hair options are short! It totally takes away from the actual look of the avatar. And the outfit I have, it‚Äôs just not the best representation of my style. I think these fixes will definitely help a lot! Other than that, love the app!"
433,Del710,"April 11, 2019",4,"Add an in-app search function please I like to use bitmoji‚Äôs regularly in my group chats, even for work. I enjoy this apps variety a lot however it would be so much easier to search up what I‚Äôm looking for similar to how it is in Snapchat. I don‚Äôt want to add another keyboard to my phone, I like saving them directly from the app and using them when the time is right lol. Or sometimes I just really have to scroll until I find one suitable for the moment. Anyways, great app but it would be better if you could search for Bitmoji‚Äôs in the app instead of stumbling upon them"
434,A user of Bit,"April 18, 2019",4,New update? Ok so I LOVE using Bitmoji and all my friends use it on a daily basis! But the reason I didn‚Äôt put 5 stars is because it needs just a little update. 2 things:
435,Mudboggerzz,"June 1, 2019",5,"Create I love this app, I‚Äôve been using it for awhile now and I think they are quite hilarious. I love it so much I even went as far as adding it to my keyboard. However, I think it would be AWESOME if I could create my own, with sayings I would use, and having different expressions to use with them. I was talking about it with my friend, and it‚Äôs an awesome idea. I love being able to create the character to look like me, but it would be even better to be able to customize my own ‚Äústickers‚Äù as they are called I guess!!!"
436,Vitamin Gummy,"January 21, 2020",3,"Major bug/ glitch This app is GREAT not gonna lie, I love the little characters and the customization but there is a MAJOR bug/ glitch that is giving me a hard time. So I logged out of Bitmoji, then later I tried to log back in (I don‚Äôt have Snapchat, I log in using my iCloud account). But then the app said, ‚ÄúConnection error. Your internet connection seems to be down. Please check your connection and try again.‚Äù I have good connection. I can still sent text messages, emails, use WiFi, etc, but I STILL can‚Äôt use Bitmoji. It‚Äôs getting really annoying and I would be REALLY appreciative if you fixed this. Thanks for reading this. :)"
437,Justice Jordan Smith,"December 11, 2019",4,"Love the app just need some new additions! I love the app don‚Äôt get me wrong. I use it everyday. I love the clothing choices on the also. The new winter collection is ok though. I just wish there was a black fur hood coat instead of blue, green, and one more. I want the fur hood coat to be in the customization section for the jacket and coat section. Also I really want there to be jewelry like a men‚Äôs watch. It would look so good to have a watch with my outfit because that‚Äôs what I wear everyday in real life. Anyways if you could please add those I would appreciate it a lot and a lot of others would too. Thank you"
438,shmester10,"October 7, 2019",4,Little problem...please help!!! I love bitmoji but like a month or so ago my iPod updated or something like that which didn‚Äôt really matter. Then I was texting my friends and I wanted to use bitmoji but it said I was logged out which was really weird so I went to the app and every time I tried logging in it said something was wrong with the app or the internet. That wasn‚Äôt possible tho bcuz I was using WiFi it still won‚Äôt let me log in and I‚Äôm really upset. I made a new account for the time being but I really want my old one back! Sorry for the long review. Thank you!!
439,prride,"July 8, 2019",4,"good, but could be better I use this app a lot, and I like that it‚Äôs linkable to Snapchat, but there‚Äôs a few things that could‚Äôve fixed. 1, skin tones. There‚Äôs just not a lot of lighter skin tones, even though there‚Äôs many darker ones. 2, clothes. None of the clothes match my style, so possibly just more hoodies that aren‚Äôt jackets? 3. Glasses. There‚Äôs no good looking glasses that don‚Äôt make you look like a dork. I suggest making them bigger and more circle shaped glasses. 4. Hair styles. The color range is great, but there‚Äôs not a lot of hair styles that a non-binary person can relate to."
440,BooBear121396,"February 9, 2018",4,"Outfits I see this continuing theme of your users wanting more variety and options when it comes to the clothing factor and I 100% agree. There‚Äôs so many ways already to customize, especially now with the bitmoji deluxe, but the outfits are pretty well basic and unoriginal. At one point in time I had three friends who‚Äôs bitmojis all had on the same outfit. I like seeing how far this app has actually come and using the stickers make conversations through messages more lively, I just wish we had the ability to be more creative with the clothing options."

442,Upset sim fan,"April 26, 2018",4,"I like it I like Bitmoji, but I wish there was more to it. I wish there were more outfits to choose from. I don‚Äôt like that most of the outfits are all for sports. I don‚Äôt have an interest in sports so I don‚Äôt really like any of the outfits for the teams. I wish there were a lot more regular outfits and cute ones that people really like. I read another review where they said they wish the outfits were customizable. I agree with them, I‚Äôd really like to be able to make my own outfit. The app is great, I just wish there was more time spent on making the clothes cute and customizable."
443,Pug Girl üáµüá≠,"May 13, 2018",3,"I like it, but it‚Äôs missing stuff I love this app so much and 75% of texting my friends is through Bitmoji, but I have some stuff that would be awesome to put in.  My ideas are that you should be able to save certain bitmoji so you can switch to different ones pretty fast. I think that you should be able to customize outfits because I was looking at the T-shirt bitmoji outfits, and I really liked the pug one. The thing is, I would never wear beige pants, so that kinda threw me off. I also think that you should customize shoes, like different styles, colors, etc. The outfits should also be able to be saved. That‚Äôs it for now, great app!"
444,lette00,"December 28, 2018",3,"Great but Simple Improvements I live using my Bitmoji with my friends and they‚Äôre so fun and cute BUT customization needs a step up! We should be able to pick out single tops, bottoms, etc. and their colors. Also I think all clothes should be gender neutral. Another thing I would love to see are tattoo and piercing options because my septum is a staple and my lil bitmoji needs one too in my opinion. My last point is a long shot but if you could collab with Vans and get us cooler shoes like slip on checkered and cool clothes that‚Äôd be pretty cool. But, to touch back again we should be able to pick out single pieces of clothing, not choosing from pre-designed outfits. Thanks!"
445,pcsgal,"April 10, 2019",4,I wish there was more to do This app is really fun to customize your character to make it look like you. However there isn‚Äôt a lot that makes it look like me like no birth marks or small side bangs. Also I wish there was a little more clothes. I know this is being a little picky but I do wish there was a little more to pick from. Also I wish you could mix and match with shirts pants and skirts that would be so fun to do. I hope you can add a few of theses thing in the app that would be fun! One more thing if you guys could add some more hair choices for short hair? Thanks!! :)

Now even better as the ‚ÄúMix & Match‚Äù allowed me to enhance my Bitmoji messages and my friends and colleagues really amazed how fast I can adjust to my existing look.

449,Dancer gem,"July 1, 2019",3,"Great app but it needs improvement I love using this app because it makes conversations between friends and family a lot more fun. Even though it is a great app my and friends and I were talking about thinks that would make this app a lot better. Clothing and style is a big one. It would be great if we could make our own outfits. Like being able to select outfits and mix n match them. It would be great if there were more choices for summer clothing such as outfits with more tank tops, shorts and flip flops. Overall, I think 3/5 rating fits the app. But if those improvements were added it would definitely be 5/5."

It‚Äôs so innovative and impressive how this is linked to snapchat, it actually makes me enjoy snapchat so much more. But the outfit options are painful to put it nicely. I‚Äôd never wear ANY of those combinations together but there are so many instances where I like one top with a different pants, legging or skirt. And a shoe from another outfit. Lol. Please give us the option to select our own clothes to put together and make an outfit of, by giving each item separately like select a top, bottoms, shoes etc. "
451,SPONGEBOB12321,"April 7, 2018",4,"Suggestion!! I love Bitmoji! I love that I can customize my avatar to look just like me. A few things would make this app perfect however: more weight options! I‚Äôm skinny myself so I don‚Äôt need it, but there are 4 types of skinny and only one type of heavy. There should be more body types! Also, there should be an option to put piercings on your avatar!! Lost of ppl have more than just ear piercings. Lastly, I think we should be able to pick a certain shirt to wear, a certain bottom, and then shoes, and then accessories, instead of only being able to choose ONE whole outfit."
452,KCSea17,"May 3, 2018",3,"More variety please.. I love this app and it is super fun to use. Many of the things that are available are great but there can still be upgrades. When I was building my own Bitmoji I found it hard to find a skin color that matched my own. Either I‚Äôm too light or too dark. I wish there was a wider variety in skin color! It would make many people‚Äôs Bitmoji‚Äôs look more like themselves. I also wish there was some more options for the clothing. I‚Äôve seen a lot of great suggestions such as allowing the users the ability to customize the colors of the clothing. Over all it is a great and fun app, just some things to work on."
453,Elisa $101,"June 17, 2018",5,Great This is great. I love it but.... I have a suggestion. Some stuff you can‚Äôt change to make yourself unique. I think there should be a step where you have a scale on the left side. Then you drag it to the correct height. Then you can control how tall you are. I can never find the correct eyes for me so there should be more options. You should also be able to customize your clothes... you could pick the style of a shirt and then pick the color and design. Thank you!!! Please consider these suggestions! üòÅüòÅ
454,Minecraft LOVER!‚ô•Ô∏è,"September 11, 2018",5,"Love this app!  :) This app is fun and creative! You can send funny photos to all your friends, and also it hooks up to Snapchat! You can personalize your own bitmoji to look just like you! This is truly a smart app and they did a good job at it. The only thing they need is lots of new hairstyles and outfits. Anything other than that is all good! I truly recommend getting this app! "

I ‚ù§Ô∏è how there are so many clothes üëóand ways to customize your character üëçüèΩ but I wish they would move like if they were real but it is super fun I wish there are more sizes for some people that aren‚Äôt that big or small. Over all I use it all the time. The one thing that I hate is the (friend) thing, i mean you can use it IF You have Snapchat account. But I don‚Äôt and I am not allowed to get it so it is so frustrating üò° but I bet a lot of people have Snapchat. Or maybe people don‚Äôt. At least I can use it for messagesü§™"
456,author-in-training,"December 26, 2018",3,"please let girls access the men's clothes!!!!!! I just want to wear a t shirt!!!! I really like having a bitmoji but it's really hard to find clothing options that feel like they reflect who I am. I think the easiest way to fix this would be to stop gendering clothing. If a girl avatar could access the ""guy's"" clothing or the other way around, it would open up so many new styles. Or outfit creation could be more like the face stylization. There could also be more hair choices, since hair is so distinct. Either way, it's an app I have a lot of fun with, I just wish there was more opportunity with the personalization when it comes to clothing especially."
457,The Gacha Squad,"April 2, 2020",4,"Needs some tweaks I like this app, and it has so many cool features that I‚Äôve never seen on any other app like this.  Though there are some problems.  Personally, I think you should add freckles, as well as other things like more mouths to choose from without buying the full subscription.  My only other problem is one that most of my friends agree on, and it is that there isn‚Äôt enough body types.  The ones we already have are great, but it would be better to have more of a average weight.  Other than that his app is absolutely amazing."
458,Layla Diaz,"September 9, 2019",5,There's not a lot of good outfits I rate this app 5 stars because it's a really cool and funny app but there is one thing I miss. Before they had cute brands such as Forever 21 and Steven Madden but now they don't have it anymore. Can you guys bring it back because they had way cuter outfits especially Forever 21 with the cute t shirt dress with the bomber jacket. I liked them way more and it was more how I dress so please bring it back because I bet there is people out there who want these brands to come back and new brands to be put into the app.
459,sophh10,"June 28, 2019",4,Love... but needs more personalization features I love the app and use it on a daily basis for snapchat... I wish there were more outfit options or that you could mix and match tops and bottoms with shoes! There should be more hair styles also so everyone doesn‚Äôt look the same or have a better hair style that fits when you do or like. I also wish there were more makeup options like types of eyelashes and eyeliner and such. If there were more ways or more options to personalize your bitmoji the app would be way more popular. I do love this app though and its concept ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
460,yoshikowo ‚ô°,"December 28, 2017",5,"Cute! At first, I was kind of upset I could only use this app for my avatar on Snapchat. Now, I actually really like it! It‚Äôs cute and fun, and the emoticons are relatable. Although I have a few feature suggestions."
461,BorntoBreathe,"February 13, 2018",5,"Love it but I do wish you had a few more things when it comes to decorating your Bitmoji Firstly I just want to say I love this app and it allows me to pretty accurately make a Bitmoji of myself but I do wish that you had more outfit choices or even be able to customize an outfit for your bitmoji. And in the older Bitmoji days at least you were able to give yourself earrings but I don‚Äôt think we can know, so with saying that I feel as there should be an option to give your Bitmoji facial piercings and ear piercings."

463,edmondmichelle,"July 16, 2018",4,"Bitmoji is ok. Hi guys! I just downloaded Bitmoji last night and it‚Äôs pretty fun to  make avatars and put them on Snapchat. Even though I like it there are 2 big things that I think should be fixed. 1. I was trying to make an avatar for myself and there was no blonde hair. I mean, come on! So it‚Äôs kind of sad that they really don‚Äôt have blonde hair. 2. I was trying to make an avatar for my mom and there‚Äôs no short hair! So at the end it really didn‚Äôt like my mom because she has a pixie cut. "
464,SaraSellnow,"October 7, 2018",2,New outfits I‚Äôve got to start out by saying I usually would give the app a 5‚≠êÔ∏è rating because I don‚Äôt ever write a review unless it needs work... but here we are.
465,gothgirl396,"December 28, 2018",5,Love this app!! I‚Äôve used this app for a very long time and I love all they different things that you can choose from. The only problem I have is is that I‚Äôm goth. There is like only 5 outfits I wish there was more to choose from. I‚Äôd also like a feature to where you can add piercings cause I have a lot of facial piercings. Gauges (stretched ears) would also be neat to. Not just small ones but like you could enter the size of what they are and then Boom! Your Bitmoji has the size you haveüòÅüòÅ I‚Äôd be very cool if you guys did this
466,Skylar nicole bertram,"March 6, 2019",4,"Love it but could be better Totally need more outfits, have not once seen Nike Shorts or sweat pants. I‚Äôm a lazy dresser and a lot of your user base is young to find more outfits and styles that appeal, and a lot more or give a top changing option, bottoms and shoes. More original for the individual. Also more hair styles would be nice. As for clothes I‚Äôm talking like a lot a lot more, like we need options I don‚Äôt wanna have lil me wear the same stuff as 20 others girls in the surrounding area. sure the options have changed buttttt I feel I‚Äôve been looking at the same options for the past 3 years."

468,emilia <3,"October 9, 2019",4,"I love this app, but I have some suggestions! I've had bitmoji for a while now and I love how my bitmoji looks! Thing is there aren't many options for certain things like for example (many have said this) more outfits! I would LOVE to see a make your own outfit kind of thing! Just like customize the pants, shirts, shoes etc. That would make bitmoji's more creative and expressive. I would also maybe add a tiny change like having the ability to make your character have braces! or other things, that make it nice :)."
469,Madison_BrookeÓÄæ,"September 25, 2019",5,"One of my favorite apps, but needs more customization options A lot of the reviews here say that we need more clothes and I agree. I wish we could choose our tops, bottoms, and shoes separately but even without that I wish we had more outfits. My favorite collections are the Hollister and Forever 21 collabs and I think it‚Äôd be cool if Bitmoji did a collaboration with another clothing company. I also think there should be more appearance options, especially more skin details and hairstyles. Regardless though I still love my Bitmoji ‚ù§Ô∏èüë©üèº"
470,obslek,"February 11, 2018",3,"Face Types So I downloaded Bitmoji and managed to keep my old Bitmoji character but when I saw the selection it was very disappointing. It gave my Bitmoji a face as long as a horse (you guys have taken away the Afro away as well, what‚Äôs up with that). And it‚Äôs making it difficult to somewhat depict me. Not everyone‚Äôs face is the same. I‚Äôm fine with everything being added. Just don‚Äôt be like Snapchat and take away the good stuff. "
471,Awesome minions,"February 14, 2018",5,Recommendations I wish that we could pick out the shirt and pants separately and pick out the shoes separately so we can design what we wear instead of you guys providing the whole outfit! There are so many shirts I like but not with the pants or shoes or there shoes I would like to be switched out or the pants. Maybe even extend the clothing brands like have an adidas line or under Amour. And tan tops and shirts. I love this app so much I just wish that we were able to do that. I hope sometime in the fights could happen? Otherwise the app is great and I LOVE it!
472,üòªCatDancer0428üòª,"March 25, 2018",4,"Bitmoji is Awesome But... This app is amazing! I use this app a lot, I mean a lot for my Snapchat! But there's a few things you need to fix, here are things you should add/fix. I almost forgot, I'm getting braces soon and I'm bitmoji there's no setting for adding braces on your bitmoji character, I was waiting and waiting to see if it will ever come but... it never did. Here's another thing you fix. You should add more hairstyles, like these for example: two French braids (yes I do wear French braids in real life), two ponytails (I do sometimes see people wearing them) and last but not least, flipped hair (I have flipped hair all of the time). Those were more female hairstyles you can add."
473,archerbortion,"March 28, 2018",4,"Love Bitmoji, but would like more options for Classic. I absolutely love how you can customize your bitmoji so that it looks almost nearly identical to you, but I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed by the bitmoji deluxe update. I‚Äôm not really a fan of this particular cartoon style, and it would be nice if the same customization options were offered for classic. Another thing I would love to see, and I‚Äôm sure many others as well; are more clothing options as well as being able to create your own outfit rather than have to pick from the limited pre-made outfits."
474,Nuttybug,"May 14, 2018",5,"New MLS outfits I enjoy using bitmojis when talking to my friends, and there is always a bitmoji for everything. This is one of the best apps out there but there is only one problem. I‚Äôm rating this app 5 stars because it is amazing, but I would enjoy it more if there was an outfit for the MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER. This would make me a happier user and my bitmoji could show my pride to the sport I play. In conclusion, soccer is one of the most famous sports in the world and it‚Äôs spreading like crazy in America, so it would be much more enjoyable to see that in the app."
475,Minty_Girl‚úåüèª,"May 28, 2018",5,"Please Add More!! I love this app so much and use it almost on a daily basis. I feel that there could be a few more customarily options, though! Some ideas for the eyeshadow, hair color, lip color: Maybe you could add a color wheel and be able pick the exact color. I also want some more hats, glasses, and outfits! I would suggest Harry Potter and other book themed clothes. Maybe even make an option to make your own outfit. I love how often you get more stickers, but one day make a huge release for a ton of stickers!"

I mean I‚Äôm only nine and I don‚Äôt have an account for Snapchat and I want to make Bitmojis of my friend without having to reset avatar, maby you could access it in gmail or something, just make sure it doesn‚Äôt involve accounts that kids can‚Äôt have.

Sure, they can still use the stickers and all that, but they can‚Äôt change the outfits! When I go to the ‚Äúfashion‚Äù section it says that I can‚Äôt change it because it‚Äôs a website. It‚Äôs a great app, and I think more people would be able to use it if it wasn‚Äôt website and all in the app. Overall I really like it, but I can‚Äôt change my outfit because of this situation.

I use it almost all day but there's a few things that need to be added. 1-we need more hair colors such as highlights, ombres, and different tones of browns. 2-more and NEW clothing variations. There's too many tshirts with emojis on them and button down shirts. 3-there should be a search option in the app. I know the keyboard has the search option but it's pretty annoying to have the app on the keyboard directly."

482,trxppy_val,"May 21, 2018",3,Clothing kinda needs work Ok so I‚Äôve been in the BITMOJI app so many times bc I just sometimes don‚Äôt like the outfits it provides for us so I‚Äôve been thinking about how cool it would be to customize our own outfits to something we like. You could have like a small slide and say Customize your own outfit where we choose what our bottoms can be and a shirt and shoes so it can look like something some of us can actually like bc i would like seeing some shorts I like for my Bitmoji but I won‚Äôt like the shirt and I would see the same thing with shirts so I think my idea would be good for a new update but if you don‚Äôt like it it‚Äôs fine
483,Puppygirl_7238,"October 20, 2018",5,Amazing app!! Just one update you need to add!! Bitmoji is a app where you can personalize your own emoji/character. It is very fun to play with. Just one thing you really need to add is we can create our own bitmoji picture!! Like you can put your own words and stuff!! Even your own face!! Like for example. I would take a picture on bitmoji and then my character makes that face and then we can add our own writing!! Also! There maybe should be a contest if this update does happen!! All of us would love it!!
484,Hey Azumo,"March 20, 2019",4,"Amazing app! (Some suggestions) I. LOVE. THIS. APP!!! It is flat-out AMAZING! That being said, I have some ideas for you guys. (I'm pretty sure these have been already asked, but it's good to have reminders sometimes!) "
485,Reveiw Writter,"April 21, 2020",4,Bitmoji NEEDS a wheelchair option!!! My best friend is in a wheelchair and it would mean the world to her if you could add a wheelchair option because that‚Äôs makes her. When you stare at a screen with only standing characters it makes you feel like you don‚Äôt fit in and that shouldn‚Äôt happen. Everyone should be included! There are so many things that people are dealing with so adding a wheelchair could make their day. Wouldn‚Äôt it feel good to know that you made someone‚Äôs day a little bit easier by making them feel included and accepted?
486,missmaple,"March 6, 2020",4,"Size diversity is lacking Bitmoji is a super fun way to communicate with friends. I originally wrote about it not having enough body sizes, but I see that the latest update added many. Kudos, but please keep adding there!"

At first I thought it was just the internet, because I wasn‚Äôt connected to WiFi at the time, but it wasn‚Äôt that. A few days later, I tried it again, at home. There was the same result. I even tried making a new account but it wouldn‚Äôt even let me press the sign up button. So if the developers could fix that issue, then the app would be amazing."

489,Kendal_Toby,"June 13, 2019",5,Fun App! This app is great but I have a few suggestions. Could you possibly make a way to favorite outfits? Like select certain outfits to put them aside for later. So that way you can have a few you really like so that way they‚Äôre easy to find.
490,Yo519,"December 26, 2017",3,"Needs work I must say, Bitmoji is a very exiting app, but a few things need to be improved. First of all, when you click Bitmoji in your messaging app, you hasn‚Äôt go back to normal text. And if you can, at least make it a bit more obvious. Or a lot more obvious. Plus, you only have one chance on your avatar. No changing what‚Äôs been done. I‚Äôve had to use a separate email because I didn't receive any information on the mechanics of creating my avatar. Also, some of the Bitmojis look basically identical. That is a waste of storage right there. The only reason I‚Äôm keeping this app is because my avatar looks smoking."
491,Meameapower,"March 27, 2018",4,"Update Question I‚Äôve been using Snapchat and Bitmoji for a couple years now and I still love both.üòä I know you asked on the Bitmoji app if you wanted the update for more outfits and stuff, but I didn‚Äôt like how it made you look, then, so I said no thank you. But now everyone has that update and I want it now too so I was wondering if we could have something in Bitmoji that would let you get that update it and be able to turn it on and off whenever you‚Äôd like. I know this is a stupid complain but if you could that would be greatüòä, thank you."

Please add this option back! And thank you, thank you for all the great improvements and updates to the Bitmoji which keep it current and relevant‚Äîit does not go unnoticed!!"
493,Gracey Hefner,"May 25, 2018",4,Good but can be better I love this app and all the choices you get to create your character. But I think I could be even better. First I think that you should be able to create your own captions for your bitmoji. Kind of like on the gif app where you cam create your own gif. Second I love the outfits you can choose from but I think you should have individual shirts and pants etc so you can be even more original with the bitmoji. I think thats all my ideas. So if you could take these into consideration im sure more people will get this app. Thanks!
494,lizzz0,"June 4, 2018",4,"Need more curly hair choices!! Ok so, Bitmoji has a HUGE variety of hairstyles, features, hats, and clothes to pick from, but there isn‚Äôt many curly hair choices. At the moment, I‚Äôm using Bitmoji Classic, and Bitmoji Deluxe hairstyles are open to me, but I can‚Äôt find a matching hairstyle for me. I have medium-long hair, it‚Äôs very curly but gets frizzy a lot. The closest matching hairstyle I can find for my Bitmoji is the short (not pixie-cut styled) and curly one, but I would like to have a hairstyle choice for longer curly hair! I‚Äôm sure most of my curly-haired friends would like the same. If that hairstyle is added, I would rate this app 5/5."

Jewelry, tattoos, choose designer sneakers that you can match with outfits. The hats look weird because it just looks like a picture of a hat in front of the Bitmoji instead of how a hat would look if you were wearing it.

I love this app so much, however I recently cut my hair short but my hairstyle does not seem to be available in Bitmoji. My hair is flat and straight and shoulder length, but the only shoulder length hairstyle Bitmoji offers is a wavy one and my hat is straight!! I would like there to be more diversity in Bitmoji‚Äôs hairstyles, so my Bitmoji can actually look like me. You guys should have an adjustable hair thing, where we can choose our hair length for a certain hairstyle. Like we could have wavy hair, but have it shoulder length. There should be a scale to choose our hair length."

Great job with the app and if this app wasn‚Äôt a thing then my texts won‚Äôt be as good! So again amazing job with the app and I don‚Äôt have anything negative to say! Happy 2019 üòò
499,Ann3357,"February 4, 2019",4,"mostly  AMAZING This app is so great because it‚Äôs free!! But I do thing there are some features you could expand on.... it would be amazing if you could add French braids to the hair styles just because I feel like it‚Äôs a pretty common hair style. Also I feel like the eye shapes are not as accurate as they could be .... but I understand that everyone has a different look and that it would be difficult to capture all of them. Besides that, this app is great and allows you to make your own version of your self or some one else. I really recommend this app!!"
500,Yvonneclark98,"November 15, 2017",4,"Great app, needs more options though Bitmoji is a great app and it‚Äôs has a lot of options for the sticker kind of things once you‚Äôve made one, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement. It would be a thousand times better if it was more customizable, as in more different options for skin tones and hair and eye colors and stuff like that. And more clothes options, especially just normal casual outfits because I cant ever find a good outfit and my bitmoji can‚Äôt look much like me because I don‚Äôt have the right options. But all in all it‚Äôs a great app and very unique."
501,Movie Critic 1,"December 12, 2017",2,"Seasonal rant. It‚Äôs that time of year again. The time Hanukkah stickers do not show in your Bitmoji app or Snapchat because your phone is not set to English. My phone is usually set to Spanish, with the region still being the United States. I just changed it to English and, just like when I did it last year, a whole slew of Bitmojis for Hanukkah come up. None come up when my phone is in Spanish. Despite my region being set to the U.S., there are also loads of other Bitmoji stickers I cannot access unless my phone is in English. I think by night four they started appearing in my phone while it was in Spanish last year, so maybe I‚Äôll get it this year before the holiday‚Äôs over."
502,thot_lol1738,"February 2, 2018",3,"Loving the new update but it needs more changes I‚Äôm loving the bitmoji updates, however I feel that it needs more of them. There aren‚Äôt enough body types provided to users, as not everyone is built stick straight and not everyone has skinny arms and legs and a giant stomach. There also needs to be more variety with regard to hairstyles and makeup. I would also like to see more clothing for girls that is current with today‚Äôs trends. I definitely feel that making these changes would make more users happy and make the bitmojis more realistic. Hopefully some of my suggestions will appear in the next update!"

This would be a great feature. Secondly I would like to be more goth and hipster looking. These clothes are great but I‚Äôm a little more trendy than the app has to offer. Lastly a custom look. Some avatar apps let you change just the shoes to your liking and the shirt to your liking. I‚Äôm positive if you change this people would really enjoy the app more.

I no longer use this app due to the fact that my avatar looks so dull and different in those neutral cloths, I used to go crazy on Snapchat with posts. I just want my old outfit back üò≠"

I really really love bitmoji! i‚Äôve been able to mix and match my bitmoji for years. but there‚Äôs something i would like to suggest. 1) layered clothing. like we can have a long sleeve shirt and then layer a short sleeve shirt over it, giving it that ‚Äúeboy‚Äù look. or turtle necks under dresses for that ‚Äúe-girl‚Äù look. also, more accessories like chains for pants or piercings. lastly, we should be able to import a photo to put as a shirt design. thatd be uber cool and a fun way to customize bitmoji even more! please please please try it!"
507,old man magilicudy,"January 9, 2020",4,"Good-but could be better I really like bitmoji and I‚Äôve been using it for a while. It‚Äôs easy to use and fun to text with... but there is one problem. The options. The bitmoji fashion is cool(cause you get to pick your outfit) but too limited. There are almost no t-shirts with print. I also always wear a backwards bandanna and my friend always wears necklaces, but we can‚Äôt give these to our bitmojis. I think there should be an option to put things around your neck (scarfs, necklaces, ties, etc) other than that, this app Is pretty good. Keep up the good work!!"
508,GekyumeThePanda,"July 27, 2019",5,I love this app but... I really do love this app but I was thinking maybe you could add some nee clothing brands and Im trying to be a snob and so like Im rich because Im not üòÇ maybe you could add some other clothing brands I like the Hollister but maybe you could add like Gucci and Supreme and also a good idea is shoes if you added shoe brands and things like vans and stuff that would be so cool and just one more suggestion maybe add some like Xxxtentacion clothing you know for tribute that would be soooooo cool üòÅ and maybe even add his hair styles that would be super cool thanks! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
509,frieded bananna,"July 10, 2019",4,"No tin grin! I LOVE this app! A lot of times you can‚Äôt get a very accurate looking avatar because they don‚Äôt have many features to choose from but this app does and it‚Äôs really fun how many icons and choices they have to choose from. One major problem is that the App doesn‚Äôt have BRACES!üòû A lot of my friends and me think it‚Äôs smart to have braces on the app because most of your customers are teens and kids that like to use these kind of things and most of them nowadays have braces. So, if you guys had a brace choice it would be a lot more fun for everybody!üòÅ"

Ok so I have Bitmoji, and it‚Äôs pretty great, but I would like more tomboy outfits, and more customization, such as, I pick this top, to go with these jeans, and these shoes. I can express myself through the pictures/bitmojis the app generates, but not so much through the given selection of clothing. "
511,Sderst157,"December 31, 2017",1,App won‚Äôt update to current version. I had a Bitmoji when the app first came out and since I haven‚Äôt kept it up to date and ended up deleting the app. I downloaded the app again today after seeing all the newer options on my friends and family‚Äôs bitmojis and I was disappointed when I downloaded the app from the App Store and it wasn‚Äôt the current version of the app that they all have with none of the options they have either. It seems that it‚Äôs the same version from when I made my bitmoji a couple years ago. The app even looks distorted like it doesn‚Äôt fit on my screen right. I have an iPhone 8 with up to date software so that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Hoping someone can help me with this!
512,SkylerBiersack,"April 16, 2020",3,"Needs more options and diversity!! Love the app and I made my character look as similar to me as possible but maybe try incorporating more hairstyles that have bangs seeing as there‚Äôs only like three and they‚Äôre kind of okay, as well as more short hairs / short w/ bangs, curly hair, waves, etc. I think more color options for the hair as it‚Äôd be cool for my character to look like me and have half n half hair, my hair is half black half red down the middle and it would look sick on the character, and I think you guys should also incorporate piercings that would make a lot of ppl more happy and look way cooler. Keep it up"
513,BoojieBbbbbbbbbbbbb,"March 24, 2020",1,"Please please fix this..... I like this bitmoji app but honestly you don‚Äôt have a lot of hairstyles, & idk what happened to the selfie part to make your bitmoji off of it also what happened to all the outfits the app had like there‚Äôs no dresses or cute springy summery clothing??... we‚Äôre not in winter time anymore... I have a huge mole on my face can‚Äôt even put a mole on my avatar I feel there‚Äôs not enough of anything to make the avatar look like me bc honestly my avatar does not look like me it has a lack of eye shapes lips nose jaw chin face shapes hairstyles skin colors eyebrow shapes eye color... I can go on & on... fix it this please! I say the only thing I like about this app is that we can pick a dif shirt & pants & shoes but those hardly have a few choices to go by."
514,-swordgirl-,"March 15, 2020",4,"Pretty cool app (suggestions) All in all, a great app, I managed to make myself rather easily, but I have some suggestions. First of all, there should be options for things such as ear piercing or hearing aids, that type of thing. Secondly, I‚Äôm a swimmer, so it would be great if there was a customizable swimsuit option in the clothing area? Also, dresses that are in the shirt section or whatever would be great, instead of in the ready-made outfit section only. Also, the option to make more than one Bitmoji would be neat. Again, pretty good app, just could be better."
515,Emrose1212,"March 9, 2020",2,"Internet Connection I love this app and all the amazing features on it, but I can‚Äôt even open it! I have seen how awesome this app is on other people‚Äôs devices, however, I want it on mine. When I first got the app I opened it and created an account. I tried to open the account but my Internet was down. I shut down my phone and turned it back on. I turned off the WiFi and turned it back on. All my other apps were working just fine. This was four moths ago and the app still will not let me enter because apparently I don‚Äôt have internet connection but I know I do. This app is still awesome and I suggest it but please don‚Äôt let this happen again!"

517,Molly Lynn Morgan,"February 1, 2020",4,"Pretty great!! I love this app for allowing a more personalized emoji. It seems silly, but it‚Äôs such a fun little thing to recognize people and their bitmojis! My only complaint is that there could be a couple of things added... for example, I‚Äôd love if there were nubbins for those who use oxygen, or a hearing aid for those who use them! Although there are countless pieces of equipment for different people, a few basics (hearing aid, wheelchair, crutches, oxygen, etc) could go a long long way. I think it would be a really cool little touch that could make thousands feel more included."
518,ShadowCat08,"November 10, 2019",5,"Love it! I really like this app! I like how you can use your Bitmoji in snaps, texts, etc. But there are a few thing I would change. First: I like the Bitmoji merch, but I think you guys should add an IPhone 11/IPhone 11 pro max/ iPhone 11 max to the phone cases considering that lots of  people have this iPhone and would love to buy a case from you guys. Second: Every time I want to customize my bitmoji, I always want pick out an outfit that I don‚Äôt like very much. You guys should definitely add some more clothes to Bitmoji."
519,aliakarbs,"September 2, 2019",5,"CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES üíØ!!! I love Bitmoji I use it everyday. I love how you can make your own character but one thing that I think would be amazing if you guys made something were we could pick out pants shirts and shoes separately. Also you should make something we‚Äôre we can pick like accessories with our outfit (example, scrunchies, neckless, bracelets for ankles) and for boys (watches, gold neckless and more) if we had all of this stuff I bet you would get a 5 star but I‚Äôm rating it 4 because Bitmoji can get some improvements."
520,queenale.123,"January 2, 2018",3,"Bitmoji body structure Hi, I been using Bitmoji for now two years and I showed my parents the app. They like it but my mom and some other people that I showed have an issue with the fact that the Bitmoji body types are very limited. For example we should be building an app for encouragement and self esteem. How we see our bodies should be control of how we want to make other view us. Bitmoji should have more things we should have access to. Like how come if you have dimples and freckles , you can only pick one! What if you aren‚Äôt just round but you are curvy when you are thick women or men. Thank you and have a nice day!"
521,FartQueen:),"June 16, 2018",5,"Love it!! Bitmoji is a really fun app! I‚Äôve found myself changing my bitmoji‚Äôs  clothes every season, since there is so many options. Before I found this app, I had a similar app called Emoji Me. It had a lot of hair options and stuff, but the clothing was TERRIBLE. The only options were literally a tee shirt, a v-neck, a button-up shirt, and a shirt with a cardigan. THAT‚ÄôS IT. Plus, you had to make all of your own emojis! They didn‚Äôt come ready made like bitmoji. I Love the look of the bitmojis and love how much you can customize them. Thank you, bitmoji!!!"
522,U will never know my name >:3,"September 9, 2018",5,"More clothes? Hello~! I really like the app and I‚Äôm wondering if you can add more clothes options? Like for example, animal jackets like pandas, foxes, and bunnies (And have a option to put on the hood :3)?Or some more accessories! Like, bow ties, bracelets, AND customized? Another idea is to add designs to clothes from our camera roll? If you don‚Äôt understand, I meant take a photo from our photo library and put oh the clothes we like? You don‚Äôt have to if you want! I just wanna give you some suggestions (I dunno if they are suggestions xD)"

The six maternity outfits are boring and not my style so now I can‚Äôt have a pregnant Bitmoji to match my pregnant self in real life because I‚Äôm not going to wear any of those outfits. When you‚Äôre pregnant you get a belly, which is part of the body so it should be a body type not an outfit choice.

Plus definitely more clothes ! And it would also be amazing if you could make and choose out outfits on your own. Other than all of that. This app is the best."

It‚Äôs really fun when you want to show the person your texting, your reaction. It also brightens your day. It‚Äôs fun in Snapchat too. And I absolutely luv that you get to pick your clothes from a FUL variety. And it‚Äôs great that they have bitmoji merch."
526,juliaminnesota,"January 12, 2019",4,Ideas Hey there Bitmoji staff! I just wanted to say good job on making such a cool app with so many cool features to make an emoji to look like you! I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve already thought about this but i feel like my Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look exactly like me. I was wondering if there was someway that you could take a picture of yourself and let the system process it so it‚Äôs a more accurate look. Of course you could make some changes after the picture you take. I know you‚Äôre probably not gonna use this idea but I thought it was worth a shot:)
527,matoghost9,"April 2, 2019",4,"Good but needs some things! I‚Äôve had bitmoji for years now, by years I mean like when bitstrips were a trend on Facebook, but anyways, some things are just.. missing. Like the one thing that bothers me the most is the options for lips. 3 options, really?! Also, the clothes are like.. way off. We need some more stylish and trendy clothes, like retro, since that‚Äôs back now, or crop tops and skinny jeans! More curly hairstyles, NOT JUST WAVY! New makeups and updo hairstyles. New outfits every now and then are cool and all, but the rest of the customization has almost been completely dropped."
528,THE YEETER >o<,"May 24, 2019",5,ME LIKE DIS APP #love this app! The characters are soooo cute! I love all the different options like there‚Äôs evens an avocado!!! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that they don‚Äôt give you more options on clothes and hair. Like i searched 10 min to find hair that was even the smallest bit close to mine! And if it gave you more headwear options that would make the app even better.
529,PRnGinger,"February 17, 2020",4,Finally Great job on mix and match better clothes that's truly an improvement thank you. Work on new morning images and actually more new images please tired of using same ones. 
530,‚ô°JillyBean‚ô°,"September 22, 2017",5,"Bitmoji Suggestion Bitmoji is a fun, creative app. I really enjoy using it to communicate with friends. One thing you should add is a feature where you get to create your own Bitmoji text. For example you could say, ‚ÄúYay it‚Äôs Friday!‚Äù This would definitely add personality to your Bitmoji text. With this feature you would also be able to add stickers and text. Your Bitmoji can also dress up in different outfits for that text. Thank you and I hope you take these ideas to a whole new level!"
531,teen with an opinion,"March 2, 2018",5,"NEW CUSTOMIZATION CONTROLS I always have loved bitmoji bc she is so relatable, but now she looks like me! The customization controls are so much better than before and the only improvement that could make it even better would be more clothing options, off the shoulder tops, more van style shoes, destroyed jeans... she would be living her best life if she could wear an off the shoulder top with destroyed jeans. Anyway the update with the new customization options are so awesome. 10/10 but add more memes please, that would make me so happy."
532,Pebbleshmm,"May 8, 2018",5,Suggestion time! I love the app and to make it better I listed things that would make it better:
533,Josh613548,"May 31, 2018",4,"Great app just need more hairstyles I think this app is great it matches my likeness pretty well. But, I personally think that they should add more hairstyles. Maybe look at popular hairstyles people have, maybe add some more dreads since the ones now aren‚Äôt exactly what most people have, maybe ones like rappers now. And maybe add a feature where you can choose where the hair coloring goes on the hair somehow that would be cool because I know that people put their coloring in different spots of their hair, I think if these were added the app would be amazing."
534,Briar Pettersen,"July 15, 2018",3,"Great! But one Minor Problem I loved Bitmoji and how you could customize it to literally make you! Or... sometimes maybe you change yourself up a little hehe... ;). But getting to my point of the minor problem, I have my bitmoji on Snapchat. And obviously my opinion I want my bitmoji to look like me. So recently I dyed my tips of my hair. So I went to change it and there was nothing even close to my hair color. All I‚Äôm saying is maybe add a color wheel or something (I‚Äôm not an artist =|) just something that can let me pick the color of my hair. Thank you for your time and hopefully you could fix my problem. üëçüòúüôè"
535,LuvHermy,"November 6, 2018",4,"Developers please read! Developers please read......I love this app it‚Äôs WAY BETTER than the other emojis I‚Äôve used, I would give 5 stars if you could add a thing where you can make another Bitmoji person like for example a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù and we can send those to our friends.....I hope you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say. I would also like cool hoodies and pants, some cute sweatshirts with boyfriend jeans and more hairstyles with more colors. I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask but it would be AMAZING if you could do that. I would definitely give a 5 for that! Thank you!"
536,BEKI_101 lol,"November 18, 2018",5,"Review over all.. Over all, this app is awesome! I use it a lot, usability is usually for Snapchat, but it‚Äôs fun to play along with!"
537,tinstle,"May 5, 2019",4,"Great! but could use more variety in everything I use the app so much! But I feel there are boundaries to expressing ur style, for example; they are very limited to the choices of clothes. I feel they should expand their variety maybe even make it so u can personally customize ur Bitmojis outfit.  Have maybe tops separate to bottoms and shoes. All are just suggestions, but I seriously recommend getting the app so u can really express ur feelings through the little stickers or messages they have.  They have a sticker/message for everything!!!"
538,s V gsgsfzfzgxvzc,"April 12, 2020",5,"Wonderful app I always use this app for texting. It has funny and serious and also things like happy birthday. I also love how you can make the Bitmoji look exactly like you. The only suggestion I have is to make it to where you can create more people like if you could make two Bitmoji and save them both then use them for different texts. Also, I would like for you to add more hair options such as pigtails, French braids, and others. Other than that, I love it! üëçü§©"
539,Dr Funk Malone,"February 7, 2020",5,"Please read, a honest review Bitmoji is an amazing app and I highly recommend it. You can make the perfect avatar with the perfect body and facial features. You can choose your own clothes to fit the perfect style for you and your own shoes with hat choices too. Further more you can chooses the perfect amount and color of makeup. The stickers are also super cute and there is pretty much one for everything.  I highly recommend getting it. Thank you developers for making this amazing app."
540,pretty pink dancer,"April 27, 2018",5,"Wish there could be more I am in love with this app! But there are just a few things that I wish could happen. Number one, I wish that you could take a picture of yourself and it would make an emoji out of it for you. Number two, I wish that you could add more hairstyles and clothes. Lastly, I wish the stickers would move instead of just putting a sticker down that doesn‚Äôt do anything. Thank you and I wish that you can fix these things."
541,RedLightningStrike,"July 18, 2018",3,"Like this except one thing... This is a fun, cute, cool thing to use in your texts! It‚Äôs cool how you can customize your avatar and choose an image of him/her to text to a person. However there is one bad thing about this: It wants full access. This means the developer can see and access everything you type. Unless you are comfortable with your information stolen, don‚Äôt allow full access."

It makes a virtual you, hooks up to your Snapchat account, and allows you to send your friends cute and funny little Bitmoji pictures! I also like how you can make your own character! The one thing that I dislike though, it that there aren‚Äôt many curly-haired choices.... and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE Bitmoji, and most of the apps that I get for personalized characters don‚Äôt even have any curly-haired options. I am just saying that I would be VERY thankful if you would make more curly haired options do fellow curly-haired people! Thanks a bunch! ‚ÄîCurly Hair Person üòâ"

But I‚Äôve always wished there was a ‚Äúsearch bar‚Äù or search option to single it down to certain Bitmojis. For example I wish I could type ‚Äúanimals‚Äù and have all the icons with dogs, cats, etc. Or type in ‚Äúwork‚Äù or ‚Äúfood‚Äù and have it show all the options for those icons. Other than that I love this app; only wish there was a way to filter through the Bitmojis faster for certain convenience."
545,Se√±oritalattie,"May 5, 2019",3,"Not enough. I feel as if you are not putting enough effort into this app anymore. Nothing has been updated recently and it‚Äôs getting quite boring. You guys need to add updated outfits, new hair, maybe some new features like nails, jewelry, height etc. because i‚Äôm sure many can agree that it hasn‚Äôt been updated recently. When u guys added the new type of bitmoji (the +) many people at my school were talking about it and were excited to use this app once again but we are all getting bored of the same old stuff.

I just wish that you had a few things that are not in the app. Such as being able to have more then one person/ avatar. That would be a really nice thing to have. Another thing that I would really like to have is ripped jeans, that‚Äôs what is new and trending. The last thing I wish it had was the ability for you to wear name brands. Like you could wear nike, Gucci, adidas, puma. Other then this the app is great!"

However I like to change my look every so often and I've gone through everything except for the preggo clothes since I'm not pregnant. There has been numerous updates but none involving clothes. The most recent gave us NFL gear which is cool and all but I'm only going to wear my teams and nothing else. Can you please update outfits for females and males but females first lol I'm dying for a new look and even a few new hairstyle options would be nice too. 
551,Kerrblack,"March 14, 2018",5,"Mix and Match clothing You advertise that I can dress my avatar as I do myself but that‚Äôs not the case as the option to mix and match is not available.

You‚Äôve been around long enough so you need to step your game up, you can‚Äôt have these kids‚Äô games doing better than you. Just update already! "
552,a fellow minion,"October 22, 2018",5,"Needs a search bar I‚Äôve only had Bitmoji for a few months, but I love it. I checked the update and saw that there is now an outfit search and I LOVE IT. But there needs to be a search bar for the actual Bitmojis too like there is in the messages keyboard, so you can find certain emojis within the app. And I would like you to add more chest sizes. I just don‚Äôt think three is enough. And I don‚Äôt think there are enough realistic skin types for Indian people. But other than that it‚Äôs a great app."
553,Javierhangulo,"January 27, 2019",5,"Love it The app is amazing and it‚Äôs nice how you can actually make it look like you because of all the little details. But I would love it if you guys added Band tees like Guns N Roses, My Chemical Romance etc and if you added tees with long sleeve shirts under them. What would also be very cool is being able to put together your own outfit. I feel like my Bitmoji isn‚Äôt really me because outfits are very important, so it would be cool if we can choose our shoes, top, bottoms, etc but overall it‚Äôs really good"
554,nattebean,"May 8, 2019",5,"I Recommend I love Bitmoji. It has progressed into something quite versatile for different users. The only thing I would suggest to the developers is to further the diversity in it by adding piercings.

This could be a way that we could fill the gap for now and prevent or help to prevent depression. It‚Äôs my idea of course so I expect to have some type of compensation üòùüôèüèºüòá

The new update where you can choose and customize shirts pants etc. but the only thing I hope the bitmoji updates is more styled hairstyles for girls.

I think u should add in the option to change the pose of your character and if u are in fact feminine in anyway then that should be the choice a person can make not have it to where I‚Äôm posed like I‚Äôm a gay man when I‚Äôm not. Over all it‚Äôs a great app and i appreciate if you guys  can give us a different option to pose when changing clothes it would be awesome thanks!
562,HStar1105,"February 23, 2018",4,"So much fun I love using this app, especially the Bitmoji keyboard. My fianc√© and I have so much fun talking through our little Bitmojis. One thing I wish we could do is maybe have a Bitmoji pet! I think that would be so cute. Plus it would be fun to be able to recreate my pup! I love the new style update. "
563,Laney8302,"March 25, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs great, but could be amazing! It‚Äôs an amazing app and I love that it connects to Snapchat and how realistic it‚Äôs been getting! But if you could make it to where we could customize our eye color and choose two colors like we can with our hair that would be awesome! I have hazel eyes but no color, not even the many greens and browns, come close to matching. Also if we could customize our outfits more, like choosing a top separate from a bottom and separate shoes... I think that would really make the app better and more interesting!"
564,üèêVolleyGirl4Lifeüèê,"May 3, 2018",5,"Pets!!! I absolutely love Bitmoji!! It is my favorite app ever. I love to go on and change my hair style and outfits, but I think it would be amazing to to have pets that could be a part of the Bitmoji pictures. So you would go on and choose a pet like dogs, cats, hamsters, and birds. Then you could choose the type of breed it is, like if you had a dog that‚Äôs a Lab. You could also choose the color fur or feathers it has, and add a leash or collar to the dogs and cats.  It would also be fun to add things like bows, bandannas, or crowns to the animal."
565,Skeetyeetboi,"November 10, 2018",5,"More options would be greatly appreciated Can you guys add add a thing where you can choose your shirt and pants and shoes. Rather than just bundles of things I think it could look a lot better and let people express themselves more in social media by truly making themselves on a platform as big as snap chat, though it is a small thought I think it would be interesting and give people more options. and have a great day to any one who are this."

Please read I love this app and my friends and I use it all the time but some of the  things that made me not give it a five star is that they don't have the option for braces. I have braces along with most of my friends yet there is no braces option which makes me sad. Also I wish you could mix and match outfits so that you could make your own outfit rather than just use the ones they give you. That would be awesome!!! Other than that I totally recommend the app and think that it's great!
567,Stormi_shillingburg,"December 17, 2018",4,"GREAT APP But,two suggestions Hello, I love this app! It is amazing but I wish you would add more hair styles! Who ever reads these should get one Pinterest and look at popular hair styles and you should see some ones you should have. Just a tipüòâ."
568,lover.unicorn,"January 3, 2019",4,"Fun!!! üòõBut some mistakes!‚òπÔ∏è It is a really fun app. But I would like more outfits. Also more colors. The amount of hair styles is good but I couldn‚Äôt find the one I wanted. So I would like to see more. I also want there to be a color wheel, because I dyed my hair teal. But there was no teal. It still is a really fun app to use. My sister used it on Snapchat. She was happy about her design. But I with we could do more than one. Because I had to start all over when I wanted to make one for Snapchat. One for a sticker. So these are some of the important mistakes that I see."

And I got really angry at that and I updated it, I looked online where to find it, I asked friends, and I can‚Äôt die the ends of my hair for my Bitmoji and it‚Äôs really annoying so I would really like if the creators of Bitmoji  were to fix that!

Most of the ppl ik have nose piercings and it‚Äôd be nice to see that addition.

574,Blaze_Piffington,"January 11, 2019",4,"Bitmoji been fixed, can use now without freezing Previously since about December or November the app was causing some issues, whether it be messenger or WhatsApp or any type of messaging app Bitmoji would not want to cooperate. It would cause freezing and well, it was just tedious and a big hassle. However with the current update they have fixed the issue‚Ä¶ For the most part, it's still a little glitchy when you try to change keyboards but far better than before. "
575,savannwah,"March 20, 2019",5,"Awesome ( but I have suggestions)from snappykitten This is an amazing app! I use this app the most every day. I have some suggestions though, I think y‚Äôall should include piercings and tattoos. For example, choose the place you want the piercing then the app gives you different designs. Then for tattoos, you design the tattoo you want then tap the place you want it on your body. Thank you so much for listening. Just some ideas to think about!

(Even though it shouldn‚Äôt be).  But can we have more body type options? There‚Äôs a pretty big jump between the ones offered. And the largest one is one type, heavy on top, smaller legs on bottom. I, and a lot of other women I know, am the exact opposite of this...thick legs and smaller waist and torso. Or even, to be able to customize different areas of the body to make it what I want It to be would be cool! Thanks team Bitstrips!"

To see how much it has grown since being around 7-8 y.o, I am amazed! I couldn‚Äôt believe it when you guys came back around with the Classic ones! And now Deluxe!! Keep on creating new things for people to express themselves better! And please oh please keep the originals intact for whatever comes next. I love switching through all three of mine."
582,EmmanuelBarrios,"February 10, 2018",5,"It is a great app. This app is great. Th only thing I hate is that I can never find the clothes I‚Äôm wearing on there. So I came up with an  idea about one year ago and thought they should make a camera option were we can take a picture of our clothes and then get the same clothes. I also had an idea were we can also make our clothes. We can chose a shirt, the pattern, the color. Sam with the pants, and shoes. So Bitmoji can you please do that. I am begging you. Please, and thank you. üòáüëçüôè"
583,17—ïŒπ–º—ï,"February 17, 2018",4,"Just a few more updates I love this app, but I just think there should be some more outfit choices, I just couldn‚Äôt find any cute outfits that I would wear so my bitmojis style is very different from mine. It would be cool if there were a customize feature where you could personalize your bitmojis outfit, pick out a shirt, pants, shoes, accessories, coats, just to make it as similar to your individuality as possible. I also would like some more hair possibilities because I have a cowlick in my hair and I can‚Äôt find any hairstyles that look similar to that."
584,Chrysandra,"April 7, 2018",5,"MORE CLOTHES AND PIERCINGS you guys have made it possible for bitmojis to be more diverse in everything BUT the clothes. i cant find any clothes i actually wear in what you have to offer. my idea is that you let us individually select a shirt pants and shoes like you do with other accessories so there‚Äôs not anyone with the same outfit. i want a broader spectrum to truly make everything unique. AS WELL AS piercings like nose, lip, eyebrow, etc. there‚Äôs many people who identify with their piercings and i think it‚Äôs something you should add."
585,JustinPfauth,"April 13, 2018",5,"Outfits I love Bitmoji. I use it with Snapchat and I‚Äôve used it for a while. But the only problem is when new outfits come out, you get rid of older outfits. Why not just keep all of them? Also another thing I would really really love is if bitmoji added something to where you could mix and match different outfits. Like if you wanted a shirt from an outfit and a pair of jeans from another outfit you could wear them together. This would make bitmoji 100% absolutely amazing."
586,JtotheFrey,"May 16, 2018",4,"Fun app, but needs more Love this app, but your creative team should get a little more creative on how we are able to pick our clothing.  Maybe allow people to choose shirt colors and styles independently from the pants and shoes. It would make it a little more fun to be able to have control over more details like that. The process overall would be more fun if we had control over many more details in customizing our avatars, instead of being stuck to your preloaded options. "
587,Katkluv,"June 25, 2018",1,"Diversity is Failing I love to use Bitmoji emojis when talking to my friends, but there‚Äôs something that really bothers me. A lot. People come in MANY shapes and sizes. Not every single person is a size 0-6. And not all plus size people are so big that you can‚Äôt see their arms when they are standing still. I find it extremely offensive that there is only one plus size body option and it‚Äôs way bigger than the previous option. It jumps from 0-100 real quick. It‚Äôs hard enough to not have your size represented in fashion magazines or cute clothing sections. You should not underrepresent a majority of the female population. I would suggest that you fix this fast because it upsets me and it upsets a lot of your customers."

First, the hair I think it would be nice to have a function where you could maybe spray the colors on so you could have two or three colors at once. Also, the outfits they're cute and I like them but I think you could be able to take different parts of different outfits to really make it an outfit you would actually like to wear."
591,Shoegirl331,"February 17, 2018",4,Lack of details I love bitmoji! So entertaining to make a life-like cartoon of yourself. My complains are that some categories greatly lack in variety. Here are things we need:
592,Restlessmind8,"April 3, 2018",2,"More? I would love to be able to customize clothing more. None of the current styles represent me. Also, the current curly hair styles are not that great. There needs to be more. They are all a little too poofy or there aren‚Äôt enough to represent every level of curl. It would also be really cool if facial piercings like nose rings could be an option. I prefer the classic bitmoji because I think the whole point is to look as much like a cartoon as possible. Changed my outfit for spring and I‚Äôm more ‚Äúhipster-ish‚Äù in my clothing choices. All the women‚Äôs fashions that aren‚Äôt super girly automatically make you look like you‚Äôre dressed like a man or a straight-up butch lesbian. GIVE US MORE OPTIONS."

594,kikipalomita,"December 20, 2018",4,"Love It! Well... I love the app except for the fact that there needs to be more options for customization in terms of more hairstyles and body types. For example, the part that triggers me the most is how there is either slightly wavy hair or coiled curls; no in between! The only hairstyle that applied to me was the overly exaggerated curly hairstyle that they (thankfully) removed. It was so exaggerated that it covered any wording in emojis. Us girls with the ‚Äúin between‚Äù curl types need styles both short and long!!! Please devs, do us curly girls a favor and implement these for us! Thanks anyways for reading my review."

I have curly hair with a fade on the sides and there is a hair like that but it makes me look African-American and I‚Äôm Hispanic. So could you guys add some curly poofy-ish curly hair with a fade on the sides? If you could than thank you! I love Bitmoji. Also I‚Äôm good with the outfits but it would make it more fun if you added more trendy/teenage outfits."
596,Fortnite Fan (alyssa),"February 16, 2019",5,More Outfits please Hi Bitmoji I rate this app 5 stars because this app you can make a look alike of you!!! But besides that I just need a comment about the outfits. The outfits are ok but there should be an option about making your own outfit with a lot of clothes. For example you can choose your own top and you can choose your own bottoms and shoes. But the outfits you have are cute for girls!!! I was just giving you guys alittle option!! Thank you for your time to read this!!!
597,LittleRed727,"September 19, 2019",1,"Desperately needs a customization overhaul I love Bitmoji, but there hasn‚Äôt been any new customization options for months. Most of the clothes are severely out dated, and the lack of new content has made myself and many others lose interest in the app. The only content released is content that no one really asks for. Everyone is begging for customization, but all we get are new cartoons. Separate outfit pieces would be amazing! This allows for much more individuality and self expression. More varieties with skin colors and body types would be a more-than-welcomed change! New hair styles and colors would also be great along with new options for every other existing customizable facial feature."
598,Bobbirox,"September 4, 2019",4,"good! i personally love the bitmoji app, but i do have a few suggestions, the first one being more hairstyles. i understand that you can‚Äôt tailor everything to everyone specifically, but maybe adding an option to flip the side the part is on or just change the part in general could be beneficial! also, maybe add some more body choices? with females at least (i have no clue about the men) there‚Äôs not much diversity in the body options. i think this could be improved as well. otherwise it‚Äôs a SOLID app."

Because someone may have, say a prosthetic arm or no arm at all. They wouldn't be able to find the option anywhere. (As far as I know) No app has that, that's what will make it more popular.

I enjoyed creating my character and I sent my friends all different bitmojis. I went to type normally and the app would not allow me to send a regular text. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall it several times but this problem continued. Other than that I think that this is an awesome app and I hope this problem is fixed soon.
603,Tsunami Qwannie,"April 6, 2019",4,"More ‚ÄúUrban‚Äù Hairstyles And Clothes I Love My Bitmoji !!! But it is DEFINITELY time for an update with the clothing options and hairstyles.

And then the clothes seem a little outdated ... maybe an option to pick clothing items individually? Like, a list of shirts SEPARATE FROM THE LIST OF BOTTOMS?

609,5Lrhythms,"November 26, 2019",4,Need a better variety of colors Let me just start off and say that I really love this app. But one thing I feel could be improved it the way you do outfits. Because I‚Äôm like dang I really like this outfit from brrmoji but I want my jacket to be a certain color. Maybe you could make a pressure touch setting like in apple emoji where if you press on it you can select a different color etc. I would just love it even more if I could make my bitmoji‚Äôs outfit to how I want and have more options. Other then that this app is awesome.

I‚Äôd also like it if we could make adjustments to each body part specifically instead of just choosing a body type, since the overall build is alright but the individual body parts (arms, legs) dont look like mine.

Just a thought, because sometimes there are really cute outfits but the shoes kind of don‚Äôt match my style. Or the pants are too short. This could probably be fixed with more customization options! Overall a cute app!"
614,Stirling Dow,"July 1, 2018",4,"Improvements I love this app so much but two things I would add about the avatars are that some people have braces and there is no braces options. Which a lot of people have them. Two, I wish there was better eye color options with more than one color in them. My eyes are blue and yellow on the inside, my friends are brown with yellow. A lot of people have more than one color in there eyes so this feature would be useful. These are just suggestions to add on but I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about the app, thanks :)"
615,t10159,"April 21, 2020",4,"A little thing to make Bitmoji more money and better Well I personally love Bitmoji but I think that in the parts of mercy for Bitmoji they have cropped tops, and cropped too hoodies. Making those will be more fashionably relatable to the current times. "

I wish you could add patterns to the clothes where you customize your own outfit and add stuff like dresses and jumpsuits. I LOVE THE JUMP SUIT YALL USE but I wish I could customize it. I would make it light blue with little yellow stars. That would be just beautiful. I also love yellow; I would love it if you could find the colors you want more easily than scrolling through a little section on the screen sand make it bigger for things like my ipad mini 2."
617,Byeee_felicia,"August 4, 2019",3,"Body positivity I love bitmoji, I love how it integrates with snapchat. As someone who loves being different I really enjoyed all the updates they did to improve hair color, and style options, and really let you get as close to your features as possible. That being said, its really annoying that there are 3 different options of thin body types, and one very large body type. I always feel like I‚Äôm slightly cat fishing people with my bitmoji lol. Can the next update involve some different body shapes, as well as better options to show size? For us chunky girls that still love our curves?"

619,Merysings,"July 12, 2019",4,Love it.......but I absolutely love Bitmoji I just have a couple things that would be AWESOME if you could change or add
620,Fkkgkfdkekwjejjejeejeke,"November 8, 2017",3,"Needs more stuff Hi I just wanted to say this is by far one of the best sticker app I have encountered BUT bitmoji needs to have a lot more options when it‚Äôs comes to customizing your avatar. I was also quite disappointed when I couldn‚Äôt find my style while dressing my avatar. There should be more outfit options, my friend is goth and couldn‚Äôt find her style. I would give this app five stars if it had more outfits and customization options. I hope the bitmoji creators take this into consideration because I know this would definitely  be appreciated by many people, including me."
621,RiddleRaven,"December 2, 2017",4,Search? Categories/collections? Favorite? Okay why isn‚Äôt there a search feature?? That‚Äôs my number one request. If not that I‚Äôd take collections/categories/tags to make browsing easier. 
622,Unhappy Unknown,"January 10, 2018",5,"Lovin It! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôve been using this app for quite a long time, and I love this app! There are so many options for your character design, and the keyboard is very accessible. I only have one recommendation: add an option for braces and earrings. Braces don‚Äôt apply to me, but I have other friends who do. I also have earrings, but there is no option to add. Imagine how many options there are for earrings, when you could make so many designs and colors and patterns for earrings and braces."
623,oddunicorn.9,"May 28, 2018",4,"More outfits I love bitmoji, it‚Äôs a great app.  But, you need to add many more outfits.  Like outfits that are relevant like sweatpants with PULLOVER sweatshirts, rompers, and just more trendy and relatable outfits.  It‚Äôs hard to love the app fully when you can‚Äôt find outfits that you like and relate to.  I think you would get much more users if you added more outfits.  Maybe you could make a feature where we get to choose our own shirts, pants and shoes separately and choose the colors of it, like when making your bitmojis face.  That would be awesome!"
624,Ladygagal,"July 23, 2018",3,"Love it but experiencing technical difficulties I love the app and have turned a lot of people onto it, hunt recently the app has been glitchy. I have followed the troubleshooting instructions and am reluctant to delete my app and redownload for fear of having to make a new Bitmoji. "
625,gavdanielmint,"August 9, 2018",4,"Love it but do I really? This app is amazing and it lets you personalize your own character to look like you or whatever you want.  The only problem is that there could be a better version that‚Äôs more interactive.  Such as being able to role up your sleeves if you have a long sleeve on, decide whether you want your pants cuffed or not, button or unbutton your flannel/button up shirt.  You could also be able to make your own outfit instead of picking an outfit out which isn‚Äôt as fun as the app could be."
626,Meowmunchies,"August 15, 2018",5,"A suggestion! Hi Bitmoji! My name is Ava and I have loved Bitmoji forever. I had a fun time sending funny stickers to my friends, this app is the perfect app for tweens and up. One thing my friends would all love to see is some type of outfit that looks like a school uniform. Because all of my friends go to catholic school and we wish we had something to express and embrace our look! I know that I‚Äôm just some lame kid but I would love if your team will consider this suggestion!"
627,SydandRoxie,"October 22, 2018",4,Great but... I love this. It‚Äôs a step up from emojis and I feel like I can actually express what I‚Äôm trying to say without actually speaking the words. The only thing I would say is have more diversity. For the body types there is only super skinny and really fat. Maybe add an option to adjust the hip and thighs to make it a more realistic outfit choice. Also the outfit selection. Please please PLEASE have a wider variety and make it so you can pick the pants and shirts SEPARATELY. Add striped shirts too because there is not a single striped shirt and they are ‚Äúthe thing‚Äù now
628,aleahbryan,"February 7, 2019",4,I have a request!!! Please make it to where you can do like in snapchat.  
629,EatLikeAGirl,"April 13, 2019",5,"I LOVE BITMOJI!!! Ok, first of all you have freedom over everything!! Second, you can have fun recreating and designing ones for you and your friends!! You also have a choice of editing your emojis and having a picture of yourself to copy!! There are only 2 problems though, first, there should be more clothes options for sports, second I think you should be able to create as many as you want on one account. Hopefully the editors get back to me!! Thanks, bye!"
630,@hbk-deer,"June 19, 2018",5,"More Options I love Bitmoji and find it easy to use! It‚Äôs one of my favorite apps, but we need more clothing options. I know, I know, there‚Äôs at least 100 clothing options available but we need more! üòÇ Especially in the hats section of the app. There‚Äôs a lot of hats but a lot of religion related head ware too, it‚Äôs about 50/50 but where are the hoodies, and durags? (DEFINELTY ADD DURAGS!! THATS A MUST [in different colors too]) but yeah. Just add a few more hat options and outfits and Bitmoji would be 100x better! Thanks"

I‚Äôd like to see more things like tattoos and piercings for those of us that have them. Customization is always the more fun part. Add in the option to move facial features around more. Such as up and down, and well as size. For all facial features. Smaller brows, wider brows, higher up mouths, wider noses, etc. the app is fine and does what it says. It‚Äôs pretty cool. I enjoy it and use it. Would also love to see a color wheel option for skin, hair, and makeup. As well as eye color. Customization..."
632,hrs2007,"October 17, 2018",5,"Great app!!! I love this app!!My friends and I have conversations through bitmoji all the time for fun. I love how i can personalize the avatar to be just like me, but I think it would be cool if our bitmojis could have braces. My bitmoji looks so great, but not identical to me and I would love for you to add this feature. Overall this is a great app and I love using it and customizing my avatar! I want to let you know that this is a well designed app but I wish you would had a few more features."
633,Alijaa Rose,"December 28, 2018",4,Outstanding:))) i use this almost everyday on Snapchat. i‚Äôve had it since late 2016. i love how the friend feature lets u use bitmoji stickers featuring your friends and how you can customize your avatar.
634,William Spitfire,"January 2, 2019",5,"Things that could improve the app I personally love the app, but I do believe that it could do more with the customization process like adding more body types and giving more facial feature options like for those who have two different eye colors and for people who have scars and facial piercings, not only to be more inclusive but also to help people express their creativity. Also adding slots so people can make more Bitmojis would also be cool."
635,kiki09800,"April 13, 2019",4,"I really like it Just a couple things that I don‚Äôt like well in the app you can‚Äôt search for specific things or look at your other saved outfits but on the text message app you can. Also, it would be a little cooler if you could make your own outfit rather than choosing one that is already put together the only part of the outfit that you can choose is the hat "
636,Not happy parent.,"February 6, 2020",4,"Great App But... I really like bitmoji I like to use it when i‚Äôm texting someone however, i wish there would be more choices for hair. Since i have very defined curls none of the hairstyles look like my hair which is a little upsetting. Also some of the older clothing that people don‚Äôt use should be replaced with more modern clothing due to the fact that i feel like most of the people who use bitmoji are relatively young and are always on the fashion trends so none of the clothes are really something that we would wear."
637,lihsgffvftvgy,"January 27, 2020",5,"Amazing app!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I always text people with a Bitmoji, there is always a Bitmoji for some kind of text you use! This app is my most favorite app on my iPhone! I really love all of the outfits and everything! There is just one little problem, I don't know if you can fix it, but whenever I go on to Bitmoji, I can't go into the outfits and stuff, it says it is restricted, which is weird because it was never restricted yesterday. But besides that, this game is the best!"

639,#Pineapple12345,"June 18, 2019",5,Has anyone thought about this I love Bitmoji but I have braces and I will be having them for quite a while and when I was updating my character I  was hoping that there would be an accessory for braces but when I looked there wasn‚Äôt any and I thought that maybe by writing a review someone would read it and maybe try to get more accessories on Bitmoji overall I Love Bitmoji but maybe just a little bit of a wider range of accessories for the face and more.
640,Jaybroww,"November 13, 2017",4,"A little more gender fluidity I think Bitmoji is an adorable app and comes in handy for cute replies and quick text backs. However when it comes to the clothing options, I wish there was just a bit more gender fluidity. Someone shouldn‚Äôt have to choose whether to only wear men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs clothing. You should be able to choose whichever fits your style more. And maybe instead of full, pre-made outfits, we get the option to choose individual pieces, (shirt, shoes, pants) and create our own personalized outfits. Just a thought."
641,MarB2,"February 13, 2018",4,"Wider appeal of expressions Great app, does a better job of personalizing the avatar, and the expressions/phrases are great ‚Äîvaried & funny‚Äî but not with as widely expressive as I‚Äôd love to see.  No offense, Millennials, but some of us would like to see more options for choices like breathe, meditate, or anything slightly stronger/positive, more confident than what‚Äôs currently available. Ollie had a good idea with the clothing choices, too."

644,Nat Grey,"June 9, 2018",5,"Fashion idea Overall it‚Äôs a really cool app and I love using it!! But I was wondering, I think it would be cool to have more customisation with cloths, like maybe you could add the option to make a custom tee shirt? Like say it starts out white and you get to choose a color and maybe at text or a photo onto it? Or even add say a stripped pattern ect?"

I mean this is just a suggestion but can you guys add a feature where we get to pick our own style, like make our own clothes, like example pick our own top we like, pants, shoes, if you know what I mean? But this is just a suggestion! Anyways keep up the good work! üòä"
646,shortyyyld,"November 24, 2019",4,More customization Hi bitmoji so I had tris app for a long time and I used to have the forever 21 outfit on my bitmoji. Later on I changed it. This was a long time ago. But when I wanted to switch it back to the forever 21 it was no longer there. It‚Äôs very unfair how some people still have the forever 21 outfits on their bitmoji since they didn‚Äôt change the outfit. It makes me mad that I can‚Äôt have my bitmoji like theres. There is no good hairstyles no earrings no good outfits. Please add forever 21 back. Add more things. Please everyone understands.
647,1228{:‚Ä¢),"July 25, 2019",4,"Great app but I‚Äôd like some things added First of all, kudos to the bitmoji crew for this really good app. One of the 2 things that I want are the ability to have braces and other accessories such as watches or rings. Also, I wear my glasses when I just want to chill but I wear my contact lenses out to places. I wish that there was an option for contacts or glasses. Anyways, I hope you read this and if you do, I want to thank you for making this app and allowing me to communicate with friends and family like never before."
648,amoreash,"July 16, 2019",4,"Love! I love this app.. A couple things I just wish we could have multiple people you can make and save,like children options. Maybe more options in features. I would allow u to mix match clothes and make a closet maybe. Or design diff breeds of dogs and maybe horses. Or you can add a bitmoji you saved to join yours in a picture or those that have a bitmoji but not snapchat and decide which position which will be in. I have so many ideas that would be awesome to see! These are so much fun though!"
649,Rayann Richards,"July 8, 2019",3,"My opinion Having a bitmoji is great for many things. Like snapchat, texting, ext. Also there are some cool things to make your bitmoji look like you. But I do think there should be more ways to make your bitmoji to look more like you. Such as choosing your shirt, pants, and shoes separately should be an option. Girl bitmojis should be able to wear guy clothes and Vice versa. Piercings should also be an option. And being able to change the color of things such as gasses. These are all things that myself and many other people I know think bitmoji should work on fixing."
650,CLPrincess,"October 7, 2017",4,"Like it but minor suggestions I like this app a lot; however, I was wondering if one of the body types could be a curvy plus size for women. The plus size body type just has a big stomach and has heavier features but not all plus size women look like that. Some of us have flatter stomachs and smaller waist lines. Also, can we get some silver jewelry, more hair accessories and some pencil skirts and blouses? Like the app a lot though and these are just my little suggestions of what would make it better! Thank you for the app!"

Like I stated before love the update but wish some of the features I had on my old Bitmoji translated well to the new update. Keep up the good work I like where the app is headed!
653,Mglitz26,"April 9, 2018",5,"Love it, but..... When my friend first introduced me to this app I like everything about it but one thing. Clothing. It would be nice if they would add more clothing to the adidas section because there is only three things on there. I have so many other ideas they can put on there for the adidas section. Also add more brands. I would love it if more brands were made like, Gap, American Eagle, Hollister, etc. Just a few suggestions, a new clothing update would be nice. Thank youüëçüèΩ"

Adding more than one Bitmoji would be nice , so you can switch between them, and not loose the previous ones. Also it would be nice to have a little more medium length hair options. Something I think that would also be nice would to be able to put braces on your Bitmoji. But overall love the app."
656,Starblondie,"February 23, 2019",5,"Make outfits more personalized. I love the bitmoji app. I just have one suggestion to make the outfits a little more personalized by having the choice to chose the shirt, pants, and shoes all separately instead of having to use the pre made outfits all the time. I just think it‚Äôd make your bitmoji even more like you and it‚Äôd be fun to make up your own outfit.

We were looking forward to re-customizing our avatar... only there‚Äôs 4 different types of skinny and then one type of heavy: morbidly obese, or at least that‚Äôs the way it seems. I noticed this before but with the new settings, all the new customization features, that we would be able to do more. and still there are just 4 different types of skinny and then whale sized if you‚Äôre fat. It‚Äôs ridiculous and feels a bit discriminatory."

Also, can us girls be able to access the men‚Äôs hairstyles? Some of us have much shorter, specifically styled hair that cannot be found in the women‚Äôs category. Thanks!"

Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter this app has got you covered! One of my favorite emoji apps and you can really make the character look just like you."

678,Imaginegirl13,"July 24, 2019",5,"I have a suggestion I love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs fun, creative, and quirky. I have an idea that could add another adjective to the bunch: stylish. Sure, there‚Äôs already a vast wardrobe of outfits to pick from, but what I want to see is the ability to chose an individual item of clothing. Sometimes, I would go through the outfits and find a shirt I really like, but I don‚Äôt like the bottoms it‚Äôs matched with. Also, I want to chose individual accessories to go with my outfit such as jewelry or a purse. "
679,rifiunicorn,"July 14, 2019",5,"I like it but it‚Äôs not the best So what I mean is I love it but the language so if you not aloud to see unnecessary language I recommend not getting the app and if it could have accessories I‚Äôd love it one thing for adults if adults put something like adult or child so they could have the unnecessary language also the outfits I love them but I don‚Äôt I wish they have ones they YOU can decorate! It sounds like fun . So fellow Bitmoji people I asking for accessories, and thats ALL!(braces)"

682,DISCORD rocks MLP,"May 5, 2018",4,"Cool App, but I‚Äôve got some recommendations :0 As someone who is on some different messaging apps a lot, these can be cool to use! But some of these messaging apps have the option to have different backgrounds in them, and this is where a problem emerges. What I really want is for the backgrounds of the sticker to not be white- but transparent so you can use them in chats and they have the same effect as in I-message and stuff. That‚Äôs all really, just think it would be a really cool edition to the multi-platform users :P"
683,Callee2005,"May 13, 2018",4,"More I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji ever since it‚Äôs collaboration with Snapchat. In my experience with this app, I‚Äôve felt that they need to implement a wider range of skin tones. Their last major update included adds of more skin tones which weren‚Äôt helpful to me in the slightest. I feel as though they should add more skin tones in all levels they already have and add more undertones to skin or maybe even a color palate so that we can create our skin color closest to our natural. Thank you for reading and please take under consideration."
684,Joeglo,"May 14, 2018",4,"more selections pleaseeee I love the premise of Bitmoji it‚Äôs cute and fun. But it‚Äôs hard to make my bitmoji look like me. There are too little of selections for outfits and hairstyles. Especially for curly hair. My options are super short, (which my hair is long) or this crazy mane with a middle part (im cool with the fullness, but why a middle part man?). The great majority of the outfits aren‚Äôt realistic. It‚Äôs summer and there‚Äôs a winter selection? why All of the sports sections?? cN you just make normal outfits in black i‚Äôm stuck with jeans and a hoodie because i wouldn‚Äôt wear anything else.."

686,Samurai Aay,"June 4, 2018",4,"Great Idea- More Hair Styles Needed Great idea of an app! I have loved Bitmoji since I‚Äôve started using it. The new update Bitmoji avatar is my favorite. I love the different clothes you can pick from and facial features. I love it all! Except the variety of hair styles... :( My hair is short and wavy, but not curly, and I have yet to find a style that truly depicts it‚Äôs true identity. I think there are more wavy hair styles that can be added, and straights. I also think you can add different shapes of lips too. That would make me truly loove this app and give it a 5. ü§ó"
687,PretzelMouse,"March 23, 2020",3,"Great, needs more customization options While I do love the new custom outfit feature, the selection is quite bland.

688,ppppppaaaaasoooooooooo,"January 4, 2020",3,Please read Bitmoji is really good app but I still have a couple changes bitmoji has a option for having more then one person but when you press it it says you have to have a Snapchat account and I don‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt want to sign up for Snapchat so I think you don‚Äôt have to have a Snapchat account. And also I think that people shouldn‚Äôt have to right there email and a password because what if you for get your password well you think to do the magic link when I do that it says magic links exspired. That‚Äôs what I think
689,themajikpig81,"December 12, 2019",4,"Great app but needs a few things This is a great app and I use it all the time, but I‚Äôm kind of annoyed that there are no options for highlights under hair treatment. Most people have either natural or dyed highlights, so if you added this that would be awesome. Also I wish there were options like braces, earrings, and tattoos, because I feel like most of the people using the app will likely have one of those things. But other than that it‚Äôs a great app, and I love the new mix n match update. ü§òü§òü§ò"
690,Midnight Lily,"September 11, 2017",4,"Pretty neat, but more physical features please! I really like the bitmoji app, and I actually saw another review that had a really great suggestion- a color wheel for skin, hair, and eye color options! I would also like to see more hair options if possible, especially for mid to long hair for girls because my hair is getting past the point of the bitmoji ones! And maybe if we could customize body features more that would be great, like adjusting arm length, thigh size, or height! Also, earrings would be amazing!!!"
691,Minion love,"September 18, 2017",5,"Love but PLEASE UPDATE!!!!! I love using this app and use it all the time and even recently got my husband to use it!! However, I, too, like the others here, want to see MORE. MORE outfits of different kinds for all seasons, especially fall/winter coming up, costumes for Halloween? Seasonal outfits?! Also. HAIRSTYLES. Please have option for highlights!! For example my hair is brown w/blonde highlights but none of the options really looks like my hair... also a way to save your outfits and have more interaction with your Bitmojis like a Bitmoji Universe! I like the one review suggesting a Bitmoji game where you create your own home/town land and interact with friends on there (like Sims but for Bitmoji)! "
692,Hoffjuff,"November 11, 2017",3,"More hairstyles, body types, skin tones! Listen, great app but you guys need some stuff. "
693,Queen of vines,"February 10, 2018",5,"Different kind of styles I think they should change the clothing styles. Make outs individually being able to choose our own styles. I was looking for something more emo or goth for my character but not much that I like. I love the app don‚Äôt get me wrong. I also think it would be neat if we could do our own kinda make things. Such as a example, freckles  I have them all over my nose but when I go they only have them on cheeks."

This app is amazing!But..There needs to be more items!So I am getting my braces.I thought that I should try to find some braces for my character!I looked threw everything but none to be found! I am there for all updates to see if there are more items.I hope that there can be more outfits more accessories for the character! I want these things to happen!THANKS SO MUCH! I am hoping to see new changes!
696,GooAttack,"September 7, 2018",5,"Bitmoji is Life I love this app, I love Bitmoji, cannot get enough. However, with all the new customization options it would be SO NICE to break down the outfits into parts. As in, being able to match shoes, tops and bottoms as you wish instead of having to pick an entire outfit as is. Sometimes an outfit is perfect but the shoes are wrong, or the shirt is off but the pants aren‚Äôt. It would make it 100% perfect if I could mix and match to really make it me!! Please!?!"
697,Be Global,"October 16, 2019",4,"Just some small things Great app, and I love all the facial customizations features (but man there are a lot). Wish there could be as in-depth clothing customization as well, like for example, taking a picture of your favorite pair of sneakers and being able to wear them as your avatar once you outgrow them, and to be able to save and create outfits because that would also be really cool. Just some ideas to think about if anyone at Bitmoji company or the app developer team actually sees this."
698,LindsayAsdfghjkl,"October 10, 2019",4,"More than one bitmoji please Ok..I LOVE this app!! Not to mention, I‚Äôd love to have the option to have more than one bitmoji! It would open up a lot of more opportunities for expressing characters instead of having to erase your other bitmoji. It‚Äôs like Memoji but different in its own style. Having more than one would be extremely helpful. Especially for the more artistic ones. Pleas make the feature in the future for people that can‚Äôt have Memoji but can have this even MORE amazing game. Please respond"
699,me283838362,"August 7, 2019",4,"Great app, just a few ideas to improve!! I love, love, love Bitmoji! This adorable character is so much fun to send to friends! I have noticed though, I think that being able to choose options like braces would be great, or a different smile type! I know that many people all have different smiles with braces or other mouth treatments, or even just the fact that people have different smiles in general! Being able to add braces or change smiles would be great! Otherwise, this app is amazing! I love Bitmoji!"
700,"Happy girl 3,000","June 17, 2018",4,Would be five stars if... I have always used Bitmoji but with the last few updates it says I have the latest version but other people have things that I don‚Äôt. I sometimes help other people create their Bitmoji and I discovered that other people have things like braided hair and hair treatment while I do not. We both have it updated to the same version but I still don‚Äôt have these other options. It would be a five star rating if they could get this fixed!
701,¬ßAnonyomous¬ß,"September 25, 2018",4,Bitmoji ideas and feedback I absolutely loved it! But I was thinking there should be a color wheel where you could choose the color of your clothes instead of colors already on the clothes and you should add more clothes like a hoodie that is long like a hoodie dress and some tomboy-ish stuff and maybe add more hair styles because the ponytail isn‚Äôt so nice in my opinion and you should have you can save the look and create more outfits over all this is a cool app I love it sooo much P.S. please take my advice on the clothes and hair
702,Bear123bear456,"October 22, 2018",5,"Suggestions Bitmoji is a great app! I recommend it for anyone who has Snapchat or just likes keyboard stickers! The thing is, i think it would be a better idea if when you get the app, it only shows up on your keyboard and on certain apps like Snapchat. For example, Game Pigeon hides the app from your home screen and can only be accessed by keyboard. I‚Äôm just giving suggestions but overall this is a fun app and you should add more hairstyles"
703,Fiizzy Anonymous,"February 10, 2019",4,"Great but one thing... This app and Snapchat are great and I have little to no problems with them, I use snapchat everyday and bitmoji and a fun and creative way to choose an avatar, the only problem, more of a suggestion, is that you can possibly add more to the wardrobe or create a way to design your own outfits and customize? I have seen that the artists and creators of this app are very professional and I believe they have the capability to produce a greater variety or ways to represent yourself on Snapchat üëç"

There aren't enough hairstyles, and my hairstyle isn't even a syle in this app (long straight hair with long bangs). Because there is no hairstyle that matches mine, I had to choose a different one that looks nothing like mine. So I would like to suggest an update where you put more hairstyles in it, since others may also have this problem. Beside that, this app is amazing and I really like the whole concept of it."
706,Ali Alkinani,"March 27, 2020",5,"Please try to add these things I love the app just try to add these things.    First piercings. Try to add nose, ear, lip, eyebrow, etc piercings.     Next they basically have all clothes but I would like if they added overalls that you can match with the shirts, ripped jeans, and more shirts like a long sleeved hoodie crop top, hoodies that are one piece or more designs for the hoodies. And lastly can you try to add more hair options?? Like loose curls or more hair styles?      Other than that everything is good!"
707,hubbub13,"December 2, 2019",4,Update Problems Some of my friends and family all ready got the new update of customizing there clothes and I haven‚Äôt got it yet. I don‚Äôt know if you can control that but I will like for it to not be one person be jealous of what one person wears and tries to find it for hours and doesn‚Äôt find it because it‚Äôs custom and they can‚Äôt make it because they don‚Äôt have the update. I would say over all the app is really good and I really like it besides the update problem.
708,WierdGril,"August 10, 2019",4,Just some changed I love the app and all but for me it just needs a few changes. I wish that there were options to mix and match outfits and change the outfits up a little bit more and that there was a little more variety. I wish that you could add mid length hair. Most of the hair that I see are either too long or too short and my hair is mid length so I would love if there was mid length hair added to this. If theres a few more changes i‚Äôd love the app even more.
709,sure no me,"July 13, 2019",5,More styles I love this app very much it‚Äôs very fun to play with and text people the only thing is none of them match my style I would say if they could approve on stuff they need to get more more styles and they also need to get more Cesery‚Äòs for an example nose piercings and like more hats and stuff because a lot of people want to feel more comfortable with the styles but Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt have all of those accessories to make everyone style pop
710,Em0107,"February 7, 2018",4,Just a suggestion. I love this app especially now that it‚Äôs linked with Snapchat . I think with this new update they made great improvements like providing more realistic skin tones and tons more physical characteristic options. One feature I think would make this up Even better would be if the user would be allowed to individually put together outfits. This allows the user to express them selves more freely instead of having to chose from outfits already put together .

However, being pregnant is a body type and we should have access to all the clothing articles and just change our body type to having the belly so we can wear any of it ! I never got to dress my bitmoji cute through the holidays or anything due to the fact that I‚Äôm pregnant and have to stay in workout gear 24/7. "
713,Ctbebe,"March 6, 2018",4,It‚Äôs great Bitmoji has made snapchat and texting fun. The deluxe update was a great one how ever i would like to see better options for the clothing. It definitely needs more trendy options and separate the tops and bottoms to really be able to create those fashion forward choices. Also the maternity options are minimal almost to the point where you don‚Äôt even want to use it I know all the pregnant ladies out would love to see more options!! Hoping these these updates come soon!!

Also it goes to your keyboard! The only thing I do have to mention is I wish you could at least create more than one character."
716,irlandaEscobar,"May 2, 2019",5,Good app confused This is an amazing app the thing is I can‚Äôt get back into my account.

717,QnN.M.W,"December 31, 2019",4,"Body Shaming I do like the app a lot it is fun and I like to personalize my character, however I don‚Äôt like the body options they have for ppl that may be a little heavier. They have you shaped like a upside down pear üò¨and that‚Äôs not fair because it makes your clothes look ugly and weird. Honestly that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt care to download it again for that reason. I don‚Äôt want to choose the smaller person so my clothes would look right and choosing the pear shaped person I‚Äôm just not interested."
718,Hello- My-Dudes,"December 6, 2019",4,"Love it but needs some fixing I love this app it just needs some fixing. The new update is interesting. I love it because you can make a custom outfit (like changing the clothes color or picking your own shoes)but also it doesn‚Äôt let me click on the avatar button or the outfit button. Also it freezes all the time. One more thing, I really recommend a braces button, a half shaved ponytail hair style, and a sweater crop top without buttons or a collar. I love that you added vans though. Thanks!"

727,jjnowak1980,"August 13, 2018",4,"More clothes customization needed It‚Äôs a good app; adds a touch to Snapchat and wherever else you use it, but I think we‚Äôre LONG overdue for the ability to choose the clothing separately.  One outfit has good shoes or pants, but a dopey shirt.  The next has a good shirt but tight pants with dorky French rolls and silly shoes.  I literally cannot find a single outfit that I completely like, and would wear in real life.  Not everyone is a fashionista.

729,Firegreen.62,"December 27, 2018",1,Don‚Äôt get this app! They will tear your heart out. I‚Äôve been using it for a while now and hadn‚Äôt had too many issues. That is until recently. I noticed that my friendmojis have been disappearing. It first started by reducing the number of ones I could find and then it systematically began removing them categorically until I could only find them in the recently used ones. Today I woke up to not being able to find them anywhere and that‚Äôs when it hit me at how often I use (used) them. My heart is broken because I can no longer send a friendmoji with my love and I as trees or with grumpy cat as we miss each other dearly. Please bring this back.

The search function is too specific leaving out many bitmojis that might fit your situation. The second, and most annoying piece (I actually found myself avoiding bitmoji so I didn't have to deal with it) is that once you have searched for something and pasted it in your text it is now more difficult to get back to the regular alphabet keyboard.

It says it‚Äôs a 12 plus game but when you make an account you have to be thirteen!!! Like if you are 12 are you supposed to sign up with your parents information instead??? Like if your less than a month away from your birthday where you turn thirteen it will annoy you a lot!!!! I mean ya you could make a false birthday but it still annoys me.

While the option has always been built into the special keyboard, if you so choose to use it that way, it was never included inside the freestanding app. Thank you for finally adding the most useful feature into the app itself."
735,.:Elijah Gamer:.,"December 14, 2019",4,"Great update for custom clothing I have used Bitmoji for a little over a year now, and I can say that it has served me well. The new mix and match clothing option is a big step, especially since previously, users were required to change the outfit by selecting a preset. This allows you to create an outfit by yourself. However, my one complaint is that the app does not allow you to delete unused outfits, forcing you to have them in the closet forever once you hit save."
736,tey #28,"August 1, 2019",4,"Eye colors I love Bitmoji but I would like it if we could have a bit more eye and skin colors, I have hazel eyes and there are none there, my eyes are brown then green. Can we get a bit more eye colors please. Also that there are no hair styles that fit mine so if you could add some thicker styles that would be great. Last things some people have a chest that is in between medium and completely flat. Last thing there aren‚Äôt a ton of good clothes. Otherwise this is great! I‚Äôll add 5 stars when stuff changes."

738,pineAppleEXPRESS07,"June 16, 2019",5,Just one suggestion I love this app.  It is fun and exciting. One way I think u could make this better is if you could make a setting for the character to have one arm or leg.  My mom lost her arm and we would greatly appreciate it if you could at least try for everyone else who has one leg or arm.  I think more people would like this and would please people.  Please take this into consideration thank you very much.

But A Little Room for Improvement Bitmoji is one out of a million apps like this it‚Äôs so different, but still amazing, I would like if there were more customizing like braces, and the clothes are amazing but could use more clothes and for the hair, can there be more girl and boy hairstyles please, I mean like they are really good but more please, that‚Äôs all I have to say but this is only a suggestion so you don‚Äôt have to do it but would really love this."
740,MemeBri,"February 17, 2018",4,"ITS GREAT...but some improvements I love the app, but as a mixed girl, i‚Äôd love to have more options to choose from in the hair department, especially curly types.  xD idk the hair types doesn‚Äôt ever seem to fit my own, they‚Äôre either too thick, too short, or too long, also the hats look weird for curly hair and aren‚Äôt modified to be placed on to the hair but rather glitched into the hair itself, which is not a problem for straight hair in the app. other than what i mentioned the app is great, would love to see improvements though"
741,Newgrams,"March 12, 2018",5,"Suggestion Would love to see the ability to mix shirts and pants as well as some new designs, i.e. maybe more peasant tops and blue jean capris along with some flat sandals or flip flops. I would also like to have the ability to tweak the body size a bit more. I absolutely love this app. These changes would make it a solid 5 stars for me and many of my friends that enjoy the app as well. Would even be willing to pay for updates. Thanks!!"
742,Rosaa,"May 3, 2018",5,Maternity options The app is great. Has almost all themes you‚Äôd want. The only thing I‚Äôd change is having more options for maternity wear. There are currently six outfits that change your body from nonpregnant to pregnant. Better yet: If only there were a way to change the body type instead of the clothes because this would offer all of the clothing options as opposed to just six maternity wear options.
743,unhappyballerina52,"June 20, 2018",2,"I am extremely insulted by this app! While I love the app, and think it‚Äôs super cool, I am insulted by the fact that there aren‚Äôt any outfits supporting unusual careers in the fine arts. While they have great outfits for people who are bakers, doctors, and police officers, there is no respect for the fine arts! Where are the ballerinas, the dancers, the gymnasts, the musicians, the artists!? Everyone would love to be able to put their bitmoji in a tutu, so why can‚Äôt they!!!!!! I am so fired up about this! I wouldn‚Äôt suggest getting this if you like arts, in fact I may just delete this myself if this isn‚Äôt fixed! I expect to see the problem resolved!"
744,sarahgrim,"June 28, 2018",4,"‚ÄúFriends‚Äù keyboard capability? Love the bitmoji app and all the versatility but you guys NEED to add a ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature to the keyboard because my favorite bitmojis are the ones with Snapchat contacts in the Snapchat App! There‚Äôs NO good way to move the bitmojis with a friend‚Äôs avatar into texting or other keyboard typing...right now I have to send a bitmoji in a chat with the Snapchat contact, screenshot the whole conversation, and then crop the screenshot to get a little bitmoji of mine and a friend‚Äôs avatars interacting. There needs to be an easier way!"
745,Ji Me Sora,"July 10, 2018",4,It could be better The app itself is amazing but the outfits are limited. I could like with thing from one outfit and another from a different outfit it would be nice if you could choose individual parts of the outfit like a section for top and another for pants and one for shoes and accessories to mix and match. I‚Äôm not going to wast my money Inez giving you reasons you should do this because you may not bother reading this so her is a small version and I hope you consider it.
746,Sofia1820,"August 15, 2018",4,"Great! But... Hi! I am a Bitmoji user and I love the app. I use it in Snapchat and text all the time. If you are wondering why I took one star away, I will tell you why."
747,Charlcie marie,"October 13, 2018",5,Question about IPhone X vs XS I love the app. I use it all the time but I noticed something and am wondering if this is because of the new XS or an issue with my phone. I have the iPhone X and my sister has the new XS. We have noticed that in her iMessaging she has an option to send a picture with both of our Bitmojis together (like on Snapchat) but I do not have this button. Is this something only offered on the XS? I‚Äôd appreciate any answer to this.
748,MishaNatural,"April 8, 2019",3,"Fine, but... The app runs well, I personally have never encountered any bugs with it. For the most part, the avatar creation is good, but one major area that I think it lacks in is body types. There‚Äôs no option in between ‚Äúa little bigger than average‚Äù and ‚Äúliterally built like shrek,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt ideal. I‚Äôm quite chunky but definitely not the disproportionate, morbidly obese body type that is offered. Another improvement would be to add an option to creat your own outfits from selections of tops, bottoms, shoes, and full-body outfits like dresses or jumpsuits."
749,FairyScienceMother,"June 2, 2019",5,"Love! More customizable? I love Bitmoji, all of my friends use them and we look forward to updating them as we change. The new status feature is really cool! I‚Äôd love to see more outfits being added more regularly if possible; maybe some pride outfits for this month! It would be cool to set what kind of car and what color your Bitmoji drives on snapmaps too! "
750,bubbleyshi,"September 12, 2017",5,"Really love I think you should give us options to mix and match clothes to our styles, and have a few more hair styles, like my hair is always super curly and it's short and I have bangs. I look like Velma basically, glasses and everything!"
751,top-reviewer,"October 13, 2017",5,Great Love this app and the integration into snap and iMessage! Revolution way to connect and send your reactions quickly and clear definitely beats emoji! 
752,ADog121206,"January 21, 2018",5,"More! I love Bitmoji but i think that there should be more clothing items, more hair styles and lengths, braces, earrings, and maybe more glasses colors! Another thing you might want to add for people that have broken their arm is a sling and a cast. Maybe you can try to add a feature that will let you add certain names onto it! I hope someone sees these sugggestions because I think they might help get the rates up but so far you guys have done a great job üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
753,great xoxo money,"April 29, 2020",4,Ok I have had this app since last year and I think it is ok because when your thinking something certain and you type it in the search place it sometimes says no results or it doesn't have it at the top where all the suggestions would be. I still recommend getting this app because you can make your avatars like Snapchat üëª look like you and they have sizes and cute clothes and you can change your whole face look!
754,TheAnimeEnchantress,"March 18, 2020",5,"Not enough hair options There‚Äôs more than enough hair color options and many other things you can choose from on Bitmoji, but the hair doesn‚Äôt have enough styles. It‚Äôs all either down or in a pony tail or a bun, there‚Äôs TWO braid styles I‚Äôve seen so far and it would be really nice if you added a Dutch or French braid option, also I would LOVE it if you could add in an option to change the sides of the part."
755,JakePaulerüòÖ,"November 17, 2019",4,"Good app, but.. Hi! I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji ever since it came out and I really like it. I like the variety of different styles of hair and how you can make your Bitmoji however you want it to be. I just think it would be beneficial to be able to have guy or girl clothes for everyone just because I know of a lot of girls that like guy clothes rather than girly type of clothing, vice versa. I really hope you take this review in consideration because I would love to be able to have a girl Bitmoji with guy outfits!"
756,Lily C üê±,"October 9, 2019",3,"Who even made these outfits I‚Äôm taking the time out of my day to write this review because I need everyone at Bitmoji to know, THEIR OUTFITS ARE TRASH (and have been since the beginning). I have waited and waited for the outfits to get upgraded, but nothing ever changes. God, did my mom dress these characters?  Can we please get some 21st century fashion? I want my Bitmoji to look like she knows what‚Äôs trending. Seriously, put some more effort into it. Do some research if you have to, go into any retail store that isn‚Äôt designed for white moms in their 40s please and thank you."
757,Your girl Kaiya,"October 8, 2019",4,"Something missing I would‚Äôve given this five stars except something is missing. I am an Native American Indian lady and I realized that there is everything else except Native American Indian feathers or anything Native American Indian related. This made me a little upset and I was hoping someone could add this. It honestly isn‚Äôt fair that ya‚Äôll aren‚Äôt including us. So please, fix this and keep making AWESOME content. Overall, this is and amazing app that just needs one thing fixed. Great app, keep creating, and good job!"
758,Courtnutt,"September 27, 2019",5,"Awesome! I love this app! I honestly do! But sometimes; just sometimes, these outfits can only go so far! Like I love the variety, but what about our southern people who hunt and fish?! Like is there a way we can get some camo outfits other than the military outfit? I believe others would agree. It‚Äôs hunting season and we can‚Äôt show our personalities if we are dressed in one outfit in real life (like camouflage) and our bitmoji is in normal everyday clothes!"
759,LITTTTTTTTYYYYYB,"August 14, 2019",2,"The natural hairstyles ... I‚Äôve always had bitmoji, butttt I think that the natural hairstyles are very limited. If you have curly hair you can understand that there are different types as w people in the more straighter field of hair. But have around like 10 hairstyles for people w curly hair when I‚Äôm sure there are good amount of people that use bitmoji for sc have curly/natural/kinky etc. it just gets annoying when I look through for more options but is never right? Maybe look at real life examples and hair on other people not everyone w really curly hair I‚Äôve Afros for a head yes it has it volume but it‚Äôs not always so poofy"
760,Majitoestaloquita,"January 21, 2018",4,"Please more options So everyone is pretty much saying the same thing but here we go again: please add more things! Some of the hairstyles aren‚Äôt very good (like we need a better man bun with some volume and medium length hair that isn‚Äôt ugly) and more piercings! Nose piercings eyebrow piercings lip, would be totally cute! I can be patient with the clothes so as to not ask for too much because I get you can‚Äôt attend to every little thing like the single freckle I have on my cheek but fun stuff like that would be cool please!"
761,Medish,"February 14, 2018",5,"Search Bar Love, love, love Bitmoji! This new update has me obsessed. I find it a little difficult to search through all of the options though without having to download the keyboard. I think the app could use a search bar where you type something in & the images are generated, similar to the keyboard feature. An easier way to browse images would make the app much easier."
762,Chichimason,"March 29, 2018",3,Search function please I like this app but often just use a regular emoji because it it too time consuming to find the image/message I am looking for. It would be so nice to have a search function that allowed you to type ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù or ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù or something to get you to the area you need to be. I never know whether Thanks is in the smiley face section or the celebration section and I don‚Äôt really want to scroll through 100 images to find the thanks ones. Please make this easier to find specific emotions/themes.
763,Hanomaly,"May 28, 2018",5,"More hair for Deluxe i love the new update but think there still needs to be more hair styles. Straight hair buns, straight hair pigtails/twintails üëßüèª (like you have in bitstrip). "
764,Evie ‚ô°,"June 16, 2018",4,"Add Bitstrips! In my opinion, this app is great. The reason it‚Äôs four stars here is because I thought bitstrips was amazing, so maybe there can be another tab on the app that includes bitstrips? If you haven‚Äôt used it before, bitstrips are little comic strips of your avatar and other people that are funny. I would really appreciate it if the developer maybe sees this and considers it, or if you agree than say it in your review! Overall amazing update, no bugs, and I like the new(er) character style. Thanks for reading!"
765,Sarahgirl1005,"July 24, 2018",4,"Fashion Game I enjoy the bitmoji app and the character for snapchat, but I wish you could mix and match outfits. It‚Äôs kind of annoying, how you only have a limit on certain outfits. Like for example, you like the jean shorts on an outfit but not the shirt, you could mix and match it. Another recommendation is jewelry (e.g earrings, necklace, bracelets, etc.). For earrings, there should be cartilage piercings, earlobe piercings (firsts, seconds, and tripples), nose piercings (nostril, hermitage,  etc.) it would be great to see these two features be brought to bitmoji."
766,LizzyOhkay99,"September 27, 2018",4,"Great, but needs a search c Okay listen, I love Bitmoji, it‚Äôs super fun, we could use some more hair options and clothing options but that‚Äôs not my main complaint. What I do want to say is that there needs to be a search function in the Snapchat messaging version of bitmoji because I HATE having to scroll indefinitely to find the right bitmoji, or send the wrong one accidentally. If there is one (for messaging, not for adding bitmoji in your snaps) then perhaps you should make it easier to find?"
767,dblack1009,"April 13, 2019",5,Love it I have had Bitmoji for a year and I love it I like all the details you can do and all the different outfits but please make sure to add more like stuff with shorts because I like to dress my character just like me and usually I where shorts because I do not mind the cold so please add some more short options but thank you so much for this amazing app I like this better than I like emojis I use this when I do not feel like typing
768,Dani_loves_u,"February 15, 2020",4,"Hair color and PIERCINGS!!!!!! I love the app, I love the fact I‚Äôm able to make it look so much like me!! But. Being a person that has multiple ear and nose piercings, it would be absolutely amazing to see an option for that as well!! Y‚Äôall have some so good this far, but that would definitely a next step!! And also having a wider and wilder selection for colored hair. Like two tone (half and half) hair colors for short hair, dyed tips with different colored roots for short hair etc. that would be awesome!"
769,Bitmogi Suggestions,"January 16, 2020",4,"Love Bitmoji but it needs some changes Ok I want to start off by saying I really love bitmoji and use it all the time and the new update is great because you can customize outfits but I think some things you need to add are braces, jewelry, dresses, being able to change headwear color, overalls, patterns, etc. I think these would really help and if these were added I would give it a 5 but for now I‚Äôm sticking to a 4. Thank you and I hope that these will be added soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
770,Dale T 68,"February 23, 2018",4,"I love it but.... I love Bitmoji but there should be more stuff. I use it like 99.9% of texting but I still think there‚Äôs room for improvement. There should be more clothing options, or you should be able to customize them. There should also be more hairstyles like for straight hair or really curly hair or short hair and the list goes on and on. I also think there should just be more like Bitmojis or poses in general. Overall I really like it but there is still a lot of improvement."
771,Anmonyous,"March 5, 2018",4,"Yes Overall bitmoji was perfect for Snapchat in my opinion, it‚Äôs a great way to spread some kind of sympathy to others. Although there aren‚Äôt many ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù or ‚Äúnice-looking‚Äù outfit options the different features of the face catches a great add on, it could use a couple more sections of outfits like for instance, sweatpants and tee shirts with headbands or maybe a fancy dress with sparkles but kind of casual for the people who admire fancy casual wear or like a cute flannel or a nice off the shoulder or lace up top with a suede skirt just for some suggestions :)!"
772,Dino zoo86578568,"April 14, 2018",5,Add some stuff This app is amazing but there is like only one thing that bothers me. that is that they don‚Äôt have a choice for people with braces or grills and ik it‚Äôs not thaf important but it would a little more detail to the Bitmoji or people w/ tattoos or piercings if u guys added that that would make the app better üôàüôèüèº but this app still deserves a rating of 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è I hope u guys actually read my recommendations if u do could u try to add this stuff pls üôèüèºü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
773,choirgeekü§ìüé§,"May 24, 2018",4,ANSEWR MY WISHES I really like this app. I really do but there is one thing that‚Äôs bothering me. I have all these fashion ideas and I really want to use them but I can only pick certain clothes and like almost all of them r really boring üòë. And can u add something to where that person can make their own clothes? I think that would be really neat. Also I would like u to add headphones so my Avatar can look like a DJüéß. Other than that I love it and I think u guys did a really good job. P.S- Some of the pictures r really funny ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
774,ugghhh annoying,"June 8, 2018",5,"Fashion&1 more I really like the ideas. Like more than other things but maybe you can do a kids mode or something kinda like for 12 year olds and younger/ to 14. And if you do, please make it were not were you make a new account to do that. Then fashion. First of all, LOVE IT!!! Second LOVE IT! I like how theres groups and just about everything i wear. Except Overalls. For new arrivals can you make 2. One of shorts and one of long pants. THANKS!"
775,ZombieRoxas,"June 19, 2018",3,"Lack of outfit variety. I‚Äôd prefer they have a section or two for the metal heads or 90s grunge kids and not the crappy style everyone else has. Maybe some untucked flannels with the sleeves rolled up, dark denim vests with hoodies, or just zip hoodies. No skinny jeans or bright colors either. Just black shoes and dark colors to knock it home too, you‚Äôd really reach out to a whole new demographic. I‚Äôm tired of being dressed like a Winchester brother with the same winter outfit I‚Äôve had since 2 years ago. I‚Äôm tired of seeing more and more sports apparel being added. I don‚Äôt care for sports."
776,Note needed,"August 5, 2018",4,"Love the app, needs a search function!! I like to use the app to peruse Bitmojis sometimes just because I like using that rather than a keyboard (no possibility of accidentally sending one while I‚Äôm looking through them lol). The app needs a search function like the keyboard!! Pretty disappointed that this hasn‚Äôt been added yet, cmon guys! Pretty essential feature. That said, you have a phenomenal app, especially with so many bitmojis and outfits to choose from! I‚Äôm very impressed."
777,kwieene24,"October 7, 2018",4,Needs more outfit options!! This app is good but most of the outfits are terrible. I only like 2 of the outfits and you guys got rid of my favorite outfit (the one with the skirt choker jean jacket and high knee socks)! The outfits need to be more customizable so that they could fit everybody‚Äôs individual styles because there are a-lot of different ways people dress that are not included in the app. Add more clothing or make it where you can choose the shirt pants and whatever else and i will give it a 5/5 rating :)
778,kaotickater,"January 13, 2019",5,"Appropriate things I LOVE this app, and all its features, but there are always Bitmojis that are inappropriate or use bad language. My mom was SO unsure about a few of these stickers. I also feel like I‚Äôm on my bus with those kids who say bad things when I look at the stickers. So, if you don‚Äôt Mind, take out the ones witch are inappropriate, especially in the mad column... other than that I love the app, especially the ‚Äò own avatar ‚Äò thing. ·ëéO·óØ, ·ó∞Y KEY·ó∑O·ó©·ñá·ó™ I·îï ·ë≠E·ñá·îïO·ëé·ó©·í™I·òîE·ó™! üëèüò∂"

780,alexiaviolet,"January 6, 2018",4,"A lot of fun, but limited hair color I use Bitmoji on Snapchat all the time and I love it! But I HATE that they don‚Äôt display my own hair color. My hair has been dyed a dark red violet brown for 2 Years, but I have to settle for Bitmoji‚Äôs either ridiculous hot pink or dark brown. Neither really look like me. It would be nice if their color palette was different, like using a color calculator with sliders to get that perfect color and tone. PLEASE make this adjustment. It would be a huge aesthetic improvement. I want a Bitmoji that actually looks like me."
781,tjtreader,"February 13, 2018",5,Update Thoughts Love the new update! There a couple of things I would like to see changed:
782,Lingerzz,"February 16, 2018",4,More options I love this app! But will there be another update with more options for facial features. I have a beauty mark near my mouth and I just don‚Äôt look like me without it. There wasn‚Äôt n option with the old one either. Also I‚Äôm Chinese and there‚Äôs not a lot of options for Asian eyes. Maybe put an option to shape and size our eyes/face. Instead of having them preset options. I love the new style just missing a lot of facial features and options. Please update.
783,#samsgonnawinthebattle,"April 27, 2020",5,"One thing missing I love Bitmoji, mine look EXACTLY like me. The only problem I‚Äôm having is there are no striped shirts. I wear a lot of striped shirts but there are none. Also, I noticed there are no flannel jackets which I‚Äôm not that mad about but I definitely think you should add some striped shirts with different fonts and sleeves. Thank you for being amazing and coming up with so many great ideas and I hope you do something about this."
784,Dude Froggie Exploding Kitten,"April 23, 2020",4,"Pretty Great! I love the app and would totally give it 5 stars but there is one reason I dislike it. You can only have 1 avatar at a time! I love all the clothing options and hair and everything but I wish I could have more saved avatars to use! I want to create more avatars of my friends or Disney characters! Not just me! But it is a great app and my friends and I use it all the time. Just a request, please add more avatar spaces! Thank you! Otherwise I totally recommend this app to others!"

I am also mixed, and I don‚Äôt see features that match mixed and people of color. I think we need things that can make us look like ourselves.

791,Queen of amazingness,"September 26, 2018",5,Love this app except... I love this app except for a few things the hairstyle there are lots of different hair styles but none of them are my short hair with a part any short hair is way to short or doesn‚Äôt have a part also the body shapes are awful everyone comes in different shapes and sizes so 4 options are not enough but i still will give 5 stars because i love the makeup and fashion and i use bitmoji    everyday
792,This is crap #2,"October 17, 2018",5,"Recommendation Sometimes i'm going through the emojis to find a freaking time when there isn't an emoji say says ""I mean i'm not sure like kinda but ummm idk i don't think i'm that ready idk though so you figure it out"" so i'm asking for an emoji that says maybe on a scale of one to ten and one that says looks not so good and another trying to stay positive and another always know how to make me laugh, because those would be helpful good day"
793,_TechWizz_,"December 2, 2018",4,Amazing but needs a few things It would make this app better if each clothing piece was separate not together. Maybe a little more would be a customized shirt that you could add an image to. To save a little room in choices have a color option for each piece of clothing like a color wheel. Also adding an +18 half that can add a few more graphic or adult stuff to it. The one I was looking for is kiss on the lips and maybe a little more if it goes through.
794,REALMREAGLEEVERONEELSERETARDED,"December 22, 2018",5,Dense Ayyy you already know I‚Äôm back with another review. I‚Äôm still waiting for that bitmoji that says ‚Äúbet.‚Äù But I‚Äôm patient so it‚Äôs good. But y‚Äôall really got to add one that says ‚Äúdense‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dense‚Äù. The use of this is so necessary because you know when you‚Äôre texting you‚Äôre friend and they say something wicked stupid. Well this is a less offensive way to call them dumb.

I think you should not only be able to pick out a whole outfit but make your own. Most of the clothes are not my style and I‚Äôd never wear them. It would make this app way better if you could pick out what top you want, bottoms, shoes, etc. You would be able to make something that you would wear and would make this app better."
798,cloverfield365,"April 27, 2019",4,"I like it a lot I love this. It gives you an opportunity to create an avatar that you get to personalise. It‚Äôs fun and amazing especially since you can use it for Snapchat. One thing that I don‚Äôt like is that it doesn‚Äôt have a option to put braces on. I am getting braces soon and I wanted to put them on my Bitmoji but they didn‚Äôt have any. Producers of this app: if you are reading this, please put braces on your app. Overall get the app it‚Äôs really good despite the braces thing. Thank you"
799,TiggerIB03,"May 7, 2019",5,Suggestion They should add another bunch of them with just ones for all the holidays and keep them here always. So if you need one for a certain holiday they‚Äôre there to use. I use Bitmoji all the time but I think they need to make one for all the holidays it would be nice to have one with all the holidays to use all the time instead of just for awhile. They‚Äôll come in handy when u need one for a certain holiday.
800,Pamm15,"September 11, 2017",2,"Like it but... Like this app, it's cool and all, but honestly there are way more body types than this app offers, especially between the last two options: the little thicker skinny and the  obese ones. Like seriously it's either I make myself thinner than I am or make myself 30-40 pounds heavier. Also, the glasses options could improve, especially with one's glasses being part of their identity. And add some more clothes options preferably rolled up jeans, sandals, and a blouse! "
801,Insta-not so famous,"February 17, 2018",5,"Great concept and great app, but outfit update needed We need more outfit options. Better yet, we should be able to put together our own outfits. Why has that not been made possible yet?ü§î We are able to design our bitmojis to resemble ourselves, but the app does a poor job of catering to our unique style choices. That aspect of our bitmojis should also be emphasized. Other than that, I really do love this app! And I love my bitmoji!"
802,KingStover32,"March 5, 2018",4,"I like it Definitely needs more clothing options. Like mixing and matching clothing items instead of set outfits. Also, more clothes suited to country living. Button-ups, jeans, BOOTS, etc. The head wear looks kind of bulky and goofy, maybe consider trimming down the sides of ball caps so that they don‚Äôt stick out from the bitmojis head quite as far. Lastly, more body type options. A muscular option would be great, to be more specific. Over all, it‚Äôs a really fun way to portray yourself as a cartoon."
803,Snapmom,"April 7, 2018",3,"Outfits I absolutely LOVE this app, but can never find anything cute for my bitmoji to wear. There are more sports clothes (football, baseball, & basketball) than actual real fashion outfits to choose from. I also wish you could choose shoes/jewelry separately from the outfit because some of the shoes with certain outfits are hideous. I wish there were so many fashionable outfits that I could change every day of the week, yet my bitmoji has to wear the same thing for months. Blah. Please update this, I hear this same complaint from all my friends."
804,Alonjra13,"April 8, 2018",5,"SUGGESTION !! Okay, so I really love this app and it‚Äôs super fun and easy to use, especially on Snapchat where some filters bring our bitmojis to life. However, I would like to see more outfits and perhaps a chance to customize the outfit? Like pick out tops, bottoms, shoes, maybe accessories? That would be really cool and make it even more personalized. Other than that the app is great and I can‚Äôt wait to see any future updates made to it. :)"

It celebrates individuality and self-confidence in how you look, feel, and act! There are so many things to love about Bitmoji! For example, lots of fashion choices, it links with Snapchat, and the ability to add on anything you want to your personal avatar! This is surly a FIVE STAR app and I can‚Äôt wait for more updates soon to come in the future!! ;)"
806,Loveüë∏,"April 27, 2020",4,"Good I love Bitmoji but I don‚Äôt really like how there is not many ‚Äúchildish‚Äù outfits and I think you guys should make it where you can have a accessory like a hydro flask or scrunchies. I also wish you could do friend-moji with out Snapchat. One more thing, I like the new hair and closet options but maybe make there be better dyed hair. I have purple hair but it is dark not super vibrant and crazy which is not good for me and tons of other colored hair peeps. With these suggestions Bitmoji would be perfect for me! ThanksüòÄ"
807,Yoyo you rock,"March 26, 2020",5,Skin Tones They don‚Äôt have very good options for Pale skin tones. They really only have two options as the tones are so white that my character looks like a ghost. Other than this problem I wish they had better options for bangs. I can only choose between two hairstyles and they don‚Äôt look anything like my hair. That‚Äôs pretty much my only issues I really do like the app except for bang and skin tone options.
808,ObviATaurus,"January 20, 2020",5,"More bitmojis in one picture & More accessories I really love using Bitmoji for Snapchat, Messenger etc.  But, in my opinion, I believe that they should add more accessories like bags, earrings ( Hoops, Pearls, etc. ) necklaces ( Chokers, and regular necklaces with some designs or so. ) "
809,skkdhdh,"October 5, 2019",4,"I have a recommendation that would make this app so much better I remember in the early days of Bitmoji before the app you were able to create your own custom pose/ Bitmoji scene, I guess you‚Äôd call it. Now it‚Äôs only premade scenes/poses. I would like to suggest a feature that would given more creative freedom to its user interface, cause although there are many different awesome Bitmoji scenes/poses it would be awesome to make one to my own personal styling of text/pose/background. Thank you!"
810,jdkehsuk,"May 28, 2018",4,"Suggestions I love bitmoji! I do have suggestions though. More hair colors and treatments would be nice. I see a lot of ombr√©, but no real highlights unless the hair is super short. The colors should be more realistic. Where are the ashy colors? My natural color is not available, but I can have green hair. Cool. üòë The clothing choices are too standard and should be customizable. I see a lot of my friends with the same outfit on. If we could choose each article of clothing separately, we wouldn‚Äôt all look like clones."
811,Basilnut,"June 1, 2018",5,"Bitmoji Ever sense I‚Äôve seen it on the App Store I immediately asked my dad if I could get it! I‚Äôve loved it ever sense. I love that I can change the outfits anytime because if it‚Äôs a different season, you can just change it to a more appropriate outfit. I love that if you don‚Äôt want to text a full sentence all you have to do is look it up on the Bitmoji search, and Vloa! It says the sentence you want and with a super cute picture of your Bitmoji!"
812,FREDFREDBRGR,"June 14, 2018",4,Outfits I‚Äôm not one to say but I am pretty sure that the people who use this app worldwide would most likely be more satisfied and appreciative if in the app you could customize your clothing and colors of the clothing that we would like to wear instead of it having be chosen already and putting everything together we would like to chose what type of shoes and pant also shirt sweaters jackets and so on and forth please put that into the app overall it is amazing thank you.
813,slb5k,"June 15, 2018",1,Login Failed - even after updating password 5 times! I recently tried to login to Bitmoji after getting a new iPhone 8 as a replacement for my previous iPhone 8 which wasn‚Äôt working right.  When I tried logging in I got the Login failed message so I tried a password reset. Got all the information to do this and reset my password. Go to log in and Login Failed again so I reset my password again.  Go back to login and you guessed it - Login Failure. I have now done this 5 times. I have had an account since there was Bitstrips so I am not new to this. Please fix this issue since it sounds like I am not the only one having it!
814,caydenstarlight,"July 29, 2018",5,Awesome but can they add one thing This game is so cool I can send so many things that Express my mood better than this plane emoji‚Äòs but I am saying for the outfits can you make an update to where you have your favorite so you don‚Äôt have to go scrolling through all of the different outfits to find your favorite one Science this point I love this game so much and would definitely recommend to basically anyone
815,Islasunflower,"August 5, 2018",5,"Love bitmoji but... I love this App! It‚Äôs so fun and there is new and fresh stuff every week. I wish though that the outfits have the option of picking tops and bottoms separate. For instance, all the shirts, tanks, tops being on a different choice than the shorts, jeans, pants and skirts. Also, I would like to see more outdoor occupation choices like farmer, landscaper, highway worker etc. Those in my opinion are the only things that could make this app any better. So fun!"
816,Holo4ever,"August 14, 2018",4,"needs new features. (this goes for bitmoji deluxe) honestly there is no where near enough options for this to be a personal emoji. for people of color there is so many more skins then people that are white. don‚Äôt come at me i mean i love how they added so many dark skin tones but for a person who is tan there‚Äôs no skin that can really represent that somewhat accurately. the hairstyles are so generic. there is barely any long hair styles.  this goes for all lengths they are all mostly so similar.  i understand this is just one app but it does have a lot of potential. for being marketed as a personal emoji, i just find there‚Äôs so much this app lacks and there‚Äôs so much it could use. if your looking to get this app i would say go for it, i mean overall it is what it says it is if your not caring that much about your avatars look."

818,Larray_Fan221,"February 24, 2019",4,"Love it still but.... I love this app but I don‚Äôt love how it doesn‚Äôt update recently. The outfits are not a large variety to choose from and are mostly not my style, and they‚Äôre should be a more open variety where people can choose different tops and bottoms. Where it doesn‚Äôt come with the outfit fully made, where you can create your own and express your style. I really love this app but I think it would be a lot better with my suggestion. Thank you."

820,DatOneOtaku,"October 10, 2017",5,"Awesome! (Btw, can you Plz read this Bitmoji People?) Ok, this app is cute and creative! I love it so much! I just have 2 suggestions how to make it better: 1. I really want there to be a feature where you can make Bitmoji's of your friends or people you know. Then, if they don't have Snapchat, you can still text them Bitmoji pictures of you guys together! And suggestion two: Add HotTopic as on of the outfit brands you choose from. Thanks!"
821,ReedRides789,"October 17, 2017",3,"This app could be a lot better... If you guys added more hair styles, clothing, ect people can really have a bit moji that looks like them... isn't that what Bitmoji is about, having you as a character... more people will use Bitmoji because the character will actually like them, I wish my character actually looked like me, there aren't a lot of hairstyles and you can't mix and match with the clothing it's set outfits what's the fun in that... hopefully you guys will actually take this into thought in future updates, thank you"
822,haiimerika,"October 18, 2017",1,"LISTEN TO US!! Scrolling through the reviews you can see a lot of people have the same problem with this app, but it doesn‚Äôt look like they are getting solved. I don‚Äôt understand why my Snapchat and my iMessages have different Bitmojis. For example, I can only use the NFL bitmojis on Snapchat, but when I search for them in my iMessages they don‚Äôt come up. I also don‚Äôt like how there isn‚Äôt a search in the actual app. I feel like if some of these issues were resolved the app would be better overall. As for now I can only use this app with snapchat & I refuse to put it back on my keyboard since it ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find‚Äù ones I‚Äôd like to use."
823,Maddieeeee20swag,"October 18, 2017",4,"Amazing app!! Except for one thing This app is amazing in every way except one. There are many outfits for our bitmojis, including sports. The sports include basketball, baseball, and football. However, I am very offended and saddened that there are no soccer teams available. The Premier league is an important piece of people‚Äôs lives all around the world. Also, you could put the national teams as a jersey or t-shirt. I feel like if that change was made many people around the world would be happy."
824,Bdhdhsbdhxjsnjc,"January 27, 2018",5,"AWESOME!! but.... I would like the app to have some diversity, and not just ‚Äúcity‚Äù outfits for girl avatars. The boy avatars have bootcut jeans and boots with t shirts so why can‚Äôt the girls? And maybe some outfits with just denim skinny jeans? And some hair styles that are really long, like down to the ribs with a side part. Also some braids would be a nice hairstyle. Overall this is a great app with great quality these are just some suggestions that I would like to see come into the app."
825,Sethis4Pizza,"January 28, 2018",4,"More Customization! I think there should be more customization. Like with outfits and face features. I think there should be sliders for face features or even combine nose parts like the bridge and the bottom part of the nose. And you should be able to make your  own outfit and be able to choose whatever colors you want and make your own color. In fact, you should be able to make your own color for every feature. Like hair, skin, eyes, ect."

I was just messing around with my avatar and playing around with the looks because of the new update, but now I can‚Äôt go back to using my original Bitstrip style looking avatar.

On my sisters app, she had so much more options, it seemed as if hers updated and mine hasn‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt allow me to do all sorts of things everyone else was callable of doing. Still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. But still recommend this app 100% Definitely download."

I had an outfit from there and changed mine for a second and went to change back and my outfit was gone :( if you‚Äôre going to get rid of outfits a warning would be nice!

830,grace daigle,"August 15, 2018",5,Great great great! I got the app because I saw other people using it so I wanted to see what was so cool about it.

And it was just so cool! It‚Äôs like a mini-me! It‚Äôs like you in a cartoon. And you can just make a animated version of you! Nice app!! It‚Äôs amazing! It was so fun when I made my character!

That would be great!

Also clothing needs and update as well as hair accessories, makeup, and face (for people with braces) I look forward to an update maybe some time soon you can update"
840,Rainbow Ruff,"October 8, 2017",4,Hair variety I love Bitmoji but it has a very limited number of hair styles and colors. My hair is dyed purple and there are no purple hair colors. They should have at least every color of the rainbow as well as natural hair colors and it would be great if they had different hues of each color. Also all of the hair styles are very short so although it is parted correctly it does not look like my hair (which is very long). Besides this I thoroughly enjoy this app especially since it has linked with snapchat

Snapchat says we‚Äôre friends, but this friend does not appear on my friend list. Really need a way to know which friend is currently appearing. We certainly did not recently interact.

And I wish they have my hair style, my hair is really long and kind wavy hair it‚Äôs bangs on one side, all they have is medium length hair with wavy hair and bangs like on both sides...so maybe more hair styles. And maybe mor skin choicest because I‚Äôm a light brown and my bitmoji looks really dark compared to the real me."
856,jessü§†,"July 2, 2018",4,Very good but! I think the whole system them is good I wish there were more hairstyles you know? 
857,Sleepy Panda Girl,"July 23, 2018",4,"More and better options. I like this app. I like it a lot. But I don‚Äôt like how my Bitmoji looks. It doesn‚Äôt have the right clothes, and I want a bit more diversity and options. Maybe instead of getting entire outfit, you have us select the shorts, shirts and accessories. I typically wear a red shirt and Jean shorts, but the clothes my Bitmoji wears aren‚Äôt close enough to what I want. I have freckles on most of my face, not just my cheeks. I also want more body types. Not bad, but needs a bit of work."
858,TheDirtyWizard,"September 15, 2018",5,Lit App!üî• Y‚Äôall are killing it so far as I can happily say that I have no problems using this app. It‚Äôs really neat and clean with plenty of customization options to help make my avatar look like me. I know it‚Äôs long shot but if y‚Äôall can add a wizard hat that‚Äôd be so cool! I mean you added a Santa one so why not a wizard one haha? And maybe like a wizard robe would be awesome too! Either way though keep up the good work and have a good day to those reading this!
859,JustABoredGirl,"September 18, 2018",5,"YUP YUP YUP I love this app! The Bitmojis are really cute and the clothing and character choices are really cool. I know a ton of people have probably asked, but I‚Äôd like to see even more outfits! But ones that are sort of out of the ordinary? We have so many sports outfits, why not cheerleading uniforms? There‚Äôs also some costumes (that I‚Äôm not big on tbh), so how about like a ninja or something? Also, maybe the hairstyles could be expanded a little. Anyway, just suggestions!"
860,Jordan Kendrick-Roe,"September 2, 2017",5,"Love the app but... I love the app but 1. I wish the hats would line up a bit better with the different hairstyles. 2. If we could pick the colors of the outfits, or even hair, off of a color wheel that would be great. 3. If we could mix and match the tops, bottoms, shoes, etc. 4. More makeup choices."
861,Mranay23,"September 24, 2017",4,"More personalization please!! I LOVE my Bitmoji, and I am only giving it a 4 star rating because I would love more personalization options!! Eyelashes, eyeliner, accessories, more hat options, more updated clothing options as the seasons and trends change. Better shoe options, hair options. Like another user said, piercing options!! I know it takes time to develop everything and I have high hopes that all these things are coming!! Love everything else about this cute little app!"
862,qwertyien,"November 26, 2018",5,"I like it but... I love bitmoji but I think it should have more hairstyles. Also, I think we should be able too put on more than 1 face line because I have both dimples and freckles but I cannot do both.  And you should be able to put how many dimples your have, and where you want them because I have 3 on 1 side of my face. Like I said I like it but I think you should change that!"
863,ilovekansas,"January 26, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs a really good app but..... This app is awesome and I use it a lot but my Bitmoji looks nothing like me because there aren‚Äôt enough curly hair options. Sure there is a lot but there very short styles and I have longer hair. Plus I wear my hair in a ponytail everyday and there is only a side ponytail and a high ponytail and they both have straight hair. If you could add more options for curly hair that would be great, otherwise, this app is pretty cool"
864,LB867963,"January 26, 2019",5,Sooooooooooooooooo good I love this app to so much I think it could have a few adjustments (1) people who have really curly hair need more options for there hair
865,FFallenSStar,"March 22, 2019",4,"More curly/wavy hair options On the newest style of bitmoji that came out early last year, I am unable to find hair that looks like my own. My hair is a bit wavy and curly, and the only suitable hair option is too short to match mine. On the bitstrips version, there was a long wavy hairstyle and a short wavy hairstyle that looked almost exactly the same, and I liked those because they really matched my hair type. Otherwise, I think this app is super cool and I use it all the time"
866,MaddyBruh,"April 30, 2020",4,"Amazing App!! I love Bitmoji so much! I‚Äôve had Bitmoji for a couple of years and all the updates are great! But there‚Äôs one thing( I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just my sucky internet though lol) Every time I try to go into Bitmoji it always glitches and won‚Äôt load. And one time I was customizing my character and then all these different shapes and clothes and hair and it wouldn‚Äôt stop. But besides that( which was one time),overall,it‚Äôs an amazing app!! Thank you for reading my review!! Bye üëãüèº!!"
867,mbb.27,"November 25, 2019",4,"AWESOME but a few things Hi so this apps the best I use it for snap and texting all the time. One problem is the hair. I‚Äôd like some more options because there aren‚Äôt many shoulder-length options. I‚Äôve noticed very few short/shoulder length options, and some of my friends have the same issue. So I just chose the ponytail because I couldn‚Äôt find anything similar to my type. Also theres only christmas stuff ü•∫. More holiday options (like kwanza or Hanukkah)."
868,Kalani,"October 6, 2019",5,Love this app! I like the emojis better than the ones that come with iPhone because there‚Äôs so much more to choose from and you get to personalize your person so to me it seems more interactive! I haven‚Äôt had any problems with this app and I find it so convenient how you can use it with Snapchat and in your text messages. If you download this app you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
869,cat lover 358,"September 26, 2019",4,Something to fix I have actualy never have used this app but I have seen my friends use it and it looked fun so I got it. I made an acount and was going to log in but every time I try to it says my internet is down. I am not allowed to have socials Medea or the internet so I believe you need internet to use this app. So I can't use it yet because I don't have the internet so that is the only thing I don't like about his app. Other than that it seems really fun üòò

871,SimmonsAndHerMouth,"March 20, 2018",1,Need more clothes in maternity. I love the app and all the things you can do with your bitmoji. But the outfits definitely need to be worked on and for a pregnant person. Why is there only 5 outfits and they are all ugly like pregnant people don‚Äôt get dressed up cute and nice. We should be able to edit the body type (like weight gain) and be able to wear anything in the clothing section just like small bodies and plus sizes. Smh. That is a major thing that needs to be worked on. Also add the pregnancy body in body types along with different pregnant body types cause there are some plus sized pregnant people along with petite pregnant people. 
872,Tatmoon,"March 25, 2018",4,"Can we make this a thing I love Bitmoji!! I use it all the time and it expresses me very well. Even has my hair cut and color, which is the best. "
873,hangry_person010,"April 20, 2018",5,"Outfit problem!!! Love the app and been using it for a while, love the new bitmoji, now I can finally choose an ombr√© affect on the hair. But, I didn‚Äôt agree with some of the out fits. I wish this app can let us choose and decorate our own pants and shirts and stuffs, because the outfits are not exactly how I want the outfit to be. I‚Äôm saying, keep the same graphics and the way the outfits look, just let us customize."
874,Saruhi,"July 27, 2018",3,"Body types I enjoy this app and appreciate the countless ways you can express yourself. However, there are about 5 different thin body types and only one fat body type. Fat people don‚Äôt look like potatoes. There are many shapes and sizes and I think if you go to all the trouble to allow so many variations to other parts of the body, bust size included.. you should be able to change stomach and hip/leg type. Again, not a potato. Even the clothes which sort of help change the body shape don‚Äôt do enough."
875,The_Cameron 1265,"September 6, 2018",5,"It‚Äôs good but could be better I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji since it colabed with snap , and I personally think that it‚Äôs really cool ...BUTTT it would be even better if you could customize your shirts and other clothing, it wold  also be cool if you could put earrings on your avatar Bc I have mine done and it would just be really cool if that could happen ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èand also customize the headwear .. all in all it‚Äôs great and I recommend it üëç"
876,geekmee,"March 22, 2020",3,Needs fixes on iPad version I am using iPad Pro with 13.3 and it 90% of the time it does not display when using Apple‚Äôs attached keyboard. I use it on iPhone Pro 11 all the time and it‚Äôs pretty good and I am not an emoji person. But there are times that a picture is worth a thousand words.  
877,megandenyse,"March 9, 2020",5,"Love it: more customizable would be nice I just wish we had piercings and a color picker for hair!! My hair is pink, but not quite the pinks that are in the color option. I would definitely enjoy more hairstyles too. Otherwise I love it and I‚Äôll continue using it! I saw another review suggesting multiple Bitmoji for one account and that would be amazing! I‚Äôm a teacher and I use my Bitmoji for some of my google slides."
878,roblox user name:Middlesissy10,"November 22, 2019",2,I can‚Äôt get in I deleted the app and then  re-downloaded it because the first time I got it I was logged in and everything .Then I read downloaded it and whenever I open up the app and try to login with my same email and password it said this email address and password has already been used and especially whenever I already deleted the app attention of remembered what my character looks like it should‚Äôve just like a raced all of my memories on the app well that‚Äôs my luck but I think they might need to update the app and fix it
879,chezzeronie,"October 15, 2019",4,Gender specific Ok I like this app and think that it‚Äôs great. But can‚Äôt you combine all of the clothes and features together. I feel as though that this is very gender specific. I am a girl and I like hoodies and suits. Hoodies and suits are only in the boys section. Also bodies come in all different shapes and sizes a boy might look like a boy but he is masculine and loves to were makeup and dresses. I‚Äôm just trying to save you guys from hate. I‚Äôm just asking that you combine EVERYTHING together. 
880,Moose.Destiel,"August 14, 2018",5,"LOVE THE APP BUT.... For starters, I LOVE this app. It‚Äôs cute and fun. But I have a couple suggestions that could make this app even better. I think having more customizable outfits would be amazing. Like picking out which shirt pants and shoes you want instead of it being all one thing. I also thought it would be cool to have a piercing option and maybe even a disability option(?) for example, people that have one arm."
881,Kennacattttt,"November 16, 2018",4,"Hair colors Bitmoji has made strives in the hair part of it but they need to add more hair treatment style, because not every one has one solid hair color or just the tips. People have split hair colors, or rainbow hair colors. I believe bitmoji should create a sorta drawing pad, where you can take the colors they have draw the different colors of your hair and then be able to have it be seen on your bitmoji. "
882,polish blender,"November 30, 2018",4,Almost perfect I love how customisable everything is. Except the clothes. I would love to be able to choose a top style and then pick a color and have the option to add layers. Same with the bottoms and shoes. I wish it were 100% customisable in that aspect. Also! I wish you would add tattoos and piercings. Obviously it‚Äôs so small that it wouldn‚Äôt have to be detailed... just to be able to see a resemblance of tattoos would make this perfect and would give 5 stars
883,V. I-M.,"March 9, 2019",4,"Fun but wish there was a plus size body I enjoy this very much, and my friends and I send each other Bitmojis and enjoy the variety of messages and clothing. My only complaint is that it can‚Äôt really look like me because the ‚Äúcurvy‚Äù version of the body still looks thin and I‚Äôm a big girl. If you google ‚Äúplus size avatar‚Äù you‚Äôll see how super cute and truly curvy the Bitmoji could be! I really wish you would update and add a cute n curvy option body type."
884,Ballet Swimmer,"March 29, 2019",4,"Fun, but not for those with bangs I love this app! It‚Äôs a really fun way to connect with friends! I just have critique. There are not many options for those with bangs. I have bangs, and I normally wear my hair half up half down or in a ponytail. However, my only options in they app that have bangs are my emoji wearing her hair down, either cut long, short, or medium. It doesn‚Äôt look like me without the hairstyles I wear, which defeats the purpose of the app! I hope this will be fixed soon."
885,MADDIE DA LASSIE,"April 24, 2019",2,"Needs so much more For an app that is so commonly used, you‚Äôd think there would be a lot more options when it comes to customizing your bitmoji. I can go on and on about different things that need to be added but personally for me I believe there should be more hair options. I have highlighted hair that is long and the only two color options for long hair is solid color or ombr√©. There should be a highlights option for long hair. Also, add more clothes because the clothes right now are super boring and basic. You need clothes for all types of personalities"

And I also request a kids version because some of the Bitmojis are not appropriate for even a twelve year old to use I am eleven so I definitely don‚Äôt want them on there. That is my only concern but I really do think it‚Äôs cool that there is so many features to personalize it and just to have fun
887,SourGuess,"October 1, 2019",4,"Great app, just a few things to add I really like to use this and text them to my friends. It‚Äôs always fun to see one of their bitmojis pop up and it puts a smile on my face. However, there are a few things that would make it even better. "

I‚Äôve had the same hairstyle for awhile now, and I keep wanting to change it but none of the other hairstyles are really me, if that makes sense. Same with the outfits. I change them every once in awhile because I get bored but it gets even more boring when I realize I keep switching off from the same outfitsüò≠. Please add more!! Other than that the app is great and I love it :(:"
889,Nia Shill,"July 23, 2019",4,"Customization I love this app. It's a great way to express yourself in a funny way. My friends love messing around with all of the stickers. One thing I would change is that you could be able to customize your outfit. Maybe you don't like any of the basic outfits because they don't fit your style. By being able to customize your outfit, you can put your ‚Äúmini me‚Äù in full circle. In all, keep up the fantastic work!!!"
890,Dsuser3509,"October 19, 2017",4,"Some ethnic outfits would be nice I love this app, but i feel it would be more complete if ethnic outfits for the bitmojis were introduced, especially during ethnic holidays. For example, maybe roll out sarees or salwar suits so that people celebrating Diwali can make their bitmoji more customized for the holiday, and keep the ethnic outfits even after the holidays because a lot of users I know feel very culturally connected to their other ethnic backgrounds and it might be fun to express it thru bitmojis!"
891,Lol2347,"January 4, 2018",4,"We need more I love how many bitmojis are available in different situations, but they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt many features to design the bitmoji. When picking hair color there are only about 12 options. There are more than 12 colors of hair. As well as body type. There are only about 6 options. I expect more in the future. If you guys could get back to me on if there is going to be more diverse options to make the bitmoji it would be gladly appreciated!!!"

I unfortunately have not been able to reap the benefits of the new curly hair options (thank you for those!) bc they‚Äôre only for deluxe, but with deluxe i‚Äôd have to chose lips that make my bitmoji no longer look like me. if you could put more lip options on deluxe that would be fantastic!!"
893,blah_bri,"February 21, 2018",4,"LOVE, plus I have a proposal that I would like you guys to consider! Hello creators of Bitmoji, the new update has revolutionized what Bitmojis are known as within society. They look GREAT and so much more realistic, I love going through the stickers! Haha, but as I was going through the stickers an idea came to mind, what if you guys could create a game of some sort where anyone with a Bitmoji can take part in it and play! Kind of like a ‚ÄúBitmoji Virtual World‚Äù where you and your friends can literally interact with eachother and compete individually or select their teams within it if they wished and go against other bitmoji teams. I thought that would be pretty cool!! I don‚Äôt know if this is possible but I really wanted to share my idea with you guys, and I look forward to more updates coming soon!!! "
894,Laylaholtzabcd,"April 29, 2018",3,Good. But needs more I love this app a lot. I just think it could use more outfits and also for facial characteristics. You should make it to where you can have multiple on. Because for me I have to choose dimples or freckles. You should make it to where there is an option so you can have both. Also if you make dimples you should make an option with one dimple on a cheek but not the other. This would really let us be able to make it look like us and not just settle for something.
895,Kerrils,"June 1, 2018",4,"Clothing options needed In looking at the reviews, it seems clothing options are one of the most common complaints. But it seems like you have gotten rid of many outfits that were already there and added very few. I had a few favorites, and they are gone. I feel like I can‚Äôt change my outfit because I won‚Äôt be able to go back to the one I am using now. Please bring them back and add additional options."
896,SingingMidwife,"June 19, 2018",3,"What just happened? What worked perfectly before the recent update now cannot work. My keyboard doesn‚Äôt become available anymore when trying to text.  We get the snarky meme woman looking disdainfully, telling us to give Bitmoji full access to our keyboard and to never mind that ominous warning from Apple.  After trying multiple times to grant that access, I cannot get my keyboard to come up in the text window.  Bitmoji has successfully sabotaged my ability to text.  Bad, very bad update."
897,ThisAin'tMyNameDood,"June 23, 2018",5,‚ù§Ô∏è Bitmoji is my favorite thing. I love how it‚Äôs grown since it first started on Facebook. I just wish I could give mine piercings. Like I myself have my septum pierced and since my bitmoji looks like me I would like her to have one as well. Also I wish I could mix match the outfits. Like a shirt from one with bottoms from another then shoes from something else. Other than those two things it‚Äôs basically perfect.
898,Yogidoo,"June 28, 2018",5,SO SO much fun! I am a middle aged ‚Äúadult‚Äù and I cannot believe how playful and fun it is to send the emojis. Mine looks just like me. They are so expressive.
899,Annalise Eiffert,"July 23, 2018",4,I Love Bitmoji! I think Bitmoji is such a great idea! I think it‚Äôs so cool to be able to make a little avatar that looks like you to use when communicating with your friends! The only reason I didn‚Äôt give five stars is because I would love to be able to incorporate my pets. I think it would be really cool to be able to not only customize an avatar to look like myself but also to customize a pet avatar that looks that could pose with me in some of the pictures.
900,HideeGemina,"July 26, 2018",5,The new update... The new update keeps glitching and it‚Äôs annoying I tried 3x to search for a specific bitmoji and it kept backing me out right to my original keyboard. Anyways I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing that but I love bitmoji. It‚Äôs cute and funny and I can answer almost every question with one and I love annoying people when I do that. Thanks for an overall great app but please fix the glitches!
901,gracEHale,"July 30, 2018",4,"Few changes? I love the app, and have lots of fun using my bitmoji. Especially with Snapchat. But I think it would be more fun if we were given the option to create an outfit for our bitmoji to wear, rather than only having a selection of outfits already made. Also it would be nice to have more hair options, I notice more and more accessories being added all the time, but I think a wider variety of hair choices would be nice too."
902,Anna W1,"March 8, 2019",4,"Love Bitmoji, BUT we need Petmojis We need Petmojis NOW. I spend way more time taking and sending pictures of my cats than myself so naturally, I should also be able to send a cartoon version of my cats. "
903,Mr.sir.man guy legocrusher123,"May 23, 2019",2,"Uniqueness I think the idea of bit moji is cool with the interactive features on Snapchat, but the whole point, narrowed down, of why it exists, is to look like you. Now I don‚Äôt have obnoxious features that stand out, but some people are recognized by a tooth gap, specific body parts, or hairstyles etc. I think I‚Äôd enjoy Bitmoji if it were similar to the mii maker for Nintendo. I remember growing up on the mii maker, and I was able to really  pin point what I looked like facially. I‚Äôm sure the creators have the money for this update suggestion. I would love giving more ideas too. Thank you"
904,Annoyingpoptart08,"April 5, 2020",4,One thing So I have snap and bitmoji. So this one girl I have on snap has two different colored eyes. And I wanna just say that‚Äôs really cool. But anyway I just wish that you could do something with the eye options and so you can chose one eye color or two different eye colors so if you could do that for the next update that would be great. Oh and one last thing can you add like braids or something because I wear braids a lot so if you could add like French or Dutch braids  thxs
905,@bumpsetspike07,"March 15, 2020",4,"Good!!! But improve! This app is very good and I love it!! I love the themes!! And this is 100% a must have!! I do have a suggestion, though, maybe add a section where you get the chance to create your own emoji and share it! I did have one problem with the app. When I got keyboard version all the emojis were tiny. I think I solved it by full access to my keyboard, but I have to admit I‚Äôm not happy to share all my texts for bigger emojis. Only my opinion concerns...otherwise great app!!!"
906,krazyk888,"September 8, 2019",5,I love it but I wish I absolutely love bitmoji but I want to like make my own saying with my own background so like I said I love this game but if you could make like a button for it or something then I will love bitmoji even more. I really want to have the chance to say that the baseball shirts are more boyish like with the pants and stuff. So this is why I have bitmoji and the stuff I wish it hade but I love bitmoji and so does my family.
907,Justagirlwithanopinion1622,"August 3, 2019",4,Love the app but I honestly love the app but they don‚Äôt have enough hair color choices in my opinion. Especially for red haired people like not every red haired person has bright orange hair or flaming red. I would honestly give the app a five stars if they were able to either give the app a color bar so you could make your color if it wasn‚Äôt already there or if they made like more auburn colors and just made it so it was easier for people with rarer hair colors.
908,Crooked toe,"June 28, 2019",4,"Hair styles and clothes I love this app but, I just wish there were more hair dye options, colors, and different hair styles too. I have half and half hair (purple one side blue the other) and would love to show that on my bitmoji. Some people even have rainbow hair it would be EPIC to put rainbow hair on an bitmoji. Also, the clothes, I wish there was an even bigger variety like long sleeves and ripped jeans like together. And like punk, emo, goth clothes it would be great for a lot of people. Take it into consideration?"

There is a lot of cool clothing choices for your Bitmoji and I like that they‚Äôve even included sports teams, however, I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that there isn‚Äôt a NHL clothing section yet, as I am a major fan of the NHL, as there is NBA, NFL, and MBL."

Converse is the latest style and has been for a while, I think that bitmoji should add converse to their outfit range. And also a station where you can choose what top you want, what pants you want and what shoes you want. It would be much more fun with these ideas. Thank you for your time."

The second is: can we make more that one bitmoji. I feel like it would be a lot of fun to make friends, family, and random OCs. Overall it‚Äôs a great app and I recommend it!"

Love this app I just really wish that the developers would make some outfits that were more flattering for the plus size Bitmoji since there are many different shapes and sizes in the world the true statement of one size does NOT fit all couldn‚Äôt be more accurate even in the cartoon world.

950,phia5-12,"January 14, 2019",2,There are a few changes I would like to see I have had a Bitmoji for 3 years now and the whole point is that it looks like you. The options that are given for accessories are so limited. Because of this there are very few glasses options and the fact that there is no nose ring accessory upsets me as well. The lack of options has resulted in my rating because it is highly upsetting the lack of options that you are given. Especially if you come from different ethnic backgrounds and if you have glasses. It is very limiting.
951,Banana girl ...,"February 1, 2019",4,"Fun app but... the only issue that i really have with the app is that it doesn‚Äôt have enough diversity in its hair section(of the bitmoji deluxe type). i have shoulder length curly hair, which i think is fairly common, and i didn‚Äôt really find anything that fit. i know this is a petty complaint but it‚Äôd just be nice to have my bitmoji REALLY look like me y‚Äôknow? no hard feelings though, just a thought i had, so why not share it to the entire world+bitmoji creators?"

975,Unicorn Narwal,"May 26, 2019",5,Amazing I have had Bitmoji since I can‚Äôt remember. It is a great app and it is so nice that they have so many different things you could choose from! I really love it and I use it every day. I wish that they could add in where you take a picture and it would do it for you but I love how you can do it yourself as well. This is a great app and I would recommend it to anyone.

So basically I used to live this app but now I can‚Äôt sign in, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars. If the creators of bitmoji could please fix this bug I will move my review to 5 stars so please fix! I want to give 5 stars!"

But most importantly it shows your style!! Style from sports were, Dresses,sweats,Cozy were & much more. I love this app for many reasons but I just can‚Äôt think of all!  I definitely recommend this app you will find many styles of clothing options and hair products, makeup & facial expression."
979,beccamison,"June 14, 2019",5,"I love bitmoji I truly do love bitmoji, I use it often with Snapchat and I love changing how mine looks. I think however more stuff needs to be added. More summer clothes, and more clothes all around. The same outfits get boring. Maybe customizable clothes?? That would be pretty cool. More makeup colors (eyeshadow, lipstick, etc), hairstyles and such. But other than that, I love this app and it‚Äôs fun to just mess around with!"
980,polkadot2023,"September 28, 2017",5,"Amazing but could be even better I love Bitmoji! It's amazing! They almost have an Bitmoji for every single conversation! Ways to improve: 1. I just wish they had Bitmojis for things like ""will you go to the dance with me?"" That would be amazing. 2. What if you could have your contacts as friends in Bitmoji, and could have one with a couple of different friends Bitmojis together. That would be so cool!"
981,Larissasteff,"November 10, 2017",2,"Not true to me I have several friends with great bitmojis that look like them. They are really fun to use in our conversations. However, I still can‚Äôt get mine to look anything like me, so I probably won‚Äôt use it. The hairstyles available are not close to my hair. I usually wear it in a braid or low bun with a little side part, never down. The up-dos are all slick back or on top of the head. I also can‚Äôt find an outfit that is true to me. I usually wear skirts that are knee length or longer. I‚Äôm not very trendy, and I know that. I will probably just pass on the bitmoji for now."
982,Skittles21212121,"November 19, 2017",4,"Needs more options I love my little bitmoji so much and i love using it on snapchat‚Äôs and such but there needs to be more clothing options. i love a lot of outfit tops but not the bottoms or shoes. i think you guys should make it so you individually pick a top, a bottom, and shoes. another thing is that you should make the male and female clothing open to both the male and female body type characters. other than that i love bitmoji and using it to send to friends and have fun."
983,Happy smiles cowgirl,"January 3, 2018",5,More than one bitmoji? Absolutely love the whole concept of bitmoji!! But just a suggestion maybe make it so you can save your bitmoji and create another one so you can compare which one you like better or maybe have fun and create one for a friend. You‚Äôd only have to keep one sinked up with your keyboard and Snapchat just be able to have a few more saved in the app.
984,SoupSlurper,"February 9, 2018",4,"Legs I really like the app.. It‚Äôs a lot of fun.. However,  I know several people that are amputees.. I was wondering if maybe you guys could come up with a limb removal option.. I mean, just to make this a real rendition of someone who is now without a limb or two.. This isn‚Äôt a joke.. My father lost his leg, and I also have a few friends who have lost legs to various life situations.. Thanks for reading and I hope to see the option to remove a leg if applicable.."

You did an awesome job with adding more things to do (i.e. the hair styles and color treatments). The only other thing that would make Bitmoji even better would be more options on the clothing, like add some springtime clothes or more up to date fashion. Other than that it‚Äôs amazing and would highly recommend!!"
986,rachy420,"May 4, 2018",3,"nice app, needs an update! Bitmoji is a cool idea and has many hilarious sticker, but is really in dire need of more. First of all, hairstyles for both men and women are very limited. Outfits consist of mostly sports themes that no one really uses. Those should be at the bottom of the outfits page. Also, the outfits won‚Äôt even load for me in the app and when I try to edit my bitmoji from snapchat, it logs me out and asks for me to login AGAIN! This is a great app, but definitely needs an big update and less glitches."
987,Lilah Marie,"June 3, 2018",4,"Great!! (Mostly) I live what this app does, allowing you to express all kinds of emotion through your own little character. However, I wish the customization was a bit more unique. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are many skin colors, hair colors and types, eye shapes and more. However, the body types lean more towards skinny people and such. The clothes are also quite bland. Will change to 5 star rating when clothes and body size diversify!!"
988,bradydrawsthat,"June 26, 2018",3,"I love it but You guys need to add more for the more gothic or emo type of peopleee. There‚Äôs no emo hairstyles or leather jacket/ripped jeans gothic type of outfits, Or even tattoos. It‚Äôd be so cool if the next update had more fashion options and more hairstyles for men/women. It‚Äôd also be so cool if you guys could add different types of piercings. All in all it‚Äôs a great app though. It‚Äôd be just really cool if there were more fashion options and hairstyles! It‚Äôd also be really cool if y‚Äôall could add customizable clothing where you can mix match or change colors of the outfits."
989,Poppoopopopppoopoppp,"July 9, 2018",4,Better curly hair options First of I love bitmoji and it‚Äôs a really fun way to communicate but as someone with curly hair I find that the newest version of bitmoji style doesn‚Äôt have my type of hair because it either has suppper curly hair or just a messy version of my hair and I have multiple friends who also can‚Äôt find their hair in the bitmoji catalogue and we often times have to use more straight hair because their simply isn‚Äôt enough variety
990,Joseph A. Scott,"March 10, 2019",3,"It needs work. To be honest, it‚Äôs a good app especially when connected with Snapchat. However, a huge plot point the designers (please listen designers) missed is that there could be clothing options that don‚Äôt suit the ‚Äòcustomers‚Äô needs. I think if they added a mechanic where you can design your own clothing, mix and match different times of shoes and pants and custom design something if the pre set options don‚Äôt fit your needs. That would push this app above and beyond."
991,a real country fan,"May 28, 2019",4,"Great app like it so far!! Wish it had more choices for accessories and clothing for the characters I have a cowboy theme going on! So far have some good choices, but maybe some other accessories like gloves, bandanas or scarves, different shoes or boots,  maybe even masks! I‚Äôm being tough with this review! Wish you could make more phrases happen when talking and maybe try for some animations that can happen also! Otherwise it‚Äôs a great app and fun to use!!"
992,luisitopintero,"February 29, 2020",5,"hair and other the app is great it‚Äôs AWESOME! but one thing i would LOVE is that if you guys added dragon ball z features like the characters or hair or costumes it would make bitmoji even better ! the hair and eyebrows and the suits and everything, you could add default characters such as goku , vegetta , etc. or just add the hairstyles and make them be available to be changed in color thanks PLEASE i beg you guys add this plz - thank you"
993,ùïÇùïöùï®ùïö‚ô°,"February 24, 2020",4,‚ô•Wonderful app‚ô• I think that overall this app is pretty good. I would have given it five stars but I wish that you could customize it more. What I mean by that is I wish that you could add jewelry to yourself. Or maybe if you could change things on your face. But they have plenty of updates and I also like how you can send people Bitmojis and how they are connected with Snapchat so overall this is a great app!
994,gramcrackerof6,"January 2, 2020",1,"Allow Full Access deceptive. Beware!!!! Bitmoji worked great for 2 days. Then, it said I had to Allow Full Access, and that screen says it exposes credit card info etc etc. When I decided not to allow Full Access, putting personal information at risk, Bitmojis won‚Äôt send at all, and even my normal keyboard won‚Äôt work anymore on my iPhone, so I can‚Äôt type anything at all, or send any messages, even outside of Bitmoji. I had to delete the app completely, just to resume normal use of my iPhone. So VERY DISAPPOINTING.  I‚Äôd love to be able to use this app, without risking security. Thank you anyway."

Also having more outfits like what‚Äôs in the pregnancy section there clothing is so cute but it‚Äôs not in any other section so if I wore it I‚Äôd have to have a baby bump:(..Overall great app!!"

Also I wanna make my own clothes and actual bitmojis. I wish you could do two face wrinkle thingies at the same time. Also more chest sizes please.  The worst thing I hate is when you edit your bitmoji it sometimes takes a day or so for it to show the changes that you changed. Love it but please please fix these bugs!üôèüèº"

As a woman of color is like to set my female character with a shade or two darker than what appear a white girl. Nothing against white girls. Half of me identified white and black. My old school friends are black. My old work associates are 80% white. I don‚Äôt want either group thinking I‚Äôm trying to pass for white or black but the tan girl that I am. Us humans come in a dozen shades or more."
999,snowman 64,"August 3, 2019",4,I wish it had a few more options Most of the options are really good but I‚Äôd like if it had a headwear option where it‚Äôs sunglasses sitting on your head because I almost always wear them on my head. I‚Äôd also like if there were some braces options since I have them. Also maybe some more options where jackets are tied around the waist because the only ones like that currently are dresses.
1000,Ilovenannyandbananas,"July 10, 2018",3,"Needs Work The developers have obviously worked really hard on the Bitmoji deluxe, and I really appreciate that. However, I personally still like the Bitmoji classic. I believe that this style should be updated a bit and needs attention. For example, in Bitmoji classic, there are limited options and the hats don‚Äôt even fit correctly. Bitmoji deluxe is very well done and very diverse, I would just like to see a bit more of that in the Bitmoji classic because some people still prefer that style."

However, I have a kind of darker taste in clothes. "
1003,PieceOfTrashxccc,"August 21, 2018",5,"I love it but I have a suggestion! So I‚Äôve been using bitmoji since you could link it to your Snapchat, and I love it! There‚Äôs a ton of outfits to choose from and I love sending my friends a little image of myself. But unfortunately, I am a very big tomboy. A very masculine girl. I want my bitmoji to be female, but I would love the app so much more if I could choose a boy outfit for a female character! Overall it‚Äôs a very cool app :)"

I love the Halloween costumes, but I do think there should be more choices for example you have a devil costume but no angel, or cat women and no Batman. Just little thing like that would make the app a lot better!"
1006,angryimovieuser,"November 30, 2018",5,"Love this, but could be more inclusive I have used Bitmoji for a long time and I absolutely love it, although it may make near picture perfect cartoons of ourselves, if fails to have handicap options or disabilities.

And I know this would be a lot to have to work on, but maybe even Bitmoji gifs..? Just a suggestion. Tysm for all the hard work in this!!!"

The ‚Äúfull size‚Äù one is just ridiculously cartoonish like. There are three ‚Äúslim‚Äù types but the biggest one is not realistic. My Bitmoji looks thin and I am not. I am full figured, but I don‚Äôt have a big round potbelly like the bigger size selection does! Also, being able to customize each article of clothing separately would be great. Last thing- PIERCINGS!"
1015,TG_Bizkii,"May 28, 2018",5,Here‚Äôs my thoughts It‚Äôs a very good app and super fun to mess around with but where are the new outfits. I think we should get some new outfits because these ones are getting kinda lame. Or give us the opportunity to make our own outfits with the clothes that are already on the app. Like let us pick our own shirt or jacket with different pants or shorts that would be pretty cool. New outfits

That would be really cool üòé if you guys take these suggestions, your app will be so much better!!! üòäplease add these aspects to Bitmojiüëèüëèüëè"
1017,Gloria Blue,"February 28, 2020",2,"Plus size hatters There are plenty of large people in the world and I think it is terrible that the plus body is so unflattering. You offer three sizes of skinny and one plus size that is just round. The neck doesn‚Äôt even adjust. It‚Äôs like the Bitmoji is wearing a fat suite. God forbid that a plus size woman wants to show that she is pregnant; it doesn‚Äôt even change. Hairstyles and eyes are limited. Wish you would let people adjust the length and size. I hate the deluxe version, they just look creepy. The concept is cute but you could have updated it by now."
1018,ihatemusicallynow,"January 8, 2020",5,This is such a great app just needs more added As someone who uses Bitmoji I think it‚Äôs a amazing app but one thing I would suggest is more variety so more hairstyles for people with curly hair and more masculine outfits for girls also these changes would just make me love this app even more then I already do I hope you listen to my feedback and what I have to say :)
1019,Peaceful Annie,"September 1, 2019",5,"Joy! I absolutely love this app!!!  It brings me joy! The artwork is so cute and the expressions are amusing, current and relevant.

1032,lexi33133,"February 15, 2018",4,Love I love this. I use it sometimes more than writing a response. It really feels personal and makes it so fun. A few things I‚Äôve discussed among friends that we feel would make it even better would be during text allow us to have our friends Bitmoji join in the responses like in Snapchat and allow us to build our pets also!!! You have responses with dogs and cats so let us make them look like our own!

For example, the curly haired pony tail. It would be cool if you had one that was smooth until the puff went out. Another thing is edges and treatments. We need some more treatments for the natural hair! Naturals due their hair too. For edges, it‚Äôd be nice if we had some nice swooping looking ones too. I would love it too if you gave us a twist out hairstyle as well."

It seems as though you added more options for every category but then reduced your options for lips to 3 (!!) I have very full lips - a defining feature - but none of the 3 choices come even close to what I have. Sad because was happy to see so many more choices for skin tone - a sign that the developers are taking our diversity into consideration. Lips are apart of this too! Please add more lip options!"

I myself have a curly Afro that‚Äôs much bigger than the options they have, so if Botmoji would just add more kinky hair, I would give this 4 stars.

1038,Moray_Eel_Softball,"May 8, 2018",5,"Amazing Few suggestions I love Bitmoji it‚Äôs wonderful. I‚Äôve had a few suggestions for the app makers. Please PLEASE add some more outfits like a custom one where you can choose the shirt and pants design,  shape, color, etc. that would be wonderful. Along with scars and other things like smeared mascara, the joker smile, tattoos etc. "
1039,notabot 3000,"May 1, 2020",3,Okay app So the problem is is that you can only make one bitmoji. I know that‚Äôs the point because you want to make your own bitmoji but I would also like to make different people besides myself. The other problem is that when you send a bitmoji the bitmoji is always doing something and you can‚Äôt even get a head shot of the bitmoji. If this makes any sense please think about it because I know a lot of people who agree with me. Overall it‚Äôs a good app! Thanks and bye.
1040,apdanvers,"November 19, 2018",5,"Love the app!! Wish they‚Äôd add one thing! I love it so much but I wish they‚Äôd add nose piercings and face piercings for anyone that wants them, (I for one only have a nose piercing) but I‚Äôd like to add it to my Bitmoji because it‚Äôs part of me. Also I wish they had more hair styles and maybe one model hair style and then you can dial how much curl or wave and straightness and length of it! Thank you!!! Hope you read this and agree!!"

1042,Doggie Dogge,"February 1, 2019",5,"Bitmoji is rad So I personally really like bitmoji and the characters are super cute and colorful you can customize any character of yours you want (and it is for sure way way better than what I‚Äôve heard of the horrid app Zepedo.) You should for sure get bitmoji and have the fun you what with sending your friends your bitmoji and I wanted to tell the bitmoji team, good job and don‚Äôt quit the hard work!"
1043,Thegamingtrooper,"February 5, 2019",5,"Ideas for more outfits Sure the current outfits are nice and all but it would be cool to see a blast from the past to see the the change in fashion through the years. Maybe something from WWII or WWI, or maybe even something from the 60s and on. Possibly something from the 19th century. It‚Äôs just something that I think would be cool to have"
1044,jimin's fan,"May 12, 2019",5,What a great app honestly I love this app I like how there Is a bunch of clothes you can choose from amd there is even brands such as Hollister(which is my favorite brand of clothes BTW ) also another thing that I like about this app is that you make it however you want. I hope you guys keep improving and making the app better than before. Keep up the great work guys!!
1045,angie_apple368,"June 6, 2019",4,"just a couple suggestions bitmoji is really awesome and all of my friends have it! it‚Äôs great to be able to make your own avatar and send messages with it to people. but one thing i would love is if we could customize our own outfits. as in, if there were many shirts or pants to choose from and we could pick each one individually. also, another thing is that there needs to be more hairstyles. maybe more for people with curly hair because i have very curly hair and there‚Äôs only one hairstyle that seems similar to mine, but that one is really poofy and my hair isn‚Äôt like that, so my bitmoji hairstyle is just wavy, instead of curly like how my actual hair is. would really appreciate if you could add more hairstyles and clothing options! thanks!"
1046,Me&mafriends,"February 4, 2020",5,GO BITMOJI!!! Love the app. Fun to use and creatively propelled. I enjoy checking it out often for new stickers and updates and to change my avatar (who actually looks A LOT like me... it‚Äôs kinda creepy üòÇ). I advise checking this app out %100! 
1047,bubblebubbleballgum,"January 28, 2020",3,I love app I‚Äôm glad you guys added a difference clothing line but still needs more clothes for the females.. I see no close toe heels wedges give us some Nike‚Äôs vans Jordan‚Äôs some kinda name brand shoes.. some socks low and high leggings shockings fish net.. dresses high waist skirts jumpers cover ups more hair styles add jewelry we need some accessories body jewelry also and tattoos braces hair accessories... more makeup AirPods earphones purses hand bags... more pants loose fit ripped jeans bell bottoms thighs.. this new update will be awesome I‚Äôll be looking forward to seeing it pretty soon thanks.
1048,üççjigfaceüçç,"January 24, 2020",4,"Love the app! But could you add a few things? Bitmoji is a really great app. I love all the messages they can send and even cool when using snap. But, I have curly hair, and I can‚Äôt find anything related to curly hair. There are some hairstyles that are curly, but not in like some ponytails or pigtails. If you could add that, it would be amazing. Also, the body sizes are all skinny and I have some friends who are not that kind of size (no hate tho), could u add different sizes?"
1049,Dave Strider :),"September 14, 2019",4,I really like it. Just add earrings. I am not too feminine looking so I wear earrings everywhere I go in order for people to understand at the best ability that I am a female. I would appreciate it if earrings were an option so that my Bitmoji could look more feminine. But not one pair of stud earrings. I mean a whole section for earrings with a bunch of kinds. I personally like hoop earrings. There should be a section for face piercings to because a lot of people have them.
1050,Bree12369,"February 19, 2018",5,"Piercings Though you may not be able to let people personalize themselves with their tattoos, you should let people start personalize themselves with piercings, such as facial, ears, and belly‚Äôs!! This would be such an improvement. I absolutely love the app, love it more now that i can really personalize my hair, but i‚Äôd love it more if i could make it look even more like myself!! Great app throughout though!!"
1051,Kenjunior,"March 15, 2018",4,"More updated ethnic hairstyles are needed. Let me say that first and foremost, i really enjoy this app. I‚Äôve watched this grow since back in the early years with Facebook. It would be greatly appreciated if Bitmoji could add more hairstyles for ethnic people. For example, many of us Black men have 360 waves, and prefer line-ups, whether it be a regular Caesar or variety of faded haircuts, rather than an ordinary natural hairline. Other than that, keep it up; you‚Äôre doing great! üëçüèæ"
1052,Noon At Moon,"April 16, 2018",5,AWSOME APP!!!! I love this app! It lets u have a skincolor that‚Äôs green and many other colors. Someone needs to tell me if I need internet to customize my Bitmoji tho. I still love this app a LOT so I‚Äôm hoping u do too. I give this app five stars I actually have it on my iPad too! Its good bc if u text someone u have not seen in real life and I both agree to use Bitmojis then u kinda get a story of wut the other person looks like
1053,Disneyfan!!,"April 21, 2018",3,"It‚Äôs cool but I‚Äôm having some problems I‚Äôve had Bitmoji for maybe a little over a year and it‚Äôs been running smoothly since then. Just recently, it wouldn‚Äôt let me change the clothing I wanted to wear. Nothing would even come up for that section when editing your avatar. I just really want this fixed, and am I the only one with this issue? "
1054,unhappy wolfgirl,"June 29, 2018",4,"Improvements I love Bitmoji but there are a couple things that need to be improved. Such as hair, there needs to be much more diversity in hair because I can‚Äôt find hair that looks like mine. Next is clothing I would be much easier to customize your Bitmoji if the app let you pic create your style. An example is that you could pic your shoes, pants and shirt without having them be in a whole outfit. Otherwise the app is wonderful üëçüèΩ"
1055,Laxstar2017,"July 19, 2018",1,"Problem with the Glasses!! As you can see by the title there is a problem with the glasses!! And what you might be wondering is what is the problem with the glasses? Well the problem with the glasses is that my glasses are not there! Neither are my mother‚Äôs , or my father‚Äôs it‚Äôs very sad since bitmoji you get to express your self and show who you are. But in this case my family does not get to do that! I find that a problem so if you can in he next update let us customize or glasses! Also please add more clothes the clothes that you have on bitmoji are just not my style and not even in my closet that‚Äôs for sure!"
1056,Segal07,"August 1, 2018",4,"Limited mouth options Unfortunately, not everyone can have a beautiful big mouth like Julia Roberts. That being said, I believe a lot of us love our little mouths and would love our Bitmojis to reflect that. I gave this app 4 out of 5 stars because I believe that solid mouth options are worth an entire star, our mouths provide us with 1 of the five senses, after all. Thank you for reading and give the people what they want ;)"
1057,Pointe_up,"October 8, 2018",4,"Good, but I have a question I was wondering if there was an option to collaborate with you‚Äôre friends Bitmoji, and if there is, how do I use it? I also think that there should be customizable outfits. If you love a shirt style, but it‚Äôs a crop top and you never wear crop tops in real life, then you should have the option to change it to a T-shirt. All in all though, I live this app. I like all the different options for everything."
1058,Sg1009,"October 12, 2018",4,"Outfits I love Bitmoji and all because yes it is a awesome app, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt like how there is literally only boy outfits, please make girl outfits and I will be happy and I bet others will too because we totally love he outfits not trying to be rude but I feel like you guys should have WAY more outfits so we can express ourself on bitmoji our different ways, if you go with my review then I will be fully satisfied and ALWAYS rate this app a 5 star! üòÅ"
1059,Luvugurl,"October 15, 2018",5,"Love Bitmoji I absolutely Love this Bitmoji app. I‚Äôm not one on Texting a lot because sometimes the messages loss in the typing. However, with using Bitmoji‚Äôs I can almost send entire message without typing one word and message received loud and clear. I don‚Äôt use GIF‚Äôs. Please tell me how do we get Bitmoji to work in Instagram without using Snapchat or any other social app. Also where do we send suggestions to to get additional Bitmojis. I‚Äôve requested these Bitmoji‚Äôs every Friday when I notice of new Bitmoji ‚Äòs. Thanking you in advance. "
1060,histprofevy,"October 19, 2017",5,"Maternity Option Please, Please, PLEASE, can you make an option in the body type for a pregnant body type so that we can have the ability to wear ANY outfit instead of just the 6 that are available and not my favorite? Please... I love this app it‚Äôs so fun but 6 options isn‚Äôt much compared to the hundred other options available for not pregnant people... thank you"
1061,Stinkybutt15,"October 22, 2017",3,Not too bad I'll say I do love this app. And it's pretty fun but I really wish there was more of a variety. Half the time I can't find a bitmoji that I'm searching for that best describes  what I'm trying to say so I have to keep searching and searching random things that are close to what I want to say and a lot of the times I never can. 
1062,phlypapi,"October 26, 2017",4,"4 stars.. could‚Äôve been 5 I love this app, my kids love the app. Lots of catchy phrases, funny faces, I‚Äôm really diggin the sports outfits so I really wanted to make this review a 5 star one but Ladies and Gentlemen app makers of Bitmoji we need to talk! .. how come it‚Äôs going on November & STILL NO NHL jerseys for our avatars? Cmon man!! The league has an INTERNATIONAL fan base not just the USA & Canada but the world watches hockey! That said, Let‚Äôs go Flyers! Hopefully very soon after Halloween I can dress my guy in Orange & Black without looking like a pumpkin."
1063,The little mermaidüòù,"February 12, 2018",3,"outfit variety I love that we can choose short ""boy"" hair or long ""girl"" hair for either gender you choose. But why not do that for the outfits too? I am a girl that likes to dress guyish but the outfit options are very girly and they don't have a big variety of styles. I wish that we had access to the guys clothes too, not just girls. There's so much more styles out there for woman than just the stereotypical girl. If there's any way we could have a bigger variety of clothing styles it'd be much appreciated by everyone"
1064,PRINSESS DEMI,"February 14, 2018",4,Some suggestions I like the app but I think it could be better if they had and option to pair different shirts and pants and accessories to your style. You could still have the outfits but maybe also have a button for your personalized outfits. Also I think you should at more hats like a boater hat that is in now and Tatoo's. I also think some of the thing from the old version should be added in.
1065,MaxxCashFtw,"February 18, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs great, lets take it further For everything this app does really really well, there‚Äôs just a few really simple changes and additions I think it would benefit from. I think there should be more style choices and the option to add accessories. The biggest difference between a picture of me and my bitmoji is that I actually have earrings, and I can‚Äôt put those on my bitmoji. It would be cool to see that added."
1066,Crazy_Gamer_Girl,"April 29, 2020",4,"Love it!!! Ok, first of all, let me say this is a great app, and the bitmoji texts are really funny sometimes. But, they‚Äôre so limited! I mean, there are hundreds, maybe thousands, but I can‚Äôt always find what I want!"
1067,Joodypoody,"April 18, 2020",3,"Why does it keep logging me out?! I used to have no trouble with this app installed on my iPad. But in the past few weeks the keyboard has un-installed (Apple‚Äôs fault?) or I suddenly find myself logged off!! I just went to the trouble of logging back in but they wanted me to create an entirely new avatar which doesn‚Äôt seem to have the choices that the one, still installed!, does on my iPhone! Crazy making. All this seemed to start happening once SnapChat bought Bitmojiü§®"
1068,camcam üòõ,"December 1, 2019",4,More options That app in general is really good but the thing that bothers me is the hair like I have braids and there are like three braid options there should be more like for example box braids or the popular ones at least and another thing get some more clothes some of them are nice but if we‚Äôre being real would you actually wear some of the clothes you have but I like it just a good update wouldn‚Äôt hurt
1069,Madzzzyyy,"October 31, 2019",3,"Needs more mom things! As a new mom, a teen mom, who spends a bit of time on her phone. I think there should be more outfits to fit the mom style. Also need emojis for moms with new babies. Such as a mom holding her baby or a mom with an outfit that includes a baby. It just needs more mom things. More baby emojis too! There are more teen moms out there now that use emojis and such. Also look when I took my picture for like the ‚Äúselfie to character‚Äù version it made my nose big and I‚Äôm quite offended üòÇ"
1070,bunbun1350,"October 6, 2018",5,"Here‚Äôs a Suggestion don‚Äôt get me wrong, i love this app. i has everything you could ever want and need in an avatar designing app. If the developers could make it so that we could choose tops, bottoms and shoes separately that would be really helpful because i really like pieces of outfits but i don‚Äôt like the outfit as a whole. i y‚Äôall could add this, take your time no rush, it would be great!"
1071,Sadüòî2,"October 14, 2018",1,Why Full Access to keyboard I have been using Bitmoji before the update asking for full access. The previous version did asked for it but I could continue to use Bitmoji without granting it. Why now? Why do you need all of my keyboard information? My iPhone alerted me and explained the meaning of third part access. Why? You have a great app and from all of the reviews it seems only a few ask the question about full access and third party. My privacy to my personal information is important to me. 
1072,madison rautiola,"December 27, 2018",5,Bitmoji I use this app on a daily for changing my outfits to my mood it would be nice if there was more choices for the outfits like you get to choose your outfit from scratch and I have tattoos and piercings it would be nice to add those customizations too I also have glasses it would be nice if you could have a color scheme for glasses as well just a few suggestions :)
1073,owlequation,"December 28, 2018",5,"Omg it rules I really like the way that there are thousands of Bitmoji and hundreds of styles, from cute to goth and mutch more but I do have one suggestion. Can you make a ‚Äúmake your own Bitmoji‚Äù feature so you can have your own like signature Bitmoji to send your friends that would be awesome. Over all I give this app five stars but if I could give more stars I would cuz this app rules"
1074,sleevysleaves,"December 29, 2018",4,"FIX THE SLEEVES Ok so most of the outfits are great but if you look at some of them (while your avatar is wearing it and doing an action) you realize that (for certain outfits) the sleeves aren‚Äôt connected to the shirt and just hang there. It bothers me and I want to wear a specific outfit (it is in the Hollister section and is a beige color) but I can‚Äôt because the sleeves just wrap around the arm, suspended. Please fix this.

1076,Galaxy GirlüëΩ,"February 2, 2019",4,Longer beards I love this app but there needs to be longer beards. My dad started building his avatar and he was so upset that there weren‚Äôt really long beards he won‚Äôt even finish building it he just gave up he was really upset about not being able to actually make his emoji look like him. So please put longer beards. I know my dad would love this app if you guys would just put longer beards. And I‚Äôm sure other men would too.
1077,Rebel_wagner,"May 17, 2019",4,"Wonderful I just love that I can personalize my own aviator, communicate with my friends bitmojis and have creative ways of expressing my feelings. "
1078,powpowwewe,"September 9, 2019",3,"I like it and all but... I like it and all but it needs a few changes to make this app better. I have a few ideas on what you can do! They should make it so that you can chose the shape of hair and the desired length, you should also add a segment for bangs, you should also be able to chose your height, you should be able to chose your own shirt and a pair of pants separately instead of choosing an outfit. I think if you add a few of these your app will be better!!"
1079,sophiesoo15,"August 30, 2019",4,"More customizing opportunities I feel like there should be more of a selection with the clothes. Instead of just picking an outfit already put together for you, you should be able to mix and match your own pieces and make your own outfits, same with like accessories like piercings and stuff like that. My point is I think there should be more of a selection in the catalog, i know people will enjoy it a lot more lol"
1080,lilylorenn,"May 8, 2018",3,"Diversity So i had this a long time ago, and it‚Äôs definitely expanded since then but it‚Äôs almost like some stuff got omitted, like there‚Äôs a pretty drastic change in skin tones I feel like a lot of medium to dark was sort of left out, also the facial hair, there‚Äôs a lot don‚Äôt get me wrong but what about someone who only has a neck beard? Also the body it‚Äôs like a little chubby to full on stomach, but then like three thin body types... It‚Äôs great how much has changed. Just putting my two cents in"
1081,Molly McCracken,"July 13, 2018",4,"Great but... This is a great app based off of an amazing  idea. However, the app would be so much better if you just added a few things. 1) you should be able to have multiple avatars. Some people share devices and both text on it so they would need to look different. 2) you should add animated ones. Like gifs but with your avatar person in them. 3) I for got the third one. "
1082,stylinturtle,"July 27, 2018",1,Benjamina ballerina needs a tutu. I am very disappointed in the clothing options available for the men section. I feel it is a bit sexist that there is a bunch of sports outfits yet no ballerina. Dance is a very serious sport and I believe it deserves recognition. Its these kinds of social media platforms that especially need to promote equality and and acceptance. Men ballerinas are a lot less likely to choose dance as a career because of this very reason. We don‚Äôt make them feel like they can express their passions freely. Everything else about the app is 5/5 but ultimately it comes down to the tutu and since there was none 1/5.
1083,AveryMorgan06,"July 28, 2018",4,"MORE OPTIONS!!! I have been using this app for a long time, and I really enjoy it. I would have given it 5 stars but there isn‚Äôt enough hair(in my opinion. there‚Äôs no wavy hair that is still down to the chest. I feel like you guys should add more options and everyone would like it more. Also being able to customize your eye color, hats, and sunglasses. Anyways the app is very good and I enjoy using it! Thanks for reading :)"
1084,J4Holyoak,"July 28, 2018",5,"Bitmoji I love Bitmoji. They‚Äôre so cute and fun. I do however have a suggestion. You should be able to mix and match the clothes.

Such as clothes or glasses. Anyways, I love Bitmoji!! Keep up the good work!"
1085,starstruk123,"August 2, 2018",4,"Yay Overall, I love this app!! But I think it would be even better if there were a few minor changes. Like I have a few beauty marks on my face, and I think my bitmoji would look even more like me if we could place beauty marks on our faces. Also if there were some clothing options from brandy melvile or more options for hollister that would be amazing! Thanks, and I hope you consider my suggestions!"
1086,LovesOCMD,"August 9, 2018",3,Friendmoji.... I absolutely LOVE bitmoji but I hate the fact that they are randomly selecting people to do the friendmoji. My friend was selected and she uses them all the time and I don‚Äôt understand why I haven‚Äôt received the update yet. My boyfriend had the update and doesn‚Äôt even know how to use it! Makes me so mad but other than that I love bitmoji so much! It‚Äôs so relatable. I can find something to go with any situation! I just wish everyone can do the friendmoji. It‚Äôs not fair for the people who don‚Äôt have it.
1087,Acerensi,"August 11, 2018",5,"Suggestions for next update Hello! I really love Bitmoji and using it with my Snapchat! However, I have facial piercings and I‚Äôve noticed that there are no options to add facial piercings to my little character.

1088,erbcat101,"August 13, 2018",5,"Amazing way better than any other one I tried This one is so good. You don‚Äôt have to pay for anything, so far I don‚Äôt see any ads. Nothing is locked and you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything. Outfits are super cute and so are looks and jewelry. I luv it. Way better than any other app I‚Äôve ever used for avatars cause it does into more detail and I just luv it. Peeps, get it!!"
1089,Vicü¶Å‚ö°Ô∏è,"September 10, 2018",5,Awesome Game but....... This game is truly amazing. I know this game shouldn‚Äôt require this but maybe the creator of this app can add Harry Potter things. I know that doesn‚Äôt match the game but I think Harry Potter fans would love this. Other than that you should totally get this app. He creator of this app should add more choices of hair styles that would be nice too. If you are thinking about getting this app then yes get this app!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
1090,Professor cornflakes,"September 23, 2017",5,Not enough options I find it really offensive that you don't offer enough options for everyone. We have such a diverse world and there isn't enough skin colors that show that for everyone. I can't find a skin color that matches me100%. I wish that you'd add a color slider that allows for everyone to find their skin color. As well as adding more hair styles and hair colors !
1091,18mmt,"September 26, 2017",4,Clothing options Bitmoji needs more clothing options. The past few days I‚Äôve been changing my bitmoji clothing far too many times. I want my bitmoji to look different from everyone else‚Äôs but clothing options don‚Äôt give much choice for that.

I deleted the app, and reinstalled it multiple times troubleshooting it. No dice. Then I signed out completely from my phone, rebooted it, signed back in and reinstalling app. Doesn't fix the issue. This is the first time since the app came out that I've had any problems."
1094,Halibugüòé,"January 1, 2018",4,"more diversity??? This is a really cool and fun app and while it does provide tons of options for skin tone, hair color, eye color, etc. there could be many improvements made. For one there are basically no updo hairstyles which is kind of annoying. Another improvement that needs to be made is a Bitmoji option for people with disabilities which currently there is none. Still a great app but it could be better."
1095,KenRun09,"February 9, 2018",4,Limited customization!! There's limited options for beards and mustaches!!! For me I have a handlebar mustache and there's no option of implementing that into my Bitmoji! I'll rate it higher once the handlebar mustache becomes a custom option!
1096,Idek wat my user should be,"February 9, 2018",4,"Multiple saving bitmojis I love using this but I have a suggestion. You guys should add the ‚Äòsaving multiple avatars‚Äô. So when u want to play around with the outfits and things, you don‚Äôt have to go through all the outfits again to find your old one and you can have different looks all at one click of a button.

My Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt have the ability to treat it red in the app! Can you please add hair treatment to all hairstyles? Anyway, other than that, I love it and will use it for years to come! Thanks Bitmoji! :D"
1098,BEmine person,"March 2, 2018",3,"I love Bitmoji, But it needs something added One of the biggest things I think the app needs is the option to choose a shirt, not outfits.

And if it has something that‚Äôs close to it, it looks weird. I‚Äôd love to be able to choose my tops and bottoms separately, kind of like we‚Äôre able to do with hats and glasses."

1103,Angelinaaaaaaz,"February 20, 2020",5,Request!! I think it would be really cool if instead of being able to mix and match certain clothes and shoes we should be able to mix and match all clothes and shoes like just for example a jersey (minus the hat) with sandals and different jeans and a sweater of choice probably wont happen but just putting it out there üòâ also you should add more onesies
1104,Deomtry dashü§™,"October 22, 2019",3,Bitmoji is alright. I rated Bitmoji a 3 out of 5 just because I think there should be more options. as in more hair and clothes and more. Bitmoji helps a lot and it‚Äôs so fun to use in Snapchat. I didn‚Äôt rate it a 3 because there‚Äôs just so many things that are off in a lot of people‚Äôs looks. I think it‚Äôs still a great way to express yourself. If you do end up changing it don‚Äôt change it completely just add more options. I still lobe  Bitmoji and I will continue to:)) please respond!!!
1105,c–ΩŒπcƒ∏en,"September 23, 2019",4,Really good app! I love the bitmoji app! It is really fun to use and I use it every day. I like all the kinds of outfits you can chose. It is really easy to make your own avatar. But I think there should be some other things added to the app like piercings or things that could go in the ears like headphones. There should also be things like braces or something you can add on the teeth. I think the app is really fun to use otherwise.
1106,luvppj,"September 15, 2019",5,"Soooo many choices! Not I love Bitmoji but there are some things I would fix or just update. First of all, the hair, I like unique styles and there‚Äôs really nothing that matches my hair. Second, I think they should have a color wheel for certain things like skin tone and make-up. Overall I probably use Bitmoji everyday but I think a few changes are needed."

For me it is very hard to find the right hair because I have loose curls and there are no options for me, and many other people also it would be cool to have pets that you could customize. And I have noticed that the hats for the costume don‚Äôt work do you think that you could fix that.  "
1108,Rzn3bys,"July 29, 2019",4,"Like it but could use some options I like the app and the idea, however it would be nice to be able to mix and match shirts, shorts, shoes, etc. Also would like to see a better way to do the body style. Maybe a slide to change the weight and height. Not really many choices. Goes from skinny to quite ‚Äúchunky‚Äù and I am more in between. Also had a slight problem with the hair style and color."

1110,kkaiitt,"June 15, 2018",5,"outfits! i and many others think that the next best thing would be to add a feature where we can customize our own outfits! yes, pre-made outfits are decent but this app is all about replicating US and i think in order to do so, we should be able to mix and match our own clothes. other than that, this app is great."

I can‚Äôt find some of the outfits that i used to wear. There should be a way to favorite a outfit and then have a separate section for the favorites, just a suggestion."

And that reasons because you need to make NEW HAIRS (ew that sounded weird) AND GLASSES OH AND LIKE IDK NEW CLOTHING TOO. Just give us newww stuff. The next update should totally be a ‚Äúnew‚Äù update. You haven‚Äôt updated the hair and stuff like that in a while and people will probably like your app a little better if you added new things. So yeah long story short we would love to see some new hair. I‚Äôd recommend longer more natural hair, more looks with bangs, different long hair styles, more short styles, all of that. And make glasses that people will actually want on their bitmoji. Thanks have a swell day."

But the reason why I have it 4 stars is because I wish they had a better hair type selection. There isn‚Äôt the type of curly I‚Äôm looking for, and the only one I can find is short and poofy. So I wish they had that. And more body types. Because that is needed. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great app!"
1120,Lissy628,"September 7, 2017",5,Needs NFL & NHL apparel Love the app but they need to add NFL & NHL apparel to match the MLB and NBA apparel that already exists. Then it would be awesome!

I know there are others out there that have to agree with me
1121,Blondyeoman,"October 15, 2017",4,"So much fun! I love these... totally awesome & I use it for texts all the time.

Like I‚Äôd loveeeee an Ohio State one.( and obviously other colleges) Or even ncaa fan clothes. But a big thing is skin colors/ tones. Like for tan people. And you have like olive skin tones and stuff but not like more reddish skin tones. you have like African American skin colors but not Native American color tones that are tan but not as dark."

Over all, bitmoji is great!"

1137,fear_m3,"December 21, 2019",4,"Hijab/Headscarf Options First of all I‚Äôd like to start by saying that Bitmoji is by far the best app, and tied with Memoji, to use for making your own emoji. I use it all the time since there are so many sticker options when I text people. I only have one little complaint. The headscarves options aren‚Äôt very modest/good looking. Considering the fact that I am a hijab I Muslim, my only request would be to change the headscarf design. THANK YOU!!!"

If you guys could please add more clothing options that would be sooo great

One more thing as well, I wish is that it was compatible with the Apple Watch. I know the Bitmojis show up as recents when you send a message, but I just wish the app was compatible.

1165,Murphy05,"June 7, 2019",4,"Great but needs more options for category ‚ÄúWORK IT‚Äù For the category work it with fire,police,military,etc they you need to put more options so one option that I really would like to be put in is a state trooper uniform so just a trooper hat in the hat section a trooper campaign hat and different color fire men helmet colors for example white,blue,red,yellow,orange and for military like dress blues and military different military branches uniforms and camp helmets in the hat section for the uniform."
1166,awesome but some issues,"April 23, 2020",5,Eyelashes and Makeup. DEVELOPERS PLEASE READ!!! I absolutely LOVE THIS APP BUT... the eyelashes are very limited and I‚Äôm not a fan of how there are huge black lines under the eyes so that is one thing. And the makeup for the eyes is not so great but not bad just wish that there could be gold or silver (shiny colors) but the rest is awesome! Love the outfits and the emojis great way to express yourself. I use this with my friends all the time and we love it!
1167,RayJ_10,"March 28, 2020",4,"Please add this!!! I love how creative this app is and what you can do with your Bitmoji and should honestly earn 5 stars but what stops it from being 5 stars is something they haven‚Äôt added yet.

The only thing I would recommend is to maybe add some more hair designs. I really like to make my Bitmoji look a lot like mine, but I‚Äôd like to have some more hair textures."

1170,Gloriousmuse,"August 4, 2018",4,"Put a search bar in the app? I love Bitmoji, but the only thing that‚Äôd make me like it more is if y‚Äôall put a search bar IN the app! The keyboard one is awesome at least because it has the search option, but I feel there are sooo many other ones in the app itself. It would be awesome if I could open the Bitmoji app and search for what I needed. Please, please, please work on getting a way to search in app üò¨ü§ó"
1171,3mmi3<3,"August 4, 2018",3,Make handicap features!! I fairly enjoy this app but the only feature I would like to see is handicap features. Bitmoji is about making an avatar that represents the digital you and for some people a wheelchair or crutches make up their physical persona. For some it makes them still feel like outsiders to not be represented fully in a way they already deal with in real world society. All in all this is a great app I would just like to see it to more inclusive to all types of people.

I love how you have kinky, natural styles for us African American users, but I still can‚Äôt represent myself through my Bitmoji because there‚Äôs no box braids as a hairstyle. I wear box braids all the time and on my Bitmoji, I have to use the very long dreads. I would love so much if you guys added braids as a hairstyle so me and probably a bunch of box braid users can have a Bitmoji that‚Äôs a split image of themselves."

It would be nice if bitmoji came out with an update that had more body types to choose from, and fixed the odd chest placement on female bitmoji!"

Also, all clothing is gendered. What if I want to wear a suit? Or if I have a men's hair cut? And while the face is customizable, they could take it farther than it currently is. If they just got rid of the ""male or female"" thing altogether, they could make the bit more customizable by being able to pick any feature or clothing option that was once locked behind a gendered option."

I love this app so much, but I‚Äôve logged out my girl Bitmoji and made a male one just because I wanted to see the hair and clothes options, and there are tons of clothes and hairstyles that I would LOVE for my girl Bitmoji to have? It would be very amazing if you could have an androgynous section for clothes and hair/let the guys have girl clothes too and let the girls have guy clothes too. Thank you! Please consider.. :(:"

Or at least, like I have big hips that stick out more than my belly and I feel like no body type really accurately displays that. Not complaining and I know it‚Äôs asking a lot, but I do think a body type variety as large as the face variety would be very cool."
1193,mazzzeeee0219,"November 5, 2017",4,"More options should be available I love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs one of my favorite things ever. I love to constantly change and update my appearance. However, there should be more options in several different spots including hair color, hair length, eye color, makeups, and most importantly clothing. There should be a wider variety!! It would make the app so much more fun and enjoyable. Not a lot of changes, but definitely the ones stated."

However, I‚Äôve noticed that bitmoji for my friends Samsung phone allows hit to customize captions. I do see that an area on the bitmoji keyboard I assume is suppose to allow that but it just does the basic keyboard function into the texting bar. A small glitch perhaps?"

I just got braces this January and when I went to look if there was any I was very disappointed to see that there weren‚Äôt any. It actually made me mad because bitmoji is pretty much a cartoon version of you and it doesn‚Äôt have braces!!! My and my friends with braces are mad! I‚Äôm the first one to complain though. Please put braces in the options!!!
1198,Slytherin Actress,"July 3, 2019",3,Room for improvement This app is fun to use. It runs well and the Bitmojis are funny. But this app only has options for females and males when you customize your Bitmoji. It needs to have a gender-neutral feature for people whose pronouns are they and them.
1199,Mr.Councilman,"June 25, 2019",4,Great It is great but not perfect I want the merch price to be brought down you would make more money because people will think it is cheaper so they should buy it so can y'all do that for me y'all would benefit from it too so why don't you

The search function is great, but could be faster. I‚Äôd like to have a favorites folder or two and be able to delete and remove bitmojis from them. More bicycle bitmojis.  I have turned several people onto these and they all love them. Thank you to the developers."

I use the bitmoji iMessage app to send people bitmojis. However, the bitmoji custom keyboard has much more capabilities and features. The iMessage app only allows to search for a bitmoji and the keyboard lets you organize by tabs and send bitmojis that have your friends in them. I would love if you updated the iMessage app to reflect the custom keyboard."
1203,Tina McKinney,"November 3, 2018",5,"It‚Äôs great! It is amazing! It can make your emojis look like you! But I would suggest some updates like: you can take a picture of yourself and the app will make similar emoji, and when you choose the clothes you should be able to choose the pants and or shirt. These are just my ideas, I enjoy the app! It has made texting so much easier!"
1204,emmasells,"November 14, 2018",5,"Heights should be considered I love this app but I feel like height is an important factor in the individuality of a Bitmoji, especially in snapchat when you and a friend can appear together in a Bitmoji. My friend is a head taller than me but for some reason her Bitmoji looks shorter than mine and it‚Äôs really off putting. The app should include height options in addition the body types."
1205,Alphawolf07,"February 24, 2019",4,"Suggestions I really love this app. It allows for my messages to be more fun and personal. To improve on that though, I think you should allow for people to make their own customizable messages with their Bitmojis. I feel like that would be cool. Also, more clothing selection for the girls. I noticed the male Bitmojis have more options for clothing and would appreciate it if the girls had more. Otherwise, a great app!"

I love Bitmoji and the new style update, however, the only reason why I haven‚Äôt switched to the new style is because you can‚Äôt adjust the width of the mouth.

A large portion of the choices for clothing aren‚Äôt what a good portion of people, at least around my age, wear. Perhaps look at the current trends and add some more options based off of those? Or possibly don‚Äôt separate options by gender, as many clothes in the men‚Äôs section could bd and are worn by women as well."
1233,Lgh98t,"January 25, 2019",2,"Great on iPhone; NOT on iPad When my granddaughter first introduced this to me, it was fun creating an emoji that looks a whole lot like me, and I enjoy having it as an extra keyboard on my iPhone.  However, on my iPad, it is very much like a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù experience: it will not display in landscape mode, and, more important, it refuses to interface with my keyboard or work any way to send Bitmoji pics to my iMessage. (And, yes, I did follow Bitmoji‚Äôs instructions to go to settings and enable keyboard access.) Therefore, I say that Bitmoji is uselsss on an iPad.  "
1234,Ariaric L.,"December 10, 2019",4,"More Accessories Would be a 5, but I think what would really make people like the app more is more accessories, like necklaces, earrings (and plugs/tunnels for those who have their ears gauged), and more hats. For example, my favorite hat was removed when the new style of the emoji came out, the Ushanka winter hat."
1235,iambrxanna,"November 1, 2019",3,"Pretty good but... Overall pretty good but there‚Äôs limited hairstyles and none of them look like mine, since I have curly natural hair and there‚Äôs not many options for us so I have to use a wavy one but my hair is curly from the roots not just at the ends. I also thing you should add were we could pick our own top and pants instead of having them together. Finally you should add bigger chest sizes and body sizes cause not everyone is like the ones added. Thanks"
1236,¬∞o¬∞ mickey,"October 24, 2019",5,Memoji This is a wonderful app!!! I am glad I have it and I have never had any problems with it. One thing I hope they add in the future is like a memoji not just the face but with your whole body too. That‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt like  Memoji because I wish that you could do a full body one. Anyways I would definitely recommend this app.
1237,SecretAnonymous,"August 2, 2019",3,"Perfect BUT... I‚Äôm hoping the developers read this. I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for quite some time. Back when there were limited number of expressions. I love the new faces and all but PLEASE more cute hairstyles?!!? Especially for female. There‚Äôs not enough short and long hairs or up do‚Äôs. Please!!! I only use 3 of them and change every now and then. Very limited. Need more female hairstyles for buns, long and medium lengths. Also I‚Äôm sad you removed some great outfits and kept sports and stuff. :("

1242,Œ±._.–≤,"May 21, 2018",4,"üíñ Love this app so much and I encourage people to buy this app. I think there should be a new update where you can choose you‚Äôre own pants and shirts and shoes individually instead of as just one outfit. And for the girls and the chest size, there needs to be more than three chest sizes bc not everyone is flat chested or has a medium or large chest size. Maybe you should involve height or make many more different lengths of hair and types of hair."
1243,Tyrdgksjx,"May 30, 2018",2,"It was fantastic at first! At the beginning of the app they had awesome brand names like Steve Madden, forever 21 and others. But now there aren‚Äôt very many good outfit choices that we all like. None of them appeal to me and it‚Äôs hard to adjust your new outfit when you like something else that isn‚Äôt there anymore. I loved the forever 21 and now it‚Äôs gone. And also, please make more realistic skin tones, hair styles,  ECT. Can u add a feature of some sort that allow you to take a picture and it creates a decently similar version of you."

Especially having this option to have pregnant body for when that exciting time that happens in your life. The wardrobe options they have are quite sad and not fun to express the type of person you are.

The only one that has straight hair is long, and my hair is not long. I wish that they had a hairstyle that made my bitmoji look like me."

The boots need to go with something else."

The actual app is great in general and I luv the outfits and the fact that u design the body types but I just wish that in hair u don‚Äôt just choose the style but u also choose the length but u set it at any length wat i mean by this is that it would be great to slide ur finger across the length bar and choose the perfect length!! Also for outfits can u plz team up with Hot Topic?!?!
1253,reeserachel,"February 12, 2018",4,"More face features please I loved the update, now my bitmoji looks more like me than ever before! It is so cute and the new stickers are adorable and funny. I have one dimple though, and there isn‚Äôt an option for one dimple. If you guys added more face features that‚Äôd be great!!

1260,nwbermudez,"June 11, 2018",5,Web developer must have for staff pages In the past we used to custom develop icons for each of our clients staff pages. Bitmoji has made it extremely easy to customize an icon for any staff member. Thereby making our job a hell of a lot easier. Thank you Bitmoji for creating such a versatile and fun tool for creating animated characters of ourselves.
1261,The Krackon,"August 10, 2018",4,Pretty good The app is really good but the only couple things i would change are 1) with the puffy hair kind of styles and a hair accessory should be able to work and not have a hat where the hat only works at the front and not the sides and 2) you should be able to choose a top you want and a pair of shorts/pants you want maybe even a jacket so you don‚Äôt have preplanned outfits that you may not like.
1262,Rare Reviewsüòá,"August 13, 2018",4,Very good I love the app Bitmoji. The updates have fixed many bugs and made the app more enjoyable. However I have one complaint. I love dresses and I love to put them on my character. I have to look through all the clothes just to find one dress. Maybe you could add a search bar so that nobody has to go through all of the options. Also maybe you could add more and better dresses.
1263,honeybadgerswag,"September 20, 2018",5,"Spice up your chats The bitmojis are hilarious, there is one for every mood/situation.

1272,Eflowmik,"December 29, 2017",3,"Improvements Suggested I like the idea of Bitmoji but the ‚ÄúF‚Äù words or even suggestion of them is unnecessary. And I don‚Äôt like the fart ones either. I wish there was a way to either hide or delete the ones we know we won‚Äôt use within our own bitmoji app. I also suggest a search engine for finding the one you want.  It would be so much easier and quicker to find if we could search with one or two word themes such as ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚Äúlove,‚Äù ‚Äúangry,‚Äù ‚Äúcleaning,‚Äù etc."

More hairstyles, more body shapes and types, and color wheels instead of preset colors for skin, hair, and eyes would make this app much better. I feel like if you aren‚Äôt a generic hipster this app just lacks variety. It‚Äôs sole purpose is so that you can have an avatar that reflects you, yet the options are pretty limited. That‚Äôs just the stuff that bugs me, otherwise it‚Äôs a pretty solid app!"
1302,Emily üíÅüèª,"October 30, 2017",3,"One hand. My Bitmoji looks exactly like me except for the fact that it has 2 hands instead of 1. Lots of people are missing limbs, and I know it‚Äôs weird to be complaining about it and all but it‚Äôs probably the thing we‚Äôre most insecure about. We face so many obstacles that make us feel horrible about it when we should have confidence. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just me, but i would very much enjoy it if my Bitmoji was an exact replica of me, one hand and all. Xo‚Äô"
1303,Maxinefred,"December 31, 2017",4,"More!!! Bitmoji‚Äôs were so fun when I first got it!! Then as I used it I got sick of the clothing, makeup, and hair. Because only every season new clothes come out. And I‚Äôm not talking a lot of clothes it‚Äôs like 2 clothes and their useless! And new hair never comes out. Bitmoji can fix this easily but the don‚Äôt. I have asked people and they agree with me, Step up your game! But I do love it other then that! Please listen to your supporters."
1304,Jfkabfnsnd,"January 10, 2018",5,"I LOVE BITMOJI!!! But... My one and only complaint, is y'all don't have enough bitmoji for sports, went to send one of me skiing and there wasn't one!üò± I was shocked because I thought y'all had a bitmoji for everything!! Also looked for one of someone climbing some rock but came up with nada again üòï would love to be able to have ones for my two favorite sports"
1305,Peytonskyemostkiewicz,"February 2, 2018",3,"Its great Its great but when I saw the update for Bitmoji a couple days ago, I obviously tried to update. I waited until it finished updating and went in. I went to settings, and I clicked on the avatar style button or whatever its called. Bitmoji Deluxe wasn‚Äôt there. I closed and opened the app again and it still wasn‚Äôt there. When I went to see if I needed to update it again, my phone told me it had already updated. Please please please fix this!!!"

1307,ariel ;),"February 10, 2018",5,"can you add different mouth sizes on your next update? i really like bitmoji and i  L O V E  the new update, but i think it could be better if i could change the size of the mouth, because i could find the lips that look like mine, but the mouth is too big and it makes my bitmoji not look like me :( if you could add that to your next update i'd be so thankful :)"

I accidentally deleted my bitmoji on my snapchat and i tried to go on the app to redo it but it logged me out of my account. I tried to log into my bitmoji account but i didn‚Äôt know my password. I tried to get help to reset my password but that didn‚Äôt work either. When i tried to make another account it told me ‚Äúno internet connection‚Äù when I have perfectly good internet.

1310,Xjohnny2000,"August 26, 2018",3,"MIDDLE PARTS So I love this app and have been using it for a long time. And I‚Äôve always noticed that my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look 100% like me for some reason and I finally figured out why. There are no hair options for males that have the part in the center, which is where I have mine. There‚Äôs like one but it has dreadlocks which I for sure don‚Äôt have lol. My hair has a middle part and kind of just flows back. Please make a lot more middle part options!"
1311,GoldFootball,"November 29, 2018",5,"Love it but one request that some people might want I absolutely love this app, but one thing i would love to have in it is the choice to have the tips of the guys hair colored. In real life i have colored tips and i wish my bitmoji could have the exact same thing. So if its no trouble i would ask if you could add that choice for the boys. Thank you üòä"
1312,A Whisper User,"February 11, 2019",3,"No Real Curly Hair Okay. I‚Äôm not usually one to gripe and complain, but I am really fed up with apps like this not having natural curly hair styles. It makes those of us with curly hair feel like we‚Äôre naturally unattractive or like we don‚Äôt belong. The only ‚Äúcurly‚Äù hair styles are all horrible perms or simply wavy hair. I love everything else about Bitmoji (especially the tardigrade!) but I am so done with professional designers acting like it‚Äôs impossible to draw curly hair. Bitmoji was bought for $100 million. Act like it."
1313,DeadlyPigeon,"May 13, 2019",4,"Love the app, just one improvement. I absolutely love this app. i especially love how you can link it with your fitbit and your snapchat. the only problem is that i think you should be able to wear the opposite genders clothing. For example, if you‚Äôre a girl bitmoji you should be able to wear male clothes. Other than that i don‚Äôt see any other improvements that could be made. Love this app!"
1314,;-;27,"April 1, 2020",3,"Hair Lengths & Color Varieties There‚Äôs a lack of hair lengths and as a person who has really long hair. I‚Äôd wish there‚Äôd be more hairstyles with really long hair and not just short hair. Also, can there please more color variety when doing eyeshadow and all of that. For example, we choose our color of desire but a place where we can choose how bright, or dark we‚Äôd want that color because right now I feel like it‚Äôs all the same and nothing new."
1315,Red vonBaron,"March 31, 2020",1,"Don‚Äôt like it #2 or Privacy? What privacy! I‚Äôve been using this for a long time. Used to work (as a keyboard) without me exposing my keystrokes, text, history etc. but am now being FORCED to Allow Full Access or the keyboard functionality is dead. WTH?!!! I get that you SAY you don‚Äôt collect keystrokes, text (I saw another recent review and your response) but there is NO way I‚Äôm allowing that. Rollback this or I‚Äôm gone... As a possible alternative perhaps you offer a token 99¬¢ paid version that works without altering full access. I‚Äôd pay that for the peace of mind."
1316,No one who you know,"February 28, 2020",5,"Just a thought. I love that you can now customize the outfits but what about the same for hair. For example I have bangs, but the only hair style I can do is down if I want to have my Bitmoji have bangs. It would be a neat feature if you could pick your hairstyle that you want and then choose to add bangs or not to that hairstyle."
1317,falseprod,"February 8, 2020",4,Hair/Head Wear I love all of the new options that were added into customizing the out fit of the bitmoji. Personally I have wave and would like if my bitmoji could have it too. Or at least a proper durag instead of a headwrap or bandanna. I would also live if your bitmoji could wear AirPods and the head phones were more customizable. Other than those small things. I really do enjoy using the bitmoji app.
1318,korribreanne,"December 27, 2019",3,Additions for the app. I think it could really improve if you could have more than one person in the Bitmoji. I hate having to send two separate ones all the time for my two best friends & I. It also doesn‚Äôt give a lot of options with another person when you look up something in the search bar anymore. Please bring more options and be able to have more than one person.
1319,Lucee Lavern,"July 7, 2019",4,"I love Bitmoji! Bitmoji is a GREAT app! I love sending it to my friends and family, it‚Äôs super fun! But the one thing I don‚Äôt like when changing my outfit is where you can‚Äôt customize your own outfit! It would be way better and everyone would have their own style and different shirts and shorts or pants, etc. Or, where we could customize the shirts or pants, etc with logos or accessories! It would be really fun, thanks!"
1320,KAIPEEZY,"March 22, 2018",3,Took away good features I like that they look more realistic but they took away features that now take away from the way I really look. There‚Äôs only three options for the lips and I hav big ones so there‚Äôs none close to what options we had before. There needs to be more clothes options. I‚Äôm tired of the same followers having the same outfits lol. It seems to focus more on the hair options than anything else.

1322,1LoudZ28,"April 25, 2018",5,"Needs more clothing option for male I like the app but I feel like the clothes options are lacking. None of the option are simple t-shirt, blue jeans and boots. All of them are rolled up pant legs or sneakers. None of the clothes option have a traditional work boot/cowboy boot. I wear steel toe boots all the time as work requires them and feel there should be an option for that"
1323,Unmagical Unicorn,"April 28, 2018",4,"Good app I was editing my bitmoji avatar and I wanted to change a few things because it didn't look that much like me. I went to the skin tones, and tried to find the closest one to mine. I found a skin tone that was pretty close to mine, but not really dark enough. But if I went darker, it would be to dark. So it would be cool if you guys added a little bit more skin tones and other features. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1324,TaylorTho,"June 14, 2018",4,"More clothing choices please?! I‚Äôve been using bitmoji for awhile with no complaints but this one and it‚Äôs kinda huge....we need more clothes! Like, separate categories for tops, bottoms, one pieces(dresses/rompers/costumes), shoes, different accessories(maybe a category for hair, neck, arms, legs)! It would be so much better than the awful premade outfits you offer now! Anyways, that‚Äôs me. Other than that, you‚Äôve got a great thing going here!"
1325,Mr.Isaiahking,"June 14, 2018",5,"Needs more. Some people have tattoos if you catch my drift that would be a cool and fun touch to add on and if you could make it wear you can make up your own outfits and change the colors of certain things like shoes, and you could also add different body sizes because the body ratios on here are off but still work."
1326,CHLO CHLOüòé,"June 16, 2018",5,"Update It‚Äôs a really great app!! But I think that you should do a update so that we can create are own outfits and hair.

1327,DiieqoHines,"July 8, 2018",4,"Bitmoji Savvy I adore the Bitmoji‚Äôs they‚Äôre fun and just give the picture a change of scenery so to speak. The only drawback is the styles. I love the classic look, but I don‚Äôt like the like how the Bitstrips have a bigger variety of hair styles. I would prefer to keep my classic Bitmoji, but have more styles. That‚Äôs the only thing that makes me sad. I tried to do the Bitstrip style & I just really don‚Äôt like how it looks. Makes me sad every time."

1329,appstore.user,"August 19, 2018",4,"Add more skin colors I love bitmoji, I always use it on snapchat since it‚Äôs like having a mini version of myself; however, i don't think there are enough choices for the skin tones, there are several on the app, yes. But personally, I don‚Äôt see the skin tone that I really think best fits my avatar. I am not light but not dark either, so if you guys can create more skin-tones in between both shades, then it would be great."
1330,Monkeys88,"September 23, 2017",2,"MORE VARIETY I like this app, but there‚Äôs just not enough. I have curly hair. The only curly styles you have are just like puff balls. My hair isn‚Äôt super frizzy. There‚Äôs barely any hairstyles, especially for the Bitmoji Style. There aren‚Äôt even hair dying options, like ombr√© or highlights. Also, there‚Äôs barely any long hair styles. And everything has bangs, but there should be an option to choose with or without bangs. Most people that use this app don‚Äôt have bangs. There‚Äôs just not enough hair, clothes, or piercing options in general. It‚Äôs so annoying."

1340,joey p da tripple og,"October 27, 2018",5,Outfits I love Bitmoji it‚Äôs a very unique and playful little app but there‚Äôs one thing...your freedom of clothing.

So Bitmoji please you know you can step up your game. Thank you for such an amazing app

Bitmoji only has summer maternity clothes. This isn‚Äôt an issue for a lot of people but I love my bump and I want to show it off! Even through my bitmoji. Four stars only because of that.

I also think there should be a scrunchie for your hair in the hair accessories category bc they are really in right now. Maybe in the side braid hairstyle, you should be able to add the hair dye. Also, you should add French/Dutch Braids bc they are SUPER CUTE!! Just some thoughts.. Hope some people can agree!! üíïüíïüíñ"
1350,Ramona the sloth,"April 1, 2018",5,"You guys did good but OK, so Bitmoji Is really cool. But it could be cooler.

You can only wear the reds hat if you also have the reds shirt. And also please fix more bugs! Now you don't absolutely NEED to do these things. Just some more suggestions."
1351,tomato face 21,"April 19, 2018",5,Good app but.... But we need more outfits and more popular brands and another thing is you need to allow guys and girls to put chains on with our outfits like we can put them on before we chose an outfit before we make a Bitmoji but hope that happens p.s when I mean chains I mean gold chains and silver ones and gold with diamonds on them but yeah thanks
1352,b e k a h b,"July 24, 2018",4,"? Mostly, I use this app for Snapchat. Sometimes text, but mostly snap. I rlly like how there are more options for hair and clothing , but there‚Äôs never a right fit. For example, my hair is middle length and has curls. Yet I have to use the short cut hair because that‚Äôs the only curly hair that fits me, but it‚Äôs Wayyy too short. I think there needs to be more curly hair types that are longer and more clothing. That‚Äôs all."

It isn‚Äôt the biggest problem, I know, but for people like me that are really proud of how they look it might be slightly offensive."

Something has changed prob with an update?? I don‚Äôt want the bitmoji board popping up first, thats very annoying since I don‚Äôt send bitmoji‚Äôs on every text. If this continues I‚Äôll be sad but will have to remove your keyboard üò• If there is a support center for this and i'm doing something wrong, help..."
1371,EMans247,"February 28, 2019",4,"So close to perfect! Really the only thing missing is the ability to piece together your own outfits! Wish there were more outfit options too, but there is a solid selection so far. I also really wish the friendmojis weren‚Äôt Snapchat exclusive :( I don‚Äôt use Snapchat. "
1372,VikaN01,"March 11, 2019",4,"outfits I love bitmoji, its so fun with friends, and being able to create our own little people. But I wish we could create our own outfits instead of having to pick between premade outfits. I love the options but I just wish I was able mix and match them to my taste. Like having the option to choose whatever shirt, and pants and shoes to put together :)"
1373,xXxLazy SquadXxX,"April 5, 2019",5,It‚Äôs really good and all but... I know many people that use it my friend wants to use it except the curly hair for her are different than anything close to her same hair aswell as mine I always have my hair in a ponytail in one side I know u arleady have one but like it‚Äôs too straight and my hair is really puffy and long is their any way u could more hairstyles ?
1374,112233bbysharm,"April 20, 2019",4,"Review I love the app but, there‚Äôs always room for improvement. I would like to see better options for hair colors because rose gold or pastel pink is becoming more popular and all the hair color options in the rainbow colors are very bright. Another thing that I would like to see added is more clothing options and mix and match the bottoms and tops. Also braces, and piercings would be a good add on."
1375,SiennaBrown2008,"May 1, 2019",4,More!!! I love this is app. It is super fun for my friends and family. It‚Äôs also great because you can link it to you messages and Snapchat!! Only thing is I wish that they had the option to add braces to your character! My friends and family and me all have braces. Overall this app would be so much better if you could add some more stuff to your character! ü§©

I‚Äôm wearing pig tails right now while writing. What I also meant to add is that you need more clothing and hair. Lastly, get more clothes that are cold shoulder and off the shoulder tops plz! Otherwise it‚Äôs amazing üòâ. OMG! I forgot! Don't use swearing words because I‚Äôm 8 years old. I know I know it‚Äôs for 12 and up but I‚Äôm a rebel so yeah. Bye and improve the app."

1378,bowmaania,"June 25, 2019",4,Clothes I honestly really enjoy the app it‚Äôs fun and creative and just all and all cool! But here is my problem and I know that you all put a lot of time into coding and creating this but I think you should make a costume shirt choice like use you emojis and make them use the shirt! Just an idea I appreciate if it would happen but like I said I know you all do a lot anyway and I do appreciate that.
1379,lfzgncxx,"June 25, 2019",2,"It‚Äôs okay but it needs improvement Bitmoji is great, but it needs a new logo, a new look per say, as great as it is it‚Äôs boring now and we now are now every iOS user is getting Memoji for IOS 13 which doesn‚Äôt make Bitmoji fun, they should improve a lot. Make it very new improve the look. New emoji faces, new logo like I mentioned before, new everything. They got big competition, and even though many of us are going to get IOS 13 Memoji we will still use Bitmoji, but I‚Äôm uninstalling it for now. I want big change."
1380,ussaustin70,"June 20, 2018",5,"Much love I love bitmoji but i‚Äôd love it even more if we could customize our own outfits. None of the current outfits speak to me so i‚Äôm settling for something right now. And all i really need is a black t shirt (not cropped) and some mom jeans. As someone who communicates heavily by bitmoji, i need to look like myself so people don‚Äôt call me out or roast me in the group chat"

Like come on bitmoji y‚Äôall have been doing well so far with their clothes but can I make my bitmoji actually look more like me? Isn‚Äôt that the point with bitmoji in the first place?
1383,princessmickey,"August 14, 2018",5,I enjoy this app but not so much the new update Anybody else having an issue with the app since they recently updated it? I updated this app the other day and ever since it has been saying installing on my home screen under the app as if I uninstalled the app which I never did... Anyone have suggestions ..
1384,Nervo Smith,"September 17, 2018",4,More hair styles and clothes plzzz I love bitmoji so much and it‚Äôs a really cute and fun app but I find it hard to match how I look with what you have to offer. The hair styles are limited and I would like if there were more long hair choices. Also it would be nice if there were more fashionable outfits and maybe some jean shorts and tank tops or something. I just would like more updates please. Thank you!
1385,Capone1973,"September 20, 2018",5,Funny and great It‚Äôs great to use add a little extra to your messages. Cool to make an yourself an avatar with a lot of different outfits to send a unique message to someone. Well it‚Äôs more like a sticker because it‚Äôs not a GIF would be cool if they added that feature in the future. But there are other apps for GIFs. Love to also see more outfits
1386,BreeInGilbertAZ,"October 12, 2018",2,"Fun, but no transfer to new phone! üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just upgraded from my old 128GB iPhone 6s I‚Äôve had 3 years to the 512GB Xs Max which I love.

I now have RECREATE an EXACT DUPLICATE of what I created several months ago‚ÅâÔ∏è Stupid! Disappointed. Also, no iPad Pro support. Huh‚ùì Getting in and especially OUT of Bitmoji is a bit of a pain, but you get used to it. It is what it is - a free fun, but flawed app. üëéüèº"
1387,i.opri,"December 28, 2018",5,"Amazing I love Bitmoji so much!!! It has so many diverse choices for hair, skin, eyes and much more! I especially love that you don‚Äôt have to have a snap account to use it. You can text it too. I love changing my outfits and that they have brand name clothes available like Nike, Hollister, and Adidas! Five stars all the way! Plz download this app and the Bitmoji merch also is great!"
1388,Judywuhu,"January 4, 2019",4,"Search feature? I love this app! I just wish there was a search feature in the app itself. It‚Äôs so convenient when you can search for them in the iMessage app. For example, there‚Äôs one with a mountain in the back and I have no clue which category it‚Äôs in so I‚Äôm scrolling forever through all of them. Still haven‚Äôt found it because I get impatient and quit."
1389,ur lil cupcake,"January 27, 2019",4,"Amazing but... I really love this app, I got it in 2016 and still have it to this day, I love the outfits, the hairstyles, the hats, the everything about it! What I think should be updated in this app is a new avatar customizer. What I‚Äôm talking about is that, we can mix up our clothing choices. Like separate shirts and pants, and we can pick which pants and which shirt. I do love the pre-made outfits but I‚Äôd like separate shirts and pants. Thanks!"
1390,Bellabooh001,"February 14, 2018",5,"Suggestions I am completely addicted to this app. My friends probably get annoyed with me for this but whatever. Anyway, I have a few more suggestions to add. Maybe you could add more bitmojis? My friends keep saying that you guys should add ‚ÄúI only text in bitmoji‚Äù because I use it so much. Or just more bitmojis to choose from. Thanks!"
1391,Lizz123321,"March 7, 2018",4,Cool but needs more. Bitmoji is a fun way to express feelings or being funny over text and social media. I especially love the collaboration they did with Snapchat. But they should definitely add more skin tones for people of color and hair styles. How you make your Bitmoji should be totally you but it is very limited. They should also add piercings and jewelry because we are all different and express ourselves different.
1392,aziz.somrani,"March 23, 2018",3,"Add some Piercings in both male & female. The last time i used bitmoji it was awful speacily in the avatar editing, & there Wasnt much things to chose from. Like the male hair, The beard,ect... Thats why i deleted it the past. But now. I see that u added alot of things in THE avatar editor. & i love ur work now. I hope u always. Add things to chose from in The editor. & Please add Some piercings & body modification, like nose piercings, earrings, lip piericings in both male & female. I hope THE next update is worth the wait"
1393,Zulyosorio,"April 14, 2018",3,Good app need more choices This is a good app I would have given it a five star but I would like to be able to send emoji‚Äôs in Spanish to have the choice to pick from Spanish to English because some friends of mine are Spanish and some friends are English I want to be able to text both the app only allows you to have emoji‚Äôs in Spanish if your phone is in Spanish it would be nice to have a The option to switch from Spanish to English
1394,Physicallym,"April 20, 2018",4,MORE OPTIONS Okay so i like what‚Äôs available now but a few things could be improved upon. 
1395,Lalalisa21,"April 27, 2018",3,"Outfits won't change I normally find this app a lot of fun and easy to use, but after this last update I noticed after I chose one do the outfits, now I can't change it again. I click on the outfit area and it's all blank. Also, I'll go to change the hair and only portions of the images will change the hair. Other portions are a different hairstyle. So there is some bug in there that needs to be updated."
1396,Lollipop827,"May 1, 2018",4,Diversity of hair and eyes (or lack there of) This app keeps improving with each update but they still lack diversity of eye shapes and tilting. What i most desire is more hair textures. I have curly hair and there are only two things on here I can use (waves and coils) neither of which is ringlets or other kinds of curls. Additionally the straight hair has lots of styles but if I want my Bitmoji to have a ponytail it won‚Äôt look at all like my hair.
1397,Taetaeüì≤üì≤üèÑüèºüèÑüèº,"May 26, 2018",5,I love it but... Well I‚Äôve had great experiences with Bitmoji as it is a fun app for Snapchat and me and my friends. But one thing is that when I want to match with one of my friends of a different gender there is not much that we can match withüôÅ. So I would prefer if you were to make a category that would be matching for each genders. Thanksüëçüèæ
1398,K28osborn,"May 26, 2018",3,"Clothing fixes I like Bitmoji because it‚Äôs cool to be able to be unique and set it up to look like you, but I wish it was easier to personalize clothes. If there was a shirts section, a pants/skirts section, a dress section, a shoe section, and an accessories section (all separate) it would feel so much more personal because our clothing truly is how we express ourselves and right now we are just limited to the same exact outfits as everyone else."
1399,HarleysCryBaby,"June 19, 2018",5,"Need more I love Bitmoji I really do I just want to change the color of some outfits or accessories like the glasses and hats. It‚Äôd also be nice to add outfits and choose what goes with what, like if I want to wear Adidas pants and a Forever 21 shirt. I‚Äôd also like to be able to put tattoos or bracelets or something on my Bitmoji‚Äôs arms to give them a little sass. Other then that I‚Äôm loving the app."
1400,MsStarSword,"September 8, 2017",4,"Great, but... So, it's a pretty cool app, but there is one thing I'd like to ask. Bitmoji, can you please add a braided hairstyle for women? My hair is always in a braid, it's kinda my thing. My braid is a little over 2 feet long, and I wear my hair like that literally all the time, so most of the people I know have never seen it down, and I was wondering if you could add one for the long hairstyle please? Thanks! It's an otherwise great app!"
1401,firegirl96,"September 23, 2017",4,Love I absolutely looove this app. I use them all the time in my messages back & front to family & friends and I love using them on Snapchat. I would only like to make one suggestion and that is to have black turnout gear for firefighters. The only opinion is brown & personally my department has black gear and I would love to get different colors of gear to choose from since every department is different.
1402,kimerrrr,"October 6, 2017",5,"Head accessory colors I love this app, but it drives me crazy that when I select a GREY hat, it ends up BROWN/TAN on my bitmoji's head! My friends come through as GREY...what gives? I have the most up to date version. So my suggestion is give us color options that work. I thought maybe it was bc of my hair color but I changed that and they still turn out tan."
1403,Brigitte pace,"October 16, 2017",5,"!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Literally one of my favorite apps!! I love all of the cool features and how they collaborated with snapchat! I have one idea for Bitmoji though.. maybe it would be cool to have a height adjustment. Just like they have body adjustments. I though that might be a cool option, but otherwise my favorite app and can‚Äôt wait to see what new things come next!"
1404,CaptainOh,"February 5, 2018",5,Great Overall The apps new update is amazing with all the new hairstyles and much more realistic looks but the outfits are still limited to a smaller choice. And instead of having preset outfits I wish there were customizable outfits to fit your own style that‚Äôs not within the preset outfits. Besides that the app is awesome!
1405,Puppylover654üò¨,"February 10, 2018",4,just my two cents // issue with hair I have curly/wavy long hair (i‚Äôm hispanic) and there aren‚Äôt a lot of options for my hair type which is kind of frustrating. There is one hair type that like a middle split that‚Äôs wavy but it‚Äôs a short hair style and there are none that are long and curly. Is there a way that this could be added? Because that would make me love this app so much more.
1406,butterflysR27,"February 12, 2018",5,"Recommendations 1)We should be able to choose our own shirts, pants and etc. individually that way we can mismatch our own outfits to express ourselves in a different way."
1407,Siveyyyyyy,"February 13, 2018",5,"teeth? Ok so I LOVE this app and I really like changing up my avatar and seeing other peoples bitmojis but I do have one request. I have a gap in my teeth and I know a lot of other people do too, I also know A LOT of people with braces, so my one request is that you make teeth options, just to make my Bitmoji the best representation of me, and for other users to do the same."
1408,big iron red,"February 14, 2018",4,"suggestions i love to use this app, but i‚Äôd like to see some new jewelry options like earrings of all kinds (especially gauges), nose rings like septum‚Äôs and studs, and a braces option as well, bitmoji appeals to a younger crowd, and as we all are young that does not mean we all have blank, pure faces, some of us do have facial piercings and without this option this makes me look like every brown haired blue eyed girl instead of the unique person i am with my many added temporary traits, as they are temporary, so are bitmojis, and i can change it anytime, so even if i was to get my braces removed i‚Äôd still like to not be reminded by my beautiful teethed bitmoji, hopefully you can take this into consideration before your next update."
1409,my name is hannah e,"April 25, 2020",4,Clothes catastrophe Ok I love this app but there is one huge problem for me and it‚Äôs that recently I made a new account and it will not let me get to the girl clothes and it is ridiculous that before this update it was only clothes for a male and I‚Äôm sure most of you know how difficult it is to make a good look when there isn‚Äôt any girl clothes and I would like it someone FIXED MY ACCOUNT!!!
1410,B ZORP,"April 16, 2020",5,Incredible App! It‚Äôs the best ‚Äúmake your own emoji app‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen.
1411,elephant3456789,"March 29, 2020",5,"love *ahem* amazing. I appreciate the more options of clothing and being able to customize it. But my issue is hair. There are sooo many types of hair, and the options that are given are usually very close but are never exact. But others than that I absolutely love bitmoji and I like to see what other people create."
1412,ggrggf,"March 27, 2020",4,"Fun But One Bug Bitmoji is a good way to connect to my friends especially when I have something really important I need to tell them. Also I‚Äôm glad that everything is free because I don‚Äôt want to keep buying more iTunes cards. There is one glitch where my Avatar just renews it‚Äôs self, but that‚Äôs the only thing that kept me from giving it a five star review. Anyways good app. :)"
1413,12THMANJESUS,"March 13, 2020",5,Great app but can have some changes I love the app. Me and like all my friends use it daily. The mix and match is also AMAZING. I wish they had more options for the hair though. I have straight hair but I don‚Äôt part it in the middle and it isn‚Äôt that long. I know that sound dumb but it matters to me. It is an overall great app though.
1414,#Heartie,"March 12, 2020",5,"More hairstyles I LOVE THIS APP! but there are a few things I‚Äôd change. I feel that there aren‚Äôt enough hairstyles! I would love one with a normal bun that is not messy, another one with straight hair, one with two braids, half up and half down, etc! I guess I just want more variety! Please consider adding more hairstyles, I have had this app for a long time and I expected you to add more hairstyles but... "

I love how you can create an avatar to look like you. I had an idea to throw out to the developers of this app. Perhaps make it so you can create your own stickers! That would make it so much fun! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CREATING THIS APP!!! üòÜ (p.s, please have a filter for swear words on the stickers!)"
1419,Harley236,"June 13, 2019",4,"The clothing I love this app I really do, I personally think it looks just like me but there‚Äôs one problem I have I really want to fix. The outfits. I think it‚Äôs great we get choices but I wish we had the chance to pick the shirt and pick the pants and things like that. Make it our own instead of having the same outfit as 20 other friends. Other than that I LOVE this app!"
1420,Allison Wallen,"March 27, 2018",5,Awesome app I‚Äôve been using bitmoji since it first came out. The only thing I would ask for is that we could be able to make our own outfits and for them to make more clothes. It‚Äôs been the same for a while and I think it would be better if there was more variety.
1421,lexisoccer4,"March 29, 2018",4,"I love but... I love bitmoji and i feel like its a great way to express yourself. One thing I recommend though is instead of having outifts, have the different types of clothing separated. Like, have section to choose shirts, a section for shorts, etc. cause a lot of outfits, people like just the tops or the shoes, etc. So if we choose separate clothing, that will be more Customizable. Other than that, love the app!!"
1422,tween_dreams,"April 16, 2018",4,Could be better but still a great app The app is great but it could be better if they would add people with skin effects or wheelchairs or their medical items and can we get more gaming accessories like headsets or shorts and some bitmojis for them üòÇ it would be great if they see this and think of the people that would love to get this app because they thought of them oh and also more chokers plz
1423,sunnylo906,"May 17, 2018",5,"Highly recommend Best app ever! Very interactive and user friendly, and allows people to create their own unique character and express themselves in countless ways. This has changed how I send messages. "
1424,Awsmboy123,"June 18, 2018",4,"Needs more personalization I think bitmoji needs to have the ability to hand pick certain items for outfits; choose what shirt goes with what pants and which shoes you have on. If you added piercings such as earrings and nose rings or other standard piercings it would be greatly improved and I, along with many others, would be 100% satisfied. Just my thoughts."
1425,üí©ü¶Ñ,"July 14, 2018",4,"NEED better clothes on the FEMALE side When i‚Äôm looking at the section for males i feel like they have options and better looks of clothing they can pick from. But if i was comparing the clothes from male to female i‚Äôd say the male side has a better variety of clothing and styles. It would be nice if u can add the same to the female side that‚Äôs my only negative opinion on this app but other than that, it‚Äôs a great appüëçüèª."
1426,WetherWax9753124680,"July 24, 2018",4,"Bitmoji Review I think that Bitmoji is pretty good overall, but I think that there can be a few more things added to the girl‚Äôs wardrobe. Well, first of all I think that the boy‚Äôs Nike section has way more and better options than the girl‚Äôs. Secondly, I think that there should be rash guard type bathing suits for the girls and also bikinis. Thirdly and finally, I think there should be more hairstyles for the ponytail for girls. Thanks!"
1427,bitmoji fan:)),"August 4, 2018",5,This is worth it Bitmoji is a great way to share your creativity. You can also express yourself. Bitmoji is a wonderful way to show who you truly are inside. Even though you might not always find your style you can always create a new one. This app they‚Äôd the world know who you are. Just like me. Thanks for reading.
1428,Justmiyyt,"March 17, 2019",4,It‚Äôs a great app but I feel like this is a amazing app you can connect Snapchat to and send cute things to friends and family I just wish there were more African American hair styles and textures and things like adding edges and more clothes styles to chose from and earrings and jewelry and stuff I feel there should be more accessories and more options to chose from but overall it‚Äôs a good app
1429,Madsgads,"March 30, 2019",4,"Love the app! I‚Äôm a teacher and it‚Äôs so fun to add my personal touch to documents and emails! My only complaint is that there is not a good option for the body size, I wish there was an option between the last two body sizes.

1430,LiamLunafamily4ever,"October 23, 2017",4,"Sooo close to a five I love this app!!! It allows me to express my emotions without taking it out on someone else if I am texting.

I still love it, but please try your best to fix bugs and crashes!!! Love y'all!!! <3<3<3"
1431,ccp7007,"November 13, 2017",4,"Love this app! But we need new clothes! I use my Bitmoji DAILY!! In Snapchat and in my messaging, I love it! The only reason I don‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because the clothes are old and boring! We need new clothing!!! There were Halloween costumes that were added but what about normal clothing?? Please update the apparel at least on a monthly basis! This is the only downfall of this app! Seems like they don‚Äôt update it as often"
1432,Jdjsnhahshay,"January 16, 2018",5,"I love it! This app is such a great way to express your feelings without using words! It‚Äôs a great way to show how everyone is very different in looks and style, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt have fun. Some social media apps even use this for silly pics all the way to happy birthday creations! It‚Äôs a very fun app and I recommend it 10/10."
1433,Abbz4000,"February 4, 2018",2,"Men don‚Äôt have many options I am a female, & have very many options on bitmoji. While making my character, i even found a nose that i thought would look good on my boyfriend‚Äôs bitmoji. After finishing mine, we went to make his & were extremely disappointed because there was almost nothing at all to change. The nose i wanted to use for him wasted even an option. Now you guys are choosing what noses we can have based on our gender? GIVE THE MEN MORE OPTIONS or at least the amount women get!!"

I have a suggestion. Could there be an option for one dimple when customizing your bitmoji‚Äôs face? I have only one dimple on my face so it would be great if my bitmoji could have one aswell. Thank you!"
1435,Shells_17,"February 9, 2018",4,Outfit I love the new upgrade!!!! The customizations allow you to do more with your Bitmoji appearance.
1436,Maryz2121,"February 11, 2018",1,"New update Im sorry I just dont like this new update:(. I love the app but me and I'm sure many others have noticed their are not many options for the jaw, face shape, mouth, and lips. Whatever I do, my bitmoji does not look like me and in return I dont want to use it:(. There should be more jaw options because I think the jaw is very important. Also the mouth options are very short. The mouths are all long and my mouth is not long. The lips as well only have three options which isnt enough. Please on the next update offer more variety for these categories."
1437,WolfieKid,"February 11, 2018",5,"Love the app. I Have some suggestions I love this app... me and my friends all use it. I think it is amazing! And I couldn‚Äôt find a better app than this. But I have some suggestions for the outfits on the app. Like maybe adding Harry Potter styled tees or robes. I‚Äôm a huge Harry Potter fan. And it will make my day if you added this to the app. Once again amazing app, love it. Bye"
1438,AliceMichele,"February 18, 2018",5,"Love this!! I love this app. I thank the artist and developer and anyone else involved for creating this, and for free, with no ads!?! When first I saw Bitmojis all over Facebook, I was annoyed by the silliness of them. A few months ago, I try out this app, and I can‚Äôt get enough of my Bitmoji! LOL! Try it and enjoy the messages you can send with your mini me!"

There hasn‚Äôt been an update in a while, the most recent one was for spring but now it‚Äôs fall... I feel like a lot of the clothing options aren‚Äôt something I‚Äôd wear so it makes my bitmoji look less similar to me! Please consider adding more clothing options and maybe making all bitmoji able to wear any gender clothing?"
1441,CutieKittyEmmy,"October 3, 2017",5,"Super fun! I love this app so much, the only reason I'm really reviewing is because I was wondering if maybe you could put pajamas as clothing options? Every time I send a bitmoji at night, it looks weird still being in regular clothes. I know there are some bitmojis with pajamas but the rest don't have them. Anyways keep up the good work!"
1442,Epic waffles 2013,"October 3, 2017",4,Really cute but i wish there were more outfits... I'm an avid sim player and my favorite lart has always been choosing outfits...and that carries into creating my bitmoji. I really wish there were more trendy outfits that appeal more towards teens and young adults or maybe customizable outfits? I just really feel that there needs to be more cause I see all bitmojis wearing the same outfits...
1443,Trvo dxjcjc,"April 30, 2020",4,"Cute I love how you can decorate your person, and there is a variety of outfits. Also, they have a lot of stickers when you search for one. One thing is that I tried logging back in, but it says I don‚Äôt have connection when I do.  I want to go back to the app, but it won‚Äôt let me log back in. I do recommend this app over the gif‚Äôs. Bitmoji is very fun and cute!!! üòùüòä."
1444,COLtitina85,"April 29, 2020",4,"More Spanish Text Needed I love the app and it is a lot of fun. I‚Äôm a teacher and we have been using it for distance learning. I just thought including more foreign languages in the stickers text would be a great improvement. In the same way there‚Äôs plenty of diverse looks and accessories, language diversity would make it appealing to more people and facilitate more uses for the app."
1445,YAYA AKA Luna Lovegood,"April 17, 2020",4,"Good but could use some work I love this app, I really do it‚Äôs just I hate that you can‚Äôt pick other accessories besides hats and glasses. I would love if the creators would add a jewelry thing to it. Necklaces, bracelets and earrings would be awesome. The only time you can get them is when you pick an already made outfit. Not to be rude but a lot of the already made outfits just don‚Äôt fit my style."
1446,Brittanybea,"February 10, 2020",4,Good app needs to be more inclusive I love the app and being able to design myself but I‚Äôve come across a problem that like many other apps there is no handicap inclusive options which with me being in a wheelchair makes me a little disappointed and I would like to see more handicap inclusive options in all apps but other than that it is a great app

1448,Ever V.,"December 3, 2019",5,"Suggestion Love this app! Use it all the time. I think you should add a feature where you can easily make your own bitmoji, so you can customize and edit what your bitmoji says if you can't find a bitmoji to express yourself. However, I can't seem to search anymore. Am I missing something?"
1449,deev001,"September 4, 2019",5,Outfits I love everything about the app but I feel like we should be able to customize our own styles. Being given options doesn‚Äôt really make it unique for us. Maybe make it a thing so we can make our own outfits in the next update??

Can we get a search function, please?"
1451,üòöüñ§,"November 18, 2018",4,I love it! but.. I think there should be more outfits. Like if you could make it so we could pick the tops and the bottoms and shoes so its all separate categories. I can never find an outfit that i want because it doesnt have what i like! this is my opinion on what you guys should do. i bet less people would complain about outfits that way... but this app is great otherwise!
1452,bondo ü§™,"December 2, 2018",5,"Request I absolutely LOVE Bitmoji!!!! It would be awesome if you could make more than one bitmoji... instead of having to delete the other one to use the new one.

1453,Zyire W.,"January 26, 2019",3,"Room for improvement. The app is great I can‚Äôt deny that however, there is room for a ton of additions. For example, I have dreadlocks but there are only 2 long hair style choices for it, straight and crinkly. I for one wear my hair back and up a lot so it would be cool if they could bring back some older hairstyles so people such as myself can have a more realistic Bitmoji. Another example is a bit of a stretch but more body types would be nice."

All in all, if more options were added to personalize my gal, I‚Äôd give it a 10/10."
1456,adubbb14 on YouTube,"April 14, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs good but one complaint üëèüèªüëèüèª This app is pretty good the hair has lots of hairstyles but I really think they need to add more outfits. First they don‚Äôt have any Louis Vuitton and Gucci, but they do have a bit of Nike and Adidas so it‚Äôs ok I guess. Second they barley have any black clothes they only have 1 all black nike hoodie all around it‚Äôs a pretty good app but just needs more outfits."
1457,Handa95,"May 28, 2019",4,"This could be a good little thing to add. I really like the app I do, but why is it when I go to change clothes on my avatar I can‚Äôt mix and match different colors of whatever outfit I pick.

But now it needs some updates... like different clothing, accessories, new face options/body options, hair styles and colors. Everything is very basic and has hardly changed since the beginning. I would use this app 10 times more if i was able to make the Avatar a lot more like me. It just misses the mark in a lot of places I find..."
1459,gpick3,"June 13, 2019",4,"Love it, but... I love the idea and concept of Bitmoji! I‚Äôm so impressed with how it‚Äôs advanced over time, with more options for personalization. My favorite Bitmojis are the ones that include cats, but my complaint is that the cat is never brown (which my cat is). I‚Äôm suggesting there could be an option to personalize the animals within the Bitmoji, or an add on pet feature. Would love to see something like this happen ü§ù"
1460,MsReta,"May 1, 2018",4,Love the app but needs more I love the app. I use it all the time. One thing that I would add would be the ability to copy and paste the friendmojis from Snapchat to other text boxes or make it so the friendmojis show up in iMessages. There also needs to be more clothing options in general and more maternity options.

I feel that you as a company if someone‚Äôs bit emoji was chubby or fat to be more just flat out rude me their background a bowl of food or something to make them feel even more fat of them forever skinny people you give them just emoji‚Äòs in as backgrounds. That should be changed. I prefer if you didn‚Äôt make this public.

Every time I open any app to type a message, the Bitmoji keyboard automatically opens, instead of my regular keyboard , then Bitmoji immediately crashes and closes, then frequently I have to close whichever app I was going to message in because it freezes up.

1469,Da-r√ºs,"September 13, 2018",5,"I have one request! I love the bitmoji app very much! I like the customization a lot, my only desire is for a new way of customizing.

1470,Lt. Yolo,"November 16, 2017",4,"More hairstyles and better blonde options please Obviously very fun to have an avatar but I‚Äôd like more options when it comes to hair. Obviously it‚Äôs hard to satisfy everyone with hairstyles so that‚Äôs less of an issue. But I‚Äôd really like better options for blonde color. For blonde, the best options are either really light brown that‚Äôs kind of blonde or just straight up hilighter ink yellow and it‚Äôs kind of gross. Please help!"
1471,MogLove,"December 8, 2017",4,"Great app! I love bitmoji so much!! The process of making mine was a lot of fun, and I really enjoy using them in text conversations. However one thing that would be cool would be if the outfit choices were updated a little more frequently, and having Brandy Melville (probably didn‚Äôt spell that right) do a clothing category would be super cool. That's all though, in total bitmoji is super fun and engaging. üòÅ"
1472,Millakat,"January 20, 2018",4,Great app!! This is great app and I love the idea. If anyone wants to know it works with Snapchat too!! But it's a little annoying if you have it in your keyboard because it pops up if you accidentally tap it and then you have the tap the globe all over again and it's sometimes annoying. Please fix this by having a whole other icon in the keyboard. But it's definitely cool!
1473,JessiüéÄ,"January 25, 2018",5,"Options I‚Äôm probably just really pregnant & hormonal, but instead of having pregnancy outfit options, you should be able to make your bitmoji pregnant & put them in any outfit.

I mean it‚Äôs the most common among African Amarie an males and yet they seem to cover all the hairstyles with long hair... I need the next update to have big waves/small waves and variances in forehead size with these wave hairstyles. I mean how hard could it be dang!!! If they do this I‚Äôm sure 5 stars would be in order!!! Active duty GTC
1477,yep kinda,"March 11, 2018",5,"Bitmoji Update? I give this app 5 stars because y‚Äôall made it a lot better by adding different facial features and hairstyles, more skin tones.

1478,Fuffin Mucker,"April 16, 2018",4,"Future Development Suggestion This app is fun. That being said, why not make it more fun. Plenty of people have pets. Adding the ability to create and customize your pets would add a new level of customizability to Bitmoji. Different kinds of pets, different breeds of pets (cats, dogs, etc.), as well as being able to adjust their colors, weight, markings, etc. would bring so much more to Bitmoji."
1479,I-love-r5,"April 18, 2018",4,"More options We need more outfits! More casual clothes and possibly the ability to make our own outfits with a selection of tops, pants, etc. We also need more girl short hair options! All the short hair options for the girls look like they belong to a soccer mom, not a teenage girl. There‚Äôs hardly any shoulder length options, and like I said the ones that are there look like adult hair styles."

When I edited the ‚Äúbody type‚Äù of my Bitmoji and then went to change the outfit she was wearing it only gave me extremely limited selections compared to the smaller body type. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm a curvy person so obviously I want to express that on something that is supposed to resemble me. I can‚Äôt do that when I‚Äôm only given limited options on what my Bitmoji can wear just because her body type is different and not small. Fix this.

1489,DrekTheSnek,"October 3, 2019",5,Avacado suit I think there should be an avocado suit because not only would it be ridiculous it would be cute and funny. I also think there should be a toilet suit just to add more humor. I also think you should be able to take the hood off on costumes. Other than that 5/5 would recommend
1490,Allie11o189,"February 8, 2018",3,Happily Disappointed With all the upgrades that were made to the avatar recently can‚Äôt believe y‚Äôall still missed the mark on the maternity section.

I even got a couple friends to download this but what would be nice is if you could have more clothes like in the night time it would automatically change into pjs and maybe like in the morning change in to clothes of your choice thanks!

I have a plain long bob that I middle part and there is no option for that, I think that‚Äôs silly that there‚Äôs like 20 options for different ombr√© hair but no generic looking bob hairstyle. I also want to be able to customize my Bitmoji with the same facial piercings I have.

I can‚Äôt be the only one wanting different options for NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB clothes. How about separate shirts? Separate hats? Jerseys? The outfits are cool, but why can‚Äôt we have just one article of clothing from the outfit instead of having to wear the whole thing? I feel like that would be so much cooler."

The whole point of it was to create a more realistic image of the actual user into a bitmoji. That‚Äôs the magic of bitmoji. Even the outdated version provided this for us. Graphics are A1 though, I highly appreciate it. New accessories such as the beret should be included. After all, it is the essence of many other bitmojis such as myself.

See I love this app a lot I think it‚Äôs great but I need some more white girl curl options there‚Äôs two options and both are middle parts I wish to see some more styles, another issue I have is the body types it goes from stick fig to large with no between if there could be a more diverse range of body types it would significantly improve the app."
1578,Paul Rafanan,"May 31, 2018",4,Amazing but not perfect This app is incredible!! The only thing I'd ask is to have it where u can make more than one avatar. I'd like to have one for each of my friends that I can use.
1579,Alexisa28,"June 1, 2018",5,"Bitmoji idea Bitmoji should get a braces feature only for people either braces. Only those people!! They take a picture of themselves and can‚Äôt pick from their gallery!! Then the people with them pick how they look. If they only have the top, only the bottom, or both! Please use my idea and sponsor me!!"
1580,Myfaulkner,"September 24, 2017",5,So fun! I love how often new Bitmoji options come up and that you guys stay relevant to popular memes and new seasons. I can always find just the right response because of your huge selection. My ONLY critique would be that there are no NFL jersey options. Hoping that'll come soon since you have MLB & NBA. Great work though!
1581,Padme66,"October 10, 2017",3,Fun App Update:  Putting NFL outfits first still won‚Äôt make me pick one.  How about a T-shirt with an American flag üá∫üá∏ or I ‚ù§Ô∏è USA

It shouldn‚Äôt be so . Please they should improve on that it will make it more fun to use . They should think about adding African clothing to it too , that would make it better as Africans use Bitmoji too! If they can make the Bitmoji talk that would be excellent except that it‚Äôs pretty good !! üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"

1585,Toe-meat,"February 1, 2018",4,"Awesome App!! This app is really cool and the idea behind it is great, although I wish they would add an edit option to certain characteristics. For example, be able to style hair just a little differently from what they have freely or even facial hair, at least for guys, I‚Äôm sure for girl avatars this would be a cool and useful option. Other than that, great app and love all the new additions!!"
1586,sarahwest21,"April 18, 2020",4,More hair options I love bitmoji but I have never been able to pick a hair that is anywhere similar to mine. I have curly hair but i do not have kinky or coily hair. Curly hair vs coily hair are very different and there should be more hair to fit all types of hair. I‚Äôve been using the hair with the half up half down bun style because it‚Äôs the closest thing for many years and i‚Äôm bored of it. Thanks!

1590,katie hanifan,"May 20, 2019",4,Good app!!! This is a great app. I love how you can customize it to look like you. One request is to add softball bitmojis if possible. I can‚Äôt remember if you have swim team ones but if not please add. The only reason is because me and my friends want to be able to get ready and celebrate for softball. And if there are not swim team ones I also would use those a lot! Thx!

1597,Butter Girl 3,"August 29, 2019",2,New outfits! Bitmoji needs more outfits more often. Also something that was really a bummer was it was like maybe two months since new outfits and I thought they finally decided to release new outfits but they under up just being a collection of already existing outfits. I feel like there should be new outfits more often. And maybe a few more hairstyles? Idk
1598,Criptonite44,"July 31, 2019",4,"Can you add a few things? I love this app for Snapchat, but some of the outfits get old.

1601,calthewitch,"October 11, 2018",3,"Something Missing I love using bitmoji to chat with my friends. It‚Äôs a really fun way to communicate together. However, it‚Äôs kinda hard when my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt feel like Me. I‚Äôm non-binary and it kind of ticks me off that ‚Äúfemale‚Äù bitmojis are limited to feminine clothing, and vice versa. A lot of people don‚Äôt limit what they wear to what is considered ‚Äúright‚Äù for their sex. Please fix this feature, it‚Äôs keeping bitmojis from becoming personalized, aka their initial selling point."
1602,Danikathleen oh yes,"November 17, 2018",5,"Great just one small fix I think they should include the option of inserting a facial beauty marks/moles on the face . They have check and facial lines but for me a very noticeable thing on my face and for many others are those marks. For example, I have a Marylin Monroe mole by my lip. The Bitmoji just doesn‚Äôt fully look like me without it"
1603,Leo Amador,"January 7, 2019",4,Could use more stuff The app is great to express yourself and make a avatar that looks just like you. But it could use more accessories. Like more piercings and the option to make our own outfit. Choosing from our own tops to our own shoes. And maybe have more hair options. I don‚Äôt know the app seems kind of bland as of right now. But overall it‚Äôs a good app.
1604,KaySlays23,"January 22, 2019",4,More facial features please! I love bitmoji and send me friends my bitmoji all the time but I really think we should get to choose more facial features. Like for example some of my friends have braces and I‚Äôm getting mine soon. I think maybe to make your bitmoji look more like you you could add those and the same with hair for people with thicker hair. Thanks for reading!
1605,#Alderpaw,"February 9, 2019",5,"Great! I love this app so much, it‚Äôs great how you can customize your character just the way you want it to look!

1609,Stupid nickname crap1975,"May 14, 2019",3,"Really like it but....... I‚Äôve had this app for awhile now & I really like it. The only thing that makes my review 3 stars instead of 5 is at some point you stopped being able to search for a type of bitmoji. If you go through another app, like FB, you can still search, but if you just open the bitmoji app there‚Äôs no way to search. Please bring back the ability to search."

Overall excellent app!!

1620,ActiveLifestyler,"October 25, 2017",2,"Good, but HATE hard push for their keyboard Bitmoji characters are fun, but after opting to not use their keyboard, the app initiated a hard push notification that covered my preferred keyboard insisting I should use their keyboard.

I still enjoy using Bitmoji and I will continue to use it :)"

Heading in the right direction.... Reminds me of my old habbo hotel days. Dont stop there though! More clothes to choose from would be nice, allowing us to mix and match between different shirts, pants or shoes so everyone wouldn't look the same would be a plus.

The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because it needed more hair options. For example, there was a side braid but there was no Dutch braid or French braid. Or even 2 regular side braids!

It was all fun it games until I was horrified by the bitmoji he sent me.  Why is there no pinky promise?  Only some weird hand holding.  PDA is not good for young kids and many young kids are on Snapchat.  The pinky promise is a universal sign of promise.  Instead of clearly understanding the point he was trying to get across I was very disturbed by weird hand touching.  Please bitmoji for the good of the people make a pinky promise.  And we as the bitmoji customers will promise you a better review.

Even make it's skin tone blue or purple or even yellow! There are so many stickers to text people with, And a lot of clothes to dress-up in! ((I know dress-up sound childish, but whatever)) And I also love the fact you could get Your own merch! Thank You For Making This App! -NatKat"
1650,iPodRetard,"February 28, 2018",4,Great but needs better clothing I love this app. The newer details are amazing! Now you guys just need to update the clothing. Make each body section separate with other options. I‚Äôm a female but prefer male clothes. There‚Äôs only one or two outfits that I like and I‚Äôm forced to look at women‚Äôs clothes. I‚Äôd like more choices! And I‚Äôd like men or unisex clothing options!! Love it otherwise. Use it daily.
1651,KaitRose,"March 24, 2018",5,"Love this app but one suggestion I have always been a fan of Bitmoji, especially after this latest update! However, I think it would be more fun if we had more outfits, or even individual pieces of clothing that allowed us to make our own outfits. Just a thought!"
1652,MaieX3,"April 18, 2018",4,"Really good but maybe some new features? I really like using my Bitmoji character in my snapchats, but I wish I could customize her more. Ever since the Bitmoji Deluxe update, she looks a lot more like me, but I wish there was more customizable clothing. And braces!! If I want my character to look more like me, braces and more customizable clothes is a must! Other than that, I love this app a lot."
1653,grwsscvbjyes,"June 3, 2018",5,"More outfits more hair styles I need more outfits maybe a mix and match options please even if we have to purchase upgrade clothing.... purses would be a plus, I want more hair options for classic like length changes and a bun with your real hair not the braid look. Please please please thanks I love my bitmoji she is my mini me"
1654,Forced Euphoria,"June 21, 2018",4,"Not bad I am surprised that there isn‚Äôt a search feature inside of the app like there is when adding an image to a text. I would rate this higher if you could customize the colors for each piece of clothing in the design process. Overall, it‚Äôs fun and it does what you‚Äôd expect (aside from the missing search feature)."
1655,chelleCandi,"June 24, 2018",4,Love it with one request I love Bitmoji and all the updates really helped make mine look just like me. My only request is having constant interaction with other bitmojis in iMessage the way we do in Snapchat. I love being able to use mine with my sisters on Snapchat but when I‚Äôm on iMessage i can‚Äôt. So if that could be possible i would never stop using them
1656,hamilicity,"July 2, 2018",4,"So cool but I wish this could be added to make this app utter perfection I wish there was a way we could have stickers with our friends like there used to be on Snapchat. It would be cool to somehow link your bitmojis to your friends so you could have friend stickers, even with more than one friend. Just a suggestion. Would love to see it happen"
1657,wooly_wooly,"July 13, 2018",4,"Add More I appreciate bitmoji. It adds to the social media and messaging experience. However, I dislike the limited options. Bitmoji could do so much better by just adding more skin tones options as well as models for facial structure and hair design. It would be AMAZING if they added more beard and mustache options for guys too. As well as more garment options. Suits are a personal favorite."
1658,MBrown87,"September 13, 2018",4,"Love it! But... I love this app and the fact that I can send tons and tons of options thru text messages, it‚Äôs really awesome and fun! But...I wish it was updated with facial piercings and/or tattoo options. It‚Äôs goes into great detail with all kinds of facial features, just not ones that would stand out or personalize it even more like piercings, etc...would LOVE to see that upgrade!"
1659,HunterAndrews1234,"September 21, 2018",4,"ADD SPLIT HAIR COLOR! Its a great app to make yourself for snapchat, but one thing i dislike is the small amount of hairstyles to choose from..My boyfriend has dreads and they don't have the type of dreadlocks he has, theyre all too long!

1662,Crystal_Clod,"December 9, 2017",5,"Minor adjustment I love Bitmojis but there‚Äôs some things that only bitshrip types can have. I really wanted to put antlers on my Bitmoji but when I go to edit my headwear, there‚Äôs no antlers. I figured that the reason why I can‚Äôt find the antlers is because I have the Bitmoji style and my friend has bitshrips style . Can you please add antlers to the Bitmoji headwear."

I give it five stars and say this is the best thing!!! I know it‚Äôs only for 20+ but even though I‚Äôm younger it‚Äôs hilarious!!! To good!!!

Until a few days ago I I looked on the app after I updated it and everything was white! The next day I came back to see if anything was different and the app was completely deleted off my phone!! I didn‚Äôt delete it and nobody knows how to unlock my Phone! HOW COULD RHIS BE POSSIBLE? I have tried to download it again but every time I download it it just goes white then deletes.
1665,antiregis7462214,"January 10, 2018",5,"Great but needs more options Since popularity is rising, the app should have more choices to customize your character.

1666,yori jefferson,"January 19, 2018",5,"Five stars! This app is great! But I want more from the outfits. Example: can you add a wolf costume? Or a bear costume? Also, I want the ability too make the outfits myself. So, if possible find a way for the people to mash, create, color change, and show off outfits they have made! Other than that, it‚Äôs a great app!"
1667,courtbailey1,"February 6, 2018",5,Love App But??? I love the app I actually just wanted to suggest something!! I have a distinct mole on my chin (and I actually love it) and I‚Äôd really like to see a feature added in which I can add it so that it looks more like me!! I saw there were freckles and dimples and such. And I really hope to see a feature like this added soon. :-)
1668,Danielle.Mahlke,"February 24, 2018",3,"Piercings? So I‚Äôve been using this and I like the new update, but I kept looking at mine and couldn‚Äôt figure out why she didn‚Äôt really look like me. I then realized it was because there was no way to add a nose piercing! Can that be added? Also I would like a search function when looking through all the options. It would make it easier when you want to see something specific!"
1669,Kbear2022,"March 17, 2020",3,"Body Shaming Hi! As someone who‚Äôs weight fluctuates I find Bitmoji to body shame people‚Äôs outfit choice! Then testing the different size options, the larger sizes have over half of their options taken away from them and are only able to choose from a few made outfits. I found this hurtful as I went up a weight size on the app to be honest and wound up having to go back down for bigger outfit selections."
1670,hoodie lover 12,"February 24, 2019",4,"Pretty good! But... Bitmoji‚Äôs always been pretty good and I have no complaints, but one. I realized that boys and girls clothing is separate, so if you sign up as a girl, you only get the girls option of clothing. There is a great variety of clothes to choose from, but I really just want to have a hoodie like my guy friends do on their avatars. Otherwise, the app is great, just wish my avatar could look as lazy as me!üòÇ"

1673,LaBibisBaliadas,"April 20, 2019",4,It‚Äôs good but needs some changes Ok so bitmoji is amazing n i love the app but what i don‚Äôt like is that they don‚Äôt have really good clothes and that they don‚Äôt have real type of clothes that we use. They also don‚Äôt have mixed eye colors n all that for example:hazel. Also they need other curly hairstyles because not every person has that very curly hair. But overall it‚Äôs good.
1674,wkdoalpp,"May 13, 2019",5,This app is super fun This app is so much fun. You can make you own pick different outfits. You can text your friends with pictures of bitmojis. You can also you can connect with Snapchat and do fun things with that. I really like this app because it is no money. You should really get this app. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1675,OMGTHISGAMETHO,"May 27, 2019",5,Braces! I have been using this app for years as I did on SnapChat! It‚Äôs so fun and a great way to interact with friends! I feel like it would be the coolest thing to add braces to the menu of choices and all the different colors and types of because because that would make people with braces feel so special! üòÅ

1677,nsjcid,"December 4, 2019",5,I love it but you should add this I love this app a lot I use it all the time with text Iv and snapchat but I really think you should be able to make ur own clothes like pick out different shirts and different colors maybe shoes ? Or pants ? It would make people with different styles actually like there bitmoji?!
1678,Spider-Girl3000,"November 23, 2019",5,More Modern It would be amazing if you could customize ur Bitmoji more like the hair styles and make it look more like yourself. And if there were more modern outfits and maybe if we could choose the tops and bottoms separately and the shoes. It would also be amazing if you could customize the color of ur eye color and ur hair.
1679,Daddyüçë,"July 5, 2019",5,"Love the app! Me and my friend have a lot of fun customizing our Bitmojis when they update stuff but we were talking and thought it would be really cool if they added a game-like aspect to the app where you could kinda build a life for your Bitmoji, like you could have a little room and pets and stuff."

If you‚Äôve seen the title you‚Äôll know that‚Äôs there‚Äôs just one problem...I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt change your glasses color. It‚Äôs probably not a big deal to you and it‚Äôs not a HUGE deal to me either but I just hate that to be honest. üòûI hope you can update it with that feature! Thank you so much! Bye!
1681,EpicCookie99,"November 16, 2018",4,"Suggestion üôÇ I love this app but the one thing, and many people want it too...is to be able to mix and match outfits...like choose what top and bottoms and what shoes.

1714,name611,"November 29, 2019",4,This app is great but... this app is a great way to express more emotions than just emojis but I think that you should add more customization to the clothes like let users be able to mix and match clothes ( like have the shirts seprate from pants and pants separated from shoes)If any of that makes sense.

And you can too!  I just wish Bitmoji would let me design one for my friends. That would be dope!  Are you listening?  I think you would

1724,Mommaapple,"November 11, 2018",5,Im hooked I absolutely LOVE this app and use it so much that I‚Äôve gotten others using it too now. I was just wondering if you‚Äôre going to put in more outfits - it would be great to have Christmas sweaters and such to dress ‚Äúme‚Äù up in!!!! I hope others request that too! But either way I still love the app!!!
1725,GuyWhoNeverReviews,"November 30, 2018",1,"Lazy Just having this app and seeing your update history the past YEAR shows more than enough this company is being lazy with its very small minor updates, The outfits and face editing/ accessories which are the most vital part about the bitmojis target audience is lacking severely in terms of diversity and style.. the app has been kept mainly in the same state despite snapchat changing so much these past 2 years alone... very lazy work and needs much more attention than just 1 small irrelevant update every month.."
1726,Jenni.mbr,"December 14, 2018",4,Piercings and more I love Bitmoji and the only thing that would make it better is having the option of adding piercings other than the earlobe one and also adding miles to our emojis to better resemble us. I have a nose piercing and and have a mole above my lip like Marilyn Monroe and I feel like being able to add that on my Bitmoji would me so much more interesting.

However there are a few things about the avatars, so for hair I know you guys just added a few new hairs but it would be really helpful if you added a little more cute long hair for girls. <3 Also the clothes love them as well, but I want there to be new clothes soon please! One last thing one of the animation stickers, can you please make one with friends hugging like actually hugging!! Thanks. <3"

1730,superstarmimi,"May 10, 2018",2,"Not my fave anymore Let me start by saying that I use to ABSOLUTELY LOVE this app. I was able to create a Bitmoji that looked exactly like me. Well I was forced to update the app and the updated features just don‚Äôt work well. Once you creat your bitmoji and go to look at the different options, you notice that the bitmoji doesn‚Äôt even look like what you just created. I‚Äôm going to try to figure out a way to reverse my update. If I can‚Äôt, I will date the app. Such a disappointment."

1733,gal1014,"June 13, 2018",4,"New clothes? Add more clothing options for bitmoji :') there's a lot of outfits but there should be more outfits that aren't so dull. I wear crop tops, crop sweatshirts with high waist ripped jeans and adidas. That would be cool to see. I really want more styles to be available and not already made. I want to be able to create my own look by having the option to choose different clothing."

1735,Happy_Wanderer_19,"July 2, 2018",4,"It's great! But there is one little problem. I've been wondering about some of the outfits. Some of the outfits with the leggings in the ""Bitmoji Casual"" section show gray for the display but on the character they turn brown instead. I was wondering if there's a possible way to change that. I really like the app and I hope it continues to satisfy people :)"
1736,E E üëç,"July 8, 2018",5,I love it! But... I love this app and use it all the time! It‚Äôs so fun to use and change out the look of your Bitmoji. My only complaint is that you can‚Äôt really personalize your outfits. I wish you could mix and match the outfits instead of just choosing one. But I freaking love everything else sooo...
1737,Ghana smlxlslaabbavv,"July 23, 2018",4,"Is great! Bitmoji is great! Everyone uses it. It‚Äôs best used for Snapchat tho. Only problem is that there‚Äôs not enough hairstyles for girls who have short hair, like to the shoulders. Also they should add a feature for people with braces or earrings. They also should also add outfits that have shirts with shorts, they do but it‚Äôs like a tank top not a t-shirt, so i feel like it‚Äôs more practical. But it‚Äôs really great!"
1738,DanceDanceDance!!,"August 2, 2018",4,"Braces option? I will be getting braces soon and thought it would be a great idea to add braces to one of the many great features.

1739,lowkey903,"August 12, 2018",5,Hairstyle Bitmoji is a great app that you can express your style and feelings through texting and snap chatting. I just wish they put more hairstyles on here. How you put every dread head hairstyle on here and put the 360 waves for the wavers? But besides all that the app is really great and fun to use. Keep up the great work on the updates.

Just the option to add them would be great!!"
1742,Kaitlyn AKA biggest fan,"February 16, 2018",4,Love this app but got ideas I love this app so much but I feel like there could be a little change like you could pick your outfits a little different like for us to go pick up your shirt and then you gonna pick up your own pants they don‚Äôt come in outfits and shoes and I wish you could make your own clothes that would be really cool
1743,mshughes2u,"March 7, 2018",4,Love bitmoji Please up date outfits and body features my old bitmoji look better with the fat feature then my new one... the chest on women look like a uni-boob when bigger and why does the plus size look like the Michelin man and a Pillsbury dough girl got together and that‚Äôs what you have ... give them more curves and then you get 4 stars .... still love can be better!

Y‚Äôall have 4 stages of skinny and then morbidly obese. I myself have extra weight but come on man. Nothin wrong with being that that big but I certainly am not, but neither am I as skinny as those other options. You need more options."
1750,Mykalan09,"September 18, 2017",4,Things to add It's great app and everything it's just I wish you would give us more options to outfits and hair skin tones...we are limited in what you give us like my skin tone isn't on there I'm either to dark or to light. My hair well all you give is short hair cuts...mine is long... then the wardrobe none of the cloths suit my personality... they don't match what is me
1751,Rrxina,"October 10, 2017",4,"Things to Add I love this app!!

And I wanted a hydro flask and a little back pack to fit my outfit and there was no water bottle or backpacks! And my friend was making a horse rider outfit and she wanted a helmet and there was no helmet. Please notice this complaint and understand me. Thank you!"
1755,GraceandL,"February 15, 2020",5,"Great! I think this app is wonderful! I love how you can make it to look like you. I do think that they could get a few more shirt options and maybe a dress option where you can make your own look, like how you get to do on the shirt and pant outfits. "
1756,PolkadotK_9,"February 4, 2020",4,"Good app but needs some changes I‚Äôve used Bitmoji for years, but now that I cut my hair, there are not really any options for curly hair that isn‚Äôt coils. I don‚Äôt want to mis represent my hair so I just end up using the pony tails, but I wish I could use my usual kinky curl, short, side parted hair, but there are no options like that (or even similar to that) which makes me dissapointed."
1757,L8872,"November 19, 2019",4,"More personal updates I have had Bitmoji for a while and I love it but most of the clothes is outdated. They have completely stopped doing updates for the character accessory aspect of the app. I wish there were more hairstyles, hats, and more clothes that people actually wear now. Clothing store like forever 21, Patagonia, urban outfitters, brandy Melville, and more outfits added to holister."
1758,Me so angry üò§üò§,"November 4, 2019",3,"Kinda inappropriate. I was so excited to get this app, but I recommend a few changes: First, some of the stickers have swear words, which I was NOT expecting. Second, I just want to be able to make a variety of people and be able to pick which one I want to use. My mom made me get rid of this app because of its immaturity. I would love it if you would just make those changes."
1759,Burroschmulyank,"October 18, 2019",3,"Keyboard combat on iPad Mini Bitmoji keyboard should not pre-empt standard emoji key and make it frustrating to get back from the unrequested Bitmoji keyboard to the alpha keyboard or the standard emoji keyboard. The last iOS system, 13.1.2, seemed to have the issue solved, but it‚Äôs back in 13.1.3. Otherwise the program has great graphics and is fun, but this problem is more than annoying when trying to do some serious work in the message app."
1760,ravemin,"December 2, 2018",4,Love this app but.. This app is great and so much fun to use on snapchat but my only request is FASHION!! more clothing options please! you should be able to pick separate clothing items and make your own outfits instead of only being able to select pre-made outfits. if you add that option i will say it would be a 5/5 stars.
1761,rebecca.m,"December 9, 2018",1,Why judge a gender I am I girl who is more into guy things so I tested bitmoji by making two accounts 1 male the other female and they are both completely different from one another. First of all the clothing choices are not fair what so ever because I want to be able to wear shorts and hoodies but they don't have the same options is both gender categories. So i would really appreciate it if you all could read this and give it a like so team bitmoji can fix this issue. This is the third review I have written
1762,Bit Mo Ji~,"December 29, 2018",4,"Too fun This app is so much fun.  Only a couple of things need fixed. My iOS keyboard is not giving me the option to search despite following the directions, which is unfortunate. Also would like to see more bitmojis with no words included. Otherwise it‚Äôs great. Bitmojis change seasonally to keep the selection current"
1763,hshshskfidjaieje,"January 6, 2019",3,"Few Suggestions I normally don‚Äôt leave reviews but here I am lol. I wish that you could have an option to choose whatever color you want for hair, eyes, and clothes (specifically hair and eyes) on something like a color wheel. Also, there is a photo option but it would be cool if it generated a bitmoji for you based off your picture so you can get the most accurate results."

The only thing that I‚Äôd love to see is if you can mix and match the outfits. For example, if you dislike some pants but you love the top, you can pick the top and change the bottoms. Thanks so much and happy Bitmojing!!üòÅ"
1765,üé∑üêì,"April 19, 2019",5,"Positive Bitmoji Review I really like Bitmoji! It‚Äôs user friendly, and they have a lot of variety of options for your character. Something I suggest for future updates is allowing users to choose individual clothing items for their character, rather then an entire outfit."
1766,Sammy.Lou.Hoo,"September 7, 2019",4,"Would like male clothing options for females and vice versa This is great, but I literally wear none of the clothing options that I‚Äôm given for being a female. I checked out the male clothing options and all of those are things I‚Äôd actually wear. Problem is with that, the Bitmoji looks too masculine in comparison to how I actually look. And vice versa for male stuff. If this could be possible, that‚Äôd be awesome."
1767,Anonymous User 122,"August 10, 2019",3,"Needs more curly hair options So i like the app a lot, snapchat makes it better.

1768,pomeranian2008,"July 17, 2019",4,"Love It but... Ok, so overall this app is fun and there is a lot of clothing options! Most of my friends have this app, and they wish that this app had a feature with braces. I agree with them, because I have braces, and a lot of others do!

1770,Violenthippie_meg,"August 4, 2018",5,"In L O V E!! Love this app so much it‚Äôs has more outfits than my closet. However, I wish we can customize what we wear instead of choosing what‚Äôs given. "

I will not be using them and I don‚Äôt want someone to send those to me! Thank you!
1773,basicange,"September 23, 2018",4,i like it i like everything except for the hair. All the long curly/wavy hair (which theres only 2 of) looks really weird on the character so i have to use the short ones instead also it would be cool if we could combine the outfits on our own like we can choose whatever too we want with whatever pants and shoes
1774,Lucie Kellum,"September 30, 2018",5,Amazingly adorable Bitmoji is a fun and creative take on emojis and short messages. It is also very clever that you can make yourself! The only problem is they are sent like photos so they take a while. Everything else about it is beautifully done though!
1775,0w3n630,"October 23, 2018",4,"About Full Access You don‚Äôt actually need to enable full access for the Bitmoji keyboard.

1781,FelicityFury,"January 31, 2018",5,amazing update! This update is actually pretty inclusive. It adds very many hairstyles and colors to fit everyone.

1782,theamandatastic,"February 7, 2018",3,"Missing basic search functionality and customizing options The editor and basic functions of this app work fine, but it lost a star because it lacks a search bar, and another star because it‚Äôs missing the ability to add a birthmark (a basic function that‚Äôs existed in avatar editors like Nintendo‚Äôs Mii maker for years). The amount of outfits is also surprisingly low."

The facial features in the new update are very based off of the original bitmoji style which, in my opinion, do not like, and just want to update my hair color."

But I really say that Bitmoji should start getting on it for the Fifa Jersey's of the international countries and also Bitmoji to send on message of each person's flags of the whole world. They should definitely have it by now.
1796,Happy turtles,"December 13, 2017",2,"MORE CUSTOMIZATION EDIT: The clothing has really improved but as for face customization, I‚Äôm still not satisfied. NEEDS MORE HAIR OPTIONS TO ACCURATELY SHOW WHAT PEOPLE LOOK LIKE. Thanks!"
1797,The Polmeister,"April 27, 2020",5,"Decent, and fun. Bitmoji is an app where you can create your own avatar, and it has a variety of pretty much everything. It‚Äôs preferably used to be your profile picture on Snapchat, and you can send cute bitmoji actions to people. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this app, and I totally recommend it! :)"
1798,TxTeacherGuy,"April 13, 2020",4,Almost perfect Two app updates ago the icon in iMessage broke. The next-to-last update fixed it. Today the most recent update broke it again! Otherwise the app is a favorite of our family. We have 9 phones and all have this issue after the most recent update. Please fix!
1799,Dawson loves this game,"April 4, 2020",4,Mullet hairstyle I‚Äôm digging the new update but I think there needs to be an update for the mullet because guys like myself can‚Äôt show how they really look because their Bitmoji can‚Äôt rock the mullet with them. I think you should be able to pick the length in the front as well as in back. Do this and you‚Äôll have 5 stars from me.
1800,Super Sloth18,"May 12, 2019",5,I love Bitmojis! Omg I just love using Bitmojis! A lot of people I know use them too! They are just so cute and perfect for all ages! I love how you can personalize them to look just like you! They are just soooo amazing! This app is also super awesome because it is totally free and doesn‚Äôt have ANY adds! This is one of the best texting apps ever!
1801,üôÉüôÉüòäüôÉüòäüòäüôÉ,"December 15, 2019",3,"Mix and Match does not work Normally I would rate this app with 5 stars but I ran into a problem with the new mix and match feature. I went to the support in the bitmoji app, but I did not find it helpful. It was telling me to tap on icons I did not have, and I did update my bitmoji app but nothing changed. I was really looking forward to the mix and match so if you could help that would be great."
1802,376458,"October 30, 2019",5,"Overall great app, but.... This app is great, it‚Äôs fun, and I can have a good time using it. Although, I am discouraged about the clothing choices. I am a girl and most of the clothing I wear is masculine, and the clothing offered for girls is rather feminine. It would be nice to offer all clothing for each gender, and not have to select out of a few girly shirts :)"
1803,Beeplees,"August 14, 2019",3,Good but needs improvements I do like it but there could be room for improvement. Such as not having the outfits as one and having them as separate categories. For example having tops separate from bottoms or shoes and outer layers. I also would like to see more accessories such as jewelry like piercings and ear piercings. Another body smaller than biggest one but bigger than the others.
1804,Christine Renois,"August 13, 2019",4,"i have a suggestion i would love for my bitmogi to finally have some EARRINGS in the new bitmoji style!! i‚Äôve has my ears pierced since the first month of my life and always had earrings in since.. my diamond studs have become a part of my entire look, but my bitmogi is earring-less and if it did have earrings we would practically be twins üòç PLEASE bring earrings to all bitmogis üíò"
1805,Chloeehorne,"July 24, 2019",5,It‚Äôs Awesome but I‚Äôm short Me and friends love this app! I use it a lot and I love make the character. So awesome and so cool! But can you make it so you make you height. I‚Äôm very short! It would be awesome to have a Bitmoji that looks more like me. My friends would say that looks more like me. I love the app but it needs some improvements!
1806,ü¶àü§ü,"July 24, 2019",4,More details I really like this app and I use it almost every day. But there are a couple things that need changes. 1)I cannot get freckles for my bitmoji without for just the app. 2) you should be able to make your own outfits. That would be a nice touch. The app is fine. Just those two things would help. üôÇ
1807,hdndncmdns,"July 4, 2019",5,Outfits I love this app so much and it is so fun to costumize my person but one thing I wish this app had was the option to separately choose clothing items instead of have them being outfits and put together. Overall though this is a great app and totally 5/5 stars!
1808,devil≈õs.√•nge≈Ç,"July 2, 2019",3,"Better Style Bitmoji is nice but I wish you could pick shoes,tops, and bottoms separate. I also with the outfits were more in style with different aesthetics. Also I wish you could choose the body proportions separate. More face options would be great to. And I wish I could have one half of my hair one color and the other half another color. I also wish the hair was much more in style."
1809,Te≈õ≈õ≈õ≈õ,"June 12, 2019",4,"Awesome This app is incredible in so many ways, you can use ur avatar or character and make it your own. You can even send memes or little messages with your Bitmoji to your friends and family to give them love or laughter, but when I was creating my avatar I felt like something was missing and there was, braces! So maybe Bitmoji can add braces too."
1810,redsoxpaty,"November 3, 2018",4,"Please add search bar Love bitmoji and love the app but it‚Äôs really frustrating to have to browse all of the bitmoji to find one that works at the time. Please add a search bar so that when you type, for example food, all the bitmoji related to food come up and users don‚Äôt have to browse through all sections and all bitmoji to find them."
1811,Miley what's good,"November 12, 2018",1,"Clothing options for women who don‚Äôt wear feminine clothes??? I have a HUGE issue with the outfits. As a woman who does not wear feminine clothes, there‚Äôs only like 5 options total for me, and all of them are not what I would usually wear. I wish bitmoji would just make all clothing options available to everyone, regardless of gender. I have submitted a couple formal complaints now, and have gotten no response. I really don‚Äôt think this would be that difficult to do, and it would make a huge difference for people like me."
1812,Chaotic Skullz,"December 19, 2018",5,Friendmojis in Messaging LOVE THIS APP! Bitmoji character looks so similar to me!! Love all the expressions and scenes! It would be cool if there was a way we could include friends in the Bitmoji comics that don't have Snapchat but have iMessage or even just text with Bitmoji installed on their phones. Think about that... Everyone doesn‚Äôt use Snapchat üôÉ
1813,Boomer503,"January 7, 2019",5,Bitstrips Any chance at all to getting bitstrips back? It was really a fabulous app which on sure many would find it worth paying for. Just a thought. I was able to save a few before the app went away and they still are enjoyed.
1814,hello0o0o,"February 10, 2019",5,"More unique facial features I love the app and using bitmoji with my Snapchat but I wish that you could apply more than one ‚Äúfacial lines‚Äù on your bitmoji, like for me personally I have both freckles and dimples however I can only select one of those features to have on my bitmoji"
1815,Sophia's garden,"February 25, 2019",4,"Love it but... I love this app so much!! But maybe you could add some dials for like body langht and that type of stuff so you can be more specific on how you can make your person. Also for the many people, just a thought would be to add a braces feature. This would be so nice for how many people who have braces!! Either way, love this appüëç"
1816,ELT09,"March 5, 2019",4,"Fun!  Share Friendmoji with those who don‚Äôt have social media! I love Bitmoji. I use mine regularly multiple times per day. Only thing that would make it better would be to allow Friendmoji to those of us who don‚Äôt have social media apps like Snapchat, etc. Also - more clothing options or additions on a more regular basis would be ideal!"
1817,Purple3212,"March 6, 2019",5,Love this app The variety of Bitmojis blows my mind. I can count on Bitmoji to find the perfect sticker. 
1818,Gabrielle Porter,"March 25, 2019",5,"Other Feature I love this app but I feel like the generation that uses it the most is preteens or young adults, and many of these people have braces. I feel that there should be an option to allow your BitMoji to wear braces just like there is an option for glasses."
1819,Darlinshea,"May 11, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs ok most the time I can enjoy the cute features of the app like creating your own look and choosing your outfit (although being able to select each piece would be better). My issue is the words, phrases, feelings, you can‚Äôt express because there‚Äôs nothing for it. It would be great if you could create your own when one isn‚Äôt available you need."
1820,Love the color pink,"March 25, 2018",4,I wish there was more clothes option I love Bitmoji so much I use it too much but the only annoying thing is that there‚Äôs not many ‚Äúcute‚Äù outfits to pick from. I wish there was many options to choose from. Or I wish we could customize what the bitmoji is going to wear because some outfits don‚Äôt match in a way! üò´
1821,TimothyInsane,"April 3, 2018",4,"Network error Every time I open the app, a message appears that says, ‚ÄúCould not load due to a network connectivity or server issue. Please try again.‚Äù"
1822,RobJr55,"April 12, 2018",5,"10/10 I like this app a lot I wouldn‚Äôt change it for anything because I like my avatar and how I can use the deluxe and have so many new options and make my Bitmoji more like me, but I wish I could add accessories to my Bitmoji like earrings and a necklace, plus they should add PacSun to the outfits that would be cool."
1823,Epamorim,"May 18, 2018",5,"Could these be possible? So I love my bitmoji and I‚Äôm a hype beast.... I was wondering is you guys could put some supreme, bape, Louis Vuitton etc another thing tattoos/piercings I‚Äôd like to have the ability to put as many tattoos and piercings on my character I‚Äôd like to be able to put the tattoos all over the body so neck arms legs face (sleeves, neck tattoos etc)"
1824,Annakin Laufeyson,"May 24, 2018",4,"Love it, but I need more hair and clothes options I love Bitmoji but I really would like more fashionable outfits and maybe more curly hairstyles. I have curly short hair and I love more alternative/punk fashion. Since Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt have many good options for me when it comes to clothes and hair, my avatar doesn‚Äôt feel very much like myself, but I still really like it though!!!"
1825,vcwalker36,"June 17, 2018",4,"Outfit options I would like to mix and match my outfits. Can you make an option for us to choose what top, bottoms, and/ or shoes we would like to wear instead of the outfits you have made for us already. I love how we can fine-tune our personal appearance, if we could do the same for our outfits this would be awesome!!"
1826,fucofffffff,"August 14, 2018",5,Outfits I liked the idea where you can take a picture of your face and the avatar looked like you I think you should do the same thing with outfits! Like if some one has a favorite outfit the can pop it on and take a pic and it could be like a oftd type thing

1828,Gjgbhijdsujh,"September 1, 2018",4,"Didn‚Äôt think of everything yet? ü§î I would rate it 5 stars but you haven‚Äôt yet upgraded the body types. There are people out there with more of a bodybuilder type body. It would be nice to have 3 more types of bodybuilder like bodies with different builds. Like a light, medium, and super heavy type muscular bodies. And then it would definitely get 5 stars from me."
1829,Isisqou,"October 25, 2018",4,"Search Function Love, love Bitmoji (although I miss Bitstrips!) It would be great if there was a search function inside the app; like there is when you use it inside Messages. Sometimes I know what I‚Äôm looking for but can‚Äôt find it the way it‚Äôs categorized. It would really improve my life if I could search and find what the image I want."
1830,steven's still born brother,"September 24, 2017",4,"Piercings. This app is great especially when paired with snapchat. My only complaint would be piercings. i have an eyebrow piercing and ear piercings. When creating your avatar, females may choose to equip a set of earrings of your choice but as a male i don‚Äôt have this option. But neither males nor females can wear any other piercings. If this was implemented i would be completely satisfied."
1831,Guitarlover221,"November 12, 2017",3,"More customizable! I use my bitmoji all the time, and made many of my friends get one too! I'm simply frustrated because I cannot personalize it to the extent I'd like. I find the hair options especially lacking. You need very long hair with a side part, half up half down, better curly options! If you could just increase the number of hair styles available, I'd be a lot happier with my bitmoji! Thanks!"
1832,Gnkhs,"December 7, 2017",5,Clothing Options I love Bitmoji and how expressive they are! They always give the appropriate response to any situation lol. The only thing I wish is that they‚Äôd expand on the maternity clothing options. It kind of makes us pregnant women feel dull because there aren‚Äôt too many options and the clothes are kind of bland üòî
1833,Olivehawk0928,"January 8, 2018",4,"I love bitmoji!! I love my bitmoji so much she is so cute I love sending her to the squad. There are so many options. However I have a request. My friend just had a baby I wish there was an option where u could make a lil baby bitmoji. Also if you could, on the group chats on snapchat make it to wear all your friends bitmojis can be included in a pic. That would be so lit."
1834,Antonio7218,"February 7, 2018",5,The new Bitmoji hair styles I think you guys should add a new hairstyle that isn‚Äôt there and some people have. I don‚Äôt know the name of it but I know it‚Äôs a low cut with a skin fade. I have a picture on what i mean but I can‚Äôt show it but you guys should consider adding a new hairstyle. But over everything else is amazing.
1835,mnlh07,"February 15, 2018",4,"Love my Bitmoji However, I feel like the clothing options could use some work. Maybe having the ability to pick individual items instead of outfits. Also adding more clothing options and I‚Äôd like to have the option to be pregnant without it affecting my clothing choices. Other then that love this app!"
1836,Dance Nat,"February 22, 2018",4,This app is cool but...‚Ä¶ This app has everything from hair to amazing out fits but one thing that makes me upset is no option for braces. First there was no glasses then that Changed. Now now braces. Whenever I would send a bitmoji to someone I barely saw they never knew I had braces and not only that but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt completely show me
1837,ladybug2110,"April 5, 2020",5,"Great, just some new stuff... I love making a Bitmoji, face, hair clothes, but why limit ourselves to that why not make a home for our bitmoji, having everything (items for home) free. Can add 2+ stories in our homes and more.

1838,Davidüòéüòé,"April 3, 2020",4,"MORE HAIRSTYLES FOR MEN!

I enjoy using the bitmoji app and including it in my snapchat life, however, i feel like there aren‚Äôt a ton of hairstyles to choose from. there are a good amount, however, there are only a couple with bangs, and they‚Äôre the type that less people have nowadays. if more hairstyles were provided, and especially with the trendier type of bangs, i would probably rate this app higher."
1841,#CoolKitty,"April 13, 2019",4,"Just needs one thing I love Bitmoji, and I use it for Snapchat, but I think it needs a better way of customizing the skin tone of your bitmoji. Maybe include a light to dark custom picker for people to pick out the one that matches them the most. Maybe I'm just crazy and I'm over thinking this stuff. I'm pretty sure I am. Just a thought to put out there."
1842,78430961538,"May 17, 2019",1,"Needs more or better options It‚Äôs an ok app. But I was shocked that clothes had to be chosen in outfit form instead of individually choosing a shirt and pants.

Also why isn‚Äôt jewelry an option? I‚Äôve had my nose pierced for 15 years, it‚Äôs weird to see something that‚Äôs suppose to be me but it doesn‚Äôt have a nose ring."

1854,123456 times bad,"December 14, 2018",5,Ya I love Bitmoji so much. But they should make more hairstyles because A lot of the strait long styles have a widows peek.

1855,Akeely,"January 8, 2019",4,"Pretty good I like this app. My friends and I send each other bitmoji reactions back and forth all the time. My only problem is the options for body size.

It just seems unnecessary to have so many skinny options and one for larger people."

1871,Kate.fusha,"February 9, 2018",5,LOVE THE APP I love Bitmoji! I think its so cool that you can create a mini you and connect it to snapchat and ‚Äúinteract‚Äù with your friends. I wish in the next update you can customize the outfit more. Such as add new items and mix and match clothing to create more of a custom look. Thank you for considering my suggestion.
1872,notsosupersami,"April 5, 2018",4,"Bitmoji is so cool but... I would give it a full 5 star rating but I really would like to see customizable outfits! Like we get to build our own outfit cause there‚Äôs a lot of cute outfits already made but I feel as if non of them represent my TRUE style. If I were able to mix and match, then it would be perfect and actually represent me the most."
1873,More options (otherwise great),"April 13, 2018",5,Great App I literally love this app and use it all the time. It‚Äôs very easy and everything is within a click. The only thing I would want for them to add would be more hair options (I myself wear braids a lot and they don‚Äôt have that option.) But otherwise the app is great!
1874,MuellerMan101,"April 19, 2018",3,Almost perfect but... I really wish you had more facial hair choices.. It doesn‚Äôt have my facial hair style (which is a short beard from one side burn to the other that doesn‚Äôt have a mustache attached to it) and it would be really nice if we could have more outfits and be able to make our own custom outfits instead of having to pick ones already made for us.
1875,Bobbi Brown Graphic Design,"April 19, 2018",5,"Needs a few things Needs a search bar, also wish you could customize the outfits more. Sometimes I hate an outfit because of the pants or shoes. Wish I could choose the shirt, pants, and shoes individually. Other than that I love this app. Nice that it goes so well with snapchat"
1876,Nat Geo Kid Fan,"April 22, 2018",5,"AMAZING! LITERALLY AMAZING! I really love bitmoji! Me and my friends chat all day and use bitmoji for the funniest things or anything we want to do with it. But I wish there was more clothing, and add more hair styles for people who have curly hair (me) and like add more bitmoji messages like for example: Ballet, sitting on the floor, or laying on the floor. PLZ add more cool features and styles. Opps, I gotta go‚Ä¶ POST MORE BITMOJIS!!!!"
1877,P_oligy,"April 28, 2018",4,"What happened a minute ago I think that the app is great, with all the various options for customization and emojis. But just a minute ago, I was customizing, the app lagged out. And now I have WAY less customization options than there was before! I have no idea what happened! But overall it is an AMAZING app and I recommend it to all. üòÉ"
1878,cspr224,"May 30, 2018",2,"Good idea, bad software I love using Bitmoji but the bitmoji keyboard in messenger is HORRIBLE!  When you open it it loads the previous page you used, then reloads to a suggested bitmoji page, then reloads again.  It takes 20 seconds to find the one I would like to use and by that time the the conversation usually moves forward to where the bitmoji is no longer relevant to the previous message.  Great idea but definitely some bugs that are annoying"
1879,krystaaalwithak,"June 10, 2018",4,"Love, but... I love this app and use it all the time in Snapchat, texts, and other apps. That being said, you need better outfits. Maybe let us put together an outfit or something, mix and match. All these outfits you guys have are getting boring. When that happens, this review would become five stars instead of four."
1880,EnuLantern,"September 28, 2017",4,Please add some new clothes and hair I have spilt hair and I wanted my bitmoji to have spiky hair but now I have to choose something a bit different. It‚Äôs somewhat similar but not right. So I think it‚Äôd be better if you add more hairstyles because when I had a different style that wasn‚Äôt there either. Also I think it would be cool if we had more clothes.
1881,Gromit from earth,"October 23, 2017",5,This apps great I love that it gives you a personalized way to show emotions and all that. But maybe what if you could create more than one Bitmoji and picks and choose instead of going through a re-inventing process whenever you want to change it up?
1882,jessybelly22,"November 5, 2017",5,"Bring back the superhero suits Hello Snapchat, can you guys bring back the super hero suits like Wonder Woman,  Superman, and Batman. I love those suits and I go to the bitmoji app and they are not there. Please bring up the suits again and see if you guys can add a ""closet"" from our favorite character accessories and clothes. "
1883,BananaSal,"November 7, 2017",3,"Needs Wider Varieties I absolutely love these Bitmojis but there needs to be a wider variety when it comes to clothing, hairstyles, and looks. I use this app on a daily basis and would give it 5 stars if CHRISTMAS BITMOJIS WERE AVAILABLE ALL YEAR ROUND!!!!! When are they going to be available? I do not celebrate thanksgiving or harvest, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. There needs to be more holiday options. That is all I ask.. for now 3 stars for being so limited atm."
1884,Auntollie2,"December 24, 2017",3,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong Don‚Äôt get me wrong the concept is cute. I love my Bitmoji i just wish i few things could be different. Instead of having few colors to choose from for skin, hair, eye, and eyebrow color you should just put a complex color wheel so people can customize their color to the exact color they want. Along with that having an option for piercings would be nice. Not just ear piercings."
1885,:) pretty,"April 18, 2020",3,"Am I missing something? I don‚Äôt have all the hair! I updated this and Snapchat and I‚Äôm CONFUSED. I don‚Äôt have the braids or the afro puffs or the different hair colors. Is there an additional app I must download for those things because why do some people have it & I don‚Äôt? Either than that, it‚Äôs a decent app. There‚Äôs not really much to it so you can‚Äôt really boast about how ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or complain about how ‚Äúawful‚Äù it is."
1886,Cartet Johnson,"December 18, 2019",4,"Good but I saw that I love love bitmoji and it is so fun to use while texting friends. as we know they just came out with a new update for mis and match clothing I like that and all, but I think you should be able to wear normal clothes and able to wear a sports hat but you need to wear the entire outfit to just be able to wear a hockey team hat or football or baseball hats"
1887,lahfnsogk,"December 13, 2019",5,Nice app I love the app it‚Äôs so cute and amazing but I wish there was one thing.. I really wish there was a place to take a photo of your face and it creates the Bitmoji for you then you would just correct it if it gets something wrong it would be so much more easier then .
1888,amdookie,"December 8, 2019",5,New clothes. Funny thing I was just about to write a review for better clothes and more so this day and time clothing. I went in tonight to change the clothes and realized the wardrobe has been revamped. Let me say I love it!!!!! I love fashion so thank you for the update! I can now express my Bitmoji to my liking.
1889,Alyssa Ibarra,"November 9, 2019",4,"clothing problem everything‚Äôs cool and all, from minor details do different facial features and a big variety of glasses and hats. why can‚Äôt the clothing choices be as such? the clothes are outdated and aren‚Äôt very modern. the maternity clothes have more style than the clothing options given to people who aren‚Äôt pregnant. don‚Äôt get me started on the athletic choice of clothes. i haven‚Äôt seen a single person use anything past the costumes including the jerseys, hockey gear, job outfits (army, nurses/doctos,firemen). it‚Äôd get a 5 star rating from me if i wouldn‚Äôt have to keep using a halloween costume because there‚Äôs nothing that catches my eye in terms of clothes."
1890,Hailey Rad,"March 31, 2019",4,"I WANT MY NOSE RING I love Bitmoji. I use it daily. But why on earth can‚Äôt my Bitmoji have body jewelry??? So many people have nose rings or lip rings or eyebrow rings or bellybutton rings etc. I understand not having tattoo options because every tattoo is different but body jewelry is pretty ordinary and universal. I know it‚Äôs silly, I still love the app and will continue to use it. I just want a nose ring!!! üòÇ"
1891,THE REAL DEJAN√â,"April 24, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs Alright I guessü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm a African American and I personally feel like they don‚Äôt have a lot of options for black people it‚Äôs mostly options for white people, yeah I know they tried to fix that by adding some hair options that black people usually wear but like it‚Äôs limited, I just feel like there should be just as much options for black people than there is for white people."
1892,Shewbies,"April 24, 2019",3,"Why can‚Äôt you pick separates in outfits still I‚Äôve been waiting years from them to allow when customizing your avatar the option to be able to pick and choose which shoes, bottoms and tops to wear SEPARATELY. I hate it when you have to pick from a whole outfit that chooses everything you have on in one pre-made choice. Please fix this Bitmoji my ugly avatar is tired of waiting jeez"
1893,o livi,"April 28, 2019",4,"Just a change Bitmoji is amazing, I‚Äôm loving it. I don‚Äôt find much wrong with  it. I just thought it would be amazing to have an anime version bitmoji. I think that would just be great. Personally, I have a lot of anime- obsessed- friends who would totally love this app if they could make cute little anime emojis of them. "
1894,bitmojisbomb,"May 4, 2019",5,"AHHHH The update that they have done makes it supportive for everyone, every race, every sexuality, every belief! Like woah, very impressed with how great this update is. And I‚Äôm so excited to see what my friends with all different looks make there avatars to look like!"
1895,nataliefforck,"September 6, 2019",5,Suggestions Ight I love it but like certain things could be better ya know. Like being able to pick and choose what clothes can be worn or more hair options also more stickers for the snap map like wtw and any plans stuff like that ya know all good tho just some suggestions
1896,mkatherinem,"August 16, 2019",1,"Do not EVER order merch from store I ordered merch from the store and it never arrived, yet Bitmoji/The Snap Store had the nerve to charge me in full for it. I asked for a refund and they refused. Customer service is so poor they kept saying my order would arrive but it was months past the estimated arrival date and they provided no concrete updates. Would never order again and telling everyone I know not to order from this store because they‚Äôll take your money and not give you your products."
1897,Lenna0213,"July 24, 2019",5,"More of an update idea Would you think of adding piercings? Also it would be cool if we could do our hair two colors but split down the middle, it‚Äôs called a half head (look it up please), & that would make my day. Also a few more goth or super girly outfits would be a nice add."
1898,hedgiegirl0817,"July 16, 2019",4,"Great! But I need the developers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This app is sending an emoji, but instead you get to make a your and send with the message. This app is amazing, but I think there should be a feature where you can customize your pet and have a Bitmoji phrase with them. If the people creating this app hear me out I think this app could be even BETTER!!!!!!!   ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1899,myfriendjusttexged,"June 12, 2019",5,"They have pride! Really good app, you can make it very realistic. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community I‚Äôm happy that Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt just have the standard rainbow flag. They have the pansexual, asexual, bisexual, polysexual, and many more flags. They also have pronoun bitmojis too! This just made me happy that the lesser-known sexualities are being included as well."
1900,Unicorn loverü¶Ñü•≥üíúüî•üî•,"November 7, 2018",5,Love the game but........ Love the game but y‚Äôall need to more hairstyles because people of getting a little tired of the old ones. The clothes are fantastic. Also bitmoji needs a BIG UPDATE Just putting it out there and and can y‚Äôall make a game where you can play as your bitmoji that would be very cool
1901,JayJay Laurence,"November 7, 2018",5,This is the best emoji app The details are great there are so many verities that you can choose. No problem with it at all you can add it to your keyboard so you don‚Äôt have to go back to the app and send I photo. You can also use it on Snapchat and I think FaceBook. I really recommend the app!
1902,cookieü•¥,"November 10, 2018",5,More Natural i love the app and everything about it but i wish that the avatars could be more realistic in the way the body form of a real person . Some people have different body shapes and i think that we should be able to make our avatar look more LIKE US !!!
1903,stop slender man,"November 26, 2018",4,"We NEED more hairstyles with bangs !!!!! :( I Love it is soooo amazing and I always use it. I want more hairstyles with bangs Tho D: There‚Äôs only two or three hairstyles for girls with bangs and we don‚Äôt only wear our hair down. We can have alien buns plain buns ponytails pigtails.

I really love it though! I hope you read this so you can add some more things to it because it would really help because I have a weird type of hair...
1906,smOPppy,"March 3, 2019",4,I wish they had another feature Besides the fact I wish they had the accessories (braces) for the teeth it‚Äôs a pretty good app o love how you can just design it however you want it‚Äôs really a good app I also wish they had spiral medium length hair for girls that would be amazing if they had those both I‚Äôm hoping them make them soon !
1907,Silly ponyüê¥,"March 6, 2019",4,"Add more clothing options I love this app so much! I use it on Snapchat and really enjoy it. The only thing I dislike is the fact that you can‚Äôt choose different options of shoes, pants, and shirt combos. If there was an option for doing that...it would be amazing. Also, I think they should add pets. Add cats and dogs so that our bitmojis can have personalized pets!"
1908,Minecraft Sucker,"March 16, 2019",4,"Hoodies without zippers please!!!! I really like the app overall, because it has a lot of outfits and other things you can use to really customize your bitmoji realistically. The only thing I dislike is that is that the hoodie selection isn‚Äôt a huge variety and they all have zippers. I‚Äôd like if they added more hoodies without zippers."
1909,dragonwolf10730,"March 18, 2019",3,"Fantastic! But... I love this app. It‚Äôs so fun and awesome for texting, but I was. Having some. Problems with it. Even when I turned off keyboards and didn‚Äôt all ow full access to all of my other ones, it still did. This got so frustrating that I eventually deleted the app. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think the aspects of it a amazing, but just please try and fix that one issue I had. Thanks!"
1910,10/10 pro,"May 20, 2018",5,"10/10 I have been using Bitmoji for quite a few years now and love it!! It‚Äôs perfect for those moment you can‚Äôt express with a few words typed on a keyboard. I have one suggestion though, there should be a Bitmoji of someone digging a hole and saying can you dig it."
1911,8675309 irritated user,"May 22, 2018",1,This app was fun...... Until I accidentally logged out. It wouldn‚Äôt let me back in so I changed my password‚Äîabout 6 times. Each time it told me I was successful. Then I tried to log in and it kept telling me there was a problem. I turned the phone on/off. I deleted/re-added the app. Next step is to delete the account and start over. Problems-since I couldn‚Äôt log in I couldn‚Äôt delete. This app has become useless. Please fix this bug or I‚Äôm just going to have to find a different app
1912,chachishoe,"June 2, 2018",5,Love the app! I have loved this app for the longest time but I feel like we should be able to design our own clothes . I am a personal fan of ballet clothes so every update I look for a ballet category. But still this app has helped me describe what I feel in one click . I appreciate this app.
1913,Mittomo fan,"July 3, 2018",4,"Need more Diversity in the Hair styles I see they have added the curly high Poof but I think the should add a slicked back ponytail with the curly poof on the bottom and I also think they should add Dutch braids because Dutch braids are really popular and so are the slick back poofs, I would be soooo happy if you guys added those hair styles to the app and put they hair dye feature on those styles as well"
1914,leahbutlrr,"July 29, 2018",5,AWESOME!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è i love bitmoji!! this is one of the best apps that i have on my phone. the only suggestion i give is to have a section where you customize ur bitmoji you have a create ur own outfit section. that would be really cool and i would really like it. this app is great and all my other friends love it as well
1915,Kylee Berg,"August 30, 2018",4,add braces this app is pretty realistic and it is mostly accurate when it comes to looking the same as you.  The only thing that I think could be used to improve the app is to add braces. I personally have braces and my Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me as much since it doesn‚Äôt have braces.  But other than that the app is amazing.
1916,spotty friend,"September 4, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs fun It‚Äôs good...kinda fun! I‚Äôm 53 yo just kinda wish I could make the moji to look a little more like me and that I could choose a pet...I have a Dalmatian, I‚Äôd love to have a Bitmoji of him and I together or at least the choice! I wish the hair wasn‚Äôt flat one color. But otherwise I like it I liked better about a year ago before you changed the moji characteristics."
1917,123kacky,"September 4, 2018",5,The awsomesst app This is amazing today I was downloading it and I saw that you can conect it to Snapchat and create your own character and design it in your own epic and creative way of style.

1918,d_bskinner,"September 17, 2018",4,"‚òπÔ∏è-üòÑ This is a pretty good app, but the only thing I would suggest would be new and improved search functions.

1919,jtg123546281,"October 17, 2018",4,"Needs more... I love the app, I use it for Snapchat and it‚Äôs really cool to use all the time but you should add the option for face piercings!

And I love the idea of giving the option to create your own outfit. Just some thoughts. Great app though"
1920,vdubbs24,"February 11, 2018",4,"Good, not great I love Bitmoji and use it on a daily basis and I love the addition of Bitmoji Deluxe for more options than Bitmoji Classic. My one complaint is that i‚Äôm Asian and there are no real asian features to chose from. I chose the closest features I could to resemble my own and my Bitmoji looks too white and doesn‚Äôt look like me at all. Hopefully the next update will incorporate more."

1923,Rosie Mac007,"March 20, 2018",4,"Love the faces, bodies and clothes need an update People keep commenting on how much like me my Bitmoji looks. The update of transforming you picture into a Bitmoji is brilliant. The reason I‚Äôm giving this 4 stars is that the lack of body diversity is frankly offensive. I feel like the options are skinny or swallowed a bowling ball. You can do so much better. And the clothes are too basic."
1924,Nahlassissy1999,"March 24, 2018",5,"ü§Øü§Øü§Ø I promise you I did not see this update coming.

Thank you Thank you Thank you"
1925,britmoji,"April 11, 2018",4,"Cool app, few suggestions Love bitmojis! A few suggestions for eventual updates. You should allow people to connect with other people while actually IN the bitmoji app so we can also have friendmojis outside of Snapchat!

1929,99FdT99,"May 15, 2018",4,Additions The app is amazing I‚Äôve been using it for almost a year and I would love to suggest adding some new stuff. Like tattoos and some chains and accessories.

1930,sladelove,"September 16, 2017",5,"Love it ... needs more options Love this app, I agree with others that a color wheel with different skin tones would work better and I personally wear black scrubs so I'd love to see more options with clothing maybe picking separate tops, bottoms, hairstyles etc to create more custom looks.

Maybe add some purses and separate shoes üë†!!!
1934,Lahoma aka La La,"November 24, 2017",3,"Special Bitmoji I LOVE this app. BUT, I am upset that all the extra packs have been completely removed. Why were the Alice in Wonderland Bitmoji‚Äôs removed, then there were the Game of Thrones and the rest of the packs recently removed. Are you going to bring them back???

That‚Äôs the only reason I use this app; after I change my bitmoij‚Äôs look I delete the app because it seems like wasted space you can you for large documents you may have. Also can there be more hairstyles and complexions because it‚Äôs very limited bc what if you have none of the hairstyles that are giving and what do you do if they don't have your skin complexion.?
1940,Make more things available!!!,"September 12, 2017",4,"Add more I love my bitmoji but I'd love to do a lot more!

I myself am in the military so I have my Bit in uniform, but as a female there aren‚Äôt accurate hair styles to go with a uniform... it would be great to have hairstyles(low buns, etc.)  that fit with the military uniform. But all in all love the app."
1944,ceasl,"January 19, 2020",4,Awesome but I don‚Äôt like the need for Snapchat to have friends in stickers! I love everything except I didn‚Äôt like how you could only use the friends setting if you have Snapchat. Some people aren‚Äôt allowed to have that!! Could you make it so it collaborates with contacts instead?? Other than that it‚Äôs a great app!!

1946,comajuice,"December 5, 2019",4,"Great..but I love using bitmoji when on Snapchat, my boyfriend and I will usually send something cute. However, it doesn‚Äôt look too much like me because there aren‚Äôt enough curly hair options (by this, I mean curl pattern and bangs). I also have tons of facial piercings! Maybe if you could add some earrings (I have stretched lobes), eyebrow, nose, lip, and cheek, that would be fantastic!"

The clothes section is great but it is also quite bland. Other than those key items, the app is wonderful"

There are multiple apps that are dirty jokes, episode...etc. I really need ypu to fix this, maybe set age limits to where a child cannot see all of the stuff I unfortunately had to see.

I‚Äôm athletic do I don‚Äôt want rly short shorts like u have. It is annoying the boys get way more athletic clothes. It is like u think girls aren‚Äôt that athletic. Just keep this in mind. Thx"

1967,ajenkins26,"January 28, 2019",4,Outfits Great app! I love it! Use Bitmoji everyday but wish my character had more lesbian or gender neutral clothes to choose from. Or be able to choose guys clothing. Would make me feel like i look more like me and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only person. With lesbians who dress like guys or people who are trans or non-binary would like a variety to choose from.

I am still waiting to find one that resembles my hair!"
1970,lolgirl47,"June 9, 2018",5,I Love It Bitmoji is such a fun way to send messages to your friends or family. I have no concerns with it just a suggestion. Can you add an update so we can create our own  messages / stickers?? And so we could post

1975,PRgirl.wanda,"August 26, 2018",5,Awesome fun!!! Love this app!

1977,ally porter,"October 10, 2018",5,More options I think that you guys should make an option where you can create your own outfit and can lose and choose the style because it would be more fun for everyone to make their own
1978,The Snazzy Tiger,"October 24, 2018",5,"Recommendation Love the app and new update bitmojis, but maybe we could sneak in a braves feature? There could be colors for bottom top, or a choice of bottom braces, top, or both. I‚Äôm sure this has been requested many times and would add new depth into personalization. Thanks for the great work!"
1979,cpw09742,"November 6, 2018",5,"Love it! But have a few suggestions... I've loved Bitmoji since I downloaded it. But I have a request. Can you add a two-color eye option?

1983,VideoCritics,"February 18, 2018",3,"Good app but should think about men and women of service This is a great app and I use it all the time. I just wish it could have more options for the men and women of service. It only has two military outfits that could fit Amy, Air Force, or Marines. But has left out the Navy and the coast guard. Or have out fits that have flight suites either. I just feel it should have done more options for that"

1987,Jejdkwjdmdo,"April 16, 2018",4,More fashion please I loveeee this app especially on snapchat. I really wish there was more glasses options though. Not everyone wears just black square glasses. I wear pinkish square glasses and i can‚Äôt find anything to match it. The fashion choices aren‚Äôt the cutest either and I wish there was a little more outfits then crop tops for girls. Im a young middle schooler so I don‚Äôt really wear any crop tops...
1988,ayyyyyeeeeeee2194,"May 13, 2018",4,i wish I love this app honestly but i think that we should be able to pick out outfits. Like have tops them bottoms and shoes not the prematched outfits. I‚Äôd also like more hairstyles. My hair is usually up in a bun but none of the bun like styles look anything but opposite of me so i just go with straight hair. Bitmoji please add these things and don‚Äôt disappoint us like snapchat
1989,Tat-wolf,"May 25, 2018",5,"Braces? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs lots of girls and boys out there who want to look just like their bitmoji, so naturally, we should have the option for braces!

1994,#liveforjesus6,"November 1, 2017",1,"Not Really... I love this app to death!!!! The one thing I don‚Äôt like is that when you want to get your Bitmojis on your  device in messages you have to allow full access. I know that doesn‚Äôt sound like at bad thing but when I went to do it in settings it said that whoever created Bitmoji could look at my address, phone number, credit card number, and more important information.

1997,0C Realtor,"February 8, 2018",4,Nice options The new options make for a more realistic avatar but my one disappointment is the mouth is huge and unattractive in all the laughing or smiling options.

2000,Stella._.bruhh,"April 25, 2020",5,"Great app! But could use some more options. I love this app, but can you please make something with stars? Maybe a star in the bit jojo selfie on Snapchat?

2002,KiwiDogü•ùüê∂,"April 11, 2020",4,Pretty good So all in all it‚Äôs a great game but you should have a section for dresses.

2008,Kate895,"December 11, 2019",5,UPDATE Loving the new mix and match feature. It was very exciting to see that the clothing range has expanded.

The character customizer is great, but as someone who isn't a boy or girl and tends to switch a lot between masculine and feminine fashion, I feel like the clothing is lackluster?? The fact that you have to put in a binary gender that you can't switch out of is bad enough, but the lack of clothes for males is REALLY telling. Guys can wear skirts and dresses too!!

I am about to get them in 3 weeks and I want my bitmoji to have them, they don‚Äôt need to be like detailed and stuff just braces! Other than that it is super fun! I like the app a lot better with the new outfits!!! Thanks for reading!"
2019,85bboy,"June 15, 2019",4,"My review I would give it five stars but when I downloaded it and started playing around with my avatar and texting my friends with it it was fun but for some reason on my texting stickers it wasn‚Äôt there. So I tried downloading it‚Äôs again and again but it‚Äôs won‚Äôt work, maybe next time :("
2020,kteairn,"February 6, 2018",4,"Awesome avatar app! The new fresh looks you have updated for 2018 was an awesome new change! Props to you guys for that, it‚Äôs been a long time coming üëèüèæ. BUT... what needs to happen next is to be able to customize my bitmoji‚Äôs outfit, I don‚Äôt always like the preset outfits you guys have available. More customization would be freaking awesome!"
2021,BecBec29,"February 12, 2018",5,Love love love I love using my bitmoji!! Especially the deluxe!! Wish Snapchat could catch up to it though. You can play with the deluxe like you can the classic. Also wish we could get some new outfits soon. It‚Äôs been awhile since they have update them. I use my bitmoji everyday!!!!!
2022,A sunshiner,"February 18, 2018",4,"Great... but This is a great app. I use it all the time on Snapchat when I‚Äôm sending emotions to my friends. It‚Äôs also fun to free and customize your own personal character. However, they just can‚Äôt seem to get my hair right. It‚Äôs parted down the middle, with the front pulled back to both sides. If they can get that, then it would be a 5/5."
2023,#preggoprobs,"February 26, 2018",4,"Maternity I love using bitmoji, but now that I'm pregnant, there are extremely limited options and they aren't even cute. I feel like none of them are anywhere close to anything that's life-like (have y'all seen what pregnant women look like?). Please add more preggo options...that's really my only dislike otherwise I would give 5 stars."
2024,Blue grass,"April 8, 2018",4,New Outfits! i love this app as i use it everyday but i wish there were new outfits. you should put a high school edition outfits where there are cheer uniforms and sport uniforms that you can customize to your schools colors. that might sound really extra but i think it would be really cool. Also more outfits in general would be good.
2025,FujAivfkusckffjjj,"April 17, 2018",4,"Put Bitmoji here This app is great, especially because it has your looks and has expressions to reflect your personality, and it doesn't hurt to work seamlessly with Snapchat. It has great expressions like ""I want to die,"" which is hard to explain in emoji and boring to explain in words. I'm holding back the fifth star because the asymmetrical haircuts only go to one side."
2026,ratSAluoSyrev3,"June 11, 2018",5,"So great!! Would love more clothes options!! I love bitmoji and I love updating how mine looks!! But I wish there were more outfit choices!!

THANK YOU!"

Can you add an update to bitmoji to let us create our own outfits or accessories. I love this app but the outfits aren't my style. I'm a girl but I like guy clothes. Plz add that update to this app. I love it so much
2032,BrowMaddie,"November 1, 2017",1,"Keyboard Issues Yes bitmojis are fun, but I cannot stand when the app glitches on my keyboard on my text messaging app. It's so annoying when I am trying to type out a message and want to use an emoji but I get taken to the Bitmoji keyboard instead. After the bitmoji keyboard is pulled up, it takes forever to go away and sometimes messes up my keyboard that I have to turn my phone on and off to get it to go away. So please fix this problem because there's no reason for this app to be screwing up my keyboard."
2033,Atxmob,"January 13, 2018",2,App has no search and no preview After a glitchy (crash crash crash) first attempt to make the avatar I was finally able to. But then found the app has no search function (only keyboard does) and no full size preview of the image you select within the app. Not everyone wants to use this as a keyboard only and these failures make it less user friendly and less fun. Might delete cuz it's annoying.
2034,Pizzapooplover,"January 22, 2018",5,Bring Batman and Superman outfits back! Love the app it‚Äôs amazing I also use these cool stickers! App works perfectly fine as well.

2035,Sarahh_K,"February 1, 2018",5,"New update This new update is so amazing it‚Äôs awesome that y‚Äôall finally added in more diverse skin types and hair colors plus the makeup!

2036,vsco_girl15106,"April 25, 2020",5,Perfect Hi I really love this app it‚Äôs really fun but one thing I don‚Äôt enjoy that much is when you are dressing up your character there are no decorations on the tops and other so maybe if you gotta could please and a few designs to the tops it would make this app absolutely perfect
2037,Pasty/Martha,"April 8, 2020",2,One Complaint Overall I think this is a fun app and a cute idea. The only thing i have a problem with is their options for hair. I have curly hair and there was only one option that i could of used to look like my hair but it doesn‚Äôt even look like my hair. You either have to chose one that has really tight curls or wazy curls. Also curly hair isn‚Äôt always frizzy and I feel like they aren‚Äôt representing what curly hair actually looks like.
2038,nerdymom331,"April 1, 2020",4,"More accessory options I love my Bitmoji app, but I do wish there were more accessory options. Like different colors for glasses, jewelry (including facial piercings), and maybe even tattoos (generic ones even). Some of us are a bit more ‚Äúdecorated‚Äù than others, and I feel that would better reflect who I am. Just a thought."

2040,Bshsjgdhh,"December 22, 2018",5,"Merch I love this app and use it all the time. The one issue I have had is when I go to look at the merch and see what I like on a phone case for example, it doesn‚Äôt have the correct clothes I have on when I send text. But other than that this game is great."
2041,americanbeautie,"January 9, 2019",5,Fashion Can we have more outfits to pick from? Or more updated fashions? I liked some of the ones you had in the past. I would really enjoy more of a variety of types of fashions too not the same outfit in different colors. Please + Thank you!
2042,thatonekeed,"April 1, 2019",3,"More options! I love using the bimoji app! When I went into the app to edit my Bitmoji, the girl did not have clothes that I would wear on a day to day, like the boy would if you chose that. I would recommend updating so the girls can have more gender neutral for the girls out there who don‚Äôt wear clothes like the dresses. "
2043,bluehairedmomma,"April 30, 2019",5,"I love Bitmoji I love being able to customize my Bitmoji. I have one problem with the customizations though, the body shapes. I am full figured.

2045,#privacyvalued,"November 13, 2019",2,Access to my personal information no thanks I would use this app all the time but I don‚Äôt like my personal info and habits and contacts being a requirement.

2046,gymnast100%#loveit,"September 25, 2019",4,I rate Bitmoji this because 2 reasons here peeps one I üíï Bitmoji but I just wish there was a clothes üß• option for like your city. Or like if you live in like Canada üá®üá¶ or Florida üêä you could get like a T-shirt or sweatshirt that said Florida pride or like I ‚ù§Ô∏è Orlando.

2047,Kinsey05,"September 3, 2019",5,MORE CLOTHING OPTIONS!!!!! love this app it‚Äôs so fun to customize an emoji type thing to look like you! But i would like to have more clothing options.

2048,rowenaravenclaw5,"August 17, 2019",4,Just a few requests Personally I love the app! But my cousin is in a wheelchair and they have no options for a handicapped bitmoji.

2049,Tpeguero,"August 8, 2019",5,Finally search option within app! I can finally give five stars for the addition of a search option within the app! Thank you so much for listening to the many users who requested it!
2050,RayRay3848,"April 8, 2018",5,Needs a few things I love bitmoji I use it a lot on snapchat. But I wish there was better clothing items there kinda plain or just not stylish. Some outfits will also be very cute but the body‚Äôs are oddly shaped...and the woman chests are odd. Lastly I think there should be a braces option
2051,Picketton7,"June 8, 2018",3,UtOh I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for years and always liked being able to customize my avatar to fit the season or my mood.

2056,Kelsgboyer,"August 29, 2018",3,"Annoying Since this app always takes away the best stickers after a while, (like the game of thrones themed sticker pack), I don‚Äôt really care to use it anymore.

2075,KC Grant,"November 23, 2019",5,African American Male facial hair Overall very good app but for African American Men the correct facial hair is not nearly accurate.

2082,justjmer,"March 21, 2019",4,doesn‚Äôt give you as many options as you need i think that the app is really nice but there are a few details that the app doesn‚Äôt provide to make your bitmoji really look like you. for example: i wear glasses and they don‚Äôt have the color i wear and so i have to use a gray color which is not the color. i wear a combination of blue and dark purple and i just think that there should be a larger color palette. i also think that in general if the details of your outfits and face should have more attention because sometimes you are trying to look for something that isn‚Äôt even there.
2083,Zo-Bugg,"March 29, 2019",3,"Improvements I love this app! But I would like to see more curly hairstyles. I have curly medium length hair, but it is not an Afro.

2094,Saige.V.B.M,"November 11, 2018",4,"Some ideas I love this app and it‚Äôs like so cute and they‚Äôve added a lot of customizations but i think they‚Äôre should be a few more, like i personally have stretched ears so it would be cute to have a feature with gauges and custom colors for them and maybe more clothes cause the options are kinda scarce on cute outfits"

There needs to be more trending outfits (more Hollister, vans) and way more hairstyle üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è options and hair colors (maybe some highlight options and different colors and hair treatments). I hope that these changes are made because it would make the app so much better!"
2097,PuppyPower8781,"January 12, 2019",5,"New Outfits I absolutely love Bitmoji! I love the outfits and how you can customize them. It‚Äôs just a suggestion, but do you think you could add more athletic outfits for the girls, I love them, but I think that the girls could have more choices of athletic clothes. If you updated it, thank you so much!"
2098,DairyQueerSlay,"January 12, 2019",5,Lots of fun I love this app! it has so many expressive poses and stuff that you can do with the character. I like the customization option though it could use a few more things. Overall definitely worth the download
2099,Jess Amaris,"January 26, 2019",4,"Great app but there could be more options Specifically I‚Äôd like to see more hair options like variety in lengths and types of dyes (my hair is really long and balayaged).

I love bitmoji it‚Äôs an amazing app and very cool and good for making cool cartoony versions of yourself, but I really think they should add piercings to their lists.

2110,messem5,"November 15, 2017",3,"Could be great I really enjoy bitmoji but it seems as though the creators of the app don‚Äôt listen to the reviews. Almost all comments talk about more variety and there has barely been any change for months. This app has so much potential and is so fun to use but there definitely needs to be a wider set of options for hair, makeup, skin tone, facial features, and outfits."

2113,Ilovewizards63578,"December 2, 2017",5,Please Consider This I love the app. I love how you can create a person that is based on your personality. The next big update should be a face scanning feature. This would be a excellent update which you can use your face to create your bitmoji. Please 
2114,Lil big smoke,"February 8, 2018",5,"Idea to make it unique Y‚Äôall could make it where you could choose your shirt, pants, dress, skirt, or shoes.

2116,Aghtoin,"February 20, 2018",4,"More options I am aware that bitmoji deluxe has been added and I love it, but I think it would be neat if braces were added. This sounds kind of crazy but not all people have those perfect bitmoji smiles that appear on your screen. Plus it‚Äôs supposed to look like you. If you have braces you should be able to add braces :)"
2117,Lukup564,"February 20, 2018",3,Bitmoji Deluxe Not Working I really like the Bitmoji app and I was excited when the Bitmoji Deluxe feature was added however since the update to add this feature I have never actually been able to use a selfie to create an avatar.  If this feature could be fixed and actually work it would make the app so much better.  I use my Bitmoji several times a day.
2118,pcfmiami,"March 12, 2018",2,No eyebrow color choice What happened to eyebrow color choice? I accidentally deleted Bitmoji me and when I remade me there was no eyebrow color choice (1 was yellow golden blonde same as hair color-no! And other 5 were all  dark brown.) This is the same in Classic and the new update (I prefer classic.) This is a bummer-it makes such a difference-the dark brown is not realistic. Why have 5 choices all same color????? Previously I had perfect luck got brown/taupe color. Bad change.
2119,fanpuckidom/fanperidom,"April 17, 2018",5,"Good, but could use more clothing options As a tomboy that loves the boy clothes for the boy bitmoji's, im really sad the option isn't available for the girl bitmoji's and its pretty obvious why.

2120,GuitarTuna is the best,"September 17, 2017",5,"THE WORLD IS ENDING Okay now that I have your attention I believe that Bitmoji should have it where you take a picture of yourself, and it graphs your face to make it look like you and if you don't think it looks right you could adjust the thing that doesn't look like yours."
2121,Aprilllllllll Michelle,"November 10, 2017",3,"More hair options please!! i have ombr√© hair & Most of my friends have ombr√© hair as well.

2123,loveloveheart,"March 11, 2020",5,New update please:( I like the new stuff and all that but I feel like it would have been better if they added more ear rings and  jewelry and maybe a Nike slipper if that all right.

2124,Mother fitness,"November 21, 2019",1,"ALWAYS BROKEN! I have had this app for about a year now and I have experienced annoying glitches quite frequently. My first thought about this app was ‚Äúawe this app is kinda cute!‚Äù but it started glitching out, crashing, and freezing my screen up. It stopped letting     me press most buttons the majority of the time I went on the app. If this app weren‚Äôt so glitchy I would have no problems with it. I think the developer needs to fix some of these major bugs."
2125,c_moli28822,"November 9, 2019",4,More hairstyles This is an amazing app but I think you need to maybe add more hairstyles. I have bangs and I feel like you should make more hairstyles with bangs. You can also make more hairstyles for people who don‚Äôt have bangs but I feel like you should add more hairstyles with bangs. Can you make a hairstyle that is a messy bun with the bangs. Thank you.
2126,SodapopPeyton,"October 26, 2019",4,"All clothes available for each gender I love Bitmoji a lot. There is one thing to improve: nowadays there are a lot of girls that like guy clothes/guys that like girl clothes, but making your bitmoji gender doesn't support your body type, if you get what i mean. It'd be awesome if bitmoji added boy clothes to girls closets and girl clothes to boys closets. I hope you take this into consideration!!üíï"

Bitmoji is a really good app and the emojis are wonderful but I would love to be able to customize my Bitmoji more with the outfits.

2130,jojopeewa,"January 8, 2019",5,Really great It is so much fun to make a character it's self but to be able to text with it i love that it has clothing brands it cracks me up.

For example like the braids at top then sides clean off
2133,Friendscatdog,"March 18, 2019",5,Great app!!! I absolutely love this app!!!

2135,Allie could,"April 5, 2019",5,"Needs clothing customization I really like this app. I use it for Snapchat mainly. The thing that bothers me most is that you can really customize the clothing.

The Bitmoji crown looks so bad, It‚Äôs way to dark and isn‚Äôt flashy enough. I‚Äôm talking about the hat your character always wears not the Bitmoji ones. How can you make a good Bitmoji Bitmoji crown but not a good Bitmoji crown. This infuriated me and needs to be fixed ASAP"

One thing owners should make it so you can make any clothing combinations like a crop top with a skirt or boots. But when I text by friends it‚Äôs a fun way to be silly. It also has more expressions than regular emojis. 
2149,HelloJ√∏shua,"December 11, 2018",3,Well done I love bitmoji and all of its options and assortments. But I‚Äôm a girl who likes to dress more on the masculine side. Maybe just make it an option to be able to dress your bitmoji from the selection of EITHER gender instead of just limiting clothes to boys and girls. Because yes I‚Äôm a girl but all of the clothes are very feminine and I rarely dress like that. So that would be my only suggestion. Great job overall!
2150,Jay Jay Charles,"March 9, 2018",5,"Awesome app but.... This app makes texting so easy. It is a good way to express yourself.

Next the hair also needs a dragable bar for the length, this problem doesn‚Äôt bother me nearly as much. Over all it‚Äôs a good app but it needs some work."
2172,altoinsomniac,"December 12, 2019",5,"New Feature I liked Bitmoji, but now with the mix and match feature I absolutely LOVE Bitmoji! It‚Äôs so fun creating different outfits and the color choices are amazing. I‚Äôd just like more sock options, for knee highs and over the knee socks but otherwise I absolutely love the new feature!"
2173,Kerishia Marie weltne:),"November 11, 2019",3,Love love But.... I absolutely love this app and I love the fact that you know we are able to create our characters and everything but I personally feel like we should have more options with the clothing and I think we should be able to switch it up as in being able to wear one shirt and changing the pants that come with it.
2174,McDsammy,"October 10, 2019",4,"Suggestions I really enjoy this app. I love to use it to show my friends I feel about specific things. One thing I would add though is tattoos. Maybe start with a few. One of the side of the arm, another one covering the whole arm. Just some sort of tattoos people can put on their bitmoji to express themselves."
2175,jtvshekknsveiqm,"October 5, 2019",4,"I just wish it could have friends in your bitmoji I don‚Äôt have Snapchat and I am not going to get it but when it says invite friends it‚Äôs kinda of misleading, because then you will think that ‚Äúoh cool I can have friends in my bitmoji‚Äù but you can‚Äôt. I was hoping you could add that not through Snapchat?"
2176,Amazing! üëç,"September 7, 2019",4,Amazing but could be better There are some stuff that could be improved like:
2177,Vicky Truth,"August 31, 2019",3,Please review this or answer this I really like but bitmojis I think it‚Äôs really cool for Snapchat and stuff like that but you guys don‚Äôt have enough curly hairs and it‚Äôs really annoying because I have curly hair and I want to use it but but there isn‚Äôt much for curly hair there‚Äôs only two in it‚Äôs kind of annoying but overall it‚Äôs a really cool app and a really cool way to express stuff in a funny way.
2178,$omber,"August 29, 2019",4,Please update It‚Äôs a great app but it‚Äôs getting a little old. Please include more clothing and hairstyles for both male and female characters. And please let us choose our pair of jeans and a different hoodie or something ya know? Instead of it being one whole outfit. And the shoes too. It‚Äôd be great. I‚Äôm sure a lot more people would use it more often
2179,Fitness Dawg,"September 24, 2018",4,"Great app, but I have suggestions -please read developers I love Bitmoji sooooo muchhhhh! But I wish they would make headphones and ear buds an option for headwear. Also they should definitely make clout goggles a glasses option. And lastly, I think you should be able to make your own outfit. Like mix and match shirts pants, and shoes. Thanks so much! Love your app!"
2180,lildmf1,"October 4, 2018",4,more outfits!!! I love bitmoji and have been using it forever! but you have more sporting attire then actual outfits! and the variety isn‚Äôt very good. people use bitmoji when the text and on snapchat...they even post their bitmoji stock their social media pages. please give better options for the clothing. thanks!
2181,APPRILLIA,"October 12, 2018",4,Link Us I have gotten my husband and teenagers to download this app.. it would be an awesome idea to link the Bitmoji with friends and family .. if we wanted .. so if my daughter and I are together we can send a text to dad with our Bitmoji hanging out in one pic.. if we would love to see our cartoon self in a family photo!!
2182,bballersweater12,"November 26, 2018",4,"More clothing options‚Ä¶ Haha I like using my bitmoji. But I would love it more if there were more clothing options. I‚Äôm a girl but my style is more of a guy‚Äôs, and I would love it if we all had the same clothing options because it would give me an option to change my bitmojis clothes to what I feel is really me :)"
2183,Nisha1512,"November 30, 2018",5,"New idea.... I love this app.. So creative and very unique, but what i think would make it even more unique is if we could upload a picture to our Bitmoji for the face, it can be very hard trying to create your own face and not look exactly like you lol.."
2184,Ad@m2020Eve,"December 7, 2018",5,Search I really like the bitmoji. The only thing I wish you would do differently on your app is have a search on it without having to look through every one of them. Like the bitmoji does in my text message. Thanks.
2185,SammieChaos,"January 4, 2019",5,Accessories The only thing I wish was different was that necklaces could be listed in accessories rather than defaulted with the clothes. I also wish there were a little more style in the clothes. Most of it just looks plain or awkward on the avatars.
2186,jacksn1212,"January 9, 2019",5,Great App!!!! First of all this app is amazing! It is so compatible with different apps such as Snapchat and house party. I think everyone should download this. Not only is it fun to use it has thousands of animated stickers! So funny. Anyone who has half a brain should obviously download this!üòÉ

I would recommend it to anyone. One thing I do ask though is to add more accessories, such as braces or earrings. Thanks! üòÅ"
2188,mahewscotin,"March 5, 2019",4,"More hairstyle options I love this app! I love using my Bitmoji when I‚Äôm chatting away with friends! I really wish though that there was an option to chnage the direction of a hairstyle. For e.g. I pick a hairstyle that looks like mine, but my hair does the same thing in the opposite direction. I think that option would be a great improvement!"
2189,missMusicJunkie,"May 25, 2018",5,"Pretty please!! Before the Bitmoji 2.0 release (which I love) my lovely little avatar me was rocking some cool headphones. Unfortunately the headphones are no more. I miss them. While I love all the varieties of headwear (cat ears are now my go to), if y‚Äôall could bring back the headphones I would deeply appreciate it. Thank you!!"
2190,kbm2,"June 3, 2018",4,"Eye color options Love using my bitmoji! However, I have heterochromia and I do not have the option for my bitmoji to have two different color eyes like myself. Therefore I feel like it doesn‚Äôt really capture the real me or how I truly look. Hoping to get the option to choose two different eye colors !"
2191,Jayden crupe,"June 3, 2018",4,"Teeth love this app, I really do but I have one problem. There's no options for teeth! Yes I know someone doesn't want messed up teeth for their character! For someone like myself I have a gap in between my two front teeth and it's my signature look! I would highly appreciate it if their was more options for teeth! Thank you :)"
2192,KatieAMaher,"June 28, 2018",2,"Love the concept but the bugs are unbearable Love the whole concept of bitmoji but I've always had issues with the app. I keep it updated but when I try to access it, either through the app itself or through others like Snapchat or the keyboard I always get errors saying something went wrong. It's so frustrating. I don't know why it's so difficult for this app to work correctly."
2193,Sophiebones,"July 9, 2018",4,"More options please! Love the idea of this app and the characters are so cute! But I would love more clothing options (maybe choose tops and bottoms separately), and more hair options! For the hair I would love if you could choose hair length/style and then choose to add bangs in a separate page, as there‚Äôs not a hairstyle that 100% resembles what I have"
2194,MGCG1,"July 17, 2018",5,Love it but I would love it more if... A few things...
2195,"Good app, but it needs more","August 1, 2018",3,"Recommendation So Bitmoji has 80% of the things I wanna say. But what it doesn‚Äôt have... well, it could be so much better in my opinion... if it had Harry Potter Bitmojis. I quote Harry Potter all the time and many others plain love it... if you added hp clothing/Bitmoji many would use them. Also, harry pottersbirthday just passed... in which would have been a better time to say this but... whatever... thnx!"
2196,desndev103,"August 22, 2018",5,Need more outfitsüò© I absolutely love having Bitmoji! me n my bf always try to match our outfits n have cute little bitmojis!üíï but if there was to be couple outfits to where you and your S/O could match would be amazing!!! Please update and have a category with couples outfits!
2197,‚≠êÔ∏èüåä,"September 17, 2018",4,"Ok But Not Ok :( üòï I wish that you could make more than one character. But, other than that I like the app and all the different kinds of clothes. Although, I would also like if you bring back the old clothes. And the accessories aren‚Äôt that great plus you guys need more options of accessories. PLEASE do better!!!"
2198,BellaStar48,"September 20, 2018",3,"Wish they would make a kid friendly version I know Bitmoji because some of my friends have it. It is great but i wish they would make a kids version because i am a kid and my parents don‚Äôt want me using it because there is some inappropriate stuff. If you do make it it would be great. Not super babyish or anything, just without the inappropriate stuff. Thanks!"
2199,Eeveeüê∂üíó,"January 23, 2018",5,K9 clothes Everything about this app is great! But I was requesting if y‚Äôall can make a K9 handler police uniform pleaseüíôor to put a selectional german shepherd dog next to the uniform because I‚Äôm studying to be a K9 handler and it would make me really happy if y‚Äôall can try to do that . Or even a hat that says K9 would make me happy üòä
2200,mgwizdala,"February 10, 2018",4,Better than before ! I like it a lot now with the update ! I will suggest thought to let me have options like freckles and dimples together xD cause i have both ! 
2201,Chinstraped Guy,"February 15, 2018",4,"4/5 No chinstrap Even after updating to the new and improved ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù edition I still found frustration in that there is no option for a chinstrap beard. This is all I can grow at the moment and I feel there‚Äôs enough of us out there for there to be a chinstrap facial hair option. Do not under-represent, do not discriminate!"
2202,Skynner McGee,"February 15, 2018",5,Clothes I wish there wasn‚Äôt a fixed set of clothing. You should be able to mix and match whatever you want. 
2203,üê±Kit-Katüê±,"February 16, 2018",5,I have a couple suggestions: 1. Let us build our own outfits -
2204,Meckila,"February 16, 2018",5,"Appreciate expanded hair options for POCs As a black woman, I really appreciate the expanded hair options (please don‚Äôt get rid of them!!!). There could be more skin colors available, but I love that I can take a selfie and it actually represents what I look like. It would be nice to customize outfits as well"
2205,Haduch,"March 7, 2018",4,Fun App even for adults All the ladies in the office have it and we used it all the time. Love the ability to change outfit and sayings seen to fit all occasions.
2206,UndyneTheUndying4060,"March 11, 2018",3,"very good!! but one thing bothers me i really like being able to have a custom avatar for snapchat n stuff but i feel like i cant express myself properly. it‚Äôd be nice to have more masculine outfits for the female outfit selection, as well as different piercings. i consider myself a butch woman and seeing the selection of outfits for women displeases me. making it so that you can choose what individual top, bottom, and shoe your bitmoji wears could make it more diverse in outfit selection. "
2207,piggielover11,"March 13, 2018",5,"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Amazing This app is amazing I love how you can reset the avatar if you want. You can make both boys and girls. I think you should get this app, even if you don‚Äôt text you can still save the pictures buy pressing down on them and pressing save photo"
2208,SophieSoph16,"May 7, 2018",5,Great! Few Suggestions: I honestly love this app lots and adore how you can link it with Snapchat! But I think it‚Äôd be so cool if the app was to have more common/popular clothing brands like Pink or maybe even a simple lifeguard sweatshirt! I love how hollister was added though! I‚Äôd love if you put these thoughts into consideration! :)
2209,Planet Zar,"September 3, 2017",4,"More clothing and color choices! There needs to be many more clothing choices. Plus, you should be able to mix and match tops, bottoms, shoes, and even accessories. You should be able to choose the colors of your clothing items, especially glasses. The outfit customization should work like it does in The Sims 4."
2210,Marci 1,"October 13, 2017",1,"Steals personal information This app was recommended by a friend. You download then create your own avatar. After that whole process, you can check the terms and conditions and privacy."
2211,Avalampone28,"October 28, 2017",4,More than one I love this app. I use it all the time but what I wish they would fix is that you can make your bit mojo and a friends or anyone else‚Äôs without yours being changed. You don‚Äôt have to do this it is just a suggestion to make it a better app. Overall i rate it 4 1/2 stars
2212,awesomeguy6666673829,"November 16, 2017",3,"Reform for the elephants I love the concept of this app, however options are very limited for certain things. There are so many types of hairstyles in the world and you, an app with hundreds of thousands of downloads, can‚Äôt reflect more than like 20? "
2213,Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1132,"December 6, 2017",3,"Kinda disappointed.. :( Okay so when I first downloaded the app I LOVED IT! I personally like the original Bitmoji style the best, but I am disappointed because the original has a very minimal selection of hair, facial features, and other things. I wish it had as much as the other style! I‚Äôm giving it 3/5 stars for now but if I see changes it will be back up to a five!"
2214,Stkush420,"December 18, 2017",3,"Diversity I have a huge problem with the lack of options to customize my Bitmoji to look like me. We need more skin colors, hair styles, body types, makeup options, Maybe even accessories like watches or earrings. I LOVE my Bitmoji I would change it every day if I could. You could add a color gradient thing for makeup, skin, hair, etc. so it would be easier to get exactly what I'm looking for. More customizing!"
2215,mskat207,"December 21, 2017",4,The choice Ok I love Bitmoji and the cool design to get to choose but I problem I had about one of your updates is you can‚Äôt change between Bitmoji and bitstrip and I‚Äôve been wanting to see what I look like as a bitstrip but I can‚Äôt do it anymore so please bring the choice back of changing your design every now and then
2216,sam_the_wam,"January 1, 2018",4,"Best app ever! This is the best app ever!!!!! I love how creative and original it is. I also like how you can Choose what you look like. The only reason I didn't give this app 5 Stars is because when you want to change your bitmoji, you have to download the app unlike when you change the clothings."
2217,Mat1030,"March 3, 2020",3,"What Happened? I think Y‚Äôall have done ‚ÄúTOO MUCH‚Äù Early Spring cleaning. What did you do with the Original BITMOJI Keyboard? Why did you delete it? Why not just add new ones instead of completely deleting those we‚Äôve become so very familiar with? What a disservice to your viewing community!!! You never heard the phrase, ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it?‚Äù Please return the Keyboard! Thanks. Mat54"
2218,vzdubson,"February 8, 2020",3,Great app but Definitely needs fixes. I have really enjoyed using this app but I find most recently there are so many bugs where it won‚Äôt allow me to type in the app to search for a certain Bitmoji. Sometimes the app even closes itself and I have done every upgrade imaginable. Really hoping that this gets fixed soon.
2219,Wax queen 2014,"May 20, 2019",4,Confused about what ‚ÄúFull Access‚Äù means I‚Äôm just confused as to what full access means. When I go to allow access through my phone it says that I am giving it full access to transmit anything that I type on my keyboard including credit card information etc.  but then I‚Äôm reading another part that says that it can‚Äôt read or access anything that I type on my keyboard.
2220,FUDGE,"June 1, 2019",4,"My favorite texting application this is an awesome app. when I know there‚Äôs a Bitmoji for something I‚Äôm about to text, I use the Bitmoji! a lot of my friends have it and we like to text with it. but sometimes when I try to open the app, it glitches me out. can you please try to fix this? otherwise, GREAT APP!ü§†"
2221,galestevens,"June 6, 2019",4,"Great app, but.. There are a lot of clothing options.. but me and my friends prefer to dress like opposite genders and I wasn‚Äôt able to find any men‚Äôs clothes and my friend couldn‚Äôt find girl clothes. I also think there should be more hairstyles included as well, but other than those two problems, this is a great app!"
2222,jordanlikesmakeup,"January 28, 2020",5,This is an amazing app üòÉüòÑüòÅüòÄ This is a great app but I gave this a five star because you get to create your own avatar but later on when I was doing my avatar I saw there was no piercing .I was going to put hoop earrings over all I think they should put piercings  overall Bitmoji is a great app.

2224,DixieWytch,"November 6, 2019",1,Blind Chicks View It‚Äôs understandable that video or animation description might be a little tough even in this day of advanced. But still photos & buttons aren‚Äôt! So to not go that extra step is a slap in the face & giggle behind the back of the blind. 
2225,word cookies is da best,"October 1, 2019",5,"Love it I love Bitmoji so much and I think it has some pretty cool emojis in it. But I have ONE suggestion, and I really really REALLY want it to happen; PLEASE ADD EARRINGS!! I wear earrings a lot and I want my Bitmoji to have some sort of hoop earrings (my family is ALL about hoops). I honestly really love bitmoji, but that‚Äôs my only suggestion. Thanks for reading! Love ya bitmoji <3"
2226,Lela2013,"August 24, 2019",3,"Cute but lacking The body types are depressing. If you consider yourself on the plus size, you can choose from skinny or Viola from Willy Wonka round. They could easily make them better with a scale to change size of the top and bottom half. You could also do more with clothing. Have a group of outfits that you can change the color."
2227,DAVIDJUNEBUG48,"June 16, 2019",5,"Good but a have a recommendation This is great app, especially if you use Snapchat. I personally just wish you could make a Railroader bitmoji; hardhat, safety vest, boots, overalls, etc. since you support vets, firefighters, doctors, policeman, chefs, etc. on this app. But keep up the work and hope you add more ‚ÄúWORK IT‚Äù bitmojis."

2229,sarahhbby,"December 31, 2018",5,More options! I love bitmoji so much but y‚Äôall need to give us more options. Especially with the hair! I love the new clothes and hats but you never give us new hairstyles especially for long hair. Other then giving us more options I absolutely love this app!
2230,Avalevi24,"January 17, 2019",3,It‚Äôs goodüòõ I think that‚Äôs it good but the only thing I do think like is that it‚Äôs not all like you can just add what you want. It get really confusing and sometimes doesn‚Äôt do what I want it to do. It‚Äôs great but you need some improvement like haveing you take a pic of yourself and you can what makeup you were wairing. So for now all you need to do is step it up a bit. ü§ó
2231,PrinceHairspray,"January 23, 2019",4,"Awesome! More Options? More Realism? Awesome app! Snapchat is way more fun! Please in the next few updates, add more options and details to make bitmojis even more unique :D it would help set apart everyone‚Äôs bitmoji, instead of having people choose the same hairstyle, or same outfit, bc they are all so similar, just different colors :)"
2232,Cat's pink hair,"January 24, 2019",5,Fun Love this the only thing that is missing in the app that I can see at this time is where you can search for things like you can do for a message..  Other than that thank you for making this.
2233,Vhavoc11,"January 25, 2019",5,"Great App, only one suggestion App is fantastic, has lots of customization choices, and has lots of cool photos. My one suggestion is if they could add an MLS category, they have one for MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, etc. Although they have one for the World Cup, I would love to still see one for the MLS with just a jersey and pants."
2234,Shannon.witt17,"March 20, 2019",3,"More diversity please I love all the aspects of Bitmoji. The only thing I ask is that you add more diversity in clothing, hair, etc. let us mix and match our own outfits and more hair styles, colors and accessories. Please and Thank you! Wonderful app over all. This is still a thing you need to do. The clothes are old, and you‚Äôve just removed the only 3 outfits I liked. Ugh üòë"
2235,Nirvana awesome!!!!!!!!ripkurt,"April 29, 2019",3,"I really like this app, however... I think there are so many inappropriate ones, and kids use this app as well.

I also would like to see customizable bitmoji‚Äôs."
2236,@juliannx1,"May 3, 2019",4,"More clothing options i like bitmoji but i can never find some outfits that are close to what i wear so, i feel like we need more outfit variety. like i wear a lot of ripped blue jeans but the only three ripped jeans that there are have a hoodie on and i don‚Äôt wear them with hoodies. so maybe getting more trendy clothes could be a good move on them."
2237,J_MAN121,"May 19, 2019",5,"Request!! Could you guys add more outfits, and could you guys add another tab in the editing your bitmoji where you can add accessories like bracelets, necklaces, etc. Also a tab where you can choose the different pieces of your outfit like the shoes, pants, shirts, etc.. Thank you."
2238,GIHANNA LANKENAU,"October 8, 2018",4,"Love it but... I have been a Bitmoji fan but I think Bitmoji needs more outfits and need some new winter and fall clothes and maybe when u do a big update maybe u could let us choose the shirts,pant,shoes separately and let us choose our outfits and make them our own. Keep that in mind for some ideas"

2240,tiajahyeaglin132,"October 14, 2018",1,"RACIST !! I‚Äôve been using this app for years and I have no problems with it except for the fact that they have a limited choice of skin colors. Everyone should be able to find their bitmoji skin color without settling for something they aren‚Äôt. They allow you to have your color set to blue, but lack ACTUAL skin colors that normal people need. They have way more light skin colors than dark anyway! Change this and a lot more people will find your app more accurate :)) !!!!!!!!"

2247,Christos Chrys.,"December 19, 2018",5,Search option First of all it has been the best sticker app since the latest update. The only thing I suggest you to add is to put a search option in the app so it would be easier to find any sticker.
2248,honeykings,"April 17, 2018",4,"Need more options I love the bitmoji app! I think it‚Äôs so fun, but the only thing that I don‚Äôt like is that i don‚Äôt feel like my bitmoji looks like me. It kind of does, I wish there was more hairstyle options, like a line bobs with bangs, or shoulder length straight hair with bangs. Other than that I think it‚Äôs great. Just wish mine looked a lil bit more like me!"
2249,Puppykitty03,"May 15, 2018",4,"Some suggestions Ok so I have some ideas for new hairstyles that you can add on. You should add two braids with and without bangs. Also you should really add some more styles with bangs like a ponytail, bun, and braid. You should also put pigtails again with and without bangs. I really hope you can add on these styles it would be really great üòäüòä"

2252,KYKY DA GOAT,"June 11, 2018",5,Suggestion? It would be cool if we could have rainbow outfits for pride month since it‚Äôs June because they have pride month things on Snapchat but they don‚Äôt have pride outfits on Bitmoji and I really want some so if you could make that happen that would be rly cool. Thx.
2253,Lilo57star,"July 26, 2018",5,"Love it! Represents my goofy self. I've loved this since day one! I use it in every conversation.

2254,kokale,"August 12, 2018",3,Friendmoji Linking Friendmoji to text message was an awesome idea. The problem is it worked for 2 weeks then all of a sudden all my friends I‚Äôm connected to on Snapchat disappeared from my keyboard & now only 2 are available. Where did everyone disappear to?! They need to fix it so it can work properly. No sense of have the option & can‚Äôt use it üòí
2255,Rainbowkitten555,"August 22, 2018",5,"Athletic wear I love this app. I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more, I just wish there was better athletic wear. There is only pants and jackets, for doing things in winter like or cold weather. I wish they had the clothing options like athletic shorts and teeshirts or tank tops. Like something you would wear on a run."
2256,_hudsoncapito_,"August 25, 2018",4,"Just add one thing Bitmoji is an amazing app to use to creat your own emoji person, but there‚Äôs on thing that they need to work on. I think the app should include features for transgender, non binary, etc. so they can have a personal emoji that can look like them as well. And the reason I say this is because I‚Äôm speaking from experience."
2257,LaydeeHicks,"October 8, 2018",3,Missing search option I loved the Bitmoji app... I would have rated it 5 stars easily but the fact that the search option is gone it makes it so much harder to find the choices you want. I rarely use it now just because scrolling takes longer than just sending a GIF. This needs to be fixed
2258,invisible_shadow,"January 30, 2018",4,"Love it I really like using Bitmoji, however I am having s problem whenever I send one through text. If I send one through text (not through the keyboard extension on my iPhone, but through the app), the category of Bitmoji I was on disappears so I can‚Äôt keep browsing unless close out the app and reopen it."
2259,emroseeee,"February 4, 2018",4,"BODY TYPES I really love the new update and love the app in general. I am so thankful that there is more hair options and just more options for everything honestly, except body types. it seems really odd to me how the body types go from 4 different types of skinny then to obese. There should be a lot more body types in between."
2260,Gvontung,"February 7, 2018",4,"Nice update but.. Love the new update! Now that we can diversify our looks better, now you all need to over haul the outfits!

2261,Country cutey,"February 7, 2018",5,i love this app but Can you please add tattoos. I feel like adding tattoos to our bitmoji characters will make them more unique and look more like the person they represent.

2263,Lily Evans,"February 15, 2018",5,"Suggestion So you can dress your Bitmoji in costumes and different outfits. I think that the costumes section is a little lacking, and that you guys should add things like Hogwarts robes (for all the houses).

2264,PrainTheWolf,"February 18, 2018",5,"I like, but... I like, but...something tht would make the app a lil better is if we could like design our own clothes,so like of we wanted to have a YouTubers merch or if you dont like any of the styles of their clothes u can always just make some of ur own outfits.

I think this app is dope... but here‚Äôs a couple of points that u all should look into... accessories, u should be able to pick the color of ur glasses and hats.. facial, u should be able to design your own facial.. u all should have something where you can type your own quotes instead of u all creating them"

2355,Pinknati68,"March 17, 2019",4,"Changes There should be an option to choose separate shirts, pants, and shoes. It shouldn‚Äôt be only certain wardrobes. It gives the user more creative freedom on expressing the way they ACTUALLY dress instead of what‚Äôs ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to what they dress, so i would hope the creators of bitmoji could consider those changes."
2356,Jusdon Dix,"April 16, 2019",5,Great but needs some cool updates I love bitmoji it lets me make my own little me. It is a very cool app but it is lacking creativity.

But overall I really like Bitmoji and please put into account my suggestion, thank you!!"
2409,KaitMcEwen,"January 10, 2019",4,Suggestion? I love Bitmoji for sure but the outfits need some more variety. I think it would be more customizable if we were allowed to but our own outfits together from the shoes on our feet to the shirts on their backs. They‚Äôre supposed to represent us right? Why not let us dress ourselves with out style?
2410,better personalizations,"January 21, 2019",3,Needs better personalizations Wish they had better personalization options because I don‚Äôt wear outfits that are anywhere close to the outfits the that they have! I wish they could let us choose an individual clothing item and not a whole outfit! Other than those small problems it‚Äôs a great app!
2411,Greekromangreek,"February 8, 2019",4,"Some more sport clothes??üò¨ So, I have Bitmoji. "
2412,COLARULES1,"February 22, 2019",4,"Good app! This is one of the best emoji maker apps I‚Äôve ever played. But, there are not much hair styles for short hair. Could you please make more short hairstyles? Short hairstyles without bangs...I have short hair just below my shoulders, and I don‚Äôt like using the same hairstyle. It‚Äôs too short! Anyways thanks and I recommend getting this app!"
2413,dvjudcbhtfhj,"February 23, 2019",5,"LOVE IT. one suggestion Sooooo. Bitmoji is like THE BEST EMOJI APP I‚ÄôVE EVER USED. But my friend and I were talking about the outfits. You should make the outfits mix and match outfits. My friend loved the jeans but didn‚Äôt like the shirt that went with it. Same with me or it was I liked the shirt not the pants. But other than that, I love this app"
2414,Dee Bethesda,"March 12, 2019",4,Love it! My only complaints are that I can only be in a picture with the person I‚Äôm messaging on Snapchat. I wish I could be with the person in texting too. I REALLY WANT THIS TO BE A THING!! 
2415,MorenaSxxxy,"March 19, 2019",4,"More outfit options I love this app and use it every single day. But it needs more fun, sexy flirty outfits for woman. We should have an option of choosing & picking what pieces of cloths to put on it. As well as more variety if hair styles-curly, mixed curly & straight etc. Also a birthday themed outfit would be great. And accessories we would like to add. Thanks."
2416,Kayleigh_753,"March 25, 2019",5,Five star! The only thing is I really want you to add a Bitmoji that comes up when you type ‚Äúnew look‚Äù so you can show your friends when you Change your Bitmoji other than that I absolutely love this app!
2417,Mango1537,"April 25, 2019",4,"Great app, just one suggestion So, I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for as long  as I can remember. I love the different options and hair styles! Just one thing, when you pick an outfit, you can ONLY have that outfit. You can‚Äôt have pants and that shirt, or a crop top and leggings that are from different outfits. Just a recommendation. Thanks!"
2418,lalunapack03,"August 9, 2018",5,"Accessories I feel like there should honestly be a tab to add piercings and jewelry, maybe even tattoos. I feel like it would make people‚Äôs bitmojis more individual being able to add those things to there little characters."

I have never have no problem with Bitmoji and. I don‚Äôt think I ever will. I definitely suggest to download this app it‚Äôs amazing.
2420,UltimateMini,"September 3, 2018",5,One suggestion I have always lived Bitmoji i think its amazing and everything but i have one request pls add more brands to clothing and like let us customize our clothes like a different shirt pant shoes like Hollister t shirt levis and vans pls add this its getting boring with these same old brands thx.
2421,Cgfufcgf,"September 25, 2018",5,Get piercings I like the app it‚Äôs just they need to get piercings. I have a nose piercing and my friends are always saying if you have a nose piercing why doesn‚Äôt your Bitmoji I always say they don‚Äôt have them my friends always say they should have them
2422,p√´r≈õ√µ√±,"October 10, 2018",4,Wish there were more choices I still like this app but none of the outfits or hair styles really go with what I would wear but Maybe that is just me and same with the hair but that‚Äôs the only thing wrong with this it would of been a five star if it were not for this

I actually really miss bitstrips cause I got that app on thanksgiving when my sister introduced me to it and thinking of it has got me feeling really nostalgic and I miss it.

2426,Lucky3993,"November 26, 2018",5,Love but... Loved my bitty since the beginning but the need for more clothes and hairstyles is real! Also need more festive (Xmas) clothes! More diverse clothes! Or maybe the option to choose which clothes to use like we can pick the top and bottom separately.
2427,stephanie moongirl,"December 4, 2018",4,"Very good...but outfits I wish you could choose a top and choose different bottoms because some outfits don‚Äôt fit your personality, but the bottom does, and you don‚Äôt want the top. That honestly is the only thing I would change...it‚Äôs great! Just know that your fav outfit might not be there!"
2428,Specialk2425,"May 17, 2018",5,more defining accessories please! Great app.  I recently just broke my ankle and as I was sitting here bored I thought it would be funny if you guys included casts or slings etc. as an accessory.
2429,iPhone*Lady,"May 23, 2018",3,"Could use some improvements... First of all, I love this app, especially since Bitmoji Deluxe came out. I really wish there was a search option when looking for Bitmoji stickers in the Bitmoji app, and maybe an option where I could add a sticker to a ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù section? Please read, as I think everyone would enjoy some new features."
2430,Silly Tink,"May 24, 2018",4,"Lots of fun, but... I really love being able to wear my team uniform (Go Red Sox!). "
2431,Ali Breyl,"May 25, 2018",3,Sigh I just want more options with clothes & body types. I feel like we should be able to pick specifically what top and bottom we want. What shoes. What color these items are.
2432,Cherelyn00,"May 28, 2018",4,Apple Watch Functionality Please Could we please get some support for the Apple watch. I know there is no keyboard but perhaps we can just have categories to select desired emojis to combat not having a keyboard on the watch. It would really take the watch and the app to another level.
2433,DivineZeal,"June 2, 2018",4,"Great app, Just add a few more things This is truly a great app, especially with the new and improved Bitmoji Deluxe. It makes the characters look at realistic as possible. The app just needs to add things such as a surplus of new hairstyles (such as waves etc.) and more clothes from various sources. Then this app will reach true perfection."
2434,Chiruli85,"June 28, 2018",5,"Great, but can we get more Love this app, but wanted to know if we could have the option to change the language, at least to Spanish! Lots of people would jump into this app if it could be in Spanish as well!!!"

Please take my review seriously and think over it ."
2436,Very nicr,"July 2, 2018",5,this app is great i love everything about this app completely. it‚Äôs so great and simply yet super fun. it‚Äôs a great way to express yourself and you can easily communicate with friends using bitmoji. one thing that i wish would change has to do with hair and glasses. i wish that if your avatar had glasses that they wouldn‚Äôt overlap some of your hairstyles. for me i have glasses on my avatar and i don‚Äôt like that with most of the female hairstyles the sides of my glasses overlaps my hair instead of being hidden. other than that the app is awesome and i love it :)
2437,maccval,"July 7, 2018",5,"SHOES üëü I do love bitmoji. Don‚Äôt get me wrong.  It‚Äôs fun to play around with it. It has many options and fun details.

2438,Mommy to ryleigh,"February 13, 2018",5,"BODY JEWELRY PLEASE i LOVE the bitmoji app. i honestly think its so cute and funny, and i use them way too much. but I think it would be even better if we got body jewelry, like nose rings, eyebrow piercings, lip rings, etc. a lot of people, including myself, have stuff like that and we wanna add it to our bitmoji!"

2444,The-Goof,"March 6, 2018",1,No Contact Support or Search Bar I have tried to contact the Bitmoji support team to provide 2 suggestions. 1. Add the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù bar to the Bitmoji app like in the iOS keyboard so I can search for a particular Bitmoji in the app if I don‚Äôt want the keyboard. 2. Allow me to do friendmojis like in Snapchat but IN the Bitmoji App. The lack of support is frustrating and lacking. So the ONLY way to contact them about anything that‚Äôs not what they suggest on the app is by posting a review and hoping someone sees it.
2445,SydneyDuLong,"March 17, 2018",5,Listen to my idea This is a great app and I use it all the time especially with snapchat but I think you should add leotards for all of the gymnasts out there the closest thing you had was a bathing suit and it didn‚Äôt look that good but maybe in an update add that plz
2446,Chaps Myers,"May 6, 2018",5,"Awesome. This app is really fun, I love it. I only have one question, I think it would be a lot of fun and really cool if this app had Harry Potter Bitmojis or other fun fictional characters. I saw they had Star Wars on there which is REALLY cool. Thx so much for the app! I always enjoy doing it with family and friends!!!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
2447,Loktug,"May 16, 2018",2,"Was fun for a day but lagged my texting I love using Gifs and I tried this app, it was fun for a day even though I couldn‚Äôt find a person that looked like me. Then I started to notice it was severely lagged my texting abilities, when I would search GIFs or search the emoji app it took a long time for images to load. On some occasions it wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to type in the search bar. I have a I phone 6S plus."
2448,nutmegtella,"November 18, 2017",4,"Missing Game of Thrones and Wonder Woman This is a great app, fun for all. I particularly liked the Game of Thrones and Wonder Woman costumes and bitmojis.

2449,Dean.787,"November 28, 2017",4,"I like this app just the way it is, (It Works) This App works Great,  even if there NO Way to Log Out for battery save. You all should be happy it‚Äôs working! The more you all ask for ( The more issues you could have just Saying)"
2450,Tidally winkle,"December 16, 2017",3,I like it but I wish there were more hair options I like using this app it‚Äôs fun and exciting. The issue that I have with it though is there is many realistic non natural hair colors. It would be cool if you kept those options but also had a color picker (like with the custom font color in Word) option for people like me that like to dye there hair an un natural color
2451,AHamiltonLover,"January 1, 2018",4,"Good but please add more hair options! Bitmoji is great! I really would like more options for women with pixie haircuts though :/ none of the styles are the right style or length for me. I think the app would be way better if you developed more hairstyles, including lengths and how you style them but also dye styles (ombre, highlights, etc.)!"
2452,AnnabananaüíÅüíÅ,"January 18, 2018",4,"more options!! i think bitmojis are AWESOME !! but there needs to be more clothing options, more body types to choose from, and ESPECIALLY more skin tone options. so you can make your bitmoji blue but cant make it a medium skin tone? im hispanic so obviously im tan but i have to use the darkest ‚Äúwhite shade‚Äù because the next darkest skin tone is just WAY too dark for me."
2453,Saphira176,"January 28, 2018",4,"An idea This app is really nice and being able to use it in regular text than always Snapchat is a good idea. I gave it 4 stars because I think that we should be able to create our own outfits. For example, I like the over all outfit, but not the shoes. It‚Äôs just a suggestion."
2454,JimberBabyTae,"February 6, 2018",4,"Great app This app is great, it‚Äôs added hairstyles and a different bitmoji style, BUT I wish it would add piercings!

2455,Insomniam43,"February 7, 2018",4,"Great, but.. Love bitmoji & the updates. BUT the deluxe bitmoji is lacking several facial feature shapes. Especially noses. I loved so much about it but switched back to the old style bitstrip because there wasn‚Äôt one single nose that looked like mine. Which totally changed the look of my bitmoji to where it didn‚Äôt even resemble me."
2456,Happysmilesgleegurl,"February 7, 2018",4,"Good but needs more options Loving the new update! Just wish they had more options for people with curly hair. I have curly hair that goes past my shoulders and the only options are slightly wavy or a full afro, and none of the curlier styles are long. Hopefully more styles will come with the next update!"
2457,Dog person 101,"February 10, 2018",3,"Please add this feature back I love bitmoji they‚Äôre super quirky and fun. But there used to be more customization of the facial features, like eye shape, freckles, beauty marks; however it‚Äôs changed and you can no longer do that. Making everyone‚Äôs faces essentially the same. The added hairstyles are cool, but my face looks identical to the next person. In an update please add facial customization back :) yay!"
2458,Bethanysea,"September 9, 2017",1,Can't change my Bitmoji I love this until I wanted to change the look of my Bitmoji then I tried to and all there was was a blinking face I couldn't edit it and I logged it out of Snapchat and into my email but it is still just a blinking face now I'm logged out and can't do anything when I enter it it is just a blinking face I can't even log back into Snapchat to have a Bitmoji and I also deleted it and downloaded it 2 times it just kept doing the same thing
2459,MCMIBNLESTON,"March 30, 2019",4,So much fun! In Bitmoji it is really fun to see an animated version of yourself and then dress it and change the hair styles etc. I would recommend having someone with you while you choose what your character looks like so you don‚Äôt have to keep looking in the mirror. Fun to send to friends for fun!
2460,broken map,"March 31, 2019",4,"Great but could add some more options I enjoy using bitmoji on Snapchat but whenever I edit my bitmoji, I never seem to actually get the CORRECT feature for me.

2461,DJtwinz24,"April 13, 2019",5,Great Arcade game added I love the new feature of games. Played it with my friends and had some good fun for a couple of hours through out the day. I would‚Äôve like that the zombie game mode lets the zombie only attack through the front
2462,Pikleprincess,"May 2, 2019",5,"Please add a few things! I‚Äôm surprised that they listened! I remember asking earlier for something to be added and later it was!

2463,kassidyk13,"April 30, 2020",5,Need more hair styles/outfit choices I love this app!!

2464,tearyfairyyy,"March 7, 2020",4,"Almost perfect With every update we get more and more customizable, but I think we need piercings and the option to add more than a couple. like offer almost every type of piercing but also make it to where you can layer them."

I believe a pair of sweatpants was the only option. Please consider making changes to this ASAP."

2507,bsloths,"February 18, 2018",4,"Where are the earrings?! Please bring back the ability to choose earrings! That‚Äôs my only complaint so far about the updated version. I love all the new choices but we need to be able to pick jewelry - if the option is still there, I can‚Äôt find it!"

2509,stylesofstraight_edge,"October 12, 2017",3,Please add Love the app but the hair color options for unnatural colors are insanely limited. Also it‚Äôd be cool if you guys could just have all the outfits available to both genders. My bitmoji is female but almost all of the outfits are way too feminine for me and the ones that aren‚Äôt are way too plain. I‚Äôd love to be able to dress my lady in some of the male outfits instead. Thank you!

Also maybe some piercing options and even braces :)"

But overall the app is amazing and super cool. :)"
2521,swimross,"September 28, 2019",4,Outfit options I love the Bitmoji it‚Äôs fun to use. But I wish the outfits had more freedom like an option to make the outfit our own or maybe a college outfit set with college apparel like there is for the NFL and MLB . Maybe an NCAA line would be cool. I just would like the option to have some more freedom and fun with that aspect.

2523,H.Lynn,"August 6, 2019",4,"Additions I love this app! I‚Äôve been using it for a long time, and really enjoy the quirky Bitmojis. One addition I would LOVE to see in the near future would be the ability to include pets. I have a golden retriever who is with me 90% of the time, and I think it would be so cool to create her very own Bitmoji to go along with mine."
2524,jstarlove18,"July 30, 2019",5,"Add accessories!! I love the app and everything it has, but I also wish there was accessories like masks, earrings, and more!

Honestly if they just add more braid type hair styles (Dutch/French braid pigtail) stuff I‚Äôd be Over the roof! Besides that it‚Äôs an awesome app
2527,aya.2362,"June 15, 2019",4,"Great, but needs more! It‚Äôs really great and can be used for a lot of apps associated with Snapchat such as YOLO, Sendit, etc. But it needs more. In the next update we‚Äôre hoping to see outfit customization with colors and highlights in hair. We also want to see trends in your hair like scrunchies. Other than that, it‚Äôs amazing!"
2528,Thatonedakotaguy,"February 27, 2019",4,Great app but needs better clothes I literally would not wear 95% of the clothes on here so my options are severely limited. A lot of the clothes look like plain weird. There‚Äôs hardly any clothes an average person would wear. Also maybe add an option of shorts with long socks. All the shorts have no show socks.
2529,random cake lover,"April 17, 2019",5,"SO AMAZING üòÜ I had to do a review on this because this app is awesome! There‚Äôs so many different styles and stickers to use,and it‚Äôs all free!

I would love for you all to expand the choices for hairstyles pleaseee! :)"
2533,12345reveiw,"May 9, 2019",5,New clothes First of all I love this app but you should add something. Make the app to where you can mix match outfits. That would be the best thing to do instead of having pairs of outfits. Hope you read this

2535,RBLSLDR19,"May 19, 2019",4,"Great app! This app is really cool because you‚Äôre able to distinguish your friends on SnapMap. It‚Äôs also cool because you can see how you might look in different outfits. One thing about that. You should have a choice to have a custom outfit. Even with Nike and Adidas. That would be great. Overall, great app!"
2536,Cup-O-Jo,"May 29, 2019",4,"Suggestion The app is great and fun to mess around with, although I‚Äôd really like there to be a feature where you can have multiple bitmojis.

2541,princessmadii12,"January 3, 2019",5,Hair Love the updates going on but can we get t to where there is a half and half addition and we put the colors? No rush or anything it‚Äôs just be a cool idea bc so many have half and Half hair but we can only use one color

2574,4902120113,"November 18, 2019",4,More Options I like the app but I wish that (1) They would add an option to filter certain Bitmojis (explicit setting) and (2) that you could create your own outfits instead of choosing from the limited selection. Other than these details I love it!üôÇ
2575,Dan2631,"September 11, 2019",5,"Love the app.... but i have a suggestion I love the app and the customizable outfits, but i think it would be cool if instead of outfits already put together that you have the option to make your own outfits (shirt,pants,shoes,etc...)"
2576,TopDog143,"August 23, 2019",5,"Truly awesome I‚Äôve been using this App for about 1 year and I can honestly say that it is absolutely amazing! Anything I want they have it, I can browse and send to whoever I want, my opinion is that it‚Äôs the perfect emoji app and I would recommend to anyone!"
2577,Hskylvr23,"August 16, 2019",3,Need more options!! Love the app however I feel it needs more choices in the outfit category. I have a hard time finding one that fits me and I would like to see more tomboyish outfits. I love to ride motorcycle and snowmobile and don‚Äôt ever see anything that fits in that category or my style. More choices in the hair style/ color scheme would be great!
2578,Cristie1982,"March 13, 2019",4,It‚Äôs different I love using my Bitmoji. But my favorite hairstyles are missing and I can no longer find the search feature for a quick find. I don‚Äôt want to have to scroll through the entire selection to find what I need. Only to see it‚Äôs not there
2579,Elizzacutiepie,"May 3, 2019",4,Love it but I love the app! It has a lot of great options and more the only thing it doesn‚Äôt have that would really make this a 5 star rating is having an option to make the bitmoji look pregnant. I‚Äôm pregnant and I would love to have my bitmoji have a baby bump! Other then that this app is great.
2580,Vivia elly,"May 7, 2019",5,AWESOME!!!!!! Just looking at all of the god reports l know I‚Äôm going to love it!!!!You have so many five stars‚≠êÔ∏è!!I can‚Äôt wait until I get to open the app and make me!!!!You were a really smart to come up with app it‚Äôs so popular at my whole school &in my family.
2581,Tasneem pixie,"May 12, 2019",4,"I really like it! It‚Äôs a fun app to use with friends to laugh and all that good stuff but I have one issue why can‚Äôt I use it my text app (iMessage) sure I can use other stickers,but my friends always tell to use bitmoji , so if that issue was solved bitmoji would be 5/5 but thanks for the good work!."
2582,PlantBasedBeauty,"May 12, 2019",5,"Idea! I love the new Bitmoji style!! I have an idea though.. maybe instead of the outfits being picked out already as a set.. why not let us pick the pants, shoes, and top of choice? Make it a tad bit more original.‚ù§Ô∏èThat would be amazing!!"
2583,Brownie Da Savage,"June 3, 2019",5,I love the game but just one suggestion...... I love Bitmoji I have had it for about a year perfect for Snapchat and iMessage!!! One thing I think they should add is Bitmoji gifs. I think that would be so fun and creative! Please take my Suggestion into consideration thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2584,‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è,"July 30, 2019",4,good but... honestly i love bitmogi im a huge fan of it! i constantly change her outfits and have fun w it. but i would also like more clothing options. for a long time at every update new clothes would come out and this suddenly stopped and as the trends continue the clothes become outdated. i think it would be cool to add clothes to the app such as fashionova or even clothing more towards the 80s style. even the hair styles for example could be updated to more options. overall i love the app this was just a few things i think would make it better!!  ü•∞
2585,Cikorte,"July 30, 2019",4,"Update please? Great but three things could be improved. One: the search feature in the app is lacking, two: you should be able to combine different elements of clothes to make an outfit/design your own, and three: please can we add pet to our Bitmoji profile?"
2586,KittenAlice,"July 22, 2019",4,"Cars! I would love to be able to customize the lil cars that show up on the snapchat map when we‚Äôre driving :) also, more skin tones, maybe just a sliding bar so we can chose the right in-between for us :)) anyways i love your app and it was a great idea!!! thank you!"

2588,Nixie_Quinn,"October 5, 2018",5,"Love it but.... I love the app, but I think that it should have the option to have braces, and they should bring in new outfits more often. I also is good partners with Snapchat, and I don‚Äôt have that so...... Anyway other then that I ‚ù§Ô∏è the app"
2589,Mimi_79_,"October 25, 2018",3,"App won‚Äôt open. I‚Äôve used this app off and on for a few years now. I like this app but after a while of having it, it crashes and most of the time it won‚Äôt open (please fix). So, I delete it. Also, can there be an update with new outfits?! These same ones are old and not interesting anymore."
2590,janeyg6,"November 4, 2018",5,Bitmoji disappeared from my iPhone I love this app. My family uses it regularly to make a point or bring a smile. Recently it is no longer visible as an icon on my phone. Is starting over the only option?
2591,CoinsOnly02,"January 1, 2019",4,Customizable Outfits It would be awesome if we could customize outfits by each clothing item so we could create our own looks that truly express our style. I like certain pieces of many outfits and wish I could put them together into one. Love the app!
2592,kaylabbpp,"January 7, 2019",4,"Sooo close to perfect, but.. App is so fun! Only thing is that the newest version on the XR won‚Äôt let me scroll through the facial features due to the fact that the home button is gone and the scroll bar is at the very bottom of the screen. Fix this and it'd be 5 stars from me."
2593,ImBeautiful143,"January 14, 2019",3,"Bitmoji delux I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt have earrings, that is such a common accessory for guys and girls."
2594,Pusheen_kittyCat,"January 26, 2019",4,"It could use some things It is a really good app overall, but, I think there could be a few more hairstyles. I also think reviews would be better if they added piercings, I love the app but I really hope you can add the few things I‚Äôve asked for."
2595,Aced12354,"February 3, 2019",4,"Love ( few suggestions) So I‚Äôm a teen and I love this app and it works like a charm!! Not many apps have as big of a skin range as this and I love this app for that!! However, I wear hearing aids and I think it would be cool if you could add those and like if you had specific things you could add them or something."
2596,A WAT WAT!!!???,"March 3, 2019",5,"Lovvinn Itt This app is awesome! There is so many good options to make bitmoji look like you! Although, it would be nice if there were a few more medium length hair options, there is a lot of hair already, but not that many medium length ones! Nice job! I love this app..."
2597,Flip-Flop24,"March 3, 2019",5,"I love it!! I use Bitmoji everyday and love it! I just have one request: PLEASE let me mix and match outfits!! My everyday look is a hoodie, flip flops, and jeans, and the closest I can find is flip flops and a crop top. The app would be even better if this feature was added."
2598,Msjlo,"June 28, 2018",4,Bitmojis üòç I love this app and how there are new bitmojis every few days to match what‚Äôs going on in the world! Lately the app hasn‚Äôt been working well. Can‚Äôt stay in one place to allow you to select a Bitmoji. A bit frustrating but I‚Äôm sure there will be new updates soon!
2599,Kit Cat 2000,"July 9, 2018",5,Personal favorite but... 1. This app is Amazing-so much fun to use in the keyboard!:)
2600,Queen Em1,"July 26, 2018",4,"Love it, but 1 small problem I love using my bitmoji to update my friends and family, but i have one small problem with it: every time i go into the app to change the clothes (which is a lot) it always closes out :( .

2601,guitarman1103,"August 7, 2018",5,It‚Äôs just fun! Shoutout to all the devs on this app and artists as well! It‚Äôs just really well done and a fun way to interact with friends and family. Even my grandma uses it! It‚Äôs super cute and super fun! 
2602,Angelina42881,"August 8, 2018",5,Friendsmoji possible for imessenger ? Can you make friendsmoji with imessenger like you do in Snapchat? It would be do. lol to be able to use friendsmoji when you are texting someone else who also has the Bitmoji app. Thanks for listening! God Bless
2603,nsijeeh,"August 13, 2018",4,Need another update I love Bitmoji.....however I feel they should have a better variety of body shapes. 3 are pretty much the same then it‚Äôs a huge jump to the 4th one. If it‚Äôs suppose to be us in Bitmoji form we should have at least a few more body types to choose from
2604,Person what will not be named,"August 17, 2018",4,"Face details I really like Bitmoji. Me and my friends communicate practically with everything Bitmoji. But I would like more face details like Acne, more freckles, skin features etc. I think it would make everyone look a little more like themselves."
2605,ineedanicknamewhy,"September 18, 2018",5,Download it now Bitemoji is awesome I love how I can use in regular text as well. There is lots of customize options. Only gripe is I wish there were accessories you can add such as necklace or watches and or add earrings and ear gauges. Would def highly recommended you down it now!
2606,Burritoü¶Ñ,"September 23, 2018",5,"I love this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I LOVE Bitmoji! It describes my every emotion perfectly! I like that you have the app, instead of just having it on there keyboard.

2607,Tim Goyette,"September 24, 2018",4,Bring back search outfits window! The latest version has removed the search outfits window to be able to go directly to an outfit I am looking for rather than scrolling through what seems like hundreds of outfits. BRING IT BACK!!!

2609,Blue devil beast,"April 14, 2018",4,March madness I love this app and how u can hook it up to Snapchat. And I like that they have nba jerseys bc I‚Äôm a big basketball fan but I like college to and I think it Wallis be a good idea to make college basketball jerseys to. So if the company who made Bitmoji sees this I would like them to consider putting these jerseys in there. 
2610,Bulgerfam,"April 14, 2018",5,"Here‚Äôs a great suggestion!! I love this app, I also love how it goes along with Snapchat. I think it would make the app a whole lot better if your avatar could have braces. There are a lot of people out there with braces and it would be a great addition."
2611,Martha EO,"April 16, 2018",5,Great app Really enjoy the app. My cousin also had the app and somehow she also had some Spanish bitmojis-they are great! I could not figure out how to get them. Can someone please tell me what to do to get the Spanish Bitmojis. I still want to keep the English bitmojis. Thanks
2612,Vi3tcutie,"April 18, 2018",5,"Need to know the tags/titles for the new BitMojis expressions I love this app! Great so far. The only thing I would suggest is to somehow be transparant with the new bitmojis. Meaning, there's a search bitmojis features but some of the new ones we dont know what its under so we can use it in the future. Therefore I suggest for iPhones, you can use the 3D touch to see the tags for the image. "
2613,MarvelGlimmer,"April 24, 2018",4,"Almost 5 stars! Love Bitmoji! My only complaint it‚Äôs the clothing choices. Although there is a wide enough variety to choose from. I think we would all like to put outfits together for ourselves. Being able to choose the shoes, top, pants, jacket, ect. would make this a five star app!"
2614,Cinthiaacx,"May 13, 2018",4,"Good but we need new stuff I love this app but it would be great if we could customize our outfit. Give us individual shirts,bottoms, and shoes so we can mix and match the outfit we like instead of having to choose one that‚Äôs already been made. Also, I would like for there to be jewelry."

It is super fun to use especially when chatting with friends who also have the Bitmoji app. I haven‚Äôt had to deal with any bugs or mess ups with the app so far. Super awesome app! I definitely recommend it if you love avatars and expressing yourself with emojis!!!
2617,Luckermarc029,"June 7, 2018",4,Needs improvements I greatly appreciate this app very much! But I wish it had the option to apply piercings and tunnels and such. I feel less like myself with this feature. 
2618,Angelgirl204,"February 2, 2018",2,"Won‚Äôt work I haven‚Äôt updated bitmoji manually in a long time, but my phone usually automatically updates some apps. So i was scrolling through snapchat and saw everyone was talking about he great new update, so I decided to ‚Äúupdate it‚Äù myself. I don‚Äôt even get an option for the update. So i‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúalright, maybe it did it by itself‚Äù, but when i go to the app there‚Äôs no update."

2620,Pig Lover 123,"February 5, 2018",5,"love new update! but needs new outfits I love the new update with the new avatars and hairstyles, but I think there should be more outfits that people wear on a daily basis and more outfits that are aesthetically pleasing (kind of like outfits instagram girls would wear?) but overall i love this!! :)"

I have my septum and my nose pierced and I would love for that to show in my bitmoji. Otherwise, I have zero problems!"

2637,Landonma,"February 13, 2020",1,Forfeit privacy using Bitmoji? This app cannot be used unless you give them ‚Äúfull access.‚Äù  Go into your settings and click on Bitmoji.  You will see what it means to grant Bitmoji ‚Äúfull access.‚Äù  This app was a winner with friends/family until I read that.  When you turn off full access the app cannot be used.  By the way I never turned on full access so it must be on until you manually change it!  Sadly I DELETED this app.
2638,Ifjensw,"February 2, 2020",4,"Braces suggestion I think that this app is amazing in expressing different styles and feeling but, I think that there people who have braces that would like to have them on their bitmoji. They would then get to show what they look like. Also maybe add more name brand items."

2644,Poke Track Fun!,"November 7, 2019",4,"Very good I‚Äôve had a great experience with Bitmoji so far, but what would make it a 5 star is if they added 1.

2645,lia_24:7,"September 29, 2019",5,REALLY GOOD APP BUT... this is a really good app but i would really like it if you can have costume clothing because everything i seem to be putting on lots of other people have it and it would be really cool if I can customize my own clothing in the app.
2646,kittykattfish,"September 17, 2019",4,Needs more outfits! I love my bitmoji. The only thing that would make the app more fun to use is more new outfits released more frequently.

2647,boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii2008,"September 16, 2019",4,"Good but there is one problem This app is great for people who love to text because of the huge keyboard but there is one problem, if you have multiple outfits then if you add a hat to one outfit it adds it to all of them overall amazing app I highly recommend it"
2648,His sus did did d,"May 1, 2019",4,"ADD TATTOO OPTIONS i‚Äôm absolutely in love with my tattoos and i think that should somehow be an option, i know a lot of people would enjoy placing tattoos on their bitmoji and i think our bitmojis should be able to be a little closer to ‚Äúdigital clones‚Äù for us, obviously age appropriate, stuff like, full sleeve, half sleeve, partial tattoos, stuff like that"
2649,jalin barry,"May 2, 2019",3,Categories I think more categories for CURLY hair should added and the outfits should be made individual categories as well so we can choose and match on our own. The legs on the bitmoji look weird and stop making us look so muscular. Let us chose our shoes and lip color should be more natural and not crusty. You guys should add face piercings that would be dope.

2653,'dorabledaisy,"June 7, 2019",4,Hats With the hats I think you should be able to use whatever food you want or design.  I want to do watermelon because that‚Äôs my favorite food but it didn‚Äôt have it.  That‚Äôs why am only giving this review a four star.  Please if you see this Bring a watermelon hat to the app
2654,ccalhoun7400,"August 19, 2019",4,"changes I feel there should be a better way to customize your person. where you can pick the shirt, pants,  and shoes all separately. I also feel there should be an option to put piercings (face) and tattoos on the bitmoji go make it look more like us."

Tons of your users these days have side nostril piercing, septum, or lip piercings. Secondly more textures & lengths in the hair department. You have blue and orange as skin colors but i know personally most of us just kinda pick whatever is closest to our hair & theyd look wayy more realistic with even 10 more options."

Still love the app just putting in a suggestion"
2682,Arcadiaüòé,"April 20, 2018",4,NEED MORE HAIRSTYLES The app is great but.... IT NEEDS MORE HAIR OPTIONS. I know there is only so much hairstyles you can really create but it would the app so much better if they provided more hair textures with different updos!! I am someone who has curly hair and i feel as though they only represented the 3c hair types for curly hair. They need to do more wavy hair with different updos.

However, I noticed that when you customize your avatar, there is no option for braces or headgear. Many teens use this app and have braces, so I think that would be a good update. Thanks!"
2739,Smallz427,"July 30, 2018",4,Great app but a lot to get through I love all of the reactions but I wish there was a way to favorite the ones you really like so you can easily come back to them. It‚Äôs easy to forget about really good ones because you have to search through so much
2740,Sydney Kossel,"July 31, 2018",5,Bit‚Ä¢voices An awesome feature to add to this fun and quirky app is a voice for our beloved characters. Having the human record voiceovers and the bitmoji delivering the dialogue! This would give the app and the bitmojis a whole new twist that would be fun and fresh and a bit-hit!
2741,mz_jacksonnn,"August 3, 2018",4,"Almost... I love Bitmoji, always have. IMO it‚Äôs ALMOST perfect- and would be if there were more body shape/size options. Women AND men come in different sizes and I think if we have so many options to show our hair, eyes, or clothes we should have more options when it comes to body shape/size."
2742,BrennaüíÄ,"August 16, 2018",1,Read! I‚Äôm rating 1 star cause I‚Äôm sure this will be seen (I give 5 stars love it) . But the app needs more outfits ! Do an American eagle collab or brandy Melville or pac sun !! None of the outfits really express my style and I feel that needs some work because all my friends bitmojis are like the same so I‚Äôd like more diversity overall like with hair too ! More lengths and styles and colors ! Also let the braid hairstyle get the hair treatment (all female btw ) and expand your treatments and skin tones and hairstyles !
2743,Girlfrienemy,"August 21, 2018",5,The best! I love Bitmoji and really appreciate the more detailed updates that have let me make my character look exactly like me! 
2744,Charmanderlady,"August 24, 2018",4,"Love it but needs updates I love the styles that Bitmoji has, but I really would love if they added piercings! I feel like my Bitmoji can‚Äôt accurately capture my essence without my septum and Medusa piercing. Also would like more outfits that are maybe more flattering and more body types to choose from."
2745,BamBambs,"September 15, 2018",4,Sad Love bitmoji but miss bitstrips and the option. My best friend passed away in 2013 and we used bitstrips with each other all the time and loved that I could still get on and make them with her character. She doesn‚Äôt have Snapchat so now her bitmoji is gone forever with the deletion of bitstrips.

2748,jdyeppers,"May 11, 2018",5,More headbands but over all great! App over all is awesome but add more spring head bands! They have hats and flowers but they don‚Äôt have normal headbands for spring and some Bitmojis look weird without them but what they put on doesn‚Äôt actually match the person.

Some people don‚Äôt want to add the creepy keyboard that can record everything you type including passwords!  You should respect our privacy and improve your actual app to make it more user friendly.
2752,lamespacealien,"June 1, 2018",4,More outfit choices The only thing it needs is more outfit choices. I can‚Äôt really find my style on the app and it kind of makes my own Bitmoji not really me. Maybe if we were able to choose our own shirts and pants to go together or something like that?
2753,Tito Glenn,"June 7, 2018",4,Clothes This app is absolutely perfect the only only thing I would say at this point is to let us be able to mix and match clothes. Like a certain shirt with certain pants and give us some shoe options as well. And this is kind of a stretch but if we can add tattoos too
2754,Bosseasy,"June 8, 2018",5,"Great way to express yourself without words Thanks for making such a fun addition to the communication world.

A lot of the population of people on the app are teens so I was thinking they could add braces as a mouth option like they did with being pregnant or having glasses! I have braces so it would be cool to have something define what I look like even more!!!!!üëçüèºüëçüèº
2758,TMoore64,"February 22, 2018",4,"I think you should add more accessories ! Bitmoji is fun and playful. Super cool way to see yourself as an avatar and it‚Äôs your spit image almost to a T but, I think there should be more. Like me for instance I have a nose ring in my nose and my Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt. I think my Bitmoji would almost be twining me if she had the option of a nose ring!"

2762,_.rubybeauty._,"March 11, 2018",5,BEST APP I love this app so much. I love how many different stickers you can chose from and all the different exemptions as well. I love how you can design a character to make it look yourself and change the clothes to anything you like.

2764,Asfgsjakalsllanalalkakakahska,"March 28, 2018",3,Diversity I think there should be a LOT more hairstyles in the app. Especially for curly medium length hair also the clothes oh my god we should be able to use every item as an individual. Not a whole outfit.

2768,FsblfBjymlga,"December 10, 2017",5,GET STAR WARS COSTUMES Bitmoji is a great app but I think to make it even greater is to make some Star Wars costume. Everyone is hype about the new Star Wars movie so how about give us fans some cool costumes to show off. You guys should also make some Star Wars Bitmoji's with like Lightsabers. Something to think about ü§îü§îü§î

2770,MsFluffypants04,"December 15, 2017",5,Add more I love bitmoji overall but they should add more styles. For the hair you should be able to choose what bangs you want and then choose what kind of hair you want. For clothes you should also choose what shirt you want with any pair of pants and shoes.
2771,Cedric Buckner,"January 10, 2018",5,Hair I would like to see the hair style called ‚Äúmessy box‚Äù it‚Äôs kind of big for black males.

2773,ejg10,"February 7, 2018",3,Get more licensed characters App keeps crashing. Considering almost every millennial male has some version of an undercut or fade with long hair on top it seems weird you only have 90s hairstyles for guys.

2776,Khe2310,"February 12, 2018",3,Networking needs to be better It is ridiculous how many times I have to re download the app and restart my phone just to get the networking to work for my bitmoji.

2777,MilanDelria,"February 20, 2018",5,Love it but... I wish we were able to add like facial piercings.  For example me I have my nose pierced and I also have a small mole on my chin. I wish I could add both on my avatar to make her look even more like me. But other that I‚Äôm fine it with.

But I do think the personalized emoji (emotion) aspect of the Memoji is cool. Would Bitmoji consider having standard emotion versions always on top ready to use the way that the Memojis work?

2804,dmdgod,"August 5, 2019",4,"No Representation Of Disabilites I would like to start off by saying, this is a great app all around.

2805,Uchiha 312,"August 4, 2019",2,"Whyyy The newer Bitmoji style is so pretty, especially with the hair colors, but there‚Äôs literally only one feature stopping me from using it: they removed my favorite hair style (and any style similar to it).

2810,Milk7789,"April 19, 2019",3,Meh It‚Äôs a cool app and I love the customization but the one thing i‚Äôve noticed that should definitely be changed is the body shapes. Not everyone is skinny.

For Latin Americans and other cultures with darker skin the range is really bad because the darker shades are either just shades for African Americans or they are just olive. They aren‚Äôt even good shades of olive. They are literally dark green shades. I myself am not able to find my shade but I love everything else about Bitmoji except this!
2918,Alesgaming3600,"March 3, 2018",5,Fashion Hello fellow Snapchat users... honestly I have thought that maybe Bitmojis can have custom outfits. For example you could make a custom outfit probably for someone who doesn‚Äôt really like most of the outfits available.

I had my daughter remove the app from their phones & though I still selectively use my character, I cannot in good conscience recommend the app any more.  Too bad, bitmoji.  You had a good thing here.  üëéüèº"

No in all seriousness, a search bar would be great."

3007,lola_lee10,"February 11, 2018",5,Animals Great app but you should be able to customize animals so if you have a pet you can have either their own Bitmoji or one with you (or one without the pet so it could be like it is now)!
3008,melisssaaaH,"September 1, 2017",4,"SMH The bitmoji option is obviously cuter and a more classy option as opposed to the bitstrips style of bitmoji, but there NEEDS to be a long haired option for bitmoji, and an option with the eye shape for the bitmoji style. I feel as though my bitmoji cannot be compared to my actual appearance due to these slight limitations."
3009,KAR58,"September 2, 2017",4,"So cute but it would be nice if we could search For those of us that for whatever reason do not wish to set up a bitmoji keyboard, it would be nice to have a search function within the app to be able to search by keywords."

You have red, pink, purple but no hazel eyes or highlighted hair.  I have common, average hair.  Idk, I'm being picky but I like the mojis to look real.

That would be so helpful."

3027,#harsh reviewer,"December 8, 2019",4,Cool I love this app but I think it would be cool if you guys added cooler things for messages. I don‚Äôt have Snapchat and just messages.

3029,yolo yolo squag swag,"March 30, 2019",4,Great but needs more hair to choose from I really like Bitmoji but I don‚Äôt really like the hair options considering the fact that the only nice curly hair is too short or they are too big and don‚Äôt look nice.

3032,hunterofpeaches,"May 28, 2019",4,Cool but could be better Honestly all I wish is that we were able to piece together our own outfits instead of choosing from pre-made outfits. Like let us choose what pants with what shirt and what belt and so on. That would be so much better!

3038,Dogmom19281,"November 8, 2018",3,Needs maternity updates! I adore this app. Works well and has so many options for everything except the maternity. There are no options and changing your body type to maternity so the other clothing options work for you isn‚Äôt an option either. Please work on this! üòî
3039,nicolelcraven,"November 12, 2018",4,"Clothes I love this app and the individual character you can make for yourself; but when will we be able to choose tops and bottoms separately, or the colors of clothing items? I feel stuck in the pre-made options y‚Äôall provide."

There are only like 4/5 options for maternity clothes and they definitely don't match the climate in in. Just some food for thought!"
3041,genderinclusive!,"November 15, 2018",1,"Needs more outfit versatility Currently, the app‚Äôs outfit options are gender-binary focused, assumptive and excluding. I would like to have a Christmas sweater with black jeans but am forced into a skirt because my Bitmoji‚Äôs gender is female. More outfit versatility would be appreciated where the current outfit catalogue is offered to all, regardless of gender, and then moving forward, where we can choose tops independently from bottoms, designing our Bitmojis to be a true reflection of our style, identity and gender expression."

There should just be a sliding bar and more of a range of sizes. Other then this I like the app.

Just some suggestions!"

3087,TayReneeElizabeth3,"January 31, 2018",5,Love it! This is one of the few apps that have gone above and beyond to make the user experience better. The Bitmojis look so realistic now! All that‚Äôs missing is a tiara or crown option and cuter clothes options‚Äô!
3088,SlimeUnicorn,"September 23, 2017",4,"Great but sometimes disappointing... Needs more body shapes. The body shapes are either anorexic, skinny, skinny and muscular, and obese. Needs more choices for hair and haven‚Äôt had new clothes in so long. Also sometimes glitches and while I‚Äôm changing it freezes and closes the app."

I‚Äôve updated my iPhone and the bitmoji app. I followed all instructions given and nothing is working. Restarted everything several times and made sure I was logged in to my bitmoji account. So annoyed.

3095,is bad is good,"December 3, 2019",3,More! I love the app and use it a lot for snapchat or me and my mom send them back. The only thing is it is hard for my bitmoji to look like me. First of all I have braces so it would be cool so we could color them different. also the eyes are very basic like i have two different colored eyes so i‚Äôd like to change it.

3098,maddieh1423,"May 7, 2019",4,"Awesome App I use it on Snapchat daily. It‚Äôs a great way to show off how your feeling or what your doing. Would be even better if there were more outfits for the Bitmoji and straight hair styles for women but that‚Äôs about it, would be fun to customize outfit completely. Great app to use."
3099,Sara Wren,"June 7, 2019",3,Weight update please? It‚Äôs really good app but personally I think they need to make an update with more body types. Instead of having 3 mainly thin body type they should have at least 10 or more if possible. Having it go from a normal weight to pretty big is a large difference in weight.
3100,ManderMillz,"June 8, 2019",4,Bitmoji app I really like the Bitmoji outfits and overall design of the Bitmojis but I would really like it if you would add a new soccer outfit. Since the Women‚Äôs World Cup is happening right now I would really like USA jersey‚Äôs because it is our home team and I want to support. But the overall Bitmoji app is amazing!

And then it disappeared for awhile but now it‚Äôs back and I cannot figure out how to do bitmoji pictures with me and my friends like I used to do. I used to post funny comics made with my own bitmoji paired with a friends bitmoji and post them on Facebook.. but now on bitmoji all I see is my own bitmoji... how do I add my friends to make comics like before?!?!

3107,*billie eilish,"June 29, 2019",4,Overall good app I personally think bitmoji is an overall good app I just think for the girls clothing they should put more up to date clothing instead of just basic clothing. And just as a request I would love more checkered items and hoodies. Just in my opinion.   :)
3108,Basic Boi,"October 17, 2018",3,"Decent except... I think Bitmoji is decent and fun, but the customization is meh. I do like how there is uniforms for most Emergency providers but there‚Äôs no EMS uniforms (kinda sad about that one since that‚Äôs a lot of my personality) but also that some of the clothing options can be kinda bland. Maybe if they add some more flair and more uniforms it could be better"

3111,~raquel4,"November 16, 2018",4,"Not a review, but a suggestion Hate to admit how addicting the Bitmojis are.  But I would *really* like to see a ‚Äòsearch‚Äô function within the app like the is when you insert a Bitmoji into an iMessage.  Wasting too much time skimming through them all to see if one exists."

3116,4343434356,"April 2, 2019",4,"Maybe there can be an update? Hi!

3121,fvckm3,"August 1, 2018",4,New feature please Ok I only rated 4 stars because I would like acne to be an option. You know? Because I personally don‚Äôt look the same with clear skin and wouldn‚Äôt you like our cartoon versions of us to look like us? Yes!! Please take time to consider this. Thankyou.
3122,Pinkzebra131,"August 15, 2018",4,LOVE IT BUT... I really love this app and how you can customize your little person. I would overall rate it a 4.5. The reason is that you guys need to add more hairstyles. I have curly hair but none of the curly hair styles match my hairstyle. So maybe add some more loose curly hair styles. Where the curls aren‚Äôt wavy but they aren‚Äôt coily.
3123,Maroonisland,"August 24, 2018",3,Rating 3 stars Ok so I love love to use bitmoji but recently I haven‚Äôt been able to to bitmoji with friends using the keyboard. It‚Äôs been really glitchy.

3126,2westeez,"September 20, 2018",5,Love this App I love love love this app and use it daily.  The only negative is that it‚Äôs not compatible with the Kakotalk app. Yes you can post in a chat but the receiver has to click to open. Any chance you guys could fix this problem?

3210,Freddy_55,"September 27, 2017",3,It‚Äôs okay I wish they would have more features to edit the Bitmoji like facial hair and other type of hair styles and different types of body sizes they just need to update what you can do with your Bitmoji or do some type of thing where you upload a picture and it creates a Bitmoji of your own face
3211,Pinkiepartycannon,"September 30, 2017",3,"No choices? Hey, I really like Bitmoji it's just that my little person looks nothing like me.

I wanna see some emo or goth looks... there just needs to be more diversity"

3267,lololo6666000,"November 13, 2018",4,"wii I wish you were able to take a photo of yourself and it would make your bitmoji look more like you, similar to the wii feature. After that, you could change it to your bitmoji to you liking."
3268,thickmommi,"April 13, 2018",1,Not Christian friendly AT ALL this app is extremely inappropriate. My daughter downloaded it for her snapchat and made a character. I thought it was so cute until I saw that she was using bit mojies that promote alcohol. Not cool :( please shape up and fix your app! My 9 year old daughter shouldn't be seeing these things considering we've already had an encounter (not only in bitmoji but in real life too) with sexual behavior. It's turning her into a satanist. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

3271,snitro,"May 5, 2018",4,"Fun! This App is really fun. I have it 4 star simply for all the different emoji's, however would have given 5 stars if you were able to save your favoites. This would be great and probably used more by me if that feature was available. Thank you."
3272,SSG JP,"May 18, 2018",5,Like this app it's fun and pretty spot on. My only request would be tattoos... that way it can be personalized! Also to improve the search option on snap and the app to access of all the bits

3274,gabrielle evelyn templeton,"June 17, 2018",5,Details My Bitmoji would look so much more like me if you added piercing options for the face and ears including stretched ears and other makeup and outfit options would really make the bitmoji look like me like eyeliner or a slit eyebrow

It‚Äôs like having an American girl doll but digital .. I think your improvements should be new hair styles like hair that parted to the side and curly and etc. thank you for this game !! It‚Äôs great for Snapchat !!üòò
3276,Cathyüíñ,"July 6, 2018",5,Clothes and tattoos You guys should add better clothes like supreme Gucci or Louis Vuitton or let people put tattoos on there body for the tattoos you can just show a picture of the tattoo then place it were ever you want to just update the clothes
3277,Kota Shay,"September 18, 2018",4,"Love but could still be better More personalization. Tattoos, piercings, hair styles, hair color style options, eyeliner, better eyelashes, and clothes let us make our own outfits give us shirt pants and shoe options.

3281,lbell12,"February 21, 2018",3,"Add-Ons I love bitmoji, I just feel like there needs to be more. There should be a ‚Äúlazy girl‚Äù section where it‚Äôs an oversized hoodie or tshirt with leggings, fuzzy socks, and birkenstocks or slippers. The messy hair styles need to be fixed too. I also wish there were more lengths for the hair styles and more hair options. I also think that there should be more makeup options."
3282,Manders8705,"March 17, 2018",4,Diversity I think they are doing great on the skin hair etc but the out fits need to be a bit more we (my husband and I) consider ourselves more to be on the ‚Äúred neck‚Äù side of things and the outfits don‚Äôt give much options to a creative side or laid back. It seems more preppy or sporty based.
3283,Skillyj,"March 18, 2018",5,"Love but.... I love the game but i'm a girl with braces, and i think i would look more like myself if you had those. The body types are a lil weird but good for the most part and i wish u could change how tall u are! Thanks!!üñ§üñ§"

Can you please add a military helmet to the hat section of the avatar because I think that it would look good on the Military outfit in the work it section. In the next Bitmoji update, please if you can add a military helmet for the two military outfits. Thank you!"
3287,Fantanabanana,"April 11, 2018",3,I want me back I loved this app and got all my friends to do it. They changed it to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù. Both my husband 53 and me agree there is no way ay to make it look like us. When there were fewer choices it worked better. Maybe because we are older. Does anyone know how to get the old one back?
3288,Sally Wallersnapper,"January 2, 2018",3,"Outfits Since there are MLB, NBA, and NFL outfits, there should be NHL outfits as well, and that is my only complaint ever about Bitmoji. Although, that‚Äôs a big negative for me as I want to support my favorite NHL teams during at least the season, if not all year long. I‚Äôm very passionate about hockey, and I know many, many others are as well."

3292,super funüòÇ,"February 7, 2018",4,"Love the new update... but So i love this new update on the customizations and i think it‚Äôs really creative, although my bitmoji app lags sometimes. "

3294,JulieAnneCO,"February 8, 2018",2,"What have you done!! While I commend the move toward much more diverse options üëè, my perfect bitmoji now looks NOTHING like me.

I accidentally saved my changes and now my avatar that had for years is gone. My bitmoji days have come to an end. üò≠ üò≠"
3295,Prenecha,"February 11, 2018",5,So about the update. I love the new update but there's just one problem. My lips are super full and your previous version accommodated that.
3296,Navspy,"February 11, 2018",4,"Need Dogs Way too many cats, need to include dogs like yellow labs! Also college attire should also be included and I couldn‚Äôt find the Astros, or Texans in the sports attire!

3297,PerlerBeadGirl,"February 11, 2018",4,"Customization I love this app and how cute my character is but I wish that you could access both gender's clothing. The Sims 4 did it, why can't bitmoji?

Thanks ."
3299,Jen Gen,"October 14, 2017",4,"Use this everyday I love communicating with Bitmoji over emoji. Now that there‚Äôs an official iMessage sticker version, I have turned off the keyboard so there are fewer keyboards for me to cycle through.

3300,Soyee95,"November 16, 2017",3,Racist I was so excited to create my bitmoji until I saw that they excluded Asian features. I just wanted my bitmoji to look like me but it looks like every other round eyed person. The point of creating a bitmoji is so it can look like me in cartoon form but it doesn't? I am a very disappoited bitmoji user and refuse to use it until they make Asian eyes.
3301,Smhdjdn,"November 16, 2017",5,Awesome app I really like how you can text your friends a bitmoji picture with both of you in it but I have one small concern and that is that there should be more skin tones and colors. Thanks for reading this!ü§ëü§ëü§ë

3303,isabellatripi,"November 25, 2017",4,Don‚Äôt leave the NHL out!!! I love Bitmoji sooooo much!!! Everything about it. My only concern is that there is no option to represent your favorite NHL team. I love hockey so much and so do others and I know a lot of people who say Bitmoji would be 10x better if they‚Äôd add the NHL jerseys in. It would be greatly appreciated!! üòò

It‚Äôs otherwise ok I guess..."

3315,datirtle2.0,"October 12, 2019",4,"A few updates needed This app is really cool, but I think that it just needs a few more stickers. I think that you could add a few more music related stickers because I‚Äôm a big musician and I think it would be cool. Overall great app."

3318,Popfizzman,"May 19, 2019",4,The outfits people So in my opinion every design option have everything. But the hats and cloths really limit what you can where. My suggestion would be to add in a hoodie of every color and get some beanies and headbands to make it more casual.
3319,MollyMcilroy,"May 22, 2019",4,"In app search feature??? Please add a search feature to the app. It‚Äôs really useful to be able to search for a bitmoji when I‚Äôm sending text messages; I‚Äôd like to be able to search in the app as well. Otherwise, fun app ü•∞"
3320,kat7lyn,"August 28, 2019",4,Good but could be better please ADD MORE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS. My bitmoji hardly looks like me and they all look the same. I would rather spend longer picking options and have my bitmoji look like me than spend less time and just look like everyone else.

3440,valariee98,"May 22, 2018",4,Beauty Marks I love this app and all its inquiries but my bitmoji will never look like me unless it has a beauty mark because that is the most essential feature on my face. so some added facial beauty marks seems like a necessity for me and others who have a similar one as well.
3441,Jbourbeau01,"June 5, 2018",4,More items! I think that more clothing should be added along with more accessories such as watches. I also think that it would be fun to add something like a guitar or sports item that your bitmoji could have. Other than that the app is great.

3445,Frogs2001,"July 12, 2018",5,Great app I love Bitmojis on Snapchat but 2 things that would make it better is more outfits and if your Bitmoji can have kids/ family. I was doing my streaks and thought I‚Äôd be nice if I can put my son and I as a Bitmoji.

3530,Ichels987,"February 9, 2018",4,love it but MORE CURLY STYLES Not sure if anyone will see this (or will even care tbh) but the new bitmoji deluxe is great and everythang. I love how my bitmoji looks BUT being a girl with long 3b curly hair... I felt as though my hair type wasn‚Äôt really included in the hair selections available for my new bitmoji. I‚Äôm upset about that but das it.
3531,sassygirl2000,"February 11, 2018",4,"Few more changes? I love spending time on bitmoji and making my avatar look like me. But I‚Äôm all honesty, I‚Äôd love if you added face piercings as an accessory option. We should also be able to mix and match shirts with pants and shoes. Other than that, I love this app!"
3532,Zayogical,"February 13, 2018",4,"Needs new customization options and accessories I‚Äôd like there to be an option to make your own outfits. Also add necklaces, earrings, ya know...more accessories. That‚Äôs all. Everything with the new update is superb. Also let us customize our mouths. Like vampire fangs or grills."
3533,jillist,"February 16, 2018",5,Suggestion i absolutely love this app it‚Äôs so so so cute!! however y‚Äôall are missing a plain long caucasian style of curly hair! i feel this is a very basic and common style hair that needs to be added!
3534,logierosati,"February 20, 2018",3,This is SQUIRREL DISCRIMINATION I have a friend who is a human/squirrel and we need a squirrel bitmoji (preferably a bitmoji dressed as a squirrel) ASAP!!! Your motto is ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù and how is she supposed to do that if there are no squirrel bitmoji for her to use. There is a squirrel bitmoji saying ‚ÄúNuts About You‚Äù but how is she supposed to express herself like that???? There should be a squirrel bitmoji in the next 3 weeks!!!!!!! Please and Thank You! ‚ù§Ô∏èüêøüêøüêøüêøüêøüêøüêøüêø‚ù§Ô∏è
3535,Em10!!!!!!!,"February 23, 2018",3,"I really like it but.....missing my hair Even with the update it still doesn't have my hair. My hair is shoulder length and rose gold color. I have the color down, but I currently have the wrong hair length. The hair styles that are a bit before the shoulders are just ugly in my opinion and I really would like my hair length."
3536,Jojo426/bacon,"February 23, 2018",5,"Love it, just one suggestion This app is wonderful, I just wish you could add more outfits, like gowns, dresses, or pajamas. I also would like it if you could customize bottoms and shoes. Other than that, much love."
3537,kenzgar,"February 24, 2018",4,OUTFITS. The only reason I‚Äôm giving this four stars is because I‚Äôm disappointed in the clothing options. I wish there was better stuff so that you could customize it even more to fit your style.
3538,NIM0117,"November 2, 2017",3,"Love the app but needs more I love the app, but I believe you need more body types. You go from like a medium body to like an extra extra large. There‚Äôs no in between the two. More curly hair styles would be a plus also. I just think that would really give this app an over the top look"
3539,Dghhvxdfgnbv,"November 14, 2017",4,Needs color wheel back I dye my hair different colors often and you just don‚Äôt have a good selection of colors. There‚Äôs not even a dark purple but when you used to have the color wheel I could get color closest to my hair color.
3540,Jaime Booker,"December 12, 2017",4,"Love it! I absolutely love Bitmoji, I‚Äôve never experienced any problems with it except.. it has problems loading sometimes but that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve got my whole family doing it now, so funny! Great idea, still I would rate it 4 and a half."
3541,hcs216,"December 25, 2017",3,Fun but needs more options So much fun to use and customize but i wish it had longer hair options and longer beards and more skin tones. Also i wish you could change the color of the buzzcut hairstyle just needs a little work to have a personal touch.
3542,MoShiSim,"December 28, 2017",3,"More options would be nice Overall, it‚Äôs fun. However, being pregnant and not having an option for a pregnant body type has been annoying. And the maternity wardrobe is strictly for summer. It would be nice having all seasons of maternity wardrobe if there‚Äôs not going to be a pregnant body type."
3543,Alex üßÄüíï,"January 22, 2018",3,"More Customization First off, boys and girls should have same hair / outfit options. Or there should be a nonbinary / gender neutral option when selecting your BitMoji‚Äôs gender. Get with the times, BitMoji! "
3544,Stevie_king420,"January 31, 2018",2,I loved this. Loved It was cute and all but before the new style I really liked this and it‚Äôs cool and all but you guys changed the eyes on the other styles which is so upsetting to me Cause I think my bitmoji was perfect and I accidentally changed it to the new style and I just wish I had my old one back 
3545,blackbear7419,"February 2, 2018",5,Bitmoji üòÇüòúüôà This is a really great app to use! One of my favorite parts that I'm so glad they added is being able to change clothes! I definitely recommend this app.
3546,Roxydog319,"February 7, 2018",4,"Give a queen her crown I love the update‚Äîthe picture matching on deluxe was very accurate!‚Äîhowever, you took my crown away & I want it back :(üëë not sure why deluxe & other styles can‚Äôt have the same accessories when they have the same outfits"
3547,i_am_doge_221,"February 7, 2018",5,"Great app! Wow I really like this app! You can make an avatar and customize it however you like (like in Wii lol)! It's not an app I'd go bananas over, but it's a pretty cool and cute app. I definitely recommend this app to anyone who doesn't have it!!"
3548,Liz-Liz51,"September 2, 2017",5,Outfits Needs more outfits. Like black vans with jeans and a long black shirt for example. Or we should be able to mix outfits. And I have my septum pierced so it would be cool to have piercing options
3549,King_Leija,"September 13, 2017",5,Everything is awesome but... I believe the app needs change. We've had the same hairstyles since Bitmoji came out. It would be more interesting to see more hairstyles.
3550,Jodi_bug,"September 15, 2017",5,I feel like Lizzie McGuire Love being able to express myself thru Snapchat & text messaging but since fall is coming and college football is here. It would be awesome for football game style outfits!
3551,üòùüòùüëçüëç,"September 27, 2017",4,"An amazing app overall! I really love bitmoji but they desperately need more outfit choices! I think it would be so cool if there was a ‚Äúdesign lab‚Äù where you could pick the individual aspects of your outfit. For example, you could pick the style of your pants, top, shoes, and accessories."
3552,illien parker,"October 7, 2017",4,"Needs more hair colors!! I am constantly changing up my hair and they never have the right colors. Even when I had natural hair colors, they weren‚Äôt very accurate! I‚Äôm sure many others would enjoy this. Other than that I‚Äôm happy!"
3553,PythonKiller,"October 10, 2017",5,Great app This app is great!! I love to send funny pics to my friends! I WISH YOU WERE ABLE TO COMBINE WITH YOUR FRIENDS THOUGH. Also there is nothing for Star Wars (the greatest movie ever). Other than those few things this app is a must have for teens and adults. üëçüëçüëç
3554,C_los015,"October 17, 2017",5,An idea to add Something I have always wished to be able to do was use my bitmoji alongside one of my friends outside of Snapchat by perhaps including an ‚Äúadd a friend‚Äù feature directly on the bitmoji app.
3555,Drizzyleigh,"October 25, 2017",5,"Love this app, where are the expansions? I love this app. I think there could be larger variety of outfit choices, none of them really feel like my style. I would also download a ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù bitmoji app if it existed."
3556,estaylor,"November 2, 2017",3,"What happened to the themes?? From the moment I downloaded Bitmoji, it had theme packs available, but after the IOS update they went away. I was wondering when they would be back even to purchase. I love this app, it is so much fun but the theme packs made it even more fun. Please bring them back!!"
3557,Muscles711,"February 27, 2020",3,"Nose Piercings ??? I love this app, and whenever i‚Äôm bored i always go through and edit and make it look like me and change the outfit. i have it synced to snapchat and everything, but why isn‚Äôt there a piercings option?? i have a nose piercing and would love to add one to my little bitmoji to make it more me !!"
3558,scarlettstorm,"February 16, 2020",5,Wonderful but.... I have both dimples and freckles and I can‚Äôt have both can you make it to where you can because I have to pick dimples over freckles
3559,2007smiley,"December 27, 2019",1,I hate it I put my email in and password and told it to sign in and told me to try again later and get a better connection! It said to try agin later! I had full Wi-Fi and 5 bars or data! I tried again about 5hrs later I hit sign in and it kept telling me no connection try agin later! I kept trying and trying and can still never get in to the app Bitmoji! It is really frustrating!
3560,AmbitiouzSmilez,"December 26, 2019",3,"Not enough Body sizes/types The only issue I have with this app is the body types... there‚Äôs like 4 smalls and then a 5XL size.. would be cool to add in between and maybe options to add or take away volume from upper or lower body! Hope to see this change soon, I really want my Bitmoji to look like me !"
3561,Smile_cuz_iloveyou,"December 13, 2019",4,Add half and half hair I have half teal and half pink hair right now and I usually change my Bitmojis hair the same color I change mine but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt do that this time due to not being able to pick sides of my hair
3562,alex.drew,"December 12, 2019",3,"More maternity So being pregnant I‚Äôve wanted to custom my Bitmoji but there‚Äôs not a lot for that, like clothing and more stickers for moms-to-be it would be great if you could add just a little bit more for clothing or actions. I think it‚Äôs kinda weird your Bitmoji can ‚Äúdrink‚Äù beer and wine while pregnant but that‚Äôs just an choice for everyone."
3563,stop reasing my username,"December 4, 2019",4,"More clothing options I have been a Bitmoji user for years and I love the app. I just wish there were more clothing options, maybe one section for tops and one for bottoms instead of one for outfits. Other than that, I love the app!üíû"
3564,haha you looked,"November 28, 2019",4,"More hair options Sometimes I get really bored and decide to make some like,, Danganronpa characters or something, but hairstyle options never match what youre ever going for. There‚Äôs no pigtails or anything, and it‚Äôs really constricting. Other than that, it‚Äôs pretty fun"
3565,400meter sprinter,"November 17, 2019",1,"The options available aren‚Äôt that good The app is cool and all but I wish we were able to create our bitmoji way cooler like have way more options that what‚Äôs available for example outfits from movies like Lord of the rings, or any type of fictional characters it would be awesome people seeing me as a the Witch King of Angmar on the map but idk just thought I throw it out if you don‚Äôt read this that‚Äôs cool too lol."
3566,thankyouformakinmesmile,"November 14, 2019",4,"More customization for clothes! it‚Äôs a great app although the clothing options are so limited. perhaps an option where u can select a shirt, pants, accessories etc one at a time? "
3567,ehhdtigwy,"September 6, 2019",5,More times Please add more accessories!! I really want hair clips like barrettes since I wear them a lot and I think it would be rlly cool!! Everyone tells me my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me cuz I‚Äôm unrecognizable without my barrettes in. Please add Some
3568,BrittShay,"May 19, 2019",4,No search bar? There should be a search bar within the app so we can find the right bitmoji for the conversation rather than scrolling & searching for ages. Sometimes the bitmoji‚Äôs come out really tiny in iMessage

3570,doglover.awesome,"May 27, 2019",5,Love it!!!! This app is awesome and I‚Äôve it for less than a day!!! I wish they had more water and swim options): Other than that I would definitely recommend it!!!!!
3571,jennajohn,"June 1, 2019",4,Needs search option in app For the love of everything - please add a search option in the app itself! If you would do that it would help me out soooo much! Surely it‚Äôs not that difficult to do! Thanks in advance!
3572,Yagirlgaby,"June 4, 2019",4,A little change for the clothes I love Bitmoji but it could be better if they let us create a style of clothing like when we want to change of clothes we can make our own design. That would be great.
3573,TaniyaMD,"August 20, 2019",4,I love it I really like the app it‚Äôs Just that I wish there was a larger variety of out fits and hair for both genders.i‚Äôd also greatly appreciate if you could add braces to the bitmojis bit besides that I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing it‚Äôs fun and unique which I love!
3574,SnacksyPolkadot,"August 9, 2019",5,Finally! You finally added a search option! So much more user friendly. Thank you! Now.. for more body shapes and more face options ...
3575,itscamila;),"July 23, 2019",5,It‚Äôs good but can be a little better The girls can use new hairstyles and the girls should have more hoodies it would be better. And we need more tops because the ones we have aren‚Äôt that good.
3576,Sweet kitty123456789101112,"July 16, 2019",3,"Add or fix I think that bitmoji should make it so that there aren‚Äôt cloths and we have a pick one but we get to make or own style like for example, we get to pick out our own sleeves and we get to pick what shirt and pants and shoes and all that. There are choices but just of that one thing."
3577,monkeyüôàüôä,"June 21, 2019",5,It‚Äôs great! This is a great app and love using my bitmoji and so do my friends. Just a suggestion is that you can match different clothing items like change the shoes or the pants on an outfit. But the app is great overall!
3578,okayyyy.ha,"January 23, 2019",4,Great app more natural hair Overall I love this app it helps me communicate in different ways without having to type a whole paragraph. But I do wish it had mor hairstyles for natural hair or black hair so I have more of a selection of hairs to choose from. Thank you.
3579,Dan k 21,"January 28, 2019",5,"More outfits I love this app but I personally think the addition of some sports (ufc, mma) and the addiction of designer clothes (Louis Vuitton, Gucci). I think the addition of some of these would definitely have a more wide range of outfits."
3580,Karl38292,"February 18, 2019",5,Amazing app but needs earrings I love this app and use it frequently on Snapchat. There are a lot of options but there‚Äôs not an option for earrings and I feel like that‚Äôs a part of my look ya heard.
3581,Ali Na Na,"February 24, 2019",5,Happy I just love bitemoji I want to change a few things like I want a teal color car and a tiny black and brown dog.  When you do the search for stickers it is amazing.  Keep it going.
3582,"Danvers, Carol","March 10, 2019",4,"Nice Hey! So Bitmoji is really cool and fun. The only thing I‚Äôd ask for is for the freedom of picking a shirt and pant that don‚Äôt come as one. Also the option for shoes like crocs and slip-ons. I really love the app but it you could keep the pre-made outfit and add a feature for picking your own shirt, pant, and shoes.. I‚Äôd like that very much. :)"

3584,ArmyWife19,"March 27, 2019",4,"Fun app, but could still improve I love this app! However when trying to use it for a facebook status the emoji background always turns black. It‚Äôd be great to make it easier to use with facebook. "
3585,MarvelGirlAlp,"March 29, 2019",4,"I love it but can you add some brands.... I love Bitmoji!!! It‚Äôs so nice and it has a wide selection of Bitmojis and clothes, but some of my favorite brands aren‚Äôt there and I wish they were.

3586,MDP0113,"April 16, 2019",5,"Awesome App I love this app. The only complaint I have is that it‚Äôs been a long time since they‚Äôve updated the outfits. Other than that, it‚Äôs one of my favorite apps of all time."
3587,StArBASE1010,"May 12, 2019",4,"outfits I love bitmoji, but the ONE thing it would need to make it 5 stars would be to be able to pick what shirt goes with whichever pants/shorts and to be able to pick your shoes separately as well, or they could even add accessories to choose from.üòÅ"

3590,kaylenekristofferson,"October 21, 2018",5,I love it but... I love this app but what would make it even better is if we were to be able to pick our own individual tops and bottoms so we can mix and match
3591,hdchccydj,"October 26, 2018",4,Improvement I think that the could add in some more outfits or have use crate our own outfits that we like. And add in more hairstyles or have use crate them to I think that that would be fun. But overall this app is so fun and cool I use it a lot.
3592,blue/tassie,"October 29, 2018",4,Great app...... almost! I love sending my little self to my friends! The only thing I really don't like is some of the options you can send to people are a bit inappropriate. Maybe take off those but otherwise great app!!
3593,Tsv311,"November 8, 2018",4,Network Connectivity It keeps telling me there are network connectivity issues even when I‚Äôm at home on WiFi or running on 4G. Won‚Äôt let me login or anything. Hoping a new update comes out soon.

So basically what I‚Äôm sayin is that can you please make the female bitmoji also have more masculine clothes and also not so basic clothes? Thanksü§ó"
3621,Sytiran,"February 22, 2018",5,Awesome! Super funny and great to use with friends. I can‚Äôt wait for it to work the same way over basic text that it does through Snapchat. I‚Äôd also love to see bitstrips return.
3622,walling94,"February 22, 2018",5,Bring the Batman costume back This app is really cool and fun to play with but it was even better when they had a Batman costume and that one was my favorite and they took it away and that makes me upset
3623,californiagirl1316,"February 25, 2018",4,MILLION DOLLAR IDEA So where‚Äôs the crazy curly/wavy hair because that‚Äôs my life also their should be more options for straight hair also HELLO MILLION DOLLAR IDEA HEAR I think we should totally be able to make pet bitmojis like hey they deserve attention too otherwise add more bitmoji texty things üòÇ y‚Äôall honestly are awesome
3624,jerbear1221,"April 5, 2018",4,Great update! I love the new ways in which we can make a bitmoji look like ourselves. The only downside for me is that the Afro sizes go from Big Chop to Angela Davis and there is no in between. And yes there are ones that are slightly bigger natural hair but those are high tops or faded sides and it‚Äôs not the same :/
3625,Teagan stengrim,"April 11, 2018",5,LOVE THIS APPüíó I think you should add more outfits with shorts because I only wear shorts and a lot of the outfits don‚Äôt have them. I love this app and all of my friends have it. It makes texting so much more enjoyable.
3626,drewmichelle_BüíØ,"April 18, 2018",4,in loveüòÇ but..... Bitmoji is like one of the coolest apps i have and i love it. when you guys did that with Snapchat it made me üëç i love all of the outfits but my complaint is that you need MORE! like hey how about some overalls or maybe even at least a cute dress? thx for reading MAYBE it will helpü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÅ

3629,LameRunner,"October 11, 2017",4,Great but... Why isn't there a search when in the app? Seems like a very basic feature. There are way to many to scroll through now (which is awesome) really need a search within the app.
3630,Kacynn,"October 11, 2017",5,Would highly suggest This app has every possible emoji you can think of! You can have a whole conversation just with the wide variety of choices.
3631,Bloundiegirl,"October 13, 2017",2,"So fun Love how many options there are for things you can express, however the lack of clothing options and lack of new options is dreadful. They need a few new designers to create fun new things to ‚Äòchange‚Äô into, some new trendy things. It used to be 5 stars, the lack of clothing options makes me use it less and less."
3632,Lyiers,"October 15, 2017",5,"Awesome but please add more stuff You've added clothes like basketball and football, but it would be awesome if you would put soccer clothes like international soccer teams, then Barcelona, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Bayern Munchen xtra, please take time to read this. Thank you"
3633,Peytonbrantonn,"October 18, 2017",4,"Updates Y‚Äôall should give more accessory choices like chains, necklaces, grills, gold teeth, watches Etc. and also y‚Äôall should make it where you can create a bit moji by showing a picture of something and they make it for you"
3634,Khensal,"November 11, 2017",5,Get more clothes Hey bitmoji! Can you get some more clothes? Particularly some Pacific Northwest outfits like some flannel and a vest? That would be awesome. Love bitmoji! I can have an entire conversation with my sister or mom all in bitmoji. Can‚Äôt get enough so funny!
3635,squishyneon,"December 7, 2017",4,"Where did the devil horns go? I love bitmoji but I really liked the devil horns in the head wear, it's not there anymore. There is one available but it's on the sides of the head, (darkish red color) while the one that's gone was on the front of the head. I hope it comes back one day."
3636,Ndonsfnfodgeli,"December 12, 2017",3,"I like it BUT.... I like the app, but there should be more variety of the outfits or body types.

3637,Coman4915,"December 22, 2017",4,"Sports Clothes I love this app because I can use Snapchat with it but my own problem I have with it is the clothes the app has clothes for the MLB, NBA, and NFL but there are no clothes for the NHL I would love to change my clothes for ether the Detroit Red Wings or the St. Louis Blues but I can't so I would love if u put the NHL clothing in"

3640,Ayden Grauer,"September 13, 2017",4,"Yeet Over all, Bitmoji has a great customization system, but you could add more options, like a few more career options, and one where you can pick the shirt, pants, jacket, etc. Also if there was an option for hoods to be on/off that'd be cool."
3641,D_Baller101,"April 25, 2020",4,"Great app, I wish it this though This app is truly amazing because it allows to you to show yourself in your own image. The one thing that I wished was in the app for the girls section were some more boyish outfits and a few pair of baggy or loose pants."
3642,watr k9,"April 17, 2020",3,"Glitchy! Pretty regularly now, when trying to send a Bitmoji in a message, I click on it and it does nothing. It won‚Äôt load into the messages, nor will it ‚Äòcopy‚Äô and ‚Äòpaste‚Äô- making it useless. And yet, later, it works! Pretty inconsistent. Frustrating."

3644,Uncreativenickname:),"April 7, 2020",4,Great but... I love bitmoji but I wish they would improve their system for searching bitomojis. For example you have a specific bitmoji in mind and you try to search for it and it‚Äôs almost impossible to find.

3647,purplezgirl,"February 16, 2020",3,"Not Happy I love Bitmoji and the outfit choices. I was even happier when Bitmoji made an update so you could make your own clothes. And you could still wear the other clothes. I was psyched. But then, Bitmoji took away some of the premade  outfits. I think the solution is putting the search bar back."
3648,siena swing,"February 4, 2020",4,"Need more hair options I have wavy/curly hair with bangs - not an option! Hair is such a critical part of someone‚Äôs look, so I can‚Äôt get my Bitmoji to look like me. Also, the clothes are so plain & boring - more patterns would be great. Animal prints & camo are trendy, maybe try incorporating more prints."
3649,Chicokate,"January 26, 2020",3,"Not a lot of options There aren‚Äôt a lot of masculine outfit options for the female model. It‚Äôs all skirts and body suits. There‚Äôs maybe one outfit of baggy sweat pants, a loose tank top and sneakers. The weight option is also very limited. It either looks anorexic, severely overweight, or an ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù that poorly represents a large majority of weight groups."

3653,tthrbfnff,"November 21, 2019",5,It is ok but should add This is a great app really but I think it would be better if they added more sporty things like I have a whole hockey team that wants more ice hockey!! But this is otherwise a great app!
3654,Raptor1Blue,"September 30, 2019",5,Love this app but I have a cool idea I like this app very cool I use it all the time but I was wondering it would be cooler if untouched could make it kinda like animoji except with your Bitmoji? Please try to see if you could do that I'd love it!

3660,Relxs,"June 6, 2019",5,Some new things u should add. u guys should add earrings and piercings and tattoos more outfits and more hair styles more hair accessories and more glassesü§îu should think about it but this is in my opinion that‚Äôs what u should add in the new update^^^^:)

3662,_xFallen_Angelx_,"August 15, 2019",4,BITFASHION Boa blah does what it does but you guys should do this thing where you can pick specific pants or shorts w a specific shirt you know like customized outfits? Either that or BRING OUT NEW CLOTHES (someone said something about language) nah keep it the way it is do not listen to them.

3670,Alea86362,"February 7, 2019",3,I like bitmoji but it needs more hair styles I really like the app but I feel like there‚Äôs no hair styles that really look like me. There is no long hair that is that curly. There‚Äôs several different types of wavy hair but none that are actually curly. Overall I think it‚Äôs a good app but we need a version that has curlier types of hair.

3672,cexfbucrvjhtcfxsdfg,"February 18, 2019",5,Love this app to death I have one idea to help the app. You could have your pets in the menu where you make your characters to add how many pets you have and what they look like
3673,aojfikenw,"March 16, 2019",5,Accessories I really like how you can customize your self in any way and show who you are but maybe you can add accessories to the app to make it a little more customizable?

3675,pavel1193,"April 7, 2019",4,It‚Äôs great üëçüèº It is a really fun app to use in texting and customizing your character but it doesn‚Äôt have some things it should like you could put on jeweler or watches if that was possible then it would be an amazing app!

3712,Contact Group,"February 22, 2018",3,Needs basic feature: search button Love the app but i have a hard time figuring out why it doesn‚Äôt have a search button within the app itself?? It‚Äôs annoying to have to go through iMessage just to find an emoji that i want to save. 
3713,Pissed100,"February 26, 2018",5,I think there should be personalized animals! I think that there should be an option to make your dog/cat the ones in the bitmojis! So that when you use a bitmoji with a dog in it it‚Äôs not a random animal it‚Äôs yours:))
3714,Brisk soooooo,"March 13, 2018",5,Annoying Keeps saying I have connectivity issues and won‚Äôt let me edit my Bitmoji . I tried updating and still doesn‚Äôt work .

3721,Abhjdksnbns,"January 31, 2018",4,"FIX THIS Okay, you do know that people have long hair right? And that there are larger chest sizes and different body types. The outfits look like they were made in a rush. Although this app is really cool. It‚Äôs simply unrealistic as to why there is only one long straight hair."
3722,Needsdiary,"February 1, 2018",4,Stupid hats So some of the outfits come with hats. I wish you had the option to not wear the hat. (I‚Äôm specifically talking about the hockey ones) I live the fact that they have sport outfits and they are amazing accept for the hockey beanies. Other than that I love the app.
3723,Christy Luna,"February 1, 2018",5,"more! hey! bitmoji‚Äôs are my life, I currently have my lock screen as my bitmoji deluxe moji üòÇ but my friend brought a good idea and said that we should be able to make our own clothes!!! So I‚Äôm writing this review üôÉ amazing update thoe! I love it"
3724,Domo Wildin,"February 7, 2018",5,Gave it a five but.... Gave it a five because I love it but the one thing I‚Äôd say to change is to let us pick different clothes from different brands and categories to mix and match the perfect outfit. yknow?
3725,lisam3586,"February 7, 2018",3,"LOVE i‚Äôm absolutely in love with the new update.. so much more range and freedom to customize your bitmoji to look like you.. and taking a picture is really accurate, it‚Äôs so cool!! great feature to add two tone hair which i have and hate having to choose one hair color or another and now i don‚Äôt!! great update!!"
3726,Jlireyn,"February 8, 2018",4,More variety in certain options please Different lip shapes would be awesome. They change your overall face look so much. Also three or four body types with the only change in chest size? Huh?!
3727,SMichael15,"February 8, 2018",4,"Clothing options for males I love what the new update brings when it comes to customization of bitmojies! However, I do wish there were better clothing options for males. The ones now just aren‚Äôt cutting it for me, and my high sense of fashion."
3728,Rugilekent,"September 21, 2017",5,Hairstyles I love the app and it's connection with Snapchat. I use it a lot but wish there were more hairstyles. Like in person I have a manbun. And I would really love it if my Bitmoji would have that too!
3729,ShadowOfDoubt,"September 23, 2017",4,"Would have given it 5 buuuuuuut They don‚Äôt have purple as a hair color choice, which is what my hair color is!!! They have this weird magenta, pink, 2 shades of blue & green, BUT NO PURPLE!? "
3730,Bvh01,"September 24, 2017",3,"iPhone 7plus PRODUCT(RED) App needs update for iOS 11 I guess. Was working fine until I updated my phone to 11. Now after you choose the emoji (from the app, not the keyboard) the application goes blank and you have to shut it down and re launch it to have the emojis populate. Kind of nerve wrecking. Please fix."
3731,Galaxy160,"September 30, 2017",5,I love this app but this Would make it even cooler! I think it would be awesome if we could individually pick clothes and accessories for our Bitmoji. For example you pick a shirt and then a jacket and then shoes and etc.
3732,Tvraa,"October 16, 2017",5,Love love love I literally send so many Bitmoji stickers on iMessage and Snapchat they‚Äôre my favorite part of messaging!

3734,Nino_Billy,"November 8, 2017",5,New idea Bitmoji should come up away for people to take a regular face picture and it sets your avatar off your face. Instead of having to create oneü§Ø I really just gave yall a good idea!! #wheremymoneyat
3735,Scrumqty,"April 1, 2020",5,"Great, and fun app! This app is very fun to use! I love the customization options and the what seems like unlimited amount of Bitmojis there are. I also love the integration with YOLO and Snapchat. Very fun app overall and very good quality."
3736,Chloe VR,"March 17, 2020",1,"Good but would add some things! I love Bitmoji, fun to use, and customize your character.I wish you could add eyelashes to the Bitmoji Classic. And for there to be Soccer/football jerseys- from all around the world. I would appreciate a Peru and Uruguay jersey. Something that I wish was on Bitmoji, is for there to be a mate drink. Again the app is amazing! And I recommend that you should download it! There is just a couple things I would add. -Valeria"
3737,SueMWat,"February 20, 2020",4,"Frustrated I love this app and have been using it for a long time. That being said lately I continue to have trouble getting into the app where you can change your avatar. Clothes,hair style etc .. hmmm"
3738,Safari917,"February 5, 2020",4,üëçüèº I enjoy using Bitmoji but I would like to see more of a variety of Maternity clothes. It has been the same for awhile. Maybe put pregnancy as one of the body types and then let us choose our outfits.
3739,KitKatRocky1690,"December 23, 2019",4,"More clothing options I love the new update!! It‚Äôs fun to finally choose your own clothing, but can there, in the future, have hoodies without the zippers? I feel like many people would enjoy that option. Thank you!"
3740,vortex3303,"December 18, 2019",4,Can‚Äôt figure it out I love this app and it‚Äôs hilarious but I can‚Äôt figure out where the mix and match outfits are. I updated the app but can‚Äôt find it. I have looked this up multiple times and can‚Äôt find it. Please fix.
3741,COOL GURL101,"December 16, 2019",5,Great app... But a suggestion I loveeeeeeee bitmoji it‚Äôs a great and fun app to use to express emotion when texting! But me and my sister were talking and we thought it would be fun if you could add an earring option?

Please can you get the afro on there, ty."
3747,Jurusan,"October 2, 2019",5,Love these! Y‚Äôall should introduce some forgiveness bitmojis. Someone was saying sorry to me and I wanted to shoot them back an ‚ÄúI forgive you‚Äù type. Couldn‚Äôt find anything quite like that.
3748,sim-anonymous,"March 2, 2019",4,Needs more outfits and hairstyles The apps good I‚Äôve been sing it for a while but it  needs new outfits and more hairstyles there‚Äôs no variety of hairstyles just generic ones and  outfits  haven‚Äôt updated for a while so it‚Äôs really stressing
3749,bp4824,"April 20, 2019",5,A fun app I like to use a lot in conversations on text to make people laugh with the silly little things my Bitmoji doing and all my friends like it to and overall it‚Äôs a great app.
3750,123456542568842264839292638496,"May 10, 2019",4,One suggestion It is an amazing app. I love how you can make yourself a cartoon emoji that can wear different types of clothes. I just really really think you should add pajamas as an option for the type of clothing you pick
3751,giggles0118,"May 14, 2019",4,Love it but... Love the Bitmojis. They‚Äôre so fun and unique. Was super excited when the upgraded Bitmojis came out so they look more personalized and like people not just funny caricatures.

3753,rockstar@3,"September 18, 2019",4,"Bitmoji, good but there are some things... Great app. I use it a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è But, there is a lot of language. Also, the options for clothing are limited.

3754,GoPhiladelphiaUnion,"August 12, 2019",3,It a good app but.... It‚Äôs a great app overall but I think that more clothes should be added I looked today and I could not find anything that interested me I realy would like to see some MLS Philadelphia Union to be more specific I think that if you have NHL then you should at least try to get MLS too
3755,nhjmc1,"July 29, 2019",4,Love this ap! Only one wish though..... For a free ap this ap is so awesome. As a HUGE Bruins fan I was stoked to see a Bruins outfit lol! Only one thing that could better this ap......be able to make your own emoji/saying course # of letters/numbers limited but how amazing would that be!!
3756,mg kitty,"July 21, 2019",4,Please make this teacher Do you put emoji could you please make a feature where you take a picture of yourself and it automatically turns into a bit emoji for you so it looks exactly like you thank you
3757,shloobertdoobert,"June 13, 2019",4,"good but needs more options i really love some of the outfits but i wish we could chose our own , like choose a shirt a a pair of shorts differently rather than choosing a whole outfit , if we could make that happen i would LOVE IT !!"
3758,terrao2005,"November 28, 2018",5,Love the messaging options! I‚Äôve loved using these so much more than basic emojis. The only complaint I have is the seriously lacking maternity clothing options!
3759,WaBang!,"December 14, 2018",4,"Bangs I love Bitmoji; it‚Äôs a great way to send messages to your friends but I‚Äôve had constant comments about my Bitmoji and how it doesn‚Äôt have bangs like me and I respond with ‚ÄúOh, none of the bangs have good styles.‚Äù I just wish there was better options for bangs!"
3760,WillowGeorgia,"December 23, 2018",4,Options I love it but I wish it had more outfits or custom outfits like pick a shirt then your own pants or shirts. I think it should over piercings or more things like that too because with out them my bitmoji isn‚Äôt really me.
3761,who cares abt the name,"December 26, 2018",4,"Cool app The apps great I‚Äôve had no problems with it but more options for customization would be cool like two different eye colors or more hair color/style options such as highlights or half and half styles, stuff like that"
3762,Beffieboo20,"December 27, 2018",4,"!!! ATTENTION !!! Ombr√© hair please I love Bitmoji! Always have, always will, EXCEPT for the fact that there is no ombr√© hair color option. Ombr√© hair is very in, it would be a simple 2 tone option, and make many people very happy. I‚Äôm begging for this, I just want my bitmoji to be as cute as I am. Thanks!"
3763,Bafffedle,"January 8, 2019",5,You did it. This is truly on the same level as sliced bread.

3765,Ifudyxvjrfnj,"February 8, 2019",4,"Need more options I love this app, everything is super funny. But my Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me until i get the facial piercings, without it it‚Äôs not the same. When will the piercings be added, and maybe more outfits."
3766,RecklessAndrey,"February 9, 2019",4,"More hairstyles Pls Can there be more hairstyles on the deluxe section? I need the emo haircut for my man, and other hairstyles in general for the people.

3767,randomreviw,"February 27, 2019",4,"Great App But This is a great app. I love creating my own little animated version of myself, and using it on Snapchat. The only thing that I would suggest is that you add piercings (ear,nose,belly button,etc). I like to make the Bitmoji look like myself, and my piercings are part of me."
3768,Bear1375,"August 5, 2018",4,More options I love using Bitmoji when I‚Äôm texting or snap chatting. I just wish there was an option to add a beauty mark when customizing my avatar. I have a very distinct beauty mark similar to Marilyn Monroe. Adding tattoo options would be cool too for people with tattoos!
3769,Bluechiffon,"August 31, 2018",4,"Make friendmoji available on iMessage! I love how there is a friendmoji feature on Snapchat, and it is so fun to use! However it will be even more cool to be able to use it brought iMessage with your friends! Because those friendmojis are super cute and fun to use!"
3770,Crichelle,"September 5, 2018",5,Great app. Some suggestions: I love this app! I think it would be even better if you could save multiple bitmoji on one device. My biggest suggestion is to enable the creation of pet bitmoji!! I want a bitmoji if my dog soooo badly!

3772,alyssacatdogs birds,"September 26, 2018",3,Love it but have some opinions I love Bitmoji but on the Bitmoji classic they don‚Äôt have a lot of options on hair then the do on the other ones I just wish they have more options on the hair for the classics I know I can use the other ones but I want the classic because they make it look like cartoons
3773,Phirrip de Asian,"October 2, 2018",5,"Just a suggestion A good suggestion, could we see a feature where you could wear the sports teams uniforms, an example being hockey, without the hat?"
3774,paigeyopoj,"October 4, 2018",5,Love it Love this app I use it all the time for snaps and messages the one thing that kinda bugs me is that there‚Äôs barely any outfits to pick from I mean there‚Äôs a lot but they should add more !
3775,Lindibur,"October 4, 2018",4,"I am frustrated! I love this app, but the last couple of times it has updated I have lost my avatar, and had trouble recreating it because so many things changed. Can‚Äôt you add without deleting looks?"

3777,LauPaige,"November 27, 2018",3,Please take my suggestion I love this because I can make my character cute an all... but I am a person with tattoos and many many piercings and I want to be able to show AT LEAST the piercings on my character too. It would be amazing. I‚Äôll give a 5 star when this happens
3778,llall,"May 19, 2018",4,Loads of fun......Just one thing I wish I could figure out a way to make it paste in a little smaller. It‚Äôs huge and takes up all the message or email space. I love to be able to use it a little more subtilely.
3779,Life11GT,"May 24, 2018",5,"Nice I love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs a great way to express your self and customize a character. There‚Äôs only one thing that I would like you to add... emo outfits. I would absolutely love for there to be emo outfits, otherwise, it‚Äôs amazing."

3781,Lina0027,"June 7, 2018",4,Good app! I like this app! Love my bitmoji! I would really like if I was able to change the colors of my outfit. The outfit selections are ok but I would really like the options of changing the color. Let‚Äôs make that happen with your next update! :)
3782,SmoothTiggerLove,"June 15, 2018",4,Love Bitmoji Use this constantly with friends and family. Need more updated clothes and more things to say. Also I would  like to see where I can copy & past in Instagram since that what I use a lot.
3783,Kyle's Desktop,"June 23, 2018",5,Needs more mustaches I love the app and its always convenient to use. But it needs more facial hair options. I'm a mustache connoisseur myself and the one option it gives me doesn't cut it.
3784,Hdbshdjghabsbsbs,"June 30, 2018",3,"Not enough options I like bitmoji very much but i have problems with the variety of options available. Firstly there is way too little hair options, i have kind of curly hair but kind of wavy and there is NO hair that is like me. Also, there are way too little body types."
3785,LKtrackstar (Player),"July 5, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs a great app, but... It‚Äôs a great app.. but I feel like the age rating is to high. 13 to dress an avatar that looks like you? Hmmmm.

3786,bbeerreettaa,"July 24, 2018",5,Happy I love Because it is fast and easy to use and I just love it üòªüòπüò∏üò∫üòΩ and for an improvement I will put different kinds of show rompers jumpsuits pants and shoes so people can make their own little outfit
3787,shayzoo,"July 31, 2018",3,"Why can‚Äôt I search. If it had a search feature I would give it 5 Stars. I ‚ù§Ô∏è Bitmoji, but it‚Äôs very frustrating trying to find a pic in the app.  I‚Äôll see it on Snapchat or FB, and then can‚Äôt find it in the Bitmoji app.  It‚Äôs ridiculous that you can search for Bitmojis in every app BUT the butmoji app."
3788,bobmarley fan,"February 14, 2018",5,Bitmoji Love the new upgrade #bitmojiforlifeüòõ also can you plz let us when we take pictures of our selves take picture from gallery
3789,SFJew415,"February 14, 2018",3,"Like the update but.... ....some of the new deluxe features are limited like the lips section. You only have 3 options! There are fuller lipped individuals that use this app. Also, they removed the crown as a headpiece. WE NEED THE CROWN....Different kinds too! Another suggestion for the deluxe: NEED to add an extensive wardrobe! Shoes, accessories, mix and match, the works!"
3790,ANANGANGEANGEL,"February 27, 2018",5,"Suggestion I absolutely love this app, but if I could make a suggestion, could we have some angel wings? And maybe a customized section for our clothes (we pick our own pants, shirts and shoes)?"
3791,KelliB_24,"March 6, 2018",5,BRACES!!! Love the app! But I have braces and a feel a lot of people that use Bitmoji have braces too and they want their Bitmoji to look more like them. So I want to see if you guys (or girls) could have braces in the next update. Thanks!
3792,neidamuzette,"March 9, 2018",3,"Expand I have always been a fan of Bitmoji ever since it came out. HOWEVER, coming from someone that doesn‚Äôt have a Snapchat, it would be nice to get all those features on Instagram as well as other social media sites. Just a suggestion! Still love the app though :)"
3793,Lex71791,"March 11, 2018",4,Love it but.. The only reason there is not 5 stars is because the bitmoji outfits are out to date always and I am HOPING that soon in iMessage we can have both bitmoji‚Äôs with the person you are messaging with. Meaning your bitmoji and the messenger‚Äôs bitmoji as well. PLEASE!!!!
3794,chunky@_@,"March 24, 2018",5,Love it but needs something else I used to have my hair down all the time but now i use braids and was wondering if a braid hairstyle could be added to make my bitmoji to look like me
3795,dhufnfj,"March 25, 2018",4,"Ok Listen it is a bit annoying to get to, BUT it is funny and helpful. I use it a lot and I like all the updates so far. You should get this app. But remember it is annoying to get to when you are texting."
3796,Imisnyou,"April 2, 2018",4,More hair style options I love this app and I‚Äôm religiously using it!!! But there is not enough curly hair style options or facial adjustment options for the new Bitmoji style ‚òπÔ∏è. Hair color also needs hair colors that are starting to turn white. Please add more options!!!
3797,Nadiah‚ù§Ô∏è,"May 6, 2018",4,Need some changes You should keep the original Bitmoji‚Äôs but make it so they‚Äôre better and you should ad a feature where they can have braces cause I would love that. And give them more clothes
3798,Nerdyyy555,"September 29, 2017",3,"Great App but needs help This app needs more variety with the outfits and with the emojis themselves.

3799,Elibigtrucks722,"October 27, 2017",3,Clothes malfunction The outfits are ridiculous that you‚Äôd see on a 2010 app. Pleaseeee do something about the clothes I‚Äôd wear none of it in real life. Give us an option to pick what shirt and jeans and shoes don‚Äôt make us choose by outfit. :( Shoes is a 2003 looking app. Come on now you guys can do better put more time into it üòÜ
3800,rjaybass,"December 2, 2017",4,Updates.. I dig this app. I use it a lot. Will you eventually restore the abilities it had when it was called Bitstrip? I chose my avatar and then my girlfriend‚Äôs avatar and I had us doing things together. Wishing our friends a happy birthday etc.. that would be nice.
3801,DrmrDee,"December 16, 2017",2,WTH happened?!?! I updated to the recent update and now I cannot send Bitmoji' in my text messages nor will it work with my Facebook. What the hell happened? Prior I used to just click the emoji button in text messages and select my Bitmoji and paste it into my text message now that no longer works nor does it work in Facebook.
3802,Chefgirltd0022,"December 25, 2017",4,"Fun I love it they are super fun, cute, and always making new ones. My only issue is I have a nose piercing and have had it for the last 4 years so I feel it it part of my appearance and I am not able to add that to my Bitmoji. Otherwise love it!"
3803,Johnsonmaemolly,"January 23, 2018",3,Needs more variety They need to have more options for hair and face characteristics. I can‚Äôt make my avatar look like me because of the lack of diversity. Everyone looks so different so I think they should have a larger variety of options to fit everyone‚Äôs unique features.
3804,Your favorite artist,"January 31, 2018",4,"Awesome!!! üëåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèΩ I seriously love the new Bitmoji style!

3911,Quimby315,"October 26, 2019",2,"Crashing? I‚Äôve deleted this app due to its recent failures/crashes. No clue, but I found the remedy for this is to delete and reinstall the app. I‚Äôve done this at least 3 times. This may also be an iOS 13 issue. I have another device using iOS 12 still and this app does not fail. For now I‚Äôll leave it deleted."

You can‚Äôt change all of your clothing such as pants or shirts....they make you choose a whole outfit which isn‚Äôt super terrible except for the fact you can‚Äôt change the colors of the clothes. I don‚Äôt know seems like in 2019 it should be a lot better.

3940,Cbyrd22,"November 1, 2018",4,Great app just needs a few adjustments I love this app! It‚Äôs so fun to use and I love the messages to send my friends especially on Snapchat. The only thing that I wish was that apparel could be individualized instead of whole outfits.
3941,Maeve4259lovedog,"November 3, 2018",4,Please read this So you know how you get an outfit already styled I think we should be able to pick our own shirts and pants so we can style are own outfit like blue shirt blue pants ext thanks for reading this hope the change that

3945,Hann999,"November 21, 2018",4,Great! I love this app especially when I use it on Snapchat. The only thing that bugs me is when you create your avatar and get to the hair section there‚Äôs only wavy hairstyles and super curly hairstyles. Fingers crossed that the next update will have regular curls!
3946,DubstepZebra,"November 24, 2018",5,Love it I love this app but could you add more outfits or hats. How about a customization mode where people can make their own outfits or hats and they can share them to the Bitmoji community
3947,Jihn Mem,"December 5, 2018",4,"More Outfits? I love Bitmoji. I have been using it for a very long time. However, there is one issue that I‚Äôve had with it. It‚Äôs that I want there to be a more diverse outfit. Maybe do some outfits with a trench coat? Because that‚Äôs more my type."

3950,Wires and bolts,"July 20, 2018",1,They removed most of the hats When I first got a Bitmoji for my Snapchat they had a gladiator helmet with other cool hats. But a few months later I check back at the bitmoji app and the first thing I notice when I go to see the hat selection all the original hats were gone and replaced by different colors of bandannas and hats and for some reason they put in backwards hat with there own color selection.
3951,xavieralright,"July 25, 2018",5,Best Thing Ever Made. They are so fun and have so many options it‚Äôs insane. I literally use them in my texts more than words these days. Love this idea and this app so much. Thank you!

3968,HollyGrovee,"February 8, 2018",5,Love the update I already liked Bitmoji before but now I love it because it added more ethnic hairstyles amongst other things. Now my Bitmoji can have the same hair I have when I wear it natural üòÅ

Just a customizable outfit would be awesome!"
3972,daised,"February 15, 2018",2,Not gender inclusive! Bitmoji I'm really disappointed in the new update. All the new options are great for cis folks but I think it's rather tone-deaf not to include a non-binary option for trans folks. Not everyone is a boy or a girl. Please consider being more inclusive in further updates. I personally love bitmoji but I have friends who cannot participate! Wouldn't it be great to gain more users...
3973,bella üî•,"February 24, 2018",5,One little upgrade I want This is still a 5 Star app no matter what but is there any way you could add a jewelry tab on it? That would seriously be the best thing ever!
3974,Cadn24,"February 25, 2018",2,"Not a fan of the updates. I have used Bitmoji for a while and had fun with it. The characters were more of a cartoon style which I preferred.  I was showing my niece the app and when I opened it to show her the creator, it changed my avatar to the new styling. I will most likely delete the app as it has lost the appeal it had for me in the first place."

3978,Crazytaty,"November 23, 2017",4,Great but room for improvement :] I think bitmoji it great. No issues with the app. I do wish they had more natural hair options like at least different fros. Also they should include tattoo and piercing choices to really customize your bitmoji.
3979,summers3639,"December 8, 2017",4,Great! I think this app it great I just have one little tiny tip if the creators read this is that I think they should make a braided hair style and have it around the front so you can see it I think that would be cute for the girl bitmojis
3980,Greengaze,"January 7, 2018",5,Great! Love this app - use it all the time!üëçüèª 
3981,Robert Pinter,"January 7, 2018",4,More accessories? I love all the options there are but maybe you can add arm/leg  accessories like if you have a broken you could put a cast on your bitmoji. That might be too dumb or too much work to do but just a small suggestion.
3982,ruvalo,"January 14, 2018",3,"More Customization NEEDED This app has so much potential, but all it is missing is more customization options. Clothing, hair, skin tones, etc. I am disappointed after every update due to the fact that there are never any customization options added."

3988,LoodaKrish,"September 5, 2017",4,"More outfits Love the app but the outfits need to be updated. Suggestion: now that the NFL is starting this week, maybe incorporate jerseys into the mix with all 32 teams? I am sure a lot of people would appreciate thus update. I think so. Go Lions!"

3990,osusig1,"September 18, 2017",4,Bitmoji editors read this There should be an option that if you press and hold on an outfit it gives you options of different varieties of colors
3991,boogersncheese,"September 21, 2017",5,New options recommendations I really like customizing my own bitmoji to look more like me. I was wondering if they could add wispy bangs to medium and long hair not those straight across bangs also more clothes choices woo~

4190,jlima6601,"February 6, 2018",5,"5 stars The apps pretty cool, I like the new update, I wish there was an option to put braces on my bitmoji so it would look more like me but other than that the apps good."

It may meet others needs just fine but let me tell you what my first reaction was to this app. ‚ÄúWhat?! Why aren‚Äôt their more options for body types?‚Äù Seriously though? WHY? Everything else about this app is pretty good but you need to work on the variety!
4192,david herreta,"February 8, 2018",4,Can you? I really enjoy these app I use it all the time but...I think something you. Guys could add on it would be more outfits and brands like supreme and bape and things like that it would make a big difference...THANK you!

4203,Rocky Swain,"November 4, 2017",4,I WANT MORE This is by far the best emoji program out there but it needs to updated.. 3D Bitmoji that appears in snap chat should be permanent feature.

4206,Cat life 6,"December 12, 2017",5,Update suggestion My suggestion is that we should be able to customize the hight of the bitmoji and add more details such as more details to the ears like hearing aids so that it looks more lifelike for people with hearing aids.

4229,mzsinn1,"April 20, 2019",3,New things to add I think this app usually is pretty good but there needs to be more hairstyles and hair colors added because some people don‚Äôt have the same color hair or the hairstyle the Bitmoji offers like mei have a military cut and I think it‚Äôs dumb that that‚Äôs not an option

4233,mystic_tal,"August 13, 2019",4,"More vairety The app itself is really good, but i think there should have more variety. For example the hair selection doesn't really have a variety for curly hair while it has different styles for straight and wavy hair."

4504,Mon s≈ìur,"October 16, 2017",4,"Needs animals The app is great, but there should be an option to customize what your pet is. For example, when it puts the Bitmoji character in a cat costume, it should be able to look like your pet cat."

4509,babyygurl_h_o_p_e,"September 4, 2017",2,More clothing choices for gay people I wear guy clothes. It's 2017 gay is normal we should be able to pick whatever clothes we want not girlie girl clothes because we are girls. And for the other gay girls that have there guy hair cuts what about that too. Or gay guys? I love the app but get with the program and let us choose whatever clothes we want then it would be 5+ stars.
4510,Puppiegirly,"April 24, 2020",4,"More choices I love bitmoji, but I have some feedback, maybe you can add a longer straight hair but with a bit wave in it and a light brown, between the dark blonde and the lightest blonde. Also, maybe provide a light blue skintone? Thank you :)"

4521,Maag14,"December 28, 2019",4,"Bitmoji I think you should add some sort of games on the app. Also I think you should have a better variety of hair styles, like long braids and short braids. Other than that I think it‚Äôs a great app."

My hair is half blue and half black. Not to mention my hair is a few inches above my shoulders and I have bangs as well as curly/ fluffy hair. But more short hair options would be nice.

4539,Drew600000007,"February 17, 2019",3,"Decent app but needs improvements I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for two years now, and it‚Äôs worked great. It needs a feature for the user to change the shoes without changing the whole outfit and then it will be perfect"
4540,Girl party,"February 17, 2019",4,"Great app I like the app it has many options for a bunch of different hair but i would like it better if there were more options for straight shoulder length hair and there be more ""trendy"" clothing styles"

4546,WillShakes1564,"May 3, 2019",4,"Perfect except for headwear Tons of options and super user friendly! My one qualm is with the hats: unless you pick a very short hairstyle, hair always pokes out over the hat instead of being covered by it."
4547,Ninjale21,"May 13, 2019",4,Fun but hey what about... The Bitmojis being searchable in the actual app?! Ill see one I want to use in snap chat or something but what a pain to go through each one one the app. Can you add that on the next update please?

4553,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaabom,"December 26, 2018",5,Face ID Not really a complaint I just think it would be really cool if people with phones that have Face ID on them could use that with their Bitmoji. Now THAT would be really cool
4554,AvaJN,"January 5, 2019",5,Bitmoji I love Bitmoji! I use it all the time. Most of my friends have it too. One suggestion I have is to be able to customize your own outfit. But besides that it‚Äôs great.
4555,SoniqPwny,"January 5, 2019",4,PLEASE add search capability to the app! New stuff fairly regularly but I‚Äôm frustrated that you can‚Äôt search within the actual app. You can only search within the texting app.
4556,Coconut~cat,"January 22, 2019",4,Hair Really love the customizing ability but I‚Äôd love more different coloring placement options in the hair. I‚Äôd really love to have an option where you can have your hair two colors on the halves of your head (like Melanie Martinez I guess).

4562,Leslie8333,"August 25, 2018",3,Glitch? I don‚Äôt know why but when I use this app on my tablet there is way more options than on my phone. Usually his wouldn‚Äôt bug me but idk why it‚Äôs not allowing me to use those new features and I do have the app up to date
4563,Grjahrhsbxjdh,"August 28, 2018",5,I Love it This app is wonderful nothing wrong for me but I know it already has lots of good stickers but I think they should add more question like stickers as well.
4564,Worksworksworks,"September 18, 2018",4,WE NEED MORE OUTFITS! This would be a five star rating if the clothing was able to be chosen separately by piece and if there were more options. Also the app could use more body type variations as well!
4565,a.rosey,"September 20, 2018",5,"Bitmoji suggestion We need some bitmojies that support or promote sobriety. There are more than a few  bitmojies that promote or include alcohol, drinking and happy hour. Just consider we should have equal amounts of sober living bitmojies!"

4613,Sidward99,"March 20, 2020",4,Avatar I love the bitmoji and use it every day just about. The thing is you should have more inclusive facial hair options. I am a guy who has facial hair but it‚Äôs really light. You should have a thin facial hair option with a thin mustache included.

4620,G constanza,"December 23, 2019",5,Love Love Love... could we get Absolutely Love Bitmoji. Could we get to be able to toggle between 2 different languages. 
4621,appreviewer941,"December 18, 2019",3,Facial appearance I love Bitmoji but a few changes that I suggest would be to have longer hair. My hair is a lot longer than the options that are available. Another random edit would be the size of people‚Äôs forehead and their height.
4622,AVGdfjcrj,"December 16, 2019",3,Why Won‚Äôt The Update Work I have updated Bitmoji to its newest version and I still don‚Äôt have the mix and match option. I have the new layout of the app but when I click on the hanger all I have are the pre set outfits. PLZ fix this!
4623,xoxo Sherlock was here,"December 10, 2019",4,"Really good The only problem I have is that there aren‚Äôt enough options to fit what I wear. I‚Äôm a bootcut jeans, cowboy boots, and a hoodie kinda person. Having more options for the country kids would be great."
4624,unicorndragon623,"December 1, 2019",4,Great... but one complaint I LOVE this app so good! My only thing with it is that well I think you should be able to make a couple Bitmojis without deleting your old one but other than that you ROCK!!!
4625,Bubu babe,"November 30, 2019",5,"Nice It works, works well on snapchat. just writing this to recommend they add more curly hair styles. Very limited on those and the ones provided aren‚Äôt exactly cute..."
4626,bivaaaaa,"September 29, 2019",4,Braces i think we should be able to change are teeth or at least put braces on it. many people have braces and it would be a great addition to the app.
4627,Swimergurl_rock,"September 21, 2019",5,OMG IM OBSESSED! OMG! It‚Äôs such a great app. It‚Äôs so much fun making a cartoon character that looks just like me! The stickers are so cute! I just kind of wish that you could make more than one. But other than that AMAZING!!!

4629,#i‚ù§Ô∏èüç™,"June 5, 2019",4,Ok It‚Äôs a cool app but I didn‚Äôt like it after a while because it can access all of your messages. They also need to have something to search with in the app.
4630,Mia.345,"September 6, 2019",4,Need some additions. I love this app and use my bitmoji alot on snapchat. One thing I‚Äôd like to see is the variety of hairstyles. There‚Äôs are very limited and similar hairstyles for long hair. It would be great to see more options.
4631,sillyian,"July 23, 2019",5,Melanie ‚ù§Ô∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüôÇ Ok so I love bitmojii the app but the problem is Like I kinda wish they would describe the bitmojii for you ONLY because like I can‚Äôt find a lot of stuff that‚Äôs for me like the faces HAIR style etc. So yeah
4632,DThreepio,"July 20, 2019",5,Great app I love this app so much!!! I just wish you could add new clothing to chose from for your avatar. I like how Bitmoji goes with Snapchat. I suggest you should add braces and or earings or jewelry. But it really is a great app!!!
4633,CJ Chan 846293037,"July 19, 2019",2,"Seriously? I mean I love idea and all, but it doesn‚Äôt work at all. It keeps crashing and when I‚Äôm trying to send something from it, even when I search something as basic as ‚Äúhello‚Äù it says no results. I can‚Äôt use this app at all, because it won‚Äôt let me select ANYTHING. Very disappointing."
4634,gabby utt,"July 14, 2019",4,"Love it! I love this app. It‚Äôs great! I just wish they had a color spectrum or you could choose colors and mix and match shorts and shirts etc. Also, they don‚Äôt have my side bangs. They have straight across bangs, but none look like mine. GET SIDE BANGS üòÇüòÇ"
4635,MK@Mal,"July 9, 2019",4,Love it but... I would like ripped jeans and you can choose your own clothes. Like a white sweatshirt with a blue T-shirt and black ripped jeans. Because people have WAYYY more options. You can make your Bitmoji more you. Most of the outfits aren‚Äôt me .
4636,JBCtx,"July 9, 2019",4,I use it daily! Always variety BUT... I love the fact I can search images when I am in the process of sending messages 
4637,NESSER2,"June 11, 2019",4,"I love it, but here‚Äôs a suggestion Can we have more- mildly sad bitmoji. Like for the status ones on Snapchat, could we get one of our bitmoji just sitting crosslegged on the ground look sad. I don‚Äôt know, it would just be nice."
4638,cornsnake1232,"January 31, 2019",4,Just ok... I love Bitmoji so much! But a lot of the times it glitches out and it doesn‚Äôt load.i would like to change my avatar but it won‚Äôt let me‚ÄºÔ∏è I love the app but some stuff needs to be fixed... üòê

4640,Shar*K,"February 24, 2019",5,Curls I absolutely love bitmoji! I love having the friends keyboard to text bitmojis between friends. I would love to see more wavy/curl hairstyles and more maternity options.  Keep up the good work!!
4641,cyd_cate,"March 8, 2019",3,"Outfits The lack of western outfits is a tad annoying. I have 1 outfit to choose from in 3 colors. After a few years, the outfit gets really old. You could do so much a western wear - boots, jeans, tank top - throw some chaps in there - bell bottom pants. These are a few but there are so so many!!! Add them."
4642,Taylor Bleu,"April 3, 2019",3,Pretty good It's OK I'd say. Bitmoji is a pretty good idea and app over all but there aren't a lot of options for hair and not a lot of hair color options either as well as clothing. If you could update it and add a few more options for those things it would be great!
4643,its okaaaaay,"April 14, 2019",5,"Suggestions Bitmoji is great, but one thing that would make it better is to have an option to put braces on your bitmoji."
4644,mander0529,"April 18, 2019",3,Information Why do you need to turn on the option on the keyboard . It says that credit cards / passwords maybe available? Why would I want to use this if my information will be at ease?
4645,Dakota Gamble,"April 19, 2019",4,"Great! Bitmoji is great! You should add nose piercings though! Nose studs and/or Nose rings! Also, you should add a Red graduation had and outfit! Lastly, you should have a bar that you can move up and down to show how high or low you want your hair colors to blend :)!"
4646,Re Garcia,"April 22, 2019",5,so FUN i had snapchat and i had no picture i found bitmoji and they made me and my brother! and we played games on snapchat and also my aunt me and my aunt texted to bitmoji is the BEST
4647,This is a very happy birthday,"April 26, 2019",4,Read this Great app I just think there should be more teen clothing options like what I wear on a daily basis I think girls should have hoodies that can go on their head while wearing yoga pants with boots or slides just saying but the app is amazing and funny
4648,dancer.ballerina12,"November 30, 2018",4,Favorites There are soooo many adorable outfits! I‚Äôd love for you to be able to ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù outfits and have them more accessible. Some of my favorite ones are way at the bottom. Please respond...

4652,Yogini73,"January 2, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs cool, but need more body types So this app is cool- I like the variety on options for the emojis.  For the most part it looks like a person, but the body options, especially if you‚Äôre a woman are limited.  If your curvy, with a booty, no option here.  They are all too heavy.  :("

4657,yeegirlkat,"January 27, 2019",5,I love it!! Bitmoji is awesome! I love how accurate you can be with the app as well. I‚Äôve used it ever since Snapchat had the option to make one and now it‚Äôs a permanent installment. It‚Äôs awesome.
4658,JerJerWalker,"September 28, 2018",1,"0/10 Can‚Äôt make anime characters I want to try to make characters from my favorite anime‚Äôs but I never can because Bitmoji might not have the right hairstyle, outfit, or accessory. If you would actually add more stuff that allows for more customization options that would make it easier to make the characters I want to make, then I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it."
4659,akb4,"October 16, 2018",4,"More options I use my bitmoji all the time, in messages and on Snapchat! I would like for there to be more options for outfits, especially maternity. Also, different eye shapes!"
4660,UpseyDaisy,"October 20, 2018",4,Bitmoji Rocks! I love dropping these into my graphics on FB and IG.  Been using it for years. Why not five stars?  Would love a search engine so I didn‚Äôt have to scroll through all the pics to find what I need.
4661,Junior has it,"October 30, 2018",5,"Could use some more stuff I Love this app. It‚Äôs creative. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs amazing. Puts me in a loop. Please add a bandana.

4664,abby696969,"November 14, 2018",3,"Love the app but... I love the features on this app, but they need more outfits with unisex genders because I don‚Äôt look good in a crop top in real life so why would I bother to put one on on the app and I still look bad? Please just give us some hoodies and ripped jeans and just call it a day."
4665,Blitz Bolt9000,"November 15, 2018",5,Very good app This app is amazing especially if you have Snapchat. One thing tho. I think it would be real cool if they add earrings to the ears selection section. Imagine how cool that would be

So I accidentally hit the star and then submit without looking at what I was doing. So I haven‚Äôt even been able to use it to know anything about it! So if you could delete it then that would be great. And then I can give a a good look. And honest opinion. Thank You
4678,OhDearErica,"April 17, 2018",3,"What happened to the other ethnic hairstyles? Literally 30 minutes ago, there were some really nice curly and ethnic hair styles. But after exiting out of Snap and then coming back in to finish my Bitmoji, that hair style and a few others just disappeared."
4679,FreckledCupcake,"April 21, 2018",4,Very fun but could be more I love this app it is fun as heck. Feedback would be more adjustments for body types I am super curvy hour glass figure and it isn‚Äôt an option. Also wish they had hot topic clothes or 50s pinnup girl type clothing

4702,Dylan Lawrence 737284,"December 19, 2017",4,It‚Äôs a good app BUT... This app need more ways to express yourself from the wardrobe. Like I really wish y‚Äôall would add the feature were guys can have earring this has really been bothering me for the longest time. 
4703,Poop254,"February 5, 2018",4,"Treatment problem~ Elysa I have recently downloaded the updated bitmoji app and it‚Äôs AMAZING, the different hair options are wonderful. But I have a problem on my app there is no ‚Äútreatment‚Äù selection, please help me with this problem, thanks.~Elysa"
4704,Leo Levinstein,"February 5, 2018",4,"Would rate 5 but... Theres just a few things missing, (in my opinion) such as some of the headwear not useable in the new style such as the arrow through the head, and just a suggestion, add red and blue lensed 3d glasses and the frames are black"
4705,??*,"February 7, 2018",3,Old version is better I don‚Äôt like the way the new version looks with the realistic looks. The older version was better and you should at least be able to pick between the two!!
4706,My Tmobile,"February 9, 2018",5,I‚Äôm in love with this app I adore all the new features and changes made. It‚Äôs one of my favorite applications. The features are very sleek and simple to use and unique
4707,Orangepineapplelyfe,"February 10, 2018",4,"Great app, just wish there were more Silly costumes to choose from. That‚Äôs literally my only complaint. This recent update was good, and hopefully we‚Äôll see more clothes and stuff come out."
4708,Erikd13,"October 17, 2017",5,More outfits You should be able to dress it how you want from the selection of cloths already in the app
4709,Blue~<3,"October 17, 2017",3,It never loads It‚Äôs okay over Snapchat but when ever I try to change something on my bitmoji it wont let me change anything and always says network error no matter what day or time I try to do it on the actual app.
4710,WhiteBoi312,"October 22, 2017",3,"Add college football team outfits I love the app itself, i love the Bitmoji I made but I don‚Äôt really have a favorite nfl team, I like college teams but there‚Äôs no college teams on there, I personally think the app would be a lot better if they put the college teams on there"
4711,tepisale,"October 23, 2017",5,Amazing. Fun. Engaging! This is so much fun and certainly great choices for most anything I want to express. Please add more hair styles and a color wheel instead of specific choices if possible!
4712,schwiftyrick,"November 1, 2017",5,iOS 11.2.0 beta I have iOS beta and the bitmoji app is not compatible with the new update and continues to crash while starting up.
4713,2centpenny,"November 5, 2017",3,Lagging Constant loading fails. Lagging daily to the point that you can‚Äôt even get an image to come up. Was pretty cool but not sure if it‚Äôs the IOS update that has caused this or changes within app. Hopefully a fix will come soon. Otherwise great app!
4714,Jac-be-nimble,"November 7, 2017",5,Friend Bitmoji I loveee the stickers but you should create an option in settings to make a friend bitmoji so they can be in the stickers when using them in messenger.
4715,xXjustdoingitXx,"November 12, 2017",5,"Great app!! Everything is just perfect but maybe have a larger clothing selection, and where you can actually customize your bitmoji by choosing your shoes, shirt, pants."
4716,Long Space Dog,"November 18, 2017",4,"More hair colors It would be five stars, but I change my hair color frequently, and sometimes there isn‚Äôt a matching color. There is absolutely no purple, which is frustrating."
4717,gomez973,"November 30, 2017",5,"Fun to use Bitmoji is extremely fun to use. Only thing I‚Äôll ask to include in next update is ability to send bitmojis with other peoples bitmojis , just like on Snapchat."
4718,Franco Capone Jr,"September 21, 2017",3,"3 of 5 Stars I‚Äôll give you the other 2 Stars once you finally add sleeve tattoos to the skin, please. Bitmoji is awesome, and a lot of them look similar to the actual person creating them. But I would love to have my sleeve tattoos (real life), animated for my Bitmoji. That would be the next best update."
4719,Imarii W,"September 25, 2017",4,Variety I‚Äôm a fan of this app but I just wish there was more variety. From hairstyles to clothing options. Hopefully you can bring more variety into your next update.

4723,Tessa Haley,"March 19, 2020",4,"Needs better curly hair options Most of the hair options are straight. If they‚Äôre not straight, they‚Äôre type 4c hair. I‚Äôd greatly appreciate if there were 3a-3c hair. I have extremely curly hair, but I‚Äôm white as milk. It‚Äôs just not like black hair."
4724,breadisgood44,"December 12, 2019",3,"Very customizable, but could use a few improvements I think either gender should have access to any wardrobe they want. Like why can‚Äôt I make my male bitmoji wear a dress ya know. I think we live in a world where our bitmoji‚Äôs don‚Äôt need to conform to society‚Äôs expectations of gender norms."
4725,stacemar84,"November 28, 2019",4,"Love Bitmoji.. Love it. It‚Äôs lots of fun, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs entertaining and all, but I wish we could customize more of the clothing. I‚Äôd like to choose my own colors and mix match the tops and bottoms. Aside from that, I enjoy it every time I use it."

4727,All Mighty Haze,"October 20, 2019",4,"Lack of facial features The app is amazing and all, but lack on the facial features and some popular hair styles. For example, I can‚Äôt even put my goatee on my avatar cause they don‚Äôt have it. Goatee is all I can grow üòî."
4728,whosebad!,"September 22, 2019",3,Mix and match Would be better if we are able to mix and match. Once this is available I‚Äôll change it to 5 stars other than that I have no problem with this app. Bitmoji please listen to us!
4729,future bit emoji designer,"September 16, 2019",3,Who designs the outfits?? Do they work 3 days a year?? need to fire that person. Only bad thing about bit emoji is outfits hardly update and some outfits are cool but the shoes are lame or doesn‚Äôt match. Should be able to pick shirt and pants and shoes separately. Need more choices
4730,CCAWESOMMESS,"September 14, 2019",5,Wardrobe I love Bitmoji but on the outfits we should be able to make our own outfits like maybe someone wants that shirt but don‚Äôt like the pants also the hair MORE STYLES PLEASE and MORE COLORS and choice of dyes
4731,MaggieüòáLinküòÅ,"September 11, 2019",5,Why I love Bitmoji I love this app because it gives me the freedom to express myself and my personality. I also get to make my friends laugh at my because of my bitmoji.
4732,whyisQnicknametaken,"September 8, 2019",2,"Okay, but could be better There‚Äôs a lack of curly hair options in terms of textures, length, updo styles, and volume in comparison to straight or wavy hair options. Also, there are only 3 mouth options for the deluxe whereas the bitstrips had significantly more. When putting hats on bitmojis, the hair is not adjusted to fit, so then it looks like the hat is unrealistic."
4733,human1473,"September 8, 2019",4,"Great app but there should be some changes I use this app a lot but I think there should be braces and earrings available. Also, I would love if there were more headband options."
4734,lil_peep_jr,"August 31, 2019",5,Can you make it so you can dye every hair with 2 colors Can you make every hair two colors so it‚Äôs better then certain hairs cuts
4735,Kdbvoss,"August 16, 2019",4,I like a lot of the options This is a pretty cool thing but I wish their were more texture options for the curly hair styles. And more options on a few of them as far as length.
4736,Love2k17,"August 7, 2019",4,"New clothes I love the app but I feel like we need accessories, more hairstyles, and be able to choose our clothing instead of them being given to us as outfits"

4739,MadiValenz,"May 5, 2019",3,"Awesome! Bitmoji is a really fun app, but it got boring for me- no new options were added and everything was the same old stuff. I just feel like Bitmoji needs more options, such as braces, more clothes, a variety of jewelry, and more. Overall, Bitmoji is pretty good."
4740,Kat3r1f1c,"May 13, 2019",4,"Search I love the Bitmoji app, but I would really like it if there was a search feature in the actual app. This would make it a lot easier to actually find the Bitmoji I wanna use."
4741,ActiveFlipper,"May 17, 2019",5,Add Women‚Äôs Buzzcut! I love Bitmojis they‚Äôre so much fun. But I am a female with a buzz cut and I just wish there was a female shaved option. The buzz cut looks in the men section don‚Äôt really suit me or look like what I have. Just a recommendation!
4742,alyssa bn,"May 24, 2019",4,"bitmoji - This app is super cute and cool to use with friends over Snapchat . Only problem is that there should be more African/Black hairstyles in the hair customization... Maybe different textures , or a way to customize length ."
4743,Giraffe_Loverü¶íüíú,"July 24, 2019",4,"Great, but... I like Bitmoji a lot. I just wish there were more hairstyles. I also wish you could pick your own clothes instead of just having complete outfits."

4745,KingJonathan.p,"July 9, 2019",5,Great app I love this app. I can change many things on it. I wish Bitmoji would put jewelry so you can customize it even more.

4748,kaleigh226,"January 31, 2019",4,I love it but one suggestion I love the bitmoji app and me and my friends all use it. If I could improve it more I would suggest adding earrings to the bitmoji deluxe style and maybe have more outfits with sweatshirts and pull overs but I love this app
4749,glory_sk,"February 2, 2019",4,Decent It‚Äôs good for things like Snapchat but the reason that I gave it a four is there‚Äôs not much to do with bitmoji other then when u want to text ppl and use it for ur profile pic on snap
4750,cactusdaddy1,"February 6, 2019",4,More hairstyles Ok I really love the bitmoji styles that we now get to choose from. But I would really appreciate it if you guys gave the option for more kinds of braids such as pigtail braids and etc pleaseeee ok that‚Äôs all thanks for reading :)
4751,BillieJoeSwansonson,"February 8, 2019",3,New Outfit Options I think to make this app better you should make things more customizable by making your tops changeable to your pants that you want or making the hair on your Bitmoji disappear when you put a big hat on
4752,haytetstet,"February 16, 2019",5,üôÇ I love it but one thing I want is to be able to create our own Bitmoji not like the characters but the meme type deals
4753,millenial,"March 4, 2019",3,"Data access w/bitmoji keyboard The emojis work great, but as long as developers have access to my personal data - including bank info - I will not turn on keyboard. I‚Äôd rather pay more for the app than give access to my data."
4754,JillMcLuck,"March 12, 2019",1,"Fun app, but..... I used to love this app when I first downloaded it. The last couple months I have tried using it and keep getting a ‚Äúlogin attempt failed, try again later‚Äù whenever I try logging in.

4757,Jackie and friend,"April 7, 2019",3,Where are the braces !? I like the app it‚Äôs really cool but there‚Äôs only one flaw about it. It has everything but a teeth option!

4763,Tigerpuff7,"December 31, 2018",4,ü¶Ñ Honestly I love the hair styles!But I feel like bitmoji needs to add more hairstyle for long hair people and half up and half down with a bun on top but with long hair and more outfits for collage football but overall I love the app!
4764,Pammysue758,"January 3, 2019",5,Great app! So much fun but it needs a search added! I don‚Äôt want it in my keyboard because it says it has access to ALL my info in my texts!!!!!! Please add search! üôèüèº

4772,FBullock,"September 9, 2018",4,Awful maternity options Love the app but very disappointed in the lack of options for pregnant women. Only 6 options and half of them are workout clothes. No fashion options.
4773,Hidhehbg,"September 21, 2018",5,Fun I love the Bitmoji they‚Äôre so cute. I think it would be even cooler if they could add facial piercings into it. I feel like that would add a lot of fun things for people to mess around with

4806,kingOfDaMonkeys,"March 7, 2018",4,One thing All i think is there should be more clothes and the option to mix and match items how ever you like and then it would be five stars
4807,Darlene_Phx,"March 17, 2018",4,Wardrobe You need to add more clothing styles and to keep up with all holidays. Here it is St. Patrick‚Äôs Day and still no special attire.  Soon it will be Easter. Are you going to update the outfits then?  I like the app but you‚Äôve got to keep up with the trends.
4808,.h.y.u.n.a.,"October 13, 2017",4,Clothing Alterations Can we choose our own tops and bottoms and shoes instead of having to choose from a whole outfit? I'd like to mix and match different tops and bottoms to make the outfit my own. I think that‚Äôd be nice. Thank you!
4809,ian is bigfoot,"October 24, 2017",5,Suggestions I like the app but I feel like they should add more clothes that people would actually wear and they‚Äôre adding sports sections for clothes but they should add a NCAA section

4819,Really impressed but,"September 9, 2017",5,"Amazing keyboard and app! I would highly reccomend this app for anyone who loves customization in their emojis! The 1 thing I'd reccomend is that the game should add braces for your teeth or casts. But other than that, amazing app and keyboard!!"
4820,Cyeagz,"September 17, 2017",3,I like it ... but I'd love the option for more builds. I'm definitely in between lol. I'm too big to be a smaller one. But not at all built like the big one.

4835,creamcheeseüòò,"September 19, 2019",4,Vsco and E-girl I just think Y‚Äôall should have e-girl and vsco girl outfits! It would make the app 10 million times better and you would getter better ratings! Everyone wants the outfits!

4842,VFlaca67,"August 7, 2019",4,We want more! I love using this app. However I think it would be great if they added more clothing options for special occasions and perhaps a way we can creat our own outfit!
4843,ExpectingMother,"August 2, 2019",4,Maternity Option Love that there are maternity clothes options on the app but could there be an actual maternity option under body type? That way pregnant girl bitmojis can wear All the clothes. Thanks!
4844,azhev22,"July 13, 2019",2,"Needs more I love this app, however me and many poeple I know want to see more longer hair styles.  There‚Äôs plenty of short hair lengths and only a few longer hairstyles.  We‚Äôd love to see styles like, curls with a middle part, beachy waves with both a side part and a middle part.  Even French braids or Dutch braids would be really cool to see."
4845,blackB12bug,"July 4, 2019",4,Good Bitmoji is one of my favorite apps but when I was 9 my mom put restrictions on that I can only do things my age or under so I couldn‚Äôt use bitmoji so I feel like they should make a bitmoji for younger people
4846,The Girl You Know 2006,"June 15, 2019",4,Braces????? Hi I love Bitmoji but I feel like there are things they should add. A lot of people have braces and you can‚Äôt put braces on your Bitmoji. I would like the app a lot more if they added braces so your avatar can look more like you.
4847,blyncc,"June 10, 2019",5,Good but maybe something to add The app is great but it would be cooler if you could change the color of the outfit chosen. Other than that the app is awesome.
4848,tallbuddy21,"January 19, 2019",3,"My opinion In my opinion I think Bitmoji is awesome, it is son fun to use with your friends. But I think there needs to be more options like hairstyles, hats, and definitely more outfits. Well that‚Äôs just my opinion, I don‚Äôt know if you feel the same way."
4849,MarlaE,"January 23, 2019",3,"Great as a plug-in, frustrating on its own Hundreds and hundreds of well-designed Bitmojis, but without search, ‚Äúa huge library‚Äù is more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. Only practical if you‚Äôre using it in another app via the keyboard."

4854,Dusick,"March 16, 2019",4,"Good but.... I think you should make it so your bitmoji can have braces, since a ton of people have braces, also there should be more clothes, or you can customize your own clothes."

4874,Spaceghoul(;A:),"September 5, 2018",4,Gender Neutral Options? I enjoy bitmoji but it doesn‚Äôt allow for a lot of gender neutral outfits or accessories? Or even just the base body? It would be a lot better to have the ability to fully customise.

4880,Gianna Yami,"May 17, 2018",4,Some suggestions Love bitmoji but please make it to where we can change the individual garments instead of picking a whole outfit (ex. Make it to where I can wear a Cubs shirt with ripped jeans) that would make it a lottttt better
4881,Xberlin,"June 10, 2018",3,"Why all the changes??????? Love the app overall but really dislike the recent changes: no more spike hairstyle for females, only heavy and large eye glass styles, not enough facial lines for senior faces. Come on! Not every one is young with long hair, smooth face and oversized eye glasses. You should include hip older people."

4893,Eemamma,"March 16, 2018",4,"iPad? I just started using this at the suggestion of a friend. I enjoy it so far, but I‚Äôm seriously disappointed that I can‚Äôt use this app on my iPad. The Bitmoji apps for iPad all charge and don‚Äôt function as a keyboard."

When it was pulled off the app, it defeats the purpose being able to express creativity ourselves on Snapchat."

4913,RUUNNNERRR,"September 28, 2017",4,"Bitmoji is great BUT In my opinion I think that the clothing the bitmojis wear should be more fun to accessorize.

4914,Haus1984,"October 5, 2017",4,Outfits Love Bitmoji. Wish you could mix and match clothes. I see outfits with good pants but a weird shirt. And then a nice shirt with weird pants. If I could pick the shirt and pants separately I'd have a perfect outfit.

4919,Dazigurl01,"April 28, 2020",1,Outfits Bitmoji is really annoying lately.  I hate that they took all the cute harvest outfits out and put in five ugly options.  They used to have a really cute outfit with a scarf blue plants and now they don‚Äôt have it anymore and it was my favorite one and I hate how you can‚Äôt add a scarf to your outfit.  Thinking about deleting it because it is just really frustrating.

Did someone forget or was it decided to  discriminate against a whole group of people solely based on their desire to  celebrate a particular religious holiday? Doesn‚Äôt somehow seem ethical.  Can we say prejudicial?"
5225,sillygirl400,"December 7, 2019",4,Bitmoji is great but... I personally think Bitmoji is a great app however I want to make my own clothing and mix and match a little and I think it would be really great if you fixed that
5226,bitmoji!!!!,"November 15, 2019",4,Adjustments Love this app but personally I would prefer a app with Hair like mine and also more clothes so my Bitmoji can be stylish so I wanted to address you and say that your game is good but it needs to improve
5227,Kiss my bic,"November 15, 2019",4,"Needs more customization I wish eventually this app will allow people to be in but mojo relationships or dating or married, and if you have kids make kid mojis to be with your bitmoji"
5228,mostafa1997,"November 13, 2019",4,Stick It's can‚Äôt open with old versions was great seriously but now is nothing hope better this version
5229,EmyEVERETT,"October 21, 2019",5,Great app! This app is awesome! You can make yourself and send pictures of them to your friends and family!
5230,OOfeRs226,"October 2, 2019",4,What to do You should make a typical high school student section and have like gothic and vsco girls or the virginity rocks hoodie and make it more relatable to the people who use it and give better hair style options
5231,Forrealdude,"September 14, 2019",4,Make our own outfits It‚Äôs a great app and super fun but it would be better if we could make our own outfits! None of the ones on here are my style it‚Äôs sucky:/
5232,_Netta16,"August 9, 2019",4,Great but... Love that I can customize it to resemble me but it would be so much better if there were more female hairstyles such as more BRAID styles because there‚Äôs only two and uhm we wear much more different styles. Much more
5233,Harry J The Magicman,"July 31, 2019",5,"Bitmoji app I love this app. My lady friend loves the little guy more than me. It makes her laugh and comment about how it makes her feel. Hmmmm, I better watch out."
5234,Kendall Cubas,"July 25, 2019",5,Bitmoji Ideas Ok so I was thinking they could add more plain colors to eyeshadow and more hairstyles!I think a whole section of swimsuits would be nice also. :) ~Kendall
5235,Meganleighh,"July 20, 2019",4,"Great app I love Bitmoji, but honestly y‚Äôall need to come out with some new clothes. The summer clothes came out last year as well as most of the other clothes. We need options people"
5236,rainbow_ panda_ is_awsome,"July 17, 2019",5,Awesome game!!!! I love this game so much I love the clothes and the hair is amazingly realistic and cute I‚Äôm constantly changing my avatar and my friends love the amazing app please never change this game!!‚ù§Ô∏è
5237,RaSte06,"June 14, 2019",3,Why??? Why does this app have to be for older people? My kids have always wanted this app but they cant have it. Im not going to LIE about there age because that not good. Other wise this app is okay. But this app only available for older people I DON'T like.
5238,Ruthi922,"February 18, 2019",5,Not on it yet It is still loading
5239,dontlikethegamebutido,"February 22, 2019",4,It‚Äôs ok It‚Äôs ok but they just need to add accessory‚Äôs and put the different types of clothing in different sections because they just give you one whole outfit and sometimes it‚Äôs not in your interest
5240,ima clucker,"March 26, 2019",5,GREAT This app is likely used for Snapchat that‚Äôs how I found it and it is great you cans design your character in so many different ways
5241,Rad blook,"March 30, 2019",4,More hair types I wish that there were more hairstyles for curly hair!! I have always wanted more options as the current ones are limited and do not represent me very well.
5242,TerriH85,"April 1, 2019",4,More clothes choices We should be able to mix and match outfits and need updated ones !
5243,Breezyboo566,"April 2, 2019",4,Customize clothing I love the app. Never had any issues . It would be very cool if we could create our own outfits instead of just choosing one we like . üòÑ
5244,mixed irish beauty üçÄ,"April 6, 2019",5,New hair styles I love bitmoji been having it for the pass few years. But it would be nice if they had more hair styles for the female bitmoji. Add more braiding hair styles like box braids or lemonade braids to the hair styles.
5245,PoopyGamesSuckNoobs,"April 25, 2019",5,Amazing I like the app because it does not glitch but the internet wipes out so I‚Äôm sad about that but besides that there‚Äôs not complaints
5246,fruslyf,"May 6, 2019",3,What happened to previous purchases I purchased several theme packages and can no longer find them. Would certainly like to use my GoT‚Äôs emojis but they are no where to be found.
5247,Britwhit198,"May 16, 2019",1,"Network connectivity Every time i try to use the app, it says no network connectivity. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong the app. I also have tried changing my password but it won‚Äôt let me saying the email address is invalid when in fact it‚Äôs the only email address i have. The same one that‚Äôs linked to Snapchat."
