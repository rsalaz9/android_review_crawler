0,grrrrr_sir,"March 13, 2020",5,"Hair I love this app! But there has been one issue that have been there for me and many other from the beginning. There are options for straight hair, kind of Wavy hair, and extremely curly/kinky hair. But there is not a single option for looser curls.  Afro texture is almost all there is, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. I‚Äôm glad they have so many options for those with super curly locks! But as a curly haired woman myself, everyone (a lot of girls) I‚Äôve met with the same hair texture as me have complained about this when it‚Äôs brought up. This includes every women in my family, we have been forced to use straight hair on our bitmojjis. And my god is it annoying that not one style of hair matches our incredibly common curly hair texture.  There is (being generous) maybe one hair option in-between straight/sight wave, and 4C kinky curls. Even just adding three or four generic options at different lengths in the very middle of wavy and kinky would make SO many people happier with the app.     If there were 4 groups of hair, moving from straightest to curliest, just to illustrate. Let‚Äôs say:    Straight. Wavy. Curly. Kinky.      There would be nothing for the curly category for women except maybe one hair style. Please make more hair!!!!!!!! I‚Äôve been waiting for it for years now! And am leaving this comment after silently just hoping for an update."
1,crawfishaquatics,"April 16, 2020",5,"Love it! But I would like to add some things I love bitmoji and so does my best friend. We use it all the time and love the new outfit update. I would just like to make a few suggestions on stickers and outfits. First, i use the YES MA‚ÄôAM soldier bitmoji ALL THE TIME and love it, so if you guys could keep it that would be awesome. Second, I would love if you could add a hair flip bitmoji because me and my friend do so many hair flip worthy things and we always wish there was a bitmoji for it! Third, could you guys add more shoes? I know that you just added more shoes but maybe some different styles and classy ones too. (I don‚Äôt think that 3 is necessary but I was just asking) Lastly, I would like to ask that you guys could make new shirts, and maybe a plaid one. The reason why I am requesting plaid is because I wear plaid all the time and wish that I could dress my bitmoji in the clothes I love to wear. I would also like if there could be swimsuit options that we could wear with shorts and whatever because being a swimmer, I do that a lot. I also would like to add more hair styles, I‚Äôm not too picky about that but just in general. I hope you take into consideration these few things and have a great day."
2,diany nails,"April 19, 2020",5,"Could improve but overall great app To be honest I really love this app but some things do bug me sometimes, I did see that you guys have different styles of Bitmojis and one of them is bitstrips. I have nothing against that style but why do they have more hair and the ability to have earrings? I hope you guys actually update the deluxe type because that would be great. I would also love it if you guys had accessories like necklaces, earrings, things like that maybe some chains you know get creative with it. Also I LOVE that we can now create our own outfits, I hope the clothing choice becomes bigger in the future but for now it‚Äôs really nice! I would love to see oversized sweaters and hoodies, more shoes and socks, high waisted sweatpants, skirts with patters, shirts with design on them, and basically just items that will make us look more fashionable and also let us express ourselves. now hats, they are really good believe me but I would love to see some bandanas in the ‚Äúbabushka style‚Äù or the new trendy look, clips, a plant cause aEsThEtIc, and some butterflies but again anything creative and fun is ok with me. That‚Äôs all I have to say but for now it‚Äôs a pretty good app keep up the great work! :)"
3,JD üòâ,"January 21, 2020",4,"It‚Äôs nice, but could use some upgrades! Bitmoji is a nice app. I think that it should let you customize your skin color, hair color, hair treatment color, and some other color stuff. I want to be able to customize my hairstyle. I also wish that you could customize the color of your makeup, clothing, and shoes. I think that chest size is another thing. They don‚Äôt have mine.... and I think that they just need more customizable things.  There should be more sweatshirt and coat options as well. They don‚Äôt have any options that I like. They should ask if you wanna customize your pants, and if you do, then they‚Äôll let you do it that. Shirt options is another thing. I don‚Äôt really like any of them. They‚Äôre way too simple, I want some more color options, and I want to be able to customize the length. I don‚Äôt want a full half top, but not a really long shirt. Or I want a VSCO shirt, a oversized top. I also want better looking shorts. I‚Äôm being picky, but it‚Äôs better then giving nothing at all. I also want more body type options. I‚Äôm going to be giving more of a review. But this is all for now. Maybe vans, the checkered, and shirts and stuff üòâ"
4,CerealGurl767,"November 28, 2018",4,"Great app!!‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞ Bitmoji is an amazing app! Weather you use it for SnapChat,Texting, whatever! I enjoy how you can customize your own little you. But there is so many ways that you could make bitmoji an even more amazing app! First off more fashion! There is already lots of clothes to choose from, but try to put even more in the app more frequently and that would be fantastic! Second, you should be able to customize even more, like your height, the length of your hairstyle, and have more options for breast sizes. Thirdly, you should be able to change the color of clothing. When I go to pick a different clothing item I want and it‚Äôs bright pink or some color that I don‚Äôt want I no longer want to wear that item, there should be an option to change the color of the clothing item. Finally, please consider being able to mix and match items, like have and an option to ‚Äòmix clothing‚Äô and select the items you want to mix. Please take this into consideration it and I would give it 5 stars, it would also make the app so much more amazing! But overall I totally recommend this app over any other, it is amazing!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
5,mbella2090,"July 17, 2019",3,"Men and Women come in all shapes and sizes! I love Bitmoji and have used it for years. My only issue with it is the limited body sizes and shapes. I hoped with the deluxe upgrade you would remedy this travesty but we‚Äôre already halfway through 2019 and from the chin down your Bitmoji editor is still failing to account for the majority of the population. You have 4 super skinny options and one ‚Äúplus-size‚Äù that could be mistaken for pregnant instead. As a large framed, hourglass shaped woman I find this incredibly disheartening. There are twenty different options for noses, chins, even ears, but when you finally get to body size you get 5?!? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more difficult to create clothing options for every size you offer, but I know I‚Äôm not alone in wishing my Bitmoji avatar reflected more of my real life curvyness. Read any women‚Äôs magazine today you‚Äôll be sure to find an article discussing how to dress for all the different body shapes. It‚Äôs time for Bitmoji to stop catering to a one size fits all market and start offering options for ALL the major body sizes. I would love to see you add options for Pear-shaped, Apple-shapes, Oval, Square, Triangle and hourglass body shapes plus different frame sizes as well. Please make this happen!!"
6,Limelight456,"June 29, 2018",5,"I love it but I have one suggestion. Bitmoji is such a great app. I love the new clothes, skin tones, accessories, etc. I love the new ‚Äúhair treatment‚Äù thing because so many girls have ombr√© balayage or colored hair in general. Everything is more diverse and you have many options. I have used Bitmoji for a long time now and I am obsessed. I recommend this to absolutely anyone and everyone. This is such a great app to have. Even if you don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My one suggestion is that I wish there was a section where you could create your own Bitmoji. Of course you customize your little person, but I don‚Äôt mean that. I mean, like if you can send a Bitmoji with a personalized message/pose/background. For example, for all the limelights, a Bitmoji that says ‚ÄúI said boom boom boom now lemme hear you say wayhoo!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúBoom boom boom‚Äù and a separate one that says ‚Äúwayhoo!‚Äù  Or for non limelights, a personal message that says something specific like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you later at the game.‚Äù Or whatever. Do you see my point? It would be nice to have a variety of Bitmojis ready and to be able to form your own."
7,kk_coolgirl,"December 7, 2019",4,"Needs Improving This app is really amazing and I love to use it whenever I text, on snapchat, or just to customize it just for fun. One really big thing that bothers me is for the hair, there is no option to put highlights. I feel like most people either have dyed or natural highlights which is why you should add it to the hair section. "
8,ü•≥ü§ì,"February 14, 2019",4,"Amazing app! üòÅ I think this app is good, but there still could be some improvements. First off hair. I think there should more options for people who have curly hair like me. I also think there should be more options for eye color. Some people have hazel eyes, not just one color. Another improvement could be with clothes. I think there could be something where u could customize clothes or make new clothes more often. And maybe u could have an option for people who have ear piercings. Also there could a setting where u could add jewelry or something like that. And maybe have more options for clothes. This app is really amazing, but just because something works well doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt make it better!! Other than this the app is really amazing!!! I have fun reading the funny things my Bitmoji says. If u r interested in getting this app u TOTALY should. I use this app everyday. It is so entertaining and u will find that ur bitmoji is quite the character!üòâ It is a fun app where u can customize ur character. I hope the creator of Bitmoji will consider my suggestion!!! Love this app tho!!! üòä"
9,celina_the_swiftie,"February 24, 2019",3,"LOVE IT but.. ok so i love this app. i use it on an almost daily basis when i‚Äôm texting my friends, and there‚Äôs a bitmoji for nearly everything. however, there‚Äôs not enough hairstyles. i always style my hair in an ariana grande ponytail but there‚Äôs no bitmoji hairstyle for that. plus, instead of dying the ends of my hair a different color i have highlights, blue highlights, but again there isn‚Äôt an option for that so my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me..please fix this and i will make my rating five stars. thanks."
10,Jeweleyes,"April 12, 2018",4,"Love it!! But.... I love this app!! It's so fun!!! Even got my co workers hooked on it!! Love that you have scrubs now!!!!!! I haven't checked recently, but could we make it easier to use for commenting on Facebook? Like that we can use it as a status update, but being able to comment without having to like screen shot or something, and then finding the post we want to comment on would be soooo much easier. Also could we get a selection of pjs and a bigger selection for maternity, I'm not that big yet, and none of those outfits are ummm my type, and I am sure other users feel the same way. Otherwise doin an awesome job guys!! Keep up the great work!!!!"
11,Shriya Muni,"September 7, 2018",4,"More creativity in outfits etc. So, I have been with Bitmoji for a while now, and have noticed that Bitmoji has actually been updating outfits, and other accessories pretty often. Something that I am just a little on the edge about, I really sometimes cannot find the correct hairstyle and have to keep changing it until I find the right one. I‚Äôm really hoping that you‚Äôll be able to add more long hair style options, for example, like space buns, of like French braids, or a sleek bun. And maybe make the hairs look a little less glossier because whenever I choose the 2 black options, it doesn‚Äôt fit my hair color (very dark brownüòÇ) And also, coming from someone who has quite bushy eyebrows, there isn‚Äôt really an option for people with big eyebrows. And one last thing :) try more natural nude matte shades for lipsticks colors, since most of them are glossy, they look different with different skin tones. I really hope that you can help me, and probably a lot of problems that others have as well."
12,bitmoji for life!,"December 27, 2018",5,"Love it but.. Bitmoji is great but you need to have more clothing few more ways to express yourself would not hurt either. On bitmoji their could be a chat room to talk to friends, but other than that bitmoji is great I use it a lot when I‚Äôm texting and for my profile pics on social media. But you could make it a bit more kid friendly I have some siblings and their to young for some of bitmojis content. Also the girl body‚Äôs are weird I know you can do better, (of course I have not seen the boy body‚Äôs but their most likely weird to). As I was saying before about more ways to express yourself, sometimes I want to use bitmoji but I can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt have the right bitmoji for it like ( I lost ). And with coughing you really need to step up your game bitmoji when I go to put on a new clouthing it takes me forever to find something I like. But in conclusion bitmoji is not prefect but if your looking to get the app I recommend it to you and I give bitmoji five stars to show l mean it!"
13,beersie3,"July 26, 2019",4,Puppies please!!! I just redownloaded the app after a year without having it and I‚Äôm loving it so far! All the new options made it so my Bitmoji looks more than just kinda like me! Buuuutttt I really need more photo options with dogs! There seem to be a lot of cats and only a couple dogs. 
14,"...........,.....,","August 19, 2019",3,"A good app but could be improved This app is fun to use if you enjoy making avatars of yourself but as someone who can‚Äôt make a bitmoji that actually looks like themselves I notice a lot of missing options for character customization. Things like the lack of curly hair and the barely enough set skin tone options can be bothersome if you want to make a character that looks like you. Back when bitstrips was still a thing I believe I remember the option to choose a wheelchair, which was really nice but it‚Äôs gone now in bitmoji. There‚Äôs a lot of physical features that could be added but something as big as the hair you have can be a make or break for some people‚Äôs avatars. Besides the customization features, every time I install the app, I seem to get more ads on my browsers and the bitmoji keyboard always sets itself to the default keyboard, which most of the time, causes whatever app I‚Äôm using to crash. I don‚Äôt really understand why we have to grant bitmoji full permission to use the keyboard either.  Despite all of the flaws, it‚Äôs definitely a fun app to use with friends, but it absolutely has room for improvement."
15,Kakashi Hatake 360,"April 18, 2020",5,"Great, but a few more options would make it even better Okay, I‚Äôm going to start off by saying that I love the customizable clothes feature, but it really doesn‚Äôt have many options or brands. So maybe more options for jeans, jackets/outerwear, and especially shoes. Could you pleeese put in some tennis shoes that AREN‚ÄôT Vans or Coverse? I know that those are both pretty gender-neutral, but Nikes, Adidas, stuff like that is still good to have on hand. Also in the preset clothes options I feel like there needs to be more winter clothes, like maybe more faux fur stuff, and also definitely more brands in general, maybe Under Armour, American Eagle, Aeropostale, etc. that would be nice. And both genders for all of this stuff too. üòÅ. Another thing. Tattoos! So many people have them now, so please make that possible. "
16,qwefbmrshhgjlpif,"March 29, 2020",4,"Lips, Hair & Clothes I just wanna state before I continue that i am talking about the options fir females & i have a few complaints. My First & biggest issue is that I strongly think you guys should add more variety to lips, the lips are awfully thin & theres people out there (like myself) who have very full lips, you should not only be able to pick the size but the shape as well (i.e cupids bow or a pout). My second complaint is that there are not many hair selections for girls with loser curls, especially on bitstrips. They go from very very loose waves to somewhat curly to kinky curls or theyre are very short cuts with no layers... There also should be an option for a part (left side, right side & center..) as well as an extension for bangs possibly. My last complaint is the mix & match, I really think you guys should add a lot more items to it (items from the pre-made outfits & such). As for clothing i think jewelry should 100% be added (hoops, pendants & crosses, bracelets, piercing & maybe even rings..). But overall i love this app a lot & new & amazing things cone out of it every time its updated ‚ô•Ô∏è"
17,Gamer Girl ‚ö°Ô∏è,"January 11, 2020",4,"Please read ‚ù§Ô∏è I love bitmoji! It's super fun to customize your own personal bitmoji, and I find that there's an accurate bitmoji for almost any occasion/situation. Plus, the mix-and-match feauture only adds to further customization. However, I do have a few ideas for how to improve this app. Firstly, I definently think that the designers of this app should add an option for braces! So many people these days find these mini metal machines fixated on their teeth for a while, and couldn't possibly imagine their appearance without them. And it's mostly teenagers who use this app, after all, and they are usually the people who have braces. That is why I think that it's important to add a choice for braces. In addition, the designers should include a low ponytail in the hairstyle section. It's one of the most common, easy hairstyle girls these days wear. The only ponytails available right now is this super high ponytail and an awkward side ponytail. We need low ponytails, please! As you can see, I only have two PRESSING requests. Please see them through as soon as you can. Otherwise this app is great!"
18,BigTownReviewer,"August 8, 2019",4,"Absolutely Love this App!! But... I absolutely love using this app for texting my friends. It adds a touch of fun in group chats. There are something‚Äôs that I wish were different, however. I agree with PuppyLover147 on things that would make the app better. Mix-and-match-able wardrobe would be ideal. Some of the outfits don‚Äôt match my personal style, or one part of the outfit does, while the other does not. Accessories such has earrings on brace are not available (at least I‚Äôm pretty sure). Also, the app IS rated for 12+, however, the language used makes me cringe every time I come across one. Once again agreeing with PuppyLover147, I suggest a parental filter, or something of the sort. One last thing. I personally don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My friends do, and I want to play Bitmoji games, too. The app Game Pigeon is an app that allows you to play numerous games with your friends over text. I was thinking that you could implement some kind of Bitmoji game like that. But, besides these few things, Bitmoji is a great app that I enjoy having so greatly!"
19,@dreamer081230,"February 22, 2020",4,"Good... wish it was better I appreciate all the updates they‚Äôve made and they‚Äôve all been improvements I just wish they would put all the updates together. For example, they have some great outfits and good separates but you can‚Äôt edit the given outfits. You also can no longer search for things. I also wish they would add pattern availability. If they would catalog all the items in the separates that are in the outfits and added a search availability that would totally improve the app. If there was a pattern section maybe they could let you design your own patterns to apply to clothing items. Another thing they could have is a color slider/creater instead of the list. For the hair section you should be able to apply various bang styles to any cut or style (bangs on a ponytail instead of just straight). Ik parts of this seem excessive but some of these things they already had and were good but replaced with something else good but not the same (taking away the search feature and adding separates). Rant over ;)"
20,mermaid_lover_GW,"December 12, 2017",1,"The Mishaps Before I updated Bitmoji, I had an issue with the picture not sending to one of my friends and I thought it had something to do with my wifi, so I paid money for faster wifi. I didn't send Bitmojis to that person anymore so when I tried with other friends it STILL DID NOT SEND!!! I finally figured out that it had something to do with my app, so then deleted the app, downloaded it again, made my character, and EVERYTHING was fine. When I got an alert that I can do an update I immediately did, it finished and I opened the app. Every picture was white and supposedly loading and usually it takes a minute or so to load. I thought it was loading and waited, but none of the pictures loaded. I am confused because I got faster internet. It might be because of the update or the app. It is still white and ""Loading"" right now."
21,Galaxy_Fandom,"February 24, 2018",4,I love it! Just need this added This app is Amazing! I love creating a little Character and using it text all my friends and family they new Version of the bitmoji the deluxe IS SO AMAZING. . . . But one thing I would love to be added is being able to customize your clothing. . . I mean I really like all the choices I get of clothes but some of them just look weird .  . . And the limited choices kinda get boring and I somethings check in to see if the app has new clothes but nope it just the same boring stuff. . . . Adding this for a update would be great!
22,raaydawg,"March 22, 2018",4,MORE CLOTHING PLEASE!!!! So I downloaded bitmoji when I saw it on Snapchat a couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. I managed to make my bitmoji look exactly like me and when the update came out w/ the camera feature my bitmoji looks even more like me and that‚Äôs what got me hooked into using this app a lot especially in text messages. The only thing I have to complain about this app is the clothing options! I wish there was more constant updates w/ the clothing. It‚Äôs boring not having many options and we all know that clothing is the way we express ourselves and of course in many other ways but for me clothing is how I express myself. There‚Äôs too much sports related clothing and not enough of day to day clothing. I check in every week to see if there has been an update to the clothing options and every time I check I get less and less enthusiastic about bitmoji. I find myself using it less too. Eventually I‚Äôm going to stop using it all together if we don‚Äôt have enough clothing options üò© PLEASE MORE CLOTHING DON‚ÄôT LET US DOWN!!!
23,Hakshbeshdidh,"August 24, 2018",4,One of my favorite apps Bitmoji is one of my favorite apps. I love almost everything about it. I wish that on bitmoji you could make your own outfits. Instead of having pre made outfits you could style whatever you want. I also think it would be cool to change the color of clothing. Sometimes I love the outfit but the color isn‚Äôt for me. I think it would be really cool if you could take a picture of yourself and it would immediately change to looking exactly like you. One setting I think would be awesome is to save creations so if you like a bitmoji you made but want to make a new one you can save it and come back to it later. One last thing I want you to add is more clothing options. You give us so many styles but I feel like you need to update. The summer styles you gave us last year are pretty good but I want you to add different outfits for more selection. If you were to make these changes I would absolutely give this app five stars. Please consider my ideas. I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è
24,AMay79,"November 17, 2018",5,"Still tickles me...consistently AWESOME I have 0 complaints. I never review apps, but this one is one everyone should have. There is now something for nearly every occasion. You don‚Äôt even need an occasion to use it. You can have a complete conversation using these personalized bits/emojis without ever typing a word. From expressing anger, sadness, boredom, sarcasm, anxiety, over-worked, tired, nonchalance, attraction/flirt, toilet break (haha), waiting, long distance, and new ones added ALLLL the time. What makes this app unique in my opinion, is the detail in the face expressions. It makes them not only stand out but also more relatable. "
25,MissCorrine916,"January 26, 2019",4,"So much Fun! I refused to download the app for a really long time because I thought creating an avatar would be too time consuming. It‚Äôs not! It was so easy and so fun! In fact, after the update to have the avatar look life like, every single one of my friends said that mine was the only one that they could say looks like me. I do agree with the featured review that there could be ways to adjust hair length and more styles for curly/wavy hair. I also would like to see more clothes options, or mix and match options. Some of the styles are too over the top or too simple for my liking. Some outfits I love except for one feature that I could do without and would love to eliminate it or swap it out for something else. They could be a really great feature; a ‚Äúbuild your own outfit‚Äù section ( like Cher‚Äôs closet in ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù!) Oh, and maybe change up the ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù options, those haven‚Äôt changed in months and they are getting pretty old. Still an awesome app. Love that we can add friends to our bitmojis when sending them."
26,Vanzilla01,"May 5, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs great! But... Ok, I still have this at five stars because it‚Äôs not horrible. There is only a couple things I wish they would add. There is no glitches I‚Äôve seen so far, and nothing is super inappropriate or anything for younger kids...it‚Äôs just the customization of my bitmoji. First, I am a teen, so I have braces. When all my friends see my bitmoji, they are all like, ‚Äúwhere are your braces??‚Äù I keep telling them that this app doesn‚Äôt have any. I look different and for me, I‚Äôm pretty picky, but I‚Äôll live. But if you guys do add braces, don‚Äôt make them look al weird and crappy (sorry), because that would just be worse! Second, clothes. I wish there was more clothes. Everything there which was recently added...it‚Äôs just too much. Just something basic, but cute! That‚Äôs all I really have to say. It was just ideas mostly. But if you want a little mini me of yourself you should get this app! I really enjoy it and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be deleting it soon."
27,hotpanda328,"April 15, 2020",2,"Outfits- MORE WHERE ARE THE NEW YEAR OUTFITS!!!! The outfits have been the same so much. The new mix and match closet is cool but in my opinion released at the wrong time, right before Christmas. There should be more modern clothes and more options for body types too. Variety is key. I wish there were more hairstyles too. I love bitmoji, it‚Äôs so cute, but my primary concern is, again, the outfits. The maternity section has lots of the older, nicer outfits which bitmoji decided to remove! I really want one of the outfits in the maternity section, why is it only available there? Do I have to get pregnant to wear exclusive clothes? Please make the outfits in the maternity section available for others. I also truly miss the hollister and forever 21 outfits from 2016. I wish those would come back, in my opinion they were the nicest outfits bitmoji has ever had and now they‚Äôre removed for uglier outfits which people aren‚Äôt wearing as much. I don‚Äôt see many people wearing anything from the sporting section which you have made so much room for, nor the bitmotees section. Please consider my opinions to improve this app and make everyone happier :)"
28,fastforward>>,"March 29, 2020",4,"Gender Options (or rather, limits) This app is great! I prefer using my Bitmoji over GIFs. My only issue is that I, as a FTM transgender person, do not like using the male avatar because the face and body shapes do not fit my pre-transitioned face and body shape, but the female avatar does not have the ""male"" outfit choices that I would like. This could go both ways. Gender is not tied to expression. Men should have the choice to wear crop tops and tights in their right body shape and women should be able to wear muscle tanks and cargo shorts in their right body shape if wanted."
29,IzzyMesopotato30,"July 8, 2019",4,"Soooo close to a 5 star but... I love love LOVE this app and have been using it for sooooo long. It never crashes, and it‚Äôs never slow and NEVER lags, but I just think the selection of STUFF to edit your avatar in general should be bigger...Especially the hair selection. I still can‚Äôt find a style just right for my hair, which is wavy and thick with a natural side part but it doesn‚Äôt BULGE out or anything. And also the outfits. Although only Boo! (Which I deleted because it completely doesn‚Äôt work anymore) had this feature, I just think being able to customize and mix and match different pieces of an outfit would be awesome. Also one more thing...eye colour. My eyes are brown but a light shade that most of the time leans more toward amber, but the only brown eyes that are offered are really dark. Maybe you could have some sort of bar that can adjust the lightness and darkness of each eye colour, like Boo! used to have. Also there‚Äôs no hazel eyes! Thanks for a great app anyway! I use it all the time!!üôÇüôÉüôÇüôÉ"
30,dat_girl1738,"February 3, 2018",5,"Love the New Style! I highly recommend Bitmoji because of its new realistic style. I recently just updated the app and received ‚ÄúBitmoji Deluxe.‚Äù Let me tell you all the details. You now get to add highlights to your hair and I read that they include over 100+ hairstyles. Your clothes stay the same! They always come up with NEW cute stickers almost every single day, featuring some emojis. "

32,Hershey kisses101201,"April 24, 2018",4,"Need more options I really like bitmoji a lot, and use it every day. The new update was great because it offered a lot more ways to customize your bitmoji in terms of body size, hairstyles, and a lot of other things. However, I think it would be fantastic if there were way more options for hairstyles, as my hair isn't that unique or uncommon but I can't find anything that looks like it. I also think that there should be more fun options for people with straight or wavy hair, like the two buns style there is for curly hair. Also, I think being able to customize outfits by mix and matching shirts, pants, and shoes would be a huge improvement as the outfit choices are kind of lacking. Another great addition would be to add an accessories option for jewelry, earrings, purses, etc as it would again allow for more customization and make the bitmoji look more like the real person. I hope the app keeps improving at the rate it is now because it's really fantastic!"
33,Bayseklyme,"April 25, 2018",1,"Very disappointed I have been using the app for about 2 years now and I was loving it. But now I find that they have taken the Superhero styles away. My Avatar was dressed as Wonder Woman this whole entire time until today, when I changed her clothes to a baseball uniform for a point I was making in a text to family members. When I went to change her clothes back to Wonder Woman, I discovered that I was not able to because the Superhero section is no longer there. For the most part the app is really pretty good and a fun way to express oneself, which I do frequently with this app.  But I am very disappointed that the Superhero section has been taken out along with other fun movie sections like Game Of Thrones and X Files. It seems that the clothing sections that were the most fun are the ones that have been taken out. Now I am left with either sports or boring attire for my Avatar to wear. Just to give you an idea of the type of character I am: I a 60 year old woman who owns lots of crazy sox because they are an extension of my personality, loves Wonder Woman, gaming, adventure, and I sport intense lilac color hair. Please bring back the Superhero clothing. PLEASE BRING BACK WONDER WOMAN!!"
34,Molly_dog lover,"December 18, 2018",5,"More outfits I love the app 10/10 quality. But I do think they should make an update with more outfits, colors, and personnel outfits. I think they should make it so that you can design your own outfit. It could have a selection of tops with different colors. A selection of dresses all different shapes and sizes. And skirts, pants, jumpsuits, and more. But you could change the style and color of them all. It would be a great update. Also if they could add strapless things I think a lot of people would like that. And if you could either choose solid colors or patterns for the design that would be so fun and amazing. Plus then it can help them look more like you by having more unique options. I would also like a selection of sport bras and shorts. Also more sports things like let‚Äôs say your a gymnast a leotard would be good. I also think that different shoes would be good. But overall a very good app, love it."

This is a BASIC feature and it‚Äôs irritating that it hasn‚Äôt been added after at this time.  I do a lot of conversing via text and I don‚Äôt have time to sit around and swap to the Bitmoji keyboard and search for a keyword (since we don‚Äôt know what each bitmoji is called), go back and paste it in. It severely limits my use of the app, which is a shame because I really do love it!"
36,pancake_nerd,"October 30, 2019",5,"Great. But needs improvement I love Bitmoji. My friends and I use it all the time. But with certain hairstyles, and when you wear hats, your hair still sticks out so it looks weird. I think that maybe you could actually make it look like the bitmoji is wearing an actual hat. It‚Äôs the same thing with straight and long hair. It‚Äôs all sticking out and it looks really weird. But other then everything is AMAZING. But with the Halloween costumes, I think there should be more costume selections. Such as a mummy, bat, wizard, Frankenstein, or even horror movie characters such a Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees, the Ghost Face from scream, a Ghost, e.t.c. Also we need more clothes. Like for instance, when I get dressed in the morning, I pick out pants and a shirt and shoes to go with what I‚Äôm wearing. But in Bitmoji you can‚Äôt to that. I would love to see that happen though. But I LOVE bitmoji and I would love to see more improvements. It is a great app. I think everyone should get it. Thanks for reading"

It has great qualities and is so customizable it is insane how much time it must have taken to build it. But I do have a few ideas. To start, I feel like having a few more hairstyles and lengths would be amazing, like really long hair or pigtails. Also, if there was a option for jeans to rip like the shirt tucking toggle, that would be very helpful. Another idea is that if you could give the option of streaks for your hair, like the hair treatment choice, it would really be great. Next, if you could add more outer wear like cropped sweatshirts that would also be awesome. Finally, if you could add a kid/teen/adult option that would be great. I mean, sure you can change the build of the character and the wrinkles, but that doesn‚Äôt do that much for height. So yeah, it is an incredible app, but there are a few things that could make it even better."
38,Lee-Ani,"January 26, 2020",3,"Could be better I believe bitmoji is good for customizing your Snapchat or keyboard and making it seem more like you but there isn‚Äôt much diversity. What I mean by that is like body and hair diversity. One of the few things that irk me about making a bitmoji is the fact that they are almost all skinny and the curviest one is made to look like a potato. Me and many other women believe that there should be customizable body parts, like the option to remove a thigh gap, get breasts that are as big as ours in real life and even adjust our waist size. That way our bitmoji can *really* look like us. Rather than having the same old boring skinny body that doesn‚Äôt even look like us. And for hair there isn‚Äôt much to complain about, there‚Äôs almost every style... for straight/wavy hair. For curls there needs to be a few more styles for women like me who don‚Äôt wear their curls in a ugly updo or down all the time because in all honesty no girl with curls wears it down all the time. That‚Äôs all I find wrong with this app, I‚Äôm looking forward to any updates :)"

42,Kandring,"May 8, 2018",4,"I enjoy this app, and I have suggestions I've really enjoyed this app so far, but like a few other folks in the comments, I have some suggestions. There are a lot of neat outfits, but I wish there was a way to completely customize for my character. Like some other folks, I am a gay female and tend to wear more masculine-style clothes, but the options in app are a little limited in terms of me expressing myself. If you included the ability to have the entire Bitmoji wardrobe available for all genders, that would be really cool! If you added a clothing customization feature, that'd also be really cool!"

44,M goodness 22,"April 20, 2019",4,"Great App But Some Suggestions I really love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs fun to be able to customize a cartoon character that looks like me. But I wish there was more options for hair, freckles, and body size. I think your Bitmoji should be more customizable. I have a lot of freckles and the app really only has the option to put a few on your face. I also think the hair section of the app should have a feature were you can customize length, waviness, and wether or not you have bangs. Also there are only like 5 different body shapes. I feel as if there should be more. The last thing I want to suggest would be the best change in my opinion. I think people should be able to customize clothes. You could pick a plain  item of clothing and then you could pick out patterns and colors and things like that. If that isn‚Äôt possible I still think the app should have more clothes. All in all this is a great app. If you read this I really suggest downloading it. üíú"

46,sjsel,"July 20, 2019",5,"Get this app! Amazing!!! I use Bitmoji practically everyday. It is so funny, and fun. I have a few suggestions. This would make it even better. Maybe more hair colors, lengths, and styles. Also, a bit more casual, but cute clothes. I would like to have something casual, but not like nerdy, but not like crazy. Maybe also a way that we can match tops and bottoms, and change their color. That way my friend and I aren‚Äôt all matching. I think a way to add things like braces would be good, that way it is more accurate. Bitmoji has awesome pictures already, though I think maybe a way to add your own text, or have moving images would be so awesome. Bitmoji is awesome. I would love to add these, but it is awesome already. You can communicate with your friends and express your emotions. It is amazing. I use it daily, and my friends always compliment our bitmojis, and change them often. Bitmoji is amazing!!!!! ü§©üëè"
47,luckyducky21,"February 18, 2020",4,"Just a few suggestions... First of all, I would like to say that this is a really fun app, especially for texting and Snapchat. Sadly, there are some things that need to be fixed. For example, the app needs more hairstyles! Finding the right hairstyle for me was the hardest part. I have medium length wavy hair, but the only wavy hairstyles were either too short or too long. Also, other hairstyles, such as pigtails or French braids, would make the app so much better! I also think you should add more hair colors and eye colors. I have dark red hair, but all of the red hair colors were either to pink or to orange, so I had to settle with brown. You should also add hazel eyes. Not everyone has just plain blue, brown, or green eyes you know. With these tweaks, Bitmojis would be so much more customizable! Again, this is a really cool app and makes texting so much more fun. I hope this review was helpful to you and you will take my suggestions into consideration. Thank you!"
48,cupcake in heven,"January 20, 2020",5,"Fun but needs a few things... I love bitmoji. It make me feel more like me. I use it to express myself. I use it when I‚Äôm texting my friends. The thing that bothers me the most, is that you have to change it on a website now. I have privacy restrictions put on my phone so I‚Äôm not allowed to get in it and choose what I want. That is the thing that bothers me the most. Also I thing they should have a little more accessories like the checkered vans and maybe hooded sweatshirts. Another thing is, it should have less inappropriate things for kids that are under age for this app but still use it. These are just a few things that should be upgraded in the next update. Thank you for being so kind to read my review of bitmoji. Other than the things that need fixed, I really love this app. Thank you so much for making it. You guys kind of saved my life from being a weirdo. Lol."

50,"Yo dawg,(:","December 13, 2017",4,"Maternitity Clothes!! I absolutely love Bitmoji to start off with. I use it all the time to express a plethora of different emotions and of course at all the wrong times. I sometimes forget it‚Äôs a separate app all on its own. I love to change my outfits to express my personality and now that I‚Äôm pregnant and getting a bump, I‚Äôve noticed there are very limited clothing choices in maternity. (And it‚Äôs winter and they‚Äôre all making my Bitmoji freeze to death!) As a 21 year old in modern times, I appreciate a good virtual outfit selection. Was hoping there could be a future update for other expecting mommies to showcase more personality and better fashion for the pregnant Bitmojis. Maybe even change the belly as a body type and adjust clothes accordingly. Sounds like that would take a lot of time, but just as a suggestion of how you could further your app. Giving 4 stars because like I said I‚Äôm obsessed, but wish for more options (:"
51,Awesomenessgirl12606,"March 17, 2018",5,"Fashion Recommendation Hello, I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for more than a year, and I absolutely LOVE it. However, I have a recommendation on the fashion. I think there should be more ‚Äúemo‚Äù outfits. That being more colors in earrings, possibly band shirts? That may need permission from the bands though. Maybe some sort of spiked jewelry? I don‚Äôt know, this is just a suggestion, along with many more that you guys probably get. I think this would be a good idea because the majority of people that use this app (and any social media) are teenagers. Teenagers are all just trying to figure out who they are, and what they wish to do with their lives. In the process, some go through ‚Äúemo phases‚Äù, as I am, along with some of my friends. If you were to add this into the app, I‚Äôd recommend doing a huge fashion update, so it wouldn‚Äôt specifically be for this. (Even though that would never happen. üòÇ)"

I and many others really enjoy having your technical creation installed in our cellular devices, but it is highly disappointing that it does not contain a plethora of skin colors that are decently adequate or even tolerable for the South Asian community of Bitmoji users, let alone the incredible world of multifarious races we live in. I am emotionally drained of the controversy my skin color gets and the fact that I can‚Äôt embrace it on an app that is supposed to display a supposed duplicate of my self is very displeasing. I understand that producing an app containing such a creative and unique concept can be arduous, but I don‚Äôt think it can be that hard to provide us with at least 5-10 more skin tones that will be suitable with a bigger reach of users of your technical creation. Sincerely, your loving Bitmoji user‚ù§Ô∏è"

54,Angelina334,"May 23, 2018",5,"The app is great but.... Bitmoji it‚Äôs a great app for anybody who likes to express themselves on Snapchat or through messaging friends. When designing your character I feel that there is a limited selection for the eye color and body shape. I have more of a glass figure shape while the ones you can choose from are mostly skinny. I feel that this feature should be changed to fit more body types. Also my eyecolor is not normal like the ones presented. I have something called sectoral heterochromia where my one eye is half brown and green while my other eye changes from green to gray. The eye colors are very limited to fantasy looking eye colors and not enough real eye colors. This app is great for anybody really, you just need an open mind when it comes to the features available right now. Bitmoji is a very unique app and I would suggest it for anybody who uses social media or texts a lot."
55,Cher Potter,"June 5, 2018",4,"Ideas I feel as though the whole app is adorable and fun! But, I do have some requests that I‚Äôm sure everyone can agree with you doing. I think the app would be better overall and more fun with more hairstyles, being able to design our own outfits, jewelry, and more options within the facial feature designing. I can‚Äôt really pick a nose like mine, my eyes aren‚Äôt really the shape my eyes are, and my hair definitely isn‚Äôt my hair, but they are all the closest I can get to myself. I love a lot of the newer outfits that have been added, but it would be great if we could pick what shirt could go with these shoes, and pick our colors. I like to wear earrings, so jewelry is a must. Also, braces should be an option! I have braces, and so do many other people around the world! That would be a perfect way to make it more like ourselves. Overall, I think you guys can do a lot better with these ideas. üòä Thanks for hearing me out!"
56,Cheshire Katt,"January 11, 2020",4,Just some suggestions on the customization I found that the skin tone is either too dark or too light and the skin tone that‚Äôs a little darker than the palest shade is too yellow to be mine maybe if there was something where you picked a shade and you could change the hue to olive tones or to warm tones?
57,‚Ä¢üê±‚Ä¢,"October 7, 2019",4,"Great App!! Maybe a few improvements I love this app and use it on a regular basis but I think there could be some improvements. One thing is the body sizes. There should be more options then the ones they have to fit more people. Also, I think there should be more options for curly haired people and more braids and such. I have seen this on other people‚Äôs reviews many times and I agree completely. We should be able to mix and match clothing options to fit our style. For example, what if you like a shirt, but are not a fan of the pants? I think we should be able to mix and match. One last thing- the language. There are younger users (even though it is for 12+) using this app and that are being exposed to the bad language on this app. I‚Äôm not saying take it off, but maybe blur it out a little better.

Also more of the good kind of camouflage hat and country hats, and everything is so boring you should add a game to Bitmoji. On the other hand Bitmoji has some things to correct next Tim I'm on it better have the changes because I want to see those changes it should have been made by now.

I have Snapchat too and I love that you can connect it. 2 things though. I had the Bitmoji keyboard for a while but then I got sick of it, so I disabled it but now whenever I go to the emoji bar it always shows that and makes me have to click out of it. It‚Äôs pretty annoying when I am trying to just send an emoji or two. The last thing is that I have hazel eyes and none of the options look like my eyes, plus I don‚Äôt really have any of the hairstyles available. I know you always update it and I love Bitmoji Deluxe and all the other cool updates and new options. But I think instead of mainly updating clothes you should start to try and update more features.

Obviously my bitmoji isn‚Äôt going to freeze to death but I like to keep with the theme of what‚Äôs going on real time so it would be helpful if there was more options, not just pregnancy wise but for every type of style for every type of person!

My hair is medium length but in the app, there are only options for longer hair or shorter hair then mine. The only one that KINDA fits me is the strait hair one on the top row when editing your bitmoji (3rd one). I would like it if y‚Äôall would add some more hair options in that length. The other thing I would like to request is more options on the lips and eye colors. My lips are full, but more on the top then on the bottom. I would like it if y‚Äôall could create some lips that are not just full on the bottom like it has in the app. Second of all, the eye color. My eyes are very different among other eyes. My eyes are blue but green at the same time. I think it would be cool if there were eye color options that were green and blue mixed not just green or just blue.

Oh and one more thing I think you should let people make there own captions for there picture they send or it at least be an option. I love to use Bitmoji to joke around with my friends, overall I think it‚Äôs a pretty good app it jut could use some adjustments. I recommend this to people who don‚Äôt like texting a lot. This app was made for you lol. Everyone should have this app !! And one last thing I wanted a funky crop top ripped jeans kind of outfit but it won‚Äôt let you pick a shirt and a different pair of jeans or so on you should make it to where you can pick any shirt and any kind of bottoms and shoes."

It‚Äôs very cool to use it with friends and family when you‚Äôre using Snapchat and messages, especially when you can use Friendmoji on Snapchat. I just have one TINY suggestion. Would it be possible to have some more hair options? I mean, all the hair you can currently choose from is great, but I think some people would prefer more hairstyles also. Anyways, that‚Äôs all I wanted to say and thanks soooooo much for recently updating the app!! The new clothes are awesome and MANY THANKS for giving the option of customizing our own clothes, like what shirt we want with want pants, shoes, etc!

I love this app I use every day on Snapchat the only thing I do not like about this app is that doesn‚Äôt really have my style and I think a lot of people say that and one way is to make it a style is  and have just shirts just pants or just shoes this way everybody can be custom but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to eliminate outfits either you can just add it on and I think people will really love it even more another thing isThere should be an option where we the people can make custom hair or something like that and of course everyone‚Äôs opinion is different so you can have a normal hair like it is now or you can make your own hair add more hair so you can have it pretty precise and I know some people don‚Äôt think this is like that important but it would make it a lot more fun and an app that people use more and I know that you guys want people to use your app more
76,Angie1234!,"April 27, 2020",4,Bitmoji Okay the clothes and everything are nice but when you can create your own outfit to me there should be more of a variety because there are country people in this world who don‚Äôt dress like all girly and everything. Like for an update or something (this is just and idea) there should be different FLANNELS you can choose from and BOOTS!!!!! Like I think this would really be nice for country people. Also I think there should be hair styles that you can create because everybody hair style is different and sometimes people don‚Äôt really care about the options it gives us because not everybody‚Äôs hair are likes the ones in the options. And also for the people who wear glasses not all glasses are the same colors people should be able to make the glasses their color not just black and white that goes for sunglasses too. But these are all just ideas and some suggestions.
77,SweetButterCakes,"March 12, 2020",4,"Love it, but would add I have had Bitmoji since it came out basically, and I have loved the updates it gotten over the years, but I feel like the hair style choices haven‚Äôt updated much. I think it would be an awesome idea to be able to have 2 colors in your hair. I think it would make the characters a lot more customizable and unique to you. I also feel that you could add more items for clothing, I know that the outfit my bitmoji has on right now is no longer an option, which makes it hard to do some of the new customizations because it will take off my outfit, and I don‚Äôt want to lose it, cause it‚Äôs hella cute. Add more shirt styles with prints or anything on them, maybe some ripped jeans and perhaps add some more color options to the shoes and jackets sections. Other than that I think it‚Äôs been getting better each update, and hope it continues to improve!!"

It‚Äôs not my favorite thing to do, but I do it anyway so that I can do well in competition. Anyway, I was wondering if you could add a feature where you can make your legs orange, just like the fake tan. Personally, I am really pale, so my bitmoji looks weird because I always have super tan legs. Also, can you please add an irish dancing bitmoji that you can share with your friends? Whenever I have a dance competition or class, I would really like to send an irish dancing bitmoji to my friends. This would be a really cool feature for all us fellow irish dancers out there.

Lots of people wanna be able to customize every part of there Bitmoji character to there liking. Also adding backgrounds, pets of every sort of animal even exotic animals, & even adding the option that y‚Äôall give on Snapchat of having your friend(s) with you at the same time.

82,Cailey b.,"July 16, 2018",4,"Great app! More options please This app has so many messages to choose from! It never glitches, and the graphics are amazing! However, there are some things you could add. My number one wish is BRACES! Most of the people using this app are in middle school, meaning there are individuals with braces everywhere! Braces are a huge part of a feature on someone‚Äôs face, it‚Äôd be a great option! Next, instead of having 5000 soccer and football jerseys, it‚Äôd be great if we could customize our own outfits! Or just add more outfits that are up to date with current fashion. Other than that, I think everything is great except the variety of hairstyles for bob cut hair. I only have two options since I have short, wavy hair :( . This is an awesome app, but please remember... braces, clothes, hair!

83,547292948,"July 17, 2018",5,"Great! Fantastic app, I love using it. There are enough facial choices that my Bitmoji actually really looks like me, which doesn‚Äôt usually happen in other programs that allow you to create your character. However, I would like more colorful clothing choices, for I wear a lot of colorful patterns. I also would prefer more hairstyle choices and definitely more hair color choices, because I am constantly coloring my hair but I can rarely match my Bitmoji‚Äôs hair to mine. Right now irl I have my natural brown roots fade into a beautiful teal color, but the closest color match on Bitmoji is brown on top (the the brown in my hair doesn‚Äôt go down that far) and an ugly shade of dark green that almost looks faded and rather weird. The green looks even worse when it is paired with the brown top. Anyways, fantastic app, but more choices are needed."
84,Just take the advice...,"September 28, 2018",4,"Update Suggestion I have had this for several years now and it has developed pretty good. There are more detailed styles which would allow the avatar to be more specialized towards you. (Anyone ever try to make yourself on the old style and say to yourself ‚Äúhey, that kinda looks like ‚Äòso and so‚Äô. Wait it also looks like ‚Äòso and so‚Äô ‚Äú and you end up with a list of 10 people) Anyways, getting to the point, anyone who has had bitmoji always has trouble finding a good outfit. You find an outfit with a shirt that looks like the one you wear often, but the pants do NOT. (Vise  versa) So being able to pick individual articles of clothing would be great! Rather than having an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù with the shirt and pants pre selected, you would be able to pick any shirt and wear any pants together. This would truly make bitmoji users able to make their avatars more like them."
85,l√´monsquare,"April 27, 2019",3,"More Features! Hi! I love your app, it is so fun! :) However, I am just frustrated about the lack of features. I calculated that there are over 20 more options for GLASSES than for HAIRSTYLES! I think that is ridiculous. You should also add more options for hair because there is literally no hairstyle that looks like mine at all. A ponytail would be great, but there are only two types of ponytails: The first one is like 1 inch and messy and the second one is like 8 inches and long and sleek. How about a little more detail? That would be awesome for me. Also more lengths and textures of hairstyles would be SO convenient. My hair is a little past shoulder length and slightly wavy at the end, but there is no option even remotely close to that, and imo there should be. Also, it would be amazeballs if you could add an option for braces! I noticed that lots of bitmojis have toothy smiles and therefore those of us with braces should have a bitmoji with braces. Thanks so much! :)"

One other option, and maybe it‚Äôs in there because I just did a new update or maybe this is in the works but sometimes I just can‚Äôt find the right saying/picture for my conversation.

87,sfspalding,"March 27, 2020",5,"Great app! (w/ suggestions) This is an awesome app! But I wish there were more specific features such as piercings, and more makeup options such as eyeliner and highlighter (I say those bc winged eyeliner and highlight are some of my trademarks). Just more variation in makeup in general would be nice, along with more customizable fashion options that look like the outfits in order to mic and match. Also, I have curly type 3b hair and I‚Äôve only found one (one!!) hairstyle that looks somewhat like my hair. Lastly, me and other people whose emojis have big hair have been having an issue with headwear. Hair should not be be sticking out of a hat. This aggravates me because I can‚Äôt use beanies despite being partial to them. Also, necklaces and chokers!! I am an avid choker wearer. Except for these nitpicks, this app is great and I highly recommend it."
88,horsesrpeople,"April 18, 2020",5,"Great! Ok I love this.  However I do not have Snapchat so once in a while it asks for full bitmoji access.  This doesn‚Äôt bother me but it might for some.  Bitmoji should be able to be on all keyboards without reading your private information though.  I was thinking there isn‚Äôt very many ones with gecko ether doesn‚Äôt that discriminate?  Maybe you can add horses, geckos or other reptiles and foxes. What I was thinking and pretty much the only reason I‚Äôm writing this review is maybe we can design some of those picture things.  Like there could be a section called private library and stuff.  We could have our avatar and write our own text, add little things and maybe you can add some more animals?

I think it‚Äôs a wonderful app. It allows you to create your own personal bitmoji, as well as placing your bitmoji into a little cartoon or pictures. I think it‚Äôs really fun and creative, but It‚Äôd be even better if there were more hairstyles, and hair colors! If some of the wavy hair styles were also available in a straight version it would be nice. I have the medium length wavy hair on mine right now, but my hair is usually straight, so if there was a straight version it would be a lot better! As well as more styles like braids or other styles of messy buns as well! Or even more lengths of hair! I also think there should be more colors! Like maybe some darker brown shades or other colorful options! Or even an option to create a custom hair color with a color wheel! I hope you can read my suggestion and take it into consideration!

The only thing I wish is that for outfits that come with some sort of hat, that the hat could fit multiple hairstyles. I have very curly hair and so does my Bitmoji and whenever I choose an outfit with a hat accessory my Bitmoji‚Äôs hair automatically becomes straight to fit the hat. I really wish that my hairstyle would stay curly with the hat or gives the option to take the hat off but stay with the outfit. If this become available I‚Äôll give it a full five stars! I also wish there were more curly hair options. I don‚Äôt see my original curly hair option anymore:( please go back to us having many hair options: wavy, straight, curly etc. and us choosing the correct hairstyle based on the kind of hair we chose. Not ALL hairstyle options are available anymore. Please bring back!!!"
93,SpeadTheLove,"June 27, 2018",5,"Soooooooo Fun!! One Small Request I love Bitmoji! It is a really fun way of adding yourself (literally) to conversations with friends and beyond. I have one request, thus being maybe adding braces into the picture. My younger sister, who is 16 years old, has braces and I think she would really like it if there was a way to add in braces. Now, I shouldn't be the one to tell u what to do because I'm sure this whole app coding thing is far beyond my abilities, but it would be cool. Maybe an option of having just top braces, just bottom braces, and then the option of having both. Once again, this is just a small idea on how to expand the horizons of the Bitmoji app, and my request isn't something I am particularly complaining about. This is definitely a 5+ star app and I applaud the creative team."
94,swag__girl__y'all,"July 13, 2018",5,"Great app Bitmoji is a wonderful app. It is very useful in my expressions in messages. Even though it is an amazing app, I have a few suggestions. First of all, on the home page when you open the app, they should have a search option so you can search for your bitmoji without having to scroll and scroll and look for the bitmoji you want. Second of all, can you make the bitmojis a little more kid-friendly? Some are inappropriate and uncomfortable. Also, in the summer, I wear T-shirt‚Äôs and shorts mostly and there are no clothes for that so I have to go with a tank top and shorts and I barely wear tank tops so I hope you update the wardrobe. Despite all of these suggestions, I really like this app. I would definitely recommend this to someone. Please take my suggestions into consideration."

But there is just one suggestion I have which would make this app a lot better for me and it‚Äôs super simple. On the bitmoji keyboard there is a little globe button thing that allows you to switch to other keyboards but because I speak other languages and also have regular emojis I use the bitmoji‚Äôs globe doesn‚Äôt let you hold down and switch to the keyboard you want. You either have to press it once and then switch or keep tapping the keyboard until you get your preferred choice. I would just like to switch back to my normal keyboard very quickly and save me some time and it doesn‚Äôt seem like something that would be hard for you guys to do so if you can that‚Äôd be great.

I just wanted to make a few suggestions for updates to come. First would be more customization options (even though there are so many right now which is awesome), I think it would be cool to have things like slit eyebrows, birthmarks, different colored eyes, tattoos, stuff like that so that Bitmojis can be even more unique and look the most like yourself. Another thing I think would be cool to add would be the option to mix and match clothing, like picking a shirt from one outfit and pants from another. This is just mostly because I see that there are parts of outfits that fit what I would actually wear, but rarely a FULL outfit. Thanks for reading and I hope you use some of these suggestions for the future!"
97,htdghogan,"February 7, 2019",3,"Versatile and fun Tons of varieties and more added constantly. Customizing characters is through BUT the lack of detailed customization for each item leaves basics to be desired, same goes for options to change direction a sticker faces, is like to be able to have extended hair lengths, left or right options for place of accessories or simply which side a hair part is on. There are many common colors for skin hair and eyes and even some cartoonish unnaturals ... but this should be given sliders and  allow for more precise cocooning. I AM TAKING THIS FROM 3 Stars down for the is next issue. THERE ARE TOO MANY OPTIONS FOR OUTFITS, there is no ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù option to make changing them easy, THEH ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE, You can‚Äôt mix and match tops with bottoms AND WORST PART, LITERALLY NO ATTEMPT TO GIVE COLOR PICKING AT ALL... they add new options in groups ‚Äúsports teams‚Äù ‚Äúseasons‚Äù ‚Äúcasual‚Äù ‚ÄúNike‚Äù or ‚ÄúFaux Brand That Looks Cook‚Äù but lack the simplicity of just implementing custom clothing."

I read that very long comment from a previous user about curly hair, personally you do have my hair style, but not it exactly. Maybe you could let users pick the hair type (straight, wavy, curly, kinky) like the 1,2,3,4, and abc strategy, and then let them choose different types of bangs, different lengths, and different styles in general. Also, PLEASE improve your ponytail and braid styles, they look weird, (I understand that it‚Äôs difficult to make them look natural, I use Apple Memoji as well and theirs looks bad too) and can‚Äôt you make the glasses color be able to change, like how you can change the clothing colors?

Also, the outfits aren‚Äôt exactly things that I will wear when I look for outfits at the forever 21 section all I see are bodycon dresses with bomber jackets and checkers. Not all teenagers wear this... and when I look for things in the bitmogi casual section all I see are the same pants and shirt on different colors.

105,gabbyholohan,"March 19, 2020",4,"We need more options for curly hair!! Bitmoji overall is a great app, however, there is one minor change I would make. The whole point of Bitmoji is to make an emoji that looks like yourself, but with the current hair options it is difficult for everyone to find their hair type. It seems like there are at least 25 different hairstyles for people with straight hair and there are about 3 hair types for girls with curly hair. To improve this, I would add 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, and 4c hair types to the hair choices so that there is at least one option for every hair type. I feel like hair types 1a-c and 2a are all that I see when I look through the hair section. It would just be a relief to those of us who have curly hair if you all added some diversity to the hair types. Otherwise, this app is wonderful, I would just love to see selections for everyone!"

In my opinion, (on Bitmoji deluxe) I think there should be a way to create your own color and style of hair, same with clothing. People throughout the world have many unique styles of clothing, and I think it would be appreciated if there could be some way to create your own style of clothing on this app. Also, I feel there should be an option to include piercings, birthmarks, scars, different skin tones, or anything along those lines really.

I gave it a 4 though because of all the inappropriate emojis there are, it says stuff under at least 16 year old kids shouldn‚Äôt know about. Also it says bad words like the f word in some emojis and one emoji even has its middle finger up which I think is really inappropriate for kids who want to send cute emojis to friends.

Every time I use my Bitmoji on Snapchat, I always have to draw my birthmark on my face. A few people thought that the Bitmoji app can let you put a birthmark on your person, but I told them that I drew it on there. If Bitmoji gave us an option to put a birthmark on our person, Bitmoji will be outstanding. Please consider the people who have birthmarks & please do think about making an update so people with birthmarks can put one on their Bitmojis. Let us chose where to put the birthmark & the size of the birthmark. I think with that update, Bitmoji will be an unstoppable fun app. Thank you! üíï"
111,KenzyC,"October 7, 2017",4,"Love it but if you could add.... Everything in this is so wonderful √±. Love using bitmoji but like another user mentioned we need more outfits, girls can never have enough outfits. It would be nice to be able to chance individual clothing like the shoes and jackets. We also need the hats to fit better. My husband‚Äôs bitmoji needed a country hat but it looked so funny because it didn‚Äôt fit it was just placed on the top like a little top hat lol. Also there wasn‚Äôt country style clothing. We need more outfits for both men and women. The clothing styles is what makes a person unique. We should be able to individually change clothing items. Also it would hurt if we could have a bitmoji text creator, where we can choose a bitmoji with selected expression then add our own words so it could be more personalized.  That would be awesome."
112,lachicaplastica,"February 1, 2018",4,"Needs a search feature!!! They think of everything! If you can't find a bitmoji for what you want to say... say something else. They're adorable and accurate and always current. But there's soooo many of them and all shoved into four categories, which means you have to sift through dozens to try to find the one you want. They need a search option or pop-out menu with categories like ""sorry"" and ""miss you"" and ""sarcastic"" and whatnot. I've opted not to send one more than once because by the time I found what I wanted, the convo has moved on. Otherwise, I love this app. Also, needs more ""miss you"" options. I have very dear people halfway across the country in opposite directions and I miss them and need more ways to say so. Like ""really miss you"" and ""missing you hard"" and sappy stuff like that lol. Great and fun app!!"
113,Leahlizp,"May 1, 2018",4,"Love bitmoji but we need more individuality I absolutely love the most recent update to make face and hair options more realistic and to give us more options, however, there‚Äôs no option for my hair style so I don‚Äôt feel my bitmoji represents me well. I had to compromise. I think it would be great to have the same type of style, length and color options, but let us mix and match and choose the texture, the length, the bang style, the way it‚Äôs displayed on the avatar (like tucked behind the ears or one side in front of shoulder, one side behind the back etc)."
114,Bocas173,"June 28, 2018",3,"I like it, but it could use some work This app is cool and fun to use, and works pretty well. Saying that though, I do have super long hair, and there really aren‚Äôt a whole lot of options for it. I would really appreciate a long straight one with a side part, as there is a long one with a middle part, but it just doesn‚Äôt look that good. I think that the feature where you can take a photo should actually automatically make you bitmoji match the picture, because mine doesn‚Äôt do it. I am not sure if it actually does it on anyone else‚Äôs devices, but it should. I also think that there should be better outfit choices, because i do have trouble finding ones i actually like sometimes. I‚Äôm hoping that the creators will see this review and fix some of these things. Regardless of all the issues, this is a pretty good app, it could just use a little work."
115,esmewolvs,"December 16, 2018",4,"4 things people will love to have in the app (my opinion) Really love this app! I think it‚Äôs amazing to use for showing cool emotions. But here is something I think many people will want. 1 I think some like piercings for ears and nose etc. 2 something I really want is different hair color styles, like for example my hair is brown but it have a kinda bling streaks/lines and the app doesn‚Äôt have that. I really think that should include in also. 3 maybe more makeup color or styles will be very nice to change. 4 something that also many people have and like to have because it shows people how they are is tattoos. I think having some type of tattoo making will be very nice as well. "
116,Ime GY,"January 15, 2019",4,"Blind Accessibility I am a low vision Voice Over user. Many of the Stickers on facebook have become accessible in the manner that Voice Over describes the image. Example,Happy dog running and jumping with hearts. Some of the sticker options in this app are described very minimally and some only say sticker when I swipe across it. That means that particular sticker is vertically useless to me. If a very brief description, example:Happy woman jumping out of cake, Text says Happy Birthday. This would be immensely helpful for your Voice Over users. I understand that this kind of accessibility is provided by the developer. :ü•∞ especially since some of my text groups with friends and family can become strictly Bitmoji communications...which is super fun, but totally leaves me out of the convo unless someone is around to tell me what is on my screen."

118,Plushie Gaming,"June 6, 2019",5,"So. Much. Fun! Let me just say this straight-away: this app is fun. It‚Äôs a great way to communicate using both pictures and words, and it‚Äôs ALL for free! No buying the outfits, hairstyles, or stickers. No FRICKIN‚Äô pop-up ads like all the other free apps (and games). The only thing that‚Äôs for sale here is CUSTOMIZED MERCH. Super cool. You don‚Äôt even have to buy that if want, at least not to get any other privileges in the app. My point is, this isn‚Äôt one of those money-making schemes that most developers are making nowadays. It‚Äôs an honest and free app. The only thing NOT to like is the fact that the want to access your texts? Kinda weird/shady, but all you do instead is use the sticker app at the top o the keyboard-UI. Simple as that! Would recommend to anyone who likes Nintendo Miis, and/or emojis."

But there‚Äôs just one thing left, can you add piercings? Like you can chose what the earring looks like, the color, and where it goes on the ear. I would love it if you could do that because me and all my friends have piercings and Bitmoji and it would make the app better if people can really, truly, make it look like them and not as close to what looks like them. But a mini them. So please consider! Thanks! (Also sorry for saying ‚Äúthem‚Äù so much)"
120,Seventeenths,"February 10, 2018",3,"some suggestions... if i have to be honest, Bitmoji is great. i love the little avatars. they're so cute! and i also love the new update where we finally, FINALLY got more options for hair and hair color. why did that addition take so long? i'd just like to suggest some things for Bitmoji that it's kind of lacking.

121,KolorJunkie,"March 8, 2018",4,"Uh oh.. I updated the other day and got to thinking tonight, while spamming my friends with mini me‚Äôs if there were new outfits released. So I go into the app and when I went to outfits everything is gone. I went into the keyboard and hit the new outfit feature from there. It did pull up about six outfits, none of which are new...bummer, so i optimistically hit more. It took me to the app with an empty closet. So not only was there nothing new but now everything is gone. Sad day. I along with many others love the app and would love to see more outfits. Or just clothes in general. I don‚Äôt mind putting my own clothes together and even maybe a color wheel so I can pick the colors. I would play with her all the time. Hope y‚Äôall get it fixed soon and maybe even add more options. Thanks so much!! üòò"
122,JQHDANCER,"March 18, 2018",4,"Update Malfunction This review is mainly just for a new update, because version 25 says that there is ombre hair and that there are more hairstyles. I haven't seen those hairstyles since I updated the app. Though my friends have ombre hair and some of the new hairstyles. For example one has Blue ombre. One has a messy bun and two others have a new short, kinda wavy hair style.I can't seem to find a way to get those. And I don't want to risk loosing my character if I delete the app. But other than my Update Malfunction I really do enjoy the app. One more thing, I think that for the outfits you should be able to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes all separately from each other so that we can create our own outfits. Because Im not liking the outfits. The only ones I like are the crop top ones and I don't really wear crop tops.üòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
123,BarneeHoyle,"July 5, 2018",4,"Keyboard glitchy I‚Äôm a huge fan and user, but over the last couple months the keyboard has started to get glitchy. It will reset itself back to the first page of Bitmojis frequently... its almost impossible to use the search feature and find a selection before it resets itself. The app itself works fine and I‚Äôve resulted to opening up the app when I‚Äôm having the most trouble, but it‚Äôs less easy to find the Bitmoji you want because there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a search feature in the app. I‚Äôve gone into settings and turned off the keyboard and turned it back on, that didn‚Äôt help.  I even deleted the whole app and reloaded it, that didn‚Äôt help either.  I don‚Äôt use any other non-standard keyboards, so I‚Äôm not sure if it might be a larger issue, or just with Bitmoji.  Thanks!"
124,Second Madmax,"July 16, 2018",5,"Opinion of the People Bitmoji is awsome. And like everyone else, I think that y‚Äôall have done great. Now I don‚Äôt know what you all are doing, whether your working on new things, or trying to fix the ones you‚Äôve made, but I really think that, if it is not any trouble, not to mention possible, that if you could make it where we can choose our own styles, item color, and similar things. I‚Äôm just a country boy from Alabama, but it seams to me that this is what people have been wanting and unless it messes up your format or makes little changes to everything, I reckon it‚Äôd b a good idea to do it. And paying for the app is what I‚Äôd b willing to do if that is the problem. Thanks again for the app guys (and/or girls)!!!! OH AND WE DONT HAVE ANY COWBOY HATS!!!! Please do this for us lol"
125,InfinityAppReviewer,"February 20, 2020",4,"BITMOJIS ARE A GO! I enjoy using Bitmojis so much. It gives my conversations so much more animation. However ,I have one suggestion that would make it a 5 üåü rate instead of 4. That suggestions would be piercings/earrings . I‚Äôve seen some Bitmojis that actually have em already,not sure if it was a glitch,hack or magic but it‚Äôs 2020, it should‚Äôve BEEN a thing by now. Get on it Bitstrips team.

I cannot COUNT how many people I know with braces. I‚Äôm also getting them soon. It would be nice to have that as a feature. Also, hair.. as much as you have a ton of choices, maybe having a mix and match for that too? Then there‚Äôs shirts. They‚Äôre just a teeny bit plain. There could be graphic tees, striped tees, or polka dots. And finally earrings, earrings would be cool to have in the ear section.

130,JaiMonkeys,"February 2, 2018",1,"I love you but.. Ok Bitmoji, I truly love you I really do. You seriously make communicating more fun. However, you recently added the avatars in monkey heads for the hear, see, and do no evil. I‚Äôm giving you the benefit of doubt and believe it‚Äôs just a coincidence these popped up during black history month. I‚Äôm also going to believe ignorance drove this appearance of insensitivity regardless of the month of the year. This stood out to me because I love monkeys but due to my ancestors and their struggle I will never ever wear a monkey suit. "
131,mrsasia,"April 10, 2018",1,"Hate new version!! My FORMERLY beloved Bitmoji was 5 stars LAST WEEK for me. NOW, it‚Äôs a ZERO!  All of a sudden, it crashed and after attempts to save it, I had to delete it and start all over. My user name and password did not work anymore, so I had to create a whole new account and new avatar. You no longer have my hairstyle, my eyes, and nose. I just spent an hour trying to create an avatar that looks similar to me without success. The newly exaggerated facial expressions are ridiculous. Now, every one has HUGE teeth as a focal point, yet you don‚Äôt have a choice for teeth, as you would eyes. I used to use Bitmoji every single day, for every emotion, for birthdays on Facebook. Friends loved them, so they signed up too. We had them on our keyboards. I‚Äôm erasing Bitmoji ASAP. Luckily, I saved a few copies of my frequently used Bitmojis, so at least I will have my birthdays and love-you‚Äôs covered. It was a big mistake to change the avatar art choices. I‚Äôm not the only one upset by the changes."
132,Lol....no,"April 23, 2018",3,It could use more detailing When it comes to some styles there‚Äôs really not much of an option. Especially the body types. There‚Äôs 4 types of skinny sizes and 1 type of big person. I‚Äôm not saying they have to have a wide range of bigger people but have the decency to be more realistic and add more then one body figure. There‚Äôs no medium sizes and it goes straight to one big person. As if smaller people are the only one deserving attention they just make a bunch of smaller ppl people and make 1 big person to categorize medium and bigger sizes....really. I‚Äôm bigger but I don‚Äôt look that big and it‚Äôs quite pathetic it takes them this long to realize they shouldn‚Äôt not done this in the first place. Plus there‚Äôs not a wide range in curly hair in all lengths. I would of just let this go by but I felt that the body types needed to be discussed bc it‚Äôs offending
133,I_Love_Horses101,"June 13, 2018",5,"LOVE it, but needs some improvements! I have been on bitmoji for quite some time now and I‚Äôve always loved it. I think it adds tons of character to any of my snaps and I love sending them to people, however customizing my bitmoji is always a pain. I like to change up my outfit every now and again but I feel like there isn‚Äôt much to choose from. I feel as though there should be an option to make your own outfit because most of the stuff on there, I would never actually wear. I think another improvement would be to allow people to choose their outfit anytime they want even within an app like Snapchat or in imessage. However I really do loveee my bitmoji! Just wish it had the same fashion sense as me"
134,ironkid06,"August 9, 2018",3,Still needs a lot of improvement I just delete Bitmoji because I was getting frustrated because I couldn‚Äôt create the perfect avatar for me. I settled for an avatar that has darker skin that I do and straight hair but in the way I brush my curly hair. 
135,Hoodie Obsessed,"January 5, 2019",4,"Just Some Suggestions Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a great app, but I feel like there could be some improvements. For example, more hairstyles. As someone with hair just a little past my shoulders, I feel as if there isn‚Äôt really a lot of hairstyles for me. Plus I have wavy hair (straight when I‚Äôm not feeling lazy and want to fix it). There should also be an option to choose your own clothing. I like the idea of being able to personalize my clothing style, considering it‚Äôs lowkey kinda different than most of the outfits you can choose from. I also like the idea of being able to make your own hair color, kinda like being able to choose from the whole color spectrum. It‚Äôs good for people who‚Äôs hair does not really fit any of the given options. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great app!"
136,kkatxo,"April 3, 2019",2,"SIMPLE FIXES NEEDED TO MAKE IT A MORE ENJOYABLE APP 1. The biggest thing that I dislike about this app is that there is no ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù tab... you can‚Äôt save your favorite bitmojis.

137,aun15drea_ü§™,"May 14, 2019",4,"Some suggestions I have been using Bitmoji for a couple of years. Before the new style of the avatar came out. I was so happy to see if they finally had my hairstyle or the type of clothes I wear. I was sad to see it didn‚Äôt. My hair is curly and I usually have it in a high ponytail. But that wasn‚Äôt there. I also have a suggestion that I think every one would enjoy. It‚Äôs a create your own clothes feature. I think it would be cool to be able to pick the type of clothing, the color, and the design because it would be more personalized. I also would like to add that it would be amazing if you could add outfits with hoodies and maybe more adidas clothes. Also better shoes or just make that a custom feature too.

138,romo rojo ilove froyo,"January 15, 2020",2,"Crashed? So what happened in my case was that the first time I got this app was successful, I loved the clothes and everything was amazing! But, I accidentally clicked the guy gender and I didn‚Äôt notice. So when my sister got the app, I was helping her make an account and I saw there was a gender choice. So, I wanted to change my gender because of the girls clothes on the app. And after that I made another account because I have so many email accounts and when I was done with designing my character it booted me out and I tried to login and it said ‚Äúyour internet connection seems to be down, please try checking your internet connection and try again. So after making three more accounts and trying to login to my other ones countless times, I just gave up.

So many choices and options for your avatar. I like the recent update where you can put together an outfit with a shirt, bottoms, shoes, and outerwear instead of just finding one in the outfit section. I think it also makes it much easier to make your avatar look like you because you can dress it just the way you would. Just one suggestion. Could you please make a furry boot like uggs or bearpaws for the shoe options because I often wear those type of boots and I wish I could put them on my bitmoji too üòã overall I think it‚Äôs really great and super fun so I totally recommend it"
140,Cali redhead,"December 28, 2017",5,"Great app, super fun. Have idea I love the way this app gives you the ability to be more expressive. I think that with all the hair styles today which constantly change with what‚Äôs popular and with some people getting unique haircuts or dyeing their hair I think that the ability to make a custom hair cut and also be able to pick areas of the hair to dye would be a great addition to Bitmoji. I think that a plethora of different lengths, cuts, and the ability to have multiple sections of hair changed to better fit a person‚Äôs hair cut or style would be great and with the ability to toggle if you want detail in the hair or to have it with less detail. (ex. lines, texture, thickness) It would be awesome if the developer(s) did this."

I love all the different pictures to chose from and the outfits and everything. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that there are very few options for pregnant people like myself. üò© That makes me sad because all the baby bump outfits are more summer and spring like and it‚Äôs currently winter. It would be wonderful if the baby bump was a body type instead of an outfit because we all know it is indeed a body type and not an outfit. Us pregnant people would like to be able to wear any outfit and still showcase our baby bump! Over all the app is wonderful but I think this adjustment would make it even better. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be a lot of work and whatnot but it‚Äôs something to think about. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î I only gave it such a low rating because I noticed the lower ratings get more replies back than the higher ones! üòÇüòÇ I do actually love the app. üíï"

However, I felt like the new update offered a ton of options for clothing, make-up, accessories and such, but not enough options on facial/body features. All of the mouth options are super wide and the eye options are also limited. I feel like more mouth size and general mouth options are needed. The mouth in the new update is so distinct that since it is wide it automatically makes the Bitmoji look nothing like me so I switched back to the old version. As for the eyes, I think you‚Äôve got the shapes down, but the eye angles in the new update are very limiting, it makes many of them look the same. I do like that the eye size is now customizable. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt care if I have a million clothing and accessory options if I can no longer get the Bitmoji to look like me."
143,Andreaüôä,"June 1, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs great but it needs more... I‚Äôve loved Bitmoji ever since it came to Snapchat because it makes chatting more fun. I do have to say that I have a love hate relationship with the Bitmoji Deluxe because I can never make it look like me. I think it would be a great idea to add sliders to the app so we can change the size of our eyes, nose, and lips so they look more realistic. I personally have VERY small round eyes and less wide lips and adding a slider to this app would definitely help me create a Bitmoji that looks a bit more like me. Also, I agree with many other reviews when it comes to the clothing. ADD MORE CLOTHES! Dang, I haven‚Äôt been able to ‚Äúwear‚Äù clothes that resemble my style either... "
144,Puppylover0954,"July 29, 2018",4,"Amazing but suggestions I love bitmojis and I feel like there could be things to make them even better. First off, I think there should be animals/pets added to your character, maybe add another app called Petmoji where you can select any basic pet and add others as you improve. Maybe your pet could even interact with your friends and play games or something. Second, there should be more frequent outfit that are more of today‚Äôs style. Third, I‚Äôd really love if we could change the color of outfits because sometimes we don‚Äôt like the colors they‚Äôre chosen and we could personalize it with our own colors and/or patterns. Maybe even make our own style. "

I love being able to customize my character how I please, and with all the new hairstyle and other customization features, it‚Äôs very easy to do so. But one thing that would make me ecstatic is if there were Bitmojis with pride flags on them. During pride month they were available, but have since disappeared. The classic pride rainbow over the Bitmojis head is still available, which is great, but I feel that other flags of LGBTQ+ community would be a great addition. For example, bisexual, lesbian, pansexual, asexual, polysexual, aromatic, etc. I think that this would certainly make, not only me, but other members of the LGBTQ+ community very happy."

149,wypbp,"October 29, 2019",2,"53 ‚ÄúHair Treatment‚Äù options but no adequate curly hair styles? The thing that has always kind of bothered me about Bitmoji is how there are extensive options in one category, but then very few in another. For example, there are no medium-length curly men‚Äôs styles, and the one closest to my hair (which is the first curly women‚Äôs style) is, quite frankly, hideous and simply not a haircut anyone has. I‚Äôm really not asking for much, just a little more diversity in the hair department with styles that aren‚Äôt obscure, that people actually have. Also, hats still just overlap hair and you can see it around the sides, which looks really unnatural but would be an easy fix. It‚Äôs been years ‚Äî please take care of this.

As Someone Who Often Likes My Hair Done In A Pompadour Style, It‚Äôs Disappointing To See That There Isn‚Äôt An Option Like That There, And There‚Äôs A Lot Of Popular Hairstyles Not Being Represented On Here, And That Can Alienate Potential Users. 2. Please Change How You Can Choose Your Clothing. I‚Äôm Fine With The Pre-Made Assets, But It Would Be Nice To Have The User Choose Their Own Combination Of Shirt, Shoe Type, And Pants/Shorts Types.

Like others have said, there's not enough skin color and hair options. Maybe people have the darker roots look with ombr√© or highlights and as someone else said, it would be nice to have that option as well (I personally would want a dark blonde roots option with white streaks/lengths). Furthermore, the blush tones are sort of strange, I'm very pale so only one of them looks okay on mine (also, what's up with the jet black and stark white blushes? More taupes or light browns would be nice) and a contour option would be cool too. More body types are needed too--there's basically just variations of hourglass skinny and ""fit"" (with minimal muscle) types and one apple shaped body type that carries most of the weight in the gut.

152,Child of the true King,"January 7, 2018",4,"Awesome! But could use some more. I love Bitmoji, it has so many stickers that can match almost any circumstance you need, but there are a few things that I would add. It would be amazing if you could make more than one Bitmoji, like make your whole family or some friends. But most of all, I wish you could make pets. I really want to make an emoji for my dog, because being in Junior High I love to send pictures of my dog and I to my friends, and the dog Bitmojis in some of the stickers look nothing like my dog. And I am sure there would have to be some cats, horses and other pets in there too. Overall Bitmoji is really good, it just needs a few things to add.

My grands are just now getting to that age where I‚Äôm still cool! Yay me! Here‚Äôs the BUT... I don‚Äôt have the body of a young gal! I could cheat and make mine not look like me but then, well it wouldn‚Äôt look like me! And that‚Äôs the whole point of the app!

157,sans plays trombone,"November 26, 2018",3,"Pretty good, but... This is a pretty good app. It is fun to use, and it has a lot a variety! I use it all the time in texting, and I like to change the avatar around. However, one of the most fun parts of using the bitmoji app is designing characters, and It would be a lot better if you could save different characters designs. It would make the app so much better and worthwhile if you could have multiple avatars, that you could save and switch between. Even if there are a limited amount of avatars you can change, I still think it would be a lot better! If you could, I would 100% give this app a 5 star rating. Also, a few of the bitmojis swear, so if that‚Äôs not your thing, just be careful :). In conclusion, it‚Äôs a good app, make multiple save able avatars, and some of the stickers swear :3."

Anyways, I have a idea.  Your app allows the stickers to be put on text messages, so this gave a me idea.  What if you made a sticker where you can put down (Ex: High Five) the first person could put down a sticker of a person with the little high five thing.  Then the second person could look up in the search bar High Five.  There, there would be the one they pasted AND one to respond, so then you could put yourself into THEIR bitmoji!  You could do it with hugs, high fives, even make us into birds and allow us to fly over the sunset in costumes!"
159,VenerableLiquid,"July 20, 2019",4,"Fun App, But Needs More Variety Bitmoji is really fun, but like some of the other reviewers I would like to see more variety in the outfits. Period styles and some long, full skirts here, please. Not one of the outfits reflects my style. They are all very similar, no variety in the skirts, and no feminine dresses. All the dresses look cheap. There is one outfit that reflects how I dressed in high school, but that was a long time ago! Also, there isn‚Äôt a real option for med-long curly hair. There are loose waves, and an Afro, neither of which is right for me. I‚Äôm in between those options. Other than that, I feel there are a lot of options for facial features and you can really make it look like a cartoon version of yourself. The actual stickers are fun and have a good amount of expression."

I'm Jewish and during the holiday season I would like to see more hannukah stuff instead of just all Christmas, Christmas has so many option to choose from, hannukah only has one. It would be nice to see my bitmoji lighting the hannukiah or spinning a dreidel with another emoji user. Great app, but I think it needs to be a little more open to other religions, and not just Judaism either!! I checked how many things there are for Islam and bahai and there is definitely not as many options for those two either, even though they are also some of the most popular religions in the world. It would be great to see a bit more diversity in this app!!!"
161,Lsbbball,"June 13, 2018",4,"Great app with a few issues I love this app! It‚Äôs so fun especially with Snapchat, but one big problem is with skin tones. There definitely needs to be more options, a tanner option for example. Second big one is that there should be an option to add beauty marks. Personally, that‚Äôs one of my most prominent features and I would love to show it on my Bitmoji. Another problem is the noses. There is only one kind one nose that doesn‚Äôt look completely terrible, and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone use any other nose besides that one. Lastly, your main users are probably teenage girls, and the Hollister section was good, but there needs to be more trendy but casual outfits. Again, this is a wonderful app that I enjoy to use, but there could just be a few things changed."

EXCEPT i can give myself realistic eyebrows. i prefer the bitmoji delux characters but my eyebrows are always hidden behind the frames of my glasses which i guess wouldn't be an issue if you had better thickness for eyebrows. i look at your thickest options for eyebrows and want to rip my hair out because if THATS THICK for everyone else then i guess i'm just a monster cursed with insanely thick eyebrows. but i don't think it's even that thick? i don't know but i feel stupid when my bitmoji delux thot doesn't have eyebrows bc they're so small they're the thickness as my glasses frame. anyways i guess it's come a long way but jesus
166,CarenW,"April 7, 2019",4,"Suggestion, PLEASE add a search in the app itself The Bitmoji is bigger when you use the Bitmoji app itself as opposed to using from the text message app. keyboard. Can you add a search in the Bitmoji app itself?  For example, when using the Bitmoji app, you have to go through the entire selection at the bottom of categories to find the Bitmoji you want but when using it from the text message app keyboard, you can put in a search and it brings up the specific Bitmoji. To add the search in the Bitmoji app itself would be soooo helpful because the Bitmoji‚Äôs are bigger.  I was wondering why everyone‚Äôs Bitmoji is bigger than mine, it‚Äôs because they use the app itself rather than they keyboard in the text message app. It‚Äôs a great app though."

It would just take me to no clothes when I tried to switch the pants or shoes or the shirt when you went to the personalizing area even though I would like to keep either the shirt, pants, or shoes. My next complaint that my friends share is the hairs. There is straight wavy but not too curly and super curly.

I also think, that there should be a way to make your own outfits. I would love it if they also had more hair styles in the medium length range, there are some, but not enough! None of them line up with my hair, and my bitmoji, is supposed to look like me. Well I thought. I have been using the bitmoji app for a while now, I love the updates!

Saying this it is still hard to create an accurate Bitmoji when there are a limited amount of choices. I am not talking about different hat colors or t-shirt opinions. I am mainly talking about body choices. There are five different body choices to pick from. The first four are all skinny in different ways while the fifth one is really fat. I am not skinny but I am also not that fat and it is kind of annoying since you have thousands of clothing options and only five body types to count for the millions of people in the world. So like I said, the app is fine but really needs to step up its game."

I and many of my friends would appreciate if you added this single picture, it would make our lives complete. Thank you for your consideration, and this addition would make the world a much better place for those who understand the memery behind it.

173,darth diaper,"January 13, 2019",4,"PLEASE ADD DISABLED FEATURES I think that Bitmoji should have features compatible to people with disabilities. Some examples could be a prosthetic arm or leg, crutches, wheelchair, casts, and other things. If a Bitmoji is a totally customizable character creator, it should have totally customizable features. I have had a foot injury for a long time and would like to add crutches or a boot/cast to my character because my injury is a big part of my appearance now. I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt be the only person who would really appreciate this update because lots of people have much more severe situations than me, and they deserve to be represented as well!

I don‚Äôt get why some of the cutest outfits are in maternity. I doubt anyone is gonna make their bitmoji wear an outfit like that cuz it‚Äôs maternity. If you could make cuter outfits like some in maternity that would be great and if we could be able to choose clothes separately not a whole outfit that would be great.

Oh wait, one more think, I think it would be awesome if we could design our own Bitmoji expressions and if it‚Äôs approved by the creators, everyone could use it!

For body types I do wish that there was a size variety between skinny and wide. I would like to see the option of being able to create your own outfit look. Because as of now some of the article of clothes in a few of the outfits don‚Äôt look good together.

I feel that it is necessary to not reuse clothes from previous seasons. If you have new clothes, it gives Bitmoji a fresher, cleaner feeling. When you have the same clothes from the last year, it‚Äôs not as exciting and enjoyable. You still have fun customizing your clothes, but it‚Äôs with the SAME CLOTHES from the LAST YEAR/SEASON!!

As well as, eye colors my eyes are not a dark brown but a light brown and the next shade is a hazel-ish color but the hazel choices are not well chosen. I also wish there would be more outfit choice. There‚Äôs a lot of costume choices which I think is irrelevant but I really press for more on outfit choices. Every time I update, I cross my fingers to see if any outfits were added in the wardrobe but no luck. Please fix this and add outfit choices please!!!!!"
201,482993639272818:782727,"February 28, 2018",4,Amazing but needs some features I love Bitmoji and I love how it works with snapchat. One of the things I really like in snapchat is the Bitmojis that have your avatar and your friend‚Äôs avatar I wish they would put that feature into iMessages. Another thing that should be added is there should be a feature where you pick a shirt then you pick pants and shoes because sometimes I will find a shirt I want but I don‚Äôt like the pants or shoes. Another thing is there should be more straight hair styles and there should be double French braids. Also I found a hairstyle in bitstrips I really liked that looked like me but they don‚Äôt have that one in the Bitmoji deluxe version. Please put the hairstyles from bitstrips into the Bitmoji deluxe version.
202,Zebraface101,"April 15, 2018",4,"Cool It‚Äôs awesome to be able to customize your own bitmoji and see your friends‚Äô on Snapchat. However, I really think there are a couple things that couple be better. First, more hair options. I understand there are a lot but I just can‚Äôt find one that matches mine, and also more options for the color of hair, because I 1. Have a weird shade and 2. Have two shades but I have short hair so I can‚Äôt do dual or even triple, like my hair is. I also think that the way mine‚Äôs face is is kind of odd and I wish there were more choices for smaller heads/jaws. I think body types are okay but also need a little more diversity, and finally multiple bitmojis at once would be really cool, like switching between several."
203,Elle beissa c,"May 1, 2019",1,needs an update Bitmoji is a great app. It‚Äôs become an important aspect of the snap universe but there is one fatal flaw. The outfits in this app lack creativity my and basic style. If you are looking for any individuality whatsoever this app is not for you. I often struggle to identify my friends on Snapchat because as we are all basic we all have the same outfits in bitmoji. One drastic way to improve this app that I have heard from many of my peers is to add more outfits options and make the outfit processes more involved on the app. I would like to be able to wear and tank top that‚Äôs pink with a pair of jeans that are from another outfit combo - and what about jewelry or shoes? Becky and Jennifer and Kristen all are wearing the same outfit and it seems like the time more a change. This app could boost its ratings and activity as well as profit if they made an update that lets users creature out out looks. Thank you!
204,FalconEye95,"May 22, 2019",4,"More facial customization? I love bitmoji, so much so that I got my mom on board! The only thing I really - I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúhave a problem with‚Äù per say - wish they‚Äôd have? Is a few more customization options in terms of facial features, hair, and stuff like that. I mean they have a TON right now and I love it, but I know a few people who haven‚Äôt been satisfied with their bitmoji because some of the features about themselves that they love aren‚Äôt included. Plus, I‚Äôm a total sucker for good hair in character customization. It just seems like everyone I know has the same exact hair option, though. Maybe some variations of the same kinds of styles?

Although it‚Äôs a great app, there can be some features that will make the app even better. 1.)Make more emotions and stickers. For example maybe a bored sticker or even a wrestling sticker would be nice. People would be able to express themselves more. 2.)Hairstyles needs to be fixed with the hats. When you add big hair to a Bitmoji with big hair, the hat just looks like it is placed on top of the hair without actually covering up. 3.)More custom outfits, I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing hype beast fits or clothes you would find in real life"

The app has definitely improved and I love being able to customize my avatar and send them to my friends; however, there‚Äôs just one problem. For a couple months now, I‚Äôve noticed that the app freezes every time I open it. I have to close it out and reopen it an hour or so later for it to work again. It also freezes on the message app when I go to send a Bitmoji to someone. Also, when I go to customize my avatar sometimes it lets me customize but other times it will let me click on everything EXCEPT that. I hope that these bugs will be fixed within the next update.

215,Jampaaaaaaa,"August 24, 2018",2,"Cute but not practical! So, I communicate with my friends in 3 different languages. And the only way to change the bitmojis language is switching the phone language. Every time you do that you need to wait for your phone to restart. That‚Äôs not convenient at all. Why not include all the languages in the search, like the gifs keyboards?! If I‚Äôm searching for some word in Spanish - give me results for bitmojis in Spanish - if I‚Äôm searching for English, give me English results. And the same for other languages... Or at least come up with something automatic that the phone language doesn‚Äôt need to be switched in order to search for bitmojis in other languages. "

Can there also be more eye colors? The last thing I wish for is that there can be more lips, like bigger or some with piercings (I also wish that noses could have piercings).

217,hodgette12,"November 29, 2019",4,"Updated Clothes and Hairstyles As much as I love the many options that you have to customize your Bitmoji I believe that it‚Äôs time for some more. I feel like there should be more hair style choices, or better yet a way to mix them. Say you wanted a certain hairstyle but you wanted it parted on the left or the middle or the right, you should be able to do that (this is primarily targeted at girls hairstyles). Also I do feel that there needs be an update in the clothing choices. Using different brands, having more clothing choices in general.

That‚Äôs why me and my friends dress up our bitmoji‚Äôs as different things. For starters I think you should add a mask like ones you use if your sick because of this journey and second off  I think you should make it where you search something up, or you create your own ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù and outfits.

It‚Äôd be nice to have a few more realistic hair designs. Also, the outfits, I just wanna scroll through more options and exchanging clothes with one another instead of having a complete outfit done alone. I can‚Äôt find any that really suit me.

222,DONT EGNORE,"June 3, 2018",5,"Add this to your next update Ok I love the app and it is a good way to customize your Bitmoji . But I have some suggestions to add to your next update, braces, you can add braces to give people a less limited variety of add ons. Also you can add mini games to maybe attract more children to get the app. Also you can add edges so your hair can be slayed to the gods. Also nail polish and a wide variety of it like glittery,Crome,long,short and all different shapes these are just some new additions to the app you can make to the app to make it better if you add these You know I will be using it way more also if we could customize our own clothing it would be great"

I really like that you can use bitmoji with your friends in messages as well as Snapchat. One thing that I would like the app to have is a place where you can assemble your own outfit instead of having to pick from a set outfit. For me, at least, there are some outfits with a top that I would wear that looks good, but the pants don‚Äôt look good at all on my bitmoji or on me irl. I‚Äôm not even into fashion and wearing good looking clothes at all, but it would be nice to have the chance to put together an outfit that I would actually wear.

I would like to be able to make my own outfit instead of having to choose from the present outfits. I think this would benefit people to express their individual creativity and style. Also i would really like to see more relaxed styles. Like hoodies, sweatpants, leggings, ect. Most high school and college aged students use this app, and that is what most wear and are most comfortable in."

But I would recommend this app for anyone who has Snapchat it makes the world a little easier.‚Ä¶anyway the Bitmoji is kind of unsafe. For  one people can find out what you look like which could be kind of dangerous in the world.

The upgrade I‚Äôd like to see is the option to have a white background because some text are not visible on iPhone‚Äôs dark mode.

The only thing that I have to say is that there are some inappropriate Bitmojis, but the app is rated 12+, so it‚Äôs not meant for little kids.

I also agree with other people about the need to customize. Considering Bitmoji is a way for users to express themselves virtually through an avatar, I feel we should have options to change certain things such as the length of hair, how curly/wavy/straight it is, combinations of outfits as well as colors for items of clothing, and different stickers to showcase more of our different personalities.

I love the app and I love the diverse features you guys have given with skin color, hair type/texture...etc. However, i give it two stars because I think body type/shapes should be more diverse. You should include a size right in between the last two sizes because A LOT of people fall in between that...the size right before the biggest body type is too small. Perhaps you guys should think about including a ‚Äúspectrum size bar‚Äù or maybe have a more options to choose between different body part sizes. You guys did it with the chest sizes for the female Bitmoji. Consider adding different sizing for butts/legs/hips/arms so we can adjust our sizes accordingly. After all, the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part of Bitmoji is the fact that we can make our characters look like us."

I want to be able to make my bitmoji look like me and dress my style and wear something I'd wear like not a select outfit I guess? And maybe more freedom with jewelry cause I love chokers but I find I can't wear a choker with a outfit because it doesn't come with the outfit. I'm not sure I guess just more freedom on clothes piercings tattoos even maybe? And maybe even makeup because I love makeup and I'm not really able to express that with bitmojis current functions.

249,CybermanFord,"July 10, 2019",4,"Great, but here‚Äôs a few suggestions! I love using Bitmoji, but it would be great if you could do more things. I wish there was more freedom of choice when you create an avatar. I don‚Äôt like the fact that you can only choose one whole outfit, and even though there are many, it would still be great if you could actually separate clothing. Like, you could choose some pants, and then go and choose a shirt, and whatnot. I also wish there were more hats and accessories. Also, I wish there were more selfies and faces, and it would also be great if you could have a selfie automatically create a Bitmoji as an option, instead of it being a one-time thing."
250,I‚ù§Ô∏èBrooklyn and Bailey,"January 1, 2018",4,"A few problems This app is great! It‚Äôs really fun to change your avatars outfit and style. I have found a few problems with this app though. I have recently changed my avatar from the BitMoji option to a BitStrip. I changed it because I have long hair, and the longest length for the normal BitMoji is to your shoulders. I decided to try the BitStrips option. Sure enough, there‚Äôs long hair. I like the BitMoji look better than the BitStrips look, but I hate having short hair on it. Another problem I have with this, is that the eye liner or whatever it is on the BitStrips is a little off on it. It looks bad. But other than that, it‚Äôs great! Once you change those, I‚Äôll rate this app 5 stars."

They update frequently, giving you even more to love. The most recent update added different hair colors, better graphics, a wider selection of almost everything, etc. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever faced any problems with this app and the fact that it connects to Snapchat is spectacular. I don‚Äôt think I can make ANY suggestions to Bitmoji, it is just truly remarkable. I hope I influenced your choice and I know you will love this app! It is such a great way to express yourself over chat."
252,Sam.Perryy,"April 13, 2018",4,Too based on societal norms I love bitmoji however I‚Äôm a biological female who presents myself as a male and is more androgynous and gender neutral than female. I feel like bitmoji is very gendered to male or female I want my bitmoji to look like me and there aren‚Äôt many options for a female who dresses as a male. I only wear boy clothes and I feel that bitmoji should mix all the clothing choices together for others this way I don‚Äôt have to make my bitmoji a boy to have the clothes i wear. I also think piercings and glasses should have more options and that there should be facial piercings and different ear piercing styles. I think jewelry accessories should be added as well. Overall bitmoji is steered towards mainstream society it‚Äôs 2018 make a bold move.
253,Dena Ivey,"January 26, 2019",5,Totally love it!! I have always loved this app!  My husband and I text each other every day with conversations using nothing but bitmoji's. 
254,Cody801,"May 5, 2019",5,"Super awesome! I‚Äôm reading a lot of really weird and lame complaints. One guy complained because his avatars wouldn‚Äôt download so he purchased faster internet speed so they would download faster. He literally purchased faster net service for a cell phone app!!! Should I go on with this? Most others complain about the clothing options or other things regarding style. I get that but I‚Äôd like to bring that to the developers as a suggestion not a complaint. Whoever made this app worked hard and that‚Äôs why, besides the style complaints that we all love it. This app is awesome. Great job! I can‚Äôt wait for the next update."
255,Cheerfulelestia,"June 5, 2019",3,"A bit missing... It needs more clothing and hair options. I also think this app should be more customizable like adding hazel eyes, and being able to put more than one special feature on because some people have both freckles AND dimples. I feel like braces and one cheeked dimples would be awesome. I think it would be a good idea to add body scales as well so that the character looks more personalized. The skinny body‚Äôs are too skinny for me, but the bigger ones are too big.. Overall this needs more customization. My biggest request in definitely for more cute hairstyles. Other than what‚Äôs missing the app is pretty cool and there is sooooo many variations of each little picture you can send to your friends."
256,Sydthekid64,"June 8, 2019",4,"One little upgrade So I luv this app and all but some things they forgot, first off for the outfits there shouldn‚Äôt be just one whole outfit. U should be able to pick your top then your bottoms. Also for the boys there is not many great options. I am a girl but I‚Äôm with the boys on this one. My Bitmoji wears the boy clothes, and I do like the outfit it‚Äôs wearing but all boys r different. Also there should maybe creating your shirt and pants and maybe your own logo or saying. There should be accessories like earrings necklaces bracelets chokers and etc. And I don‚Äôt think there should be language there is some kids out there ya know. Otherwise luv the app. Well done and great sayings and logos(besides the language)"

258,kinglesbo,"March 20, 2020",3,"not enough diversity As far as I know, this app is meant to be a way to express yourself through an emoji format, yet it does a poor job allowing it's users full reign and choice. With the evergrowing amount of diversity in the appearance of today's youth, bitmoji just doesn't keep up. There's a lack of options that leads to limiting freedom of expression. There are no piercings, not enough makeup options, not enough hair options or clothing options etc. Furthermore, i think the app would benefit from better hat and hair interaction options, specially allowing the hairstyles to be tucked into whatever hat option you choose. Also, can we have a pink skin option? Honestly, the app itself works perfectly fine, it's just the lack of expression."

260,Catterox101,"December 10, 2017",4,"Update Customizing I love this app and it's great, but we need more options for hair color - darker red hair, darker colorful hair (barely anyone has neon hair anymore), and maybe some hair color that's balayage. We also need more skin shades because i am very pale but not as pale as the lightest shade which makes me look white. More hairstyles would be cool too because i have collarbone length pin straight hair and there isn't even an option for that.....i either have to have long hair or some weird short hair that looks like a mom's hair (no offense). also different body types would be great, maybe change it to a scale so people can decide how big or small they want their bitmoji width and height to be? thanks!"
261,Br¬£n[}@n,"April 10, 2018",5,"Great no awesome But... I love the feature where you can do collaborate in bitmoji with Snapchat. What I don't love about it is that you can only do it with Snapchat. Also the bitmoji closet is so small. Maybe you should make a feature where you make your own outfit. Where you could choose whatever pants you like, whatever shirt you like, and whatever ever you like. I absolutely love this app but these features would make it way better. I want to be able to collaborate with Bitmoji on Messages or Hangouts too. I want to have more accessibility to outfits and custom outfits. Please consider making this update."

And the only one lighter is to light. I would like more in between options for people with other types of natural hair colors. I wear colorful glasses (blue, pink and yellow stripes) and I think that the glasses should be customizable. And I think you should have little scales for bodies. Because everyone it different. And also. Can someone add in certain areas with highlights (my hair is brown with blonde highlights in the front) and I need to see things happen with the outfits! We need more clothing. It's spring and my bitmoji is either boiling or freezing. There is not in between. Thanks"

You really need to be able to search in Bitmoji like you can when you pull it up on Snapchat- like if I want to send a happy face I should be able to search the word happy and all the happy faces come up. Also, I really wish that you could save certain ones that you like and you know that you would use frequently. It just takes so much time to look through all of them and it‚Äôs difficult to find which one you really want to use without it taking forever."

It seems like Bitmoji has an expressive reaction to every situation I can think of!! Love this app! One feature that I would really appreciate is to all users to ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù inside the app for a specific expression, just like we can inside our texting apps. Since I save the Bitmojis as photos and use them in marketing and coaching materials (like flyers and email), I would like to be able to quickly access images without needing to take a screen shot or save through my texting app."

Those were the Bitmoji Deluxe and new clothes, but lately there hasn‚Äôt been anything new. No new clothing, no new hair styles, nothing. And like I said in my previous reviews, having the clothings all together doesn‚Äôt allow us as users to get very creative with our Bitmojis. I really hope that you guys are working on something big and exciting for this app whether it‚Äôs more hair styles, the ability to change individual clothing pieces, anything other than ‚Äúbug fixes and improvements‚Äù because it‚Äôs getting boring."
270,Use to like the game!,"October 6, 2017",5,Love...but why? The body sizes go from small and skinny to a potato. There needs to be like one more size between the last two where the Bitmoji has big arms and big legs but a smaller stomach. Like curvy I guess you could say. I‚Äôm not skinny by any means. But I am no potato. I feel fat shamed to pick the biggest one but it kinda puts my self esteem down. Please add one more size between the last two and make it more proportional please. Other than that I love this app. I use it for everything! People just always wonder why I use le potato build when oh nay nay I am none of those sizes. PLEASE CHANGE!

However, after using bitmoji for a few years, I notice that a lot of my friends bitmojis look somewhat the same. I realized there‚Äôs a bunch of short hair styles for girls but only a handful of long hair options. Maybe in the next update more long hair options for girls would be great. Even an update that could make outfits more customizable would help, where you could pick out the exact top, pants, and shoes to wear.

I went to Avatar on the bottom of the screen and I pushed it but nothing happened. Then I went to settings in the game and I pushed CHANGE AVATAR STYLE.

For the next big update, I would love it if you gave us options to chose a different top, pants, and shoes for every outfit. Just take the existing parts of the outfits (shoes, tops, pants) and make them into separate categories where you can change their color and create your own.

Especially now with how Snapchat is set up where your Bitmoji is kind of front and center. This represents a person and I feel like there could be so much more variety.

I would just like it to be more open and have the makeup option for both sexes and maybe add another gender other than male and female. Some people feel a mix and the question of their gender can be very uncomfortable. Please add makeup and more feminine clothing options, after all the world is changing in ways for the better.

Most of my girl friends have much longer hair than I give options for and so it becomes a choice of whether u want it to look more like yourself ‚Äîbut kind of demented?‚Äî or have it be cute but not how your hair looks.

Again, not too worried about it and not sure what the problem is but it would be really cool if that could be fixed."

I just uninstalled it for the third and last time until I read where they have fixed this issue. When I switch to the Bitmoji keyboard in iMessage, I kiss my regular keyboard goodbye. There‚Äôs no getting it back - even when I disable the Bitmoji keyboard in settings, it still won‚Äôt allow my regular keyboard to be used. Instead, when I reopen messenger after disabling Bitmoji, I get a message - where my regular keyboard SHOULD BE - that tells me the Bitmoji keyboard does not have full access and provides a link to my keyboard settings! My only option is to turn bitmoji keyboard back on. Thanks for being such a dictator. You‚Äôre outta here until you fix this."
299,Lulu Freij,"March 20, 2020",4,"Amazing but I‚Äôd wish it was better This app truely is awesome its also very fun to use, but I‚Äôd wish there were more hairstyles espacially for the girls because I can‚Äôt tend to find curly hair, all I find is really fluffed up hair. That goes to the bitmoji selfies, too. Another major thing I face problems with is finding a shade or colorthat matches my hair color because when we dye our hair you know we also want our bitmoji to look like us too. For example the purple colors are either too dark or straight pink. I hope you guys fix this and give in extra colors and maybe even add piercings like nose rings or studs. But like overall this app is one of the best üíô"

It would also be cool if there were new outfits with each update as well. Spice it up a bit- I get bored wearing the same clothes all the time. I like to pick clothes that are my style in real life, so I only have limited outfits to choose from so they look like me.

My bisexual friend actually cried when she saw it because she‚Äôs never been represented in an app like this before. The only note I have is that you add a few more hair styles (particularly on the curly variety) because I can‚Äôt find anything that really matches.

I also feel that we should be able to customize our own outfits because, some of the tops I like for myself but I hate the pants and shoes! I feel we should have the option of skinny jeans, or other kinds that people like and different shoes that we can change the colors on and style.

It‚Äôs so silly and funny to use when sending these to other people!!! I definitely recommend this app, especially for iMessage!

And I have a friend that has curly hair but is not as dramatic as the one in bitmoji so she has to use a wavy hair style that looks nothing like her natural hair.

The stickers you can send are awesome, and I love the many ways you can design your bitmoji. However, there are two major flaws with this app (in my opinion). You are only allowed to make one bitmoji, and if the game let you make multiple bitmoji saved as outfits, that would be amazing. Also, it would be great if they added more stickers and more outfits. It would be nice if they let you break down the outfits into different genres. For example, you could choose socks, shoes, shirts, pants, and jackets/coats/hoodies. All of these additions would make bitmoji more diverse and a better app."

It could be cool because you could make your friends who don‚Äôt have Bitmoji and also you could make your avatar saved with a different outfit on in case we are unable to find an outfit that was taken off and hard to search for.

But I would definitely like to see Bitmoji improve in trend wise, I think Bitmoji should make different hair styles and a forever 21 outfit sections.

320,Monkey18-,"September 29, 2017",4,Outfits The only problem I have with the Bitmoji outfits is that's I think you should be able to access old outfits that you've had on before because when I accidentally changed my bitmoji outfit I had a limited addition footlocker Collaboration jacket that's when I accidentally changed and now i don't have that jacket I want that jacket back because it's the only thing I like especially cause I'm picky with everything meaning clothes too and being a girl makes it worse so I'd like it so you can access you're past bitmoji outfits from the past even limited outfits from the past that you've worn

I often wear natural twists if my hair isn't braided or in an afro. I have seen a few variations of dreadlocks, but no twists. I ended up using a wavy male hairstyle in place of this. I wish you guys could add more hairstyles for everyone. The other thing is more of a suggestion. Maybe instead of having all the clothes as single outifts, users can mix and match different bottoms with tops to creat the ultimate unique look. That is all, and great app"
323,Cia.Reviews,"November 2, 2018",1,"It's okay There really isn't any curly hair to choose from even after this much time has passed. Skin tones are still limited, the curls are scarce and the types of curly hair you have to choose from are even less. The keyboard constantly crashes for me and the app doesn't even open outside of snapchat so I can't even use it. Theres a lot of straight and kind of wavy hair options but forget it if you've got classic spiral curly. In bitstrip there used to be a wheelchair option but that has yet to return, which is disappointing consider the demand for a more inclusive character customization experience has always been around. It's a good character/avatar app if you have a popular style of some sort. Not sure if anyone else has the problem with constant crashes but it gets pretty annoying"

First, please keep adding new outfits to wear, like t-shirts that aren't just one color, or a blazer with a bow tie (please add a bow tie).  Second, it would be really cool if we could make our own bitmojis, like with custom words, fonts, colors, clothes for our guy (without changing your normal clothes), and poses.  This would help me use them way more often because it's hard to find oune that's perfect for a situation before the topic goes away.

I like the premade outfit idea so maybe for those who like that instead, there should be a button or something.

347,"GreatGame,But...","January 11, 2020",5,"Amazing, but... I have used bitmoji for more than three years now, and I am loving it! It is a really fun way to express myself, so good that you could just have a conversation of just bitmojis."
348,Mattwick101,"November 4, 2019",4,Great but needs updated facial hair I‚Äôll give this five stars when you update your facial hair selections. There are tons of options with other aspects in the app but then it seems like you wimped out on facial hair. I always trim in unique ways and so it‚Äôs a blend of different styles and non of the presets in the app seems fits right. I need to be able to pick the different elements individually or overlap some of them so it actually looks like me. And there needs to be some extra clothing options as well. Like maybe choosing color from a color pallet for the clothing you already have would improve it greatly. Thanks.
349,Kass m rivera,"August 4, 2019",5,"Can you come up with bitmoji alive like Memoji ? It will be a great idea if the Bitmoji can come up with a similar look a like the bitmoji just like the memojis and Animoji Meaning we can take pictures and look like our own Bitmoji and video clips for Snapchat and Instagram just like the iPhone Xr has they can take photos with the face of their character and video as well for the ones I don‚Äôt have the xr will be awesome, Just hoping you guys can do something like that would be really great and everybody will love it I know it because a lot of people would love to have them memoji‚Äôs"
350,Rosey5282,"September 23, 2017",5,"I love it but... This app is great and I love that I can use it in snapchat and on my messaging app. The only issue I have are the outfits available. I think you should offer more skirt options as I'm Pentecostal and only wear skirts. Not mini skirts either. There should be longer lengths even dresses or maxi skirts. Skirts are always in season, but not that short. I think it would be nice to be able to coordinate your outfits like you do accessories. Separately. Other than that I love Bitmoji and will continue to use it but would like more options that are modest and not so skimpy."

I love the new style in bitmoji deluxe. Every time I‚Äôm texting in group chats I always use my bitmoji and someone says, ‚ÄúTHAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE U‚Äù. Then someone else would say we can look as hot as we want. But then again I want my bitmoji to looks as real as possible so I would like more short natural black hair for men options because I cannnot find a hair that suits me.

352,GPJ993,"September 3, 2018",5,"Hey Bitmoji creators I love it when you guys design new clothing and put it on the game! So awesome! Could you please do that more often? ALSO, the hair styles for girls are very limited, there aren‚Äôt really any medium sized hair cuts that really apply to a lot people. For myself I always hate the hairstyle on my Bitmoji because I feel that it doesn‚Äôt actually match my style, can you guys include some more designs please? Other than these requests, this app is super amazing and I spend long amounts of time always customizing my Bitmoji and creating a mini me! I really love this app and you should too!"

They‚Äôre totally cute on Snapchat and I appreciate the people who made them to put on Snapchat, but I would like there to be more options to change your bit emojis for an example more colors I mean who doesn‚Äôt love different varieties because I know I do. Maybe someone could start something new like getting coins on Snapchat for doing a certain thing on there and with the coins we could buy things to make things more exciting! I love what the Snapchat company did to Snapchat but again there could be some changes!"

I have used it for like two years, and I love having a mini me to express myself with on my phone. Everything is awesome except for one thing... OUTFITS! Where is the baggy sweatshirts and the vintage clothes and the cute hoodies? We need better clothes! I don‚Äôt like having skin tight clothes in every single outfit except for the jerseys. Could you please add some simple oversized sweatshirts with shorts or leggings? That would be great! We all would appreciate this. Also, could you add different teeth? Like teeth with a gap or teeth with braces? I have a gap and my bitmoji looks weird with normal teeth. Thank you so much!"

Also, my friend‚Äôs Bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look her because there are no earrings! It‚Äôs a really cool app but it needs more hair, clothing and there should be earrings! Also, some of the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù outfits are to ‚Äúgirlie‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt make sense, some of the outfits that are for the boys should be in the girls clothes. Another thing is what if you bisexual/transgender there is not option it‚Äôs either boy or girl, which is not fair! Can you right back!?ü§®"
356,Charmed824,"February 27, 2019",5,"Fun! Love it! However, please do an update with more editing options. I would love to have more clothing/hairstyle options. It seems like the current choices have been there forever. Would be fun to chose outfits individually piece by piece (such as options to ‚Äúchoose a shirt or top‚Äù and then ‚Äúchoose pants or a skirt‚Äù and ‚Äúchoose your shoes‚Äù etc). In my opinion there‚Äôs way too many sports-type outfits and a lot of my friends bitmoji‚Äôs look the same due to everyone picking the same outfits. Other than those suggestions, I love the bitmoji app!"
357,ackj1234,"March 12, 2020",3,Pretty good (please read!) Hey guys! Today I‚Äôm going to be doing a review for Bitmoji.
358,kikiluv20,"January 7, 2020",5,"Needs more hair diversity for natural hair This is app is great and all but y‚Äôall should really take the time to diversify the natural hair styles and textures. Not everyone has cotton texture, there‚Äôs people who have curls as well.  There‚Äôs bunch of straight hairstyles but not enough for people with natural hair. In the future I hope y‚Äôall add curlier textures and protective styles like maybe box braids, lemonade braids, and bead options for certain styles as well. I‚Äôd also like to see different hairline shapes. Not everyone has a straight box hair line. Just a lil suggestion cause my Bitmoji never really looks like me."
359,Cruzn2,"September 19, 2019",5,"Still in love... but... Ok. So; I was glad to know you could revert to your previous bitmoji style. And although some changes didn‚Äôt revert totally to the perfection that was my bitmoji or as many call it Lizmoji. it was pretty darn close. However, the Hair styles in the deluxe version is waaaayyy better. Hair styles that suit and fit me. The curly hair is on point. I need that to be available on the classic version. Please!!!! Ooooooh, pleeease!!! Make it available for the classic version. Still love you guys but do that. Oh!!!! And how about some tattoos!!!! I‚Äôd really love to add some of those!!!! Ok. That is all. Thank you!!!!"
360,Aankane avjdud,"October 12, 2017",4,"Yayy Okay gr8 app and all the only thing that bothers me so much is that when you're picking the ""Bitmoji style"" or ""bitstrips style"" when you pick Bitmoji style you can't have long hair!!! I really like the Bitmoji style but I have to have my Bitmoji wear a ponytail even though I don't usually wear ponytails because I have long hair & if I wear a short hairstyle that just doesn't look like me. I recently just changed my Bitmoji into NFL gear because that's the only way I get to have long hair but I'd love for it to be like that with other outfits as well. I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate this if it were on the next update as well :)"
361,Sn@k3m@n,"November 29, 2017",2,"We need more outfit choices I think it is save to say that Bitmoji has not updated their clothing formula in some while. They should change it up so everybody could dress a little more differently, a chance to make Bitmoji more personal. It is annoying to see many friends have the same clothes because they don‚Äôt have the correct clothes. It‚Äôs 2017 and the phones have processors far greater to have just a couple of similar options. There‚Äôs many social stereotypes that Bitmoji could derribe inspiration, there‚Äôs goths, there‚Äôs swag clothing, winter, hot, gangsters, ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù, there‚Äôs many stores they can take look at and take inspirations, cmon Bitmoji, we need a new update with more coming options, more hair, more styles, WHILE STILL KEEPING THE HOLD ONES"
362,ravenclawviss,"February 10, 2018",4,Recommendations I think that if you were to add braces the Bitmojis would be more realistic because a lot of people have braces and there is currently no option for braces so I personally think that would be a great thing to add. Another thing that I think you could add is more choices on clothing because the clothing given is either sporty or has been there since fall or summer. And lastly I think you could is more eye colors because not all people have those eye colors. Maybe you could put like more mixes of colors into the eyes. Thank you for listening/reading and please consider these options
363,paawz3,"February 19, 2018",5,"Love Bitmoji! I love Bitmoji. Especially the new update where you can take a picture of yourself and it kind of matches your facial features for you. I wish that there was an option to add more piercings though so it matches the person more. For example: cartilage piercings, second and third hole ear piercings, whole ear piercings, (add earring options as well), eyebrow, tongue, nose, etc... I feel like people get piercings to be more unique/add character to themselves (not that everyone isn‚Äôt unique anyway, but still) and having the options to add them to your Bitmoji would be great!"
364,Butterflypoet,"March 24, 2018",4,Love it! I love being able to respond to messages with theses characters! The word responses & facial expressions are on point. I‚Äôm leaving this message to say I appreciate your push to add more ethnic hairstyles- my request at this time is can you just add the hairstyles from the ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù to the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù? In ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù the options to create certain parts of my face are missing so I don‚Äôt look like myself-
365,Big dack 202,"January 26, 2019",5,"Needs more clothes I‚Äôve been using this app ever since it came out, then everyone got it once they collaborated with snapchat. I love this app very much it‚Äôs so much fun making a mini you!! But I wish that they had more clothing options. I wear pacsun, Brandy Melville, and billabong and they don‚Äôt have any of these stores :(( it‚Äôs hard to recognize your bitmoji when you don‚Äôt wear the same clothes :(( my bitmoji wears the American eagle clothes but I think that collection is either too dressy or it‚Äôs too casual. Even if you guys don‚Äôt make pacsun, BM, or billabong I‚Äôll still use it !!"
366,QueenBhadB,"January 29, 2019",4,"Needs more! I would like for the app to have more hairstyle options, specifically different curls. I don‚Äôt see my type of curls as one of the hairstyles. Either it‚Äôs to tight of a curl or to loose so I would like more options. Maybe event have some half up half down hairstyles and braids. "
367,AriamWolf,"May 25, 2019",5,OBSESSED I am waaaay Obsessed with this app I use it multiple times a day I‚Äôm constantly editing my Bitmoji and constantly making a bunch of them and I have always been obsessed with character customization games and I have a suggestion that would REALLY help. Maybe be able to save Bitmojis? Like have a place on the app that shows all the Bitmojis you‚Äôve ever made like basically a gallery or history thing or whatever it would really help with the whole storage problem because most of my photos are screenshots of all the Bitmojis I make
368,Lnb234,"April 14, 2020",4,":/ Hi! I love this app, but i just wanted to give some ideas that you could use in the future.. I think pregnancy should be in a body type not clothing. There are sooooo many clothes in the maternity section. Also I think you should expand on the hair choices.(loose curls, braids,etc) also I noticed that clothes and hats were missing. I get it you have to replace them for new clothing updates but i think you should get rid of the ones that are kind of out of style or just don‚Äôt make sense. My old outfit is gone. it‚Äôs kind of upsetting, especially when it was an accident. (pls bring it back) thank you ‚úåÔ∏è"
369,Ally marie T,"January 4, 2020",5,"Great app‚ù§Ô∏èbut needs some more.... Don‚Äôt get me wrong this app is amazing, I‚Äôm in love with my friends can send each other them for hours. But in the pants/jeans section there are no ripped jeans, which a LOT of people wear so please add that, and I also love putting my hair in braids please add more options for braids with the hair ombr√©. Maybe in the sweaters/ jacket section you could add some more jackets like an off the shoulder one since some people like there jackets like that. If you read all of this, thank you very much, this is a great app to get, but they do need some more stuff."

The diversity in skin tone & the selection of religious headware is so much better than before. & the new hair colors and styles?? Golden. A++. I‚Äôm having so much fun with the color selections and combinations.

372,Cindi Lynne69,"February 15, 2018",4,"suggestions?? while the app consists of many new realistic looking type features there are still things missing. i believe there should be an even bigger amount hair styles. for example, i have short hair and the short hair options don‚Äôt really match up with the way i want my bitmoji to look but not only that the noses aren‚Äôt too real either. while on that note i also noticed that when you wear a hat it just kind of rests over like a sticker when it should actually look like it is on the bitmojis head, but also there aren‚Äôt that many hats and there should be more kind of beanie hats. almost done here. i think we should be able to choose any shirt or pants or shoes instead of having certain outfits and be able to change the colors of wanted. and lastly i think there should be different eye lashes and eyes because to me they just do not look right and i dislike that fact. so i hope you take some of my ideas into consideration. thank you."
373,BennyRay84,"April 25, 2018",5,"I love this update, but still a little room for improvement Great idea with the selfie transforming into the bitmoji!! The only things I would say that needs improvement (but nothing major to take a star away at the moment), is more options for hairstyles and for us to actually modify the body instead of preset ones. I thought about about this because I joked with my wife about changing her bitmoji after her hairstyle she's about to get, they don't have one. Basically, it'll be a shaved cut. I'm sure she's not the only one who has this issue.."

I want to use but Bitmoji but it just won‚Äôt load!! I tried switching accounts too. It loads the characters and clothing, just not the actual Bitmoji moji!! It‚Äôs soooo annoying!

And what if I‚Äôm using crutches? You can‚Äôt tell by my Bitmoji. Also, there‚Äôs almost NO cute but tomboyish outfits!!! I can‚Äôt seem to find any cute t-shirts with sayings on them, and there are like ZERO ripped jeans...that being said, I LOVE the variety in hairstyles and colors and the variety in all the face options. My Bitmoji used to look absolutely NOTHING like me, but now it is practically SPOT ON!!! Thank you so much for making this app!!

I know we‚Äôre getting more outfit options...but what about bodies? I think there are only 4...and it‚Äôs been this way a while. For the new year, new body types and should be a thing. Because some are so drastically different from one another...but as a plus size person without a belly, it‚Äôs hard to choose because of the inaccuracy. Not that it will keep me from doing my thing every day with mine lol."

I wish I could choose hair styles more accurately to what I do to my own hair like having a hair style with bangs but pulled back into a pony tail because that is how I wear my hair. I also wish there where more abilities to pick out my own outfit instead of taking on that is already built for you. I also understand that I can choose my cloths separately now but there still isn‚Äôt as many options as I see in the already built outfit. Other wise I love this app."
379,Miss old bitmoji,"April 25, 2020",1,So disappointed! I accidentally deleted Bitmoji and when I reinstalled it I was so upset at the changes!  It doesn‚Äôt have the same options as it did before.  I loved my Bitmoji and now I can‚Äôt recreate it.  I can‚Äôt find a good eye shape option. They all have thick eyeliner around the entire eye. I loved the flower headband and it‚Äôs no longer there even though they show it in the ad!  I can‚Äôt get the 2 tone hair color and that‚Äôs in the ad too!  Not as many clothes options.  Couldn‚Äôt find the hairstyle option I had before.  I could go on and on. Why did you take so many options away?  It was perfect before. I did the best I could because after looking at other apps it‚Äôs still the best but my new Bitmoji is nowhere as cute as it was before and I‚Äôm very sad about that.
380,Hayden Lovelace,"March 8, 2018",5,"Customizable Outfits I LOVE this app, and the creativity has been awesome. Especially with all the recent updates that allow you to make the Bitmoji more detailed. With that being said, if the developers could make more customizable outfits that would be fantastic. There are so many tops that would be cool with other bottoms. And shoes that would look cool on other outfits. What would also be dope is a color wheel along with clothing items. So you can customize the clothes to your style and liking. These are my biggest hopes for this app. Thank you!"
381,A.W. I love this game,"March 30, 2018",5,"Love it! Just a couple suggestions though I use bitmojis pretty much every day. And since it is almost spring, I was hoping there could be some more outfits out related to spring. Also I was wondering if you could fix the issue where bitmojis with some of the new hairstyles could wear all of the hats. When I was trying on the costumes, the headpiece wasn‚Äôt showing up. I thought it was kind of awkward that he headpieces weren‚Äôt showing up on the costumes. I hope you can fix this issue ASAP. Please and thank you. Other than that, I love the app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
382,good game 02 ves,"April 24, 2018",5,"In love I totally love this app it has such a variety. Personally I would have set it up better just with the outfits and facial stuff, it is NOT CONFUSING so you can instantly have fun. I have braces and I think they should totally add braces because that can really mean a lot when you have braces. Ear rings would also be a nice touch. I am taller than a bunch of my friends and some are taller than I am so having like a side scroll bar thet adjusts the height.  Those are just improvements it does not need them it would just be pretty cool. but overall üòç. ( I love it)"
383,Kelse2019,"July 5, 2018",5,"Love it!!! I really love the app!! I use it almost every day. But one thing I would change is the clothes choice and the hair choices. I love some of the outfits but then others I only like parts of them. I think I would be cool if you made it so users could customize outfits if they want to but also have the option of the outfits that are already put together. For the hair you need to add more styles, sometimes I want to change my hair style but all of the other options aren't really me. But other than that I love this app!!!!!!!!"
384,Wittlehay,"August 4, 2018",4,"Love love, but .. I love it! Everything about the app is pretty much perfect :) only one request I have would be the hair.. yes, there are now several different styles and colors now available however the lengths of those styles aren‚Äôt always accurate to the person.. like myself I have medium length hair but the only styles you have for medium hair are not what mine looks like.. I think myself and others would like the option of lengthening or shortening the hair to our liking and also how thick and thin it might be or how straight and how wavy just please add more customizable options to the hair section. Thanks!!"
385,Marshcream üíõ,"December 15, 2018",4,"LOVE IT!! Just a suggestion: I'm a huge fan of Bitmoji. The stickers are sooo cool and relatable, and it's easy and quick to create your own character."
386,Volmos2004,"January 15, 2019",4,"Hurry up! I have been using Bitmoji for a while! I love everything about it. One thing I will say is that sometimes they take too long to come up with new cloths(in my opinion). Another thing I will say is that an idea that I‚Äôve had for a really long time is that they should have a set of shirts and pants and shoes that you can pick on ur own. I say this because sometimes there is an outfit that I like(specifically the shirt) but I don‚Äôt like the pants. You guys should give a set of shirts to pick and then a set of pants, shirts, etc to choose with the shirt you chose. I hope that makes sense. Overall, I love the app!!!!"
387,lulusweet34,"January 26, 2019",5,Pretty good So I‚Äôve been using Bitmoji for a few weeks and well I have to say is you need they need to make like a color wheel option to sleep I have glasses and they‚Äôre not black gray white or blue They‚Äôre more of a Navy and the Bitmoji does not have the option for Navy so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd say that they need to have a color wheel or something like that. All in all I do like the app though I‚Äôve just think that maybe they need to have more hair dye colors and hair color options because I‚Äôve got a really odd hair color but yeah I mean I think this app is pretty good.
388,Emily ‚ú®üíú,"May 17, 2019",5,"Outfits and customization I do like this app. But I do wish there was more customizing with like your hair, and your clothes. I know there already are a lot but I wish you could have a way to give your self multiple accessories, jackets over other clothes, and ways to change the colors of all the clothing items. And with the hair, I just wish there were more styles and colors for it. These are just suggestions that I do really really wish were in the app. Keep up the good work! Because I really do like the app on Snapchat üòÖüòä"
389,SeafordLove,"March 21, 2020",5,Star glasses I love this app and I use it for snapchat but my signature thing is star glasses and I felt a little disappointed when I saw there were heart glasses but not stars. I would love and very appreciate it if your added them as fast as possible. I‚Äôm very positive that many of the users of this would appreciate and use this option. There are a bunch of different types of crazy and natural looking glasses and I would love for their to be a star shaped glasses. Thank you and I expect to see this happen very soon. In fact I‚Äôll check everyday.
390,Alirob844,"September 23, 2017",4,"Good, but could be better I love Bitmoji but I think you could make the clothes options better. Like you could pick the shirt then pants they would be separate so it is like you are making your own outfit. Maybe just for fun you could have like cool accessories. Like wings and swords or backpacks and more. You could have more and cooler hats and hair accessories. For hair you could have something that you could have highlights for your hair, because some people has highlights. Bitmoji is great, you can hook it up to Snapchat. But every thing can always get better. I hope Bitmoji gets better and better.üòÅü§óüòú"

I'm tired of still looking at the ""spring2017"" outfits like come on! I want some to new outfits not the same old same old one. You also need to make new hairstyle, hair colors, skin colors, and body shape. If these things where all added the app would be much better. You guys seem really lazy that's you're not adding anything and that you're just keeping the same old same old. Consider making another update. Thank you."
392,Powergirl89,"February 1, 2018",3,"More body types please! The new deluxe bitmojis are so fun. I love all the new options, but what‚Äôs not awesome is the complete lack of body type diversity. Currently there are five options.... four of which are skinny. You can hardly tell the difference between any of them unless you click one and then four. The fifth option is literally just a circle. Why is there no in between? Before when there were limited options in every other category I was bothered, but I understood. Now you‚Äôre bragging about all the new options and somehow managed to leave out something that I would argue is one of the biggest factors in determining similarity. Fix this!"
393,Kiarushi,"February 7, 2018",3,"Why did you delete my haircut? So there‚Äôs a million new haircuts but the one I used to wear before does no longer exist why???

And there‚Äôs not like a normal ponytail :(. I was feeling better before now idk I feel like she doesn‚Äôt look like me. And there‚Äôs not a skin color for Latina women there‚Äôs the Indian looking color with a yellow shade but there‚Äôs nothing for latinas that are a bit brown like me but not to the extreme.

I agree that it‚Äôs better, but it needs to be a bit more accurate. Maybe you can add braces and allow us to choose the color of our braces by tapping each bracket and choosing the colors. You can also let us choose how many brackets we need. And maybe, to make it more accurate, allow us to have grills on our bottom teeth. Otherwise, this update really made things better. I love it."

The thing that blew my mind was able to customize your own outfit, (A second suggestion is overalls.) even your own socks! "
397,@MissTsundere,"December 21, 2019",5,"Wonderful I am so happy that you guys finally updated bitmoji to let us build our own outfits!!  I would love to see a customizable section added for accessories, like chokers/necklaces, hats, etc. It‚Äôd also be nice to see some patterns available for customization, like plaid and polka dots and stripes :-) Lastly, I suggest implementing a color slider option for things like physical features and makeup, while leaving the sample colors already in the app for those users who enjoy using presets, and others can just make whatever colors they‚Äôd like to use."

399,Kitkat7854,"August 31, 2019",4,Best emoji around The only thing that I'd ask for is to be able to have a favorites folder. There are so many emojis to search through that I often give up looking for the one that I'm thinking of. I'd cut the theme related emojis in half since they're trend is short. I love the frequency of new emojis. 
400,Mps139,"September 23, 2017",4,"Loving it... I love the Bitmoji app a lot, it's so fun to make your character look just like you and show your friends. Picking out the cloths is the hardest pat for me though. That's because nothing really has what I wear on there. But I think that it would be a great idea if they had it sorted by shirt, pants/shorts/skirts, shoes, jackets, and Accessories. So that you could make your own unique outfits that look more like you. I'm in love with there superhero outfits as well. Better than any Halloween costumeüòÇ. And I would just explode with excitement if they added more superhero costumes for the Bitmoji's. Then I would give this app the easiest 5 stars ever!üëçüèªüòä"
401,Be your true selfie,"April 7, 2018",4,Little tweaks I Love Bitmoji it‚Äôs much fun and super funny heartwarming and just plain amazing to have an emoji look just like you if you‚Äôre thinking about getting this app get it! It will not disappoint but only 
402,Bobo yoyo,"April 17, 2018",5,"Outfits Hi. I really love this app. For real. I think it‚Äôs an awesome way to communicate and it‚Äôs fun and interactive too and all my friends love it. Literally the only suggestion I have is letting people pick their outfits instead of giving them some to choose from, including shoes, because I really like some outfits but I want different shoes, ya know? Or maybe give more of a variety of outfits. I‚Äôm more of a skater girl and I wear crop tops, and ripped skinny jeans, and I wear timberlands, Adidas, and stuff like that so maybe give more of a variety of clothing. Thanks you and I hope this helped lol"
403,BiJeeJ,"June 4, 2018",4,"New way of expression lol I‚Äôm glad I finally made a Bitmoji. It says exactly what I want to say without having to use the same basic emojis over and over again. What‚Äôs even better is that there are more options available for hair, like the natural hairstyles for Black women. I wish there were more clothes options but the clothes available are fine. The only reason I gave four stars is because I wish there was a search option within the app like there is for the iMessage sticker app. It takes a while to find the Bitmoji you‚Äôre looking for when you can‚Äôt search."
404,VERYANGRYGAMER,"September 26, 2018",3,"Lacking There are 4 body sizes for smaller women and only 1 ‚Äúone-size-fits-all-plus-size????‚Äù We need more options because I‚Äôm definitely not a bulbous shaped overweight woman. Where‚Äôs the hourglass shake with larger bust and accentuated hips??? Not all plus sized woman has a large midsection with large sides like you provide. Can we get some body diversity here??? Also the nose and chin options are all WEIRD I can‚Äôt find anything that closely resembles me. I‚Äôm also on board with the clothing options. Separating the items would be great to better customize according to individual styles. I‚Äôm talking sections to choose scarves, jewelry, shoes, accessories, etc. Better makeup options would be nice as well."
405,Mommytomolly1904,"November 30, 2018",3,Falls short during holidays During the holiday season the app has fallen short and not lived up to my expectations. You can create a Bitmoji to look any which way you want. But during the Holiday season the only holiday represented is Christmas üòî. There are so many faiths and beliefs during the holiday season. When I search Hanukkah I get a sweater with snowmen. That has absolutely nothing to do with Hanukkah. I am extremely disappointed in the apps one sided holiday features. There was nothing else for the other holidays during this time of year either. Just Christmas. I would hope that is this day and age developers of widely used apps like this would be more diverse.

407,._.lindsey._.,"March 18, 2020",5,"amazing! but maybe a little more realistic things this app is amazing, but i would add more to this app (in the ladies clothing section) if i were you to make it more modern. for example, there needs to be more options for short hair. like for me, my hair is short(above shoulder length) and wavy, and maybe some that have one part of hair behind the ear, for a more cute look. it would also be awesome if you could add piercings!! i have many piercings myself, some cartilage and a couple on the lobes, that would be awesome if y‚Äôall added that. and, more modern outfit choices. like, overalls and strapless dresses/shirts. also with the clothing, you guys should definitely add some options for us to customize our clothing like patterns, stripes, polka dots, etc. that would be amazing, but y‚Äôall keep doing what you need to do, these are just some suggestions that in my opinion would be great for us ladies :) have a good day!"
408,Karebear3261,"February 20, 2020",1,"Good App... but Beware... while using this APP on iPad, you must give allow all access for it to work. This means you give permission for them to see any time you have used the keyboard to input personal information. This includes SSNs, credit card numbers, addresses etc."
409,GoldenRetrivers4ever,"December 16, 2019",5,"Need neckwear I love bitmoji and use it a lot when texting my friends. But they need neckwear, like scarves or necklaces. Then they could make holiday versions of them. Other than that, it‚Äôs awesome and you should totally get it. Even if you don‚Äôt have Snapchat. I don‚Äôt have Snapchat and I use it all the time when I text. One more thing, I think that we should be able to create a pet, so we can include it in our stickers. We could also dress it up. Then everyone could have there own pet even if they don‚Äôt have one in real life."
410,Ladeda de da,"April 8, 2018",4,"skin color!!!! I love how the bitmoji update gives so many more hairstyles, facial features, and skin tones, yet I still struggle to find a skin tone that resembles me at all. It bothers me that I can find purple, green, and blue skin tones, yet I can‚Äôt find my own completely realistic skin color. As a solution, I think it would be awesome to have a color gradient for people to choose their skin tones with rather than/in addition to preset colors so that everyone can get the skin tone that they identify with. Bitmoji is supposed to be a portrayal of people, and I find it hard for my bitmoji to truly portray me when I can‚Äôt even find my own skin tone."
411,xxeliselovexx,"June 4, 2018",4,"Skin tones, Hair and fashion The app is great! I love the stickers and the update totally blew my mind, but even though there were skin tones added I still feel like I cannot truly represent my color.  I‚Äôm like a golden bronze tan color but on the app I have to choose between a yellowish brown or a peachy skin tone, when in fact I‚Äôm neither. I love the hair styles too, but I think we can come up with additional looks and styles.  Maybe long ponytails, cute buns, or just different styles.  And the fashion goes up and down.  I never have a problem with the fashion provided but I‚Äôd love to see more stuff!"
412,Kharris99,"June 21, 2018",5,Awesome! Just a couple suggestions... I love Bitmoji! It‚Äôs super fun to use both inside and outside of Snapchat and browse through the fun little cartoons and see myself in them. I like how uniquely you can customize your Bitmoji and the functions they have on video for Snapchat. 
413,Hole.io is GREAT,"October 24, 2018",5,"Just a small recommendation üòâ Hi, I‚Äôm not here to write a bad review, just something to think of and maybe add. You should think of like a long sleep crop top, like you know the not so short ones the normal ones. I was wearing that but since it‚Äôs getting cold, I like to change outfits when a new season hits. So maybe you should think of that because I really recommend it, you really wouldn‚Äôt see people with a short sleeve crop top on in the winter! Tysm! Best app ever btw, it expresses literally all my emotions when I‚Äôm to lazy to type! Have a great day/night!"
414,doglover121üê©,"December 31, 2018",4,"needs a few things I love this app and I'll have full conversations using it, but I think a few things need fixed. For one thing there needs to be more clothes because I dont wear any of the options you have. Maybe something like skinny jeans and a hoodie. There just aren‚Äôt popular clothes on the app which makes it hard to decide what my avatar should wear. Also there needs to be more options and colors for glasses.  My last thing is the hairstyles. None of them look like my hair you need way more options, but overall I still love the app and I will give it 4 stars"
415,Linda Boo Mama,"March 24, 2019",5,Full Access I had to delete this app because I could not use the regular keyboard for some reason. So I deleted it and had to sign in when I downloaded it again which made me go through the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù process. To use Bitmoji you have to allow full access to the developer which means anything you type going forward and previously including credit card information is allowed to be seen etc. by the developer. They have no reason to see this information. So goodbye Bitmoji.
416,cleigh94,"December 15, 2019",3,"Something Missing I‚Äôm so happy that mix and match was finally added, but I wish the mix and match would also apply to the outfits that are already in the options. There‚Äôs a lot of pieces I love in the old outfits but not outfits that I love, so it would be nice to be able to mix those outfits together. Also, if mix and match would add cowboy boots too, and patterns instead of just colors."
417,jki,"August 16, 2019",4,Love the app! Just 3 suggestions I absolutely love ‚ù§Ô∏è Bitmoji I just have a couple of suggestions. I have to admit these were not my idea but I totally agree with them. (1)Outfits! I love all the outfits but I would appreciate if there were ways to mix and match outfits so they would really match the person‚Äôs style.(2)Accessories! I would love if there were a accessories button where you had bracelets and earrings and braces & wheelchairs etc.(3)Emoji! I love the idea of customizing your own Bitmoji message! Other then that I totally recommend it it is really funny I‚Äôve had for about year I think it‚Äôs totally worth it!üòä
418,VLONKA SHLONKA,"August 3, 2019",4,"AMAZING APP: few suggestions I absolutely love this app and my friends and I constantly use it, I even ordered a custom mug for my mom! The app has so many great features, and it‚Äôs so fun to use. However, I do have some suggestions. I‚Äôm not able to customize the face too much, which means I can‚Äôt add birthmarks, braces, or earrings, so it never really looks like me. Also, the app only allows you to trade friend bitmojis if you have Snapchat, so if I want to make my friend a personalized notebook or mug, I can‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt have snap chat. Other than this though, the app is incredible and I highly recommend it."
419,Grl26,"July 10, 2019",3,"Good, but could use a little tweaking I enjoy using Bitmoji and mainly use it in my everyday texting communication to change things up from the typical emojis. However, There are not enough updates to the app overall to keep the average user interested and the outfit options could use a major overhaul. For example, All the summer options that are listed are ones that were already there and just got moved under their ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù category. It can get kinda boring after a while not having new features added. Please reconsider adding new outfit choices to each season and just overall more frequent updates."

421,Emily Lrfin,"February 1, 2018",4,"I really like!! I really like this update its super slick. I really like all the hair options. Though we have more hair options, I feel like you kind of then took away the mouth (and other facial features) options. With the old version i had a facial feature that fit my face, but now you kind of took them all away. I really liked all the mouth options they had in the old version, but now there‚Äôs only 3, and they‚Äôre all the same width (and my mouth isn‚Äôt that wide). This is something pretty minor, but I did really like it. Otherwise I love bitmoji and I LOOVE how it‚Äôs connected to Snapchat :)"

423,L. Swaggett,"December 30, 2018",1,Racist and Sexist 1. There needs to be more legit skin color options. They have crap like blue and green but still not my exact normal human skin tone which I find to be a problem. 
424,Max_imum,"January 22, 2019",4,Much improved!! I had previously written a review for this app and had only given it 2 stars because the options for avatars were divided up by ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. The changes made to the avatar screen where you now choose your preferred silhouette made me extremely happy and made me feel as though my previous review was actually acknowledged! My only concern now is that I wish all clothing options were available in either silhouette style (I‚Äôd love for my non-curvy bitmoji to be able to wear cute dresses now and then)! I love this app and the changes you have made- keep up the good work!!!
425,Lilly Spinard,"March 18, 2020",4,"Add better outfits and accessories!!!! This will make my whole life if you just add chokers, champion sweatshirts, Nike shoes, UGGS, And hair part settings. Also, my hair is curly, but the curls are usually tight and look like tubes. Also maybe add scrunchies and other cool things like apple watches and fitbits. That's all I need. If it was like that, my whole life would be better. "
426,xoxolizzz,"October 22, 2019",5,"Bitmoji clothes My friend Eric told me to say this: Bitmoji I love your app ,but I would sometimes like to create my own outfit instead of it already being picked out for me. Although their may be a lot of options, I looked through all of them and tried on all the ones I like. So if you would consider doing this, it would make me enjoy the app even more. I agree with him because making our own clothes for out bitmoji would be so much fun and we could get super creative! I hope you consider this. Thank you!"

428,Dork face!,"August 24, 2019",4,"Improvement So I‚Äôve had this app for a few years now. But I have some things y‚Äôall need to tweak up there at bm headquarters. I really don‚Äôt like the options. The clothes are fine. But why can‚Äôt I have braces, or freckles? Those are some of the key features that need to be implanted. As well as custom clothing items. You could make your own outfit. Match skirts, tops, pants, shorts etc. Also, why can‚Äôt males wear skirts? Or dresses? I have a male friend (my best friend.) and he loves wearing skirts. But he can‚Äôt have them on his bitmoji. It breaks my heart to see him upset so please add these features. Anyway, it‚Äôs a nice app with potential."
429,Mai4Sim,"August 13, 2019",4,"Almost perfect I‚Äôve been using this app for over 2 years. I love the weekly updates / additions, and all the options. People say my Bitmoji looks just like me! I love that I can hold a conversation with friends with just Bitmoji‚Äôs!! The only thing I would like to see updated is the ability to SEARCH by keyword in the actual app (currently able to do so on keyboard), and also mix and match outfits or customize hairstyles. An added bonus would be to be able to, as another reviewer mentioned, be able to pick an expression and then add our own text. Either way, I‚Äôm a fan!!"
430,Caileigh Murphy,"December 1, 2017",5,"Request on some enhancements If it happens to be possible, this for one might be a minor challenge but is there anyway to make the avatar more characterized, I guess you could say somewhat like the sims and Mii(wii avatars) had a baby..for example more hair choices, body types, and clothes if possible would y‚Äôall make it so you can make your own..and PLEASSEEE add more earring/piercings choices..I have an industrial bar(ear piercing)and I also have a bunch of other piercings. I would be very much appreciated if you would accept my request thank you..ü§ó"

Add more highlights all kind of boys hair should have highlights. More shapes of lips and beard/mustache hair. More different hairstyles and like I was saying with the outfits it should be a section for shoes a different one for pants and shirts similar to the hair section or the lips section PLEASE make Bitmoji more realistic and you should make a game too like the sims 4 but better I know you can do it."
432,cutebutshy,"April 6, 2018",4,"Love this app!!! It‚Äôs so much fun to use this app for fun stickers and to change your bitmoji, but there‚Äôs one thing that bothers me. I think there needs to be a wider variety of hairstyles, make up styles and clothes! If you‚Äôre paired up with snapchat, the best way to excite the billions of people connecting bitmoji on snap, is to appeal to them as well! I have long curly hair, but 99% of the curly hair options are short! It totally takes away from the actual look of the avatar. And the outfit I have, it‚Äôs just not the best representation of my style. I think these fixes will definitely help a lot! Other than that, love the app!"
433,Del710,"April 11, 2019",4,"Add an in-app search function please I like to use bitmoji‚Äôs regularly in my group chats, even for work. I enjoy this apps variety a lot however it would be so much easier to search up what I‚Äôm looking for similar to how it is in Snapchat. I don‚Äôt want to add another keyboard to my phone, I like saving them directly from the app and using them when the time is right lol. Or sometimes I just really have to scroll until I find one suitable for the moment. Anyways, great app but it would be better if you could search for Bitmoji‚Äôs in the app instead of stumbling upon them"
434,A user of Bit,"April 18, 2019",4,New update? Ok so I LOVE using Bitmoji and all my friends use it on a daily basis! But the reason I didn‚Äôt put 5 stars is because it needs just a little update. 2 things:
435,Mudboggerzz,"June 1, 2019",5,"Create I love this app, I‚Äôve been using it for awhile now and I think they are quite hilarious. I love it so much I even went as far as adding it to my keyboard. However, I think it would be AWESOME if I could create my own, with sayings I would use, and having different expressions to use with them. I was talking about it with my friend, and it‚Äôs an awesome idea. I love being able to create the character to look like me, but it would be even better to be able to customize my own ‚Äústickers‚Äù as they are called I guess!!!"
436,Vitamin Gummy,"January 21, 2020",3,"Major bug/ glitch This app is GREAT not gonna lie, I love the little characters and the customization but there is a MAJOR bug/ glitch that is giving me a hard time. So I logged out of Bitmoji, then later I tried to log back in (I don‚Äôt have Snapchat, I log in using my iCloud account). But then the app said, ‚ÄúConnection error. Your internet connection seems to be down. Please check your connection and try again.‚Äù I have good connection. I can still sent text messages, emails, use WiFi, etc, but I STILL can‚Äôt use Bitmoji. It‚Äôs getting really annoying and I would be REALLY appreciative if you fixed this. Thanks for reading this. :)"
437,Justice Jordan Smith,"December 11, 2019",4,"Love the app just need some new additions! I love the app don‚Äôt get me wrong. I use it everyday. I love the clothing choices on the also. The new winter collection is ok though. I just wish there was a black fur hood coat instead of blue, green, and one more. I want the fur hood coat to be in the customization section for the jacket and coat section. Also I really want there to be jewelry like a men‚Äôs watch. It would look so good to have a watch with my outfit because that‚Äôs what I wear everyday in real life. Anyways if you could please add those I would appreciate it a lot and a lot of others would too. Thank you"
438,shmester10,"October 7, 2019",4,Little problem...please help!!! I love bitmoji but like a month or so ago my iPod updated or something like that which didn‚Äôt really matter. Then I was texting my friends and I wanted to use bitmoji but it said I was logged out which was really weird so I went to the app and every time I tried logging in it said something was wrong with the app or the internet. That wasn‚Äôt possible tho bcuz I was using WiFi it still won‚Äôt let me log in and I‚Äôm really upset. I made a new account for the time being but I really want my old one back! Sorry for the long review. Thank you!!
439,prride,"July 8, 2019",4,"good, but could be better I use this app a lot, and I like that it‚Äôs linkable to Snapchat, but there‚Äôs a few things that could‚Äôve fixed. 1, skin tones. There‚Äôs just not a lot of lighter skin tones, even though there‚Äôs many darker ones. 2, clothes. None of the clothes match my style, so possibly just more hoodies that aren‚Äôt jackets? 3. Glasses. There‚Äôs no good looking glasses that don‚Äôt make you look like a dork. I suggest making them bigger and more circle shaped glasses. 4. Hair styles. The color range is great, but there‚Äôs not a lot of hair styles that a non-binary person can relate to."
440,BooBear121396,"February 9, 2018",4,"Outfits I see this continuing theme of your users wanting more variety and options when it comes to the clothing factor and I 100% agree. There‚Äôs so many ways already to customize, especially now with the bitmoji deluxe, but the outfits are pretty well basic and unoriginal. At one point in time I had three friends who‚Äôs bitmojis all had on the same outfit. I like seeing how far this app has actually come and using the stickers make conversations through messages more lively, I just wish we had the ability to be more creative with the clothing options."

442,Upset sim fan,"April 26, 2018",4,"I like it I like Bitmoji, but I wish there was more to it. I wish there were more outfits to choose from. I don‚Äôt like that most of the outfits are all for sports. I don‚Äôt have an interest in sports so I don‚Äôt really like any of the outfits for the teams. I wish there were a lot more regular outfits and cute ones that people really like. I read another review where they said they wish the outfits were customizable. I agree with them, I‚Äôd really like to be able to make my own outfit. The app is great, I just wish there was more time spent on making the clothes cute and customizable."
443,Pug Girl üáµüá≠,"May 13, 2018",3,"I like it, but it‚Äôs missing stuff I love this app so much and 75% of texting my friends is through Bitmoji, but I have some stuff that would be awesome to put in.  My ideas are that you should be able to save certain bitmoji so you can switch to different ones pretty fast. I think that you should be able to customize outfits because I was looking at the T-shirt bitmoji outfits, and I really liked the pug one. The thing is, I would never wear beige pants, so that kinda threw me off. I also think that you should customize shoes, like different styles, colors, etc. The outfits should also be able to be saved. That‚Äôs it for now, great app!"
444,lette00,"December 28, 2018",3,"Great but Simple Improvements I live using my Bitmoji with my friends and they‚Äôre so fun and cute BUT customization needs a step up! We should be able to pick out single tops, bottoms, etc. and their colors. Also I think all clothes should be gender neutral. Another thing I would love to see are tattoo and piercing options because my septum is a staple and my lil bitmoji needs one too in my opinion. My last point is a long shot but if you could collab with Vans and get us cooler shoes like slip on checkered and cool clothes that‚Äôd be pretty cool. But, to touch back again we should be able to pick out single pieces of clothing, not choosing from pre-designed outfits. Thanks!"
445,pcsgal,"April 10, 2019",4,I wish there was more to do This app is really fun to customize your character to make it look like you. However there isn‚Äôt a lot that makes it look like me like no birth marks or small side bangs. Also I wish there was a little more clothes. I know this is being a little picky but I do wish there was a little more to pick from. Also I wish you could mix and match with shirts pants and skirts that would be so fun to do. I hope you can add a few of theses thing in the app that would be fun! One more thing if you guys could add some more hair choices for short hair? Thanks!! :)

Now even better as the ‚ÄúMix & Match‚Äù allowed me to enhance my Bitmoji messages and my friends and colleagues really amazed how fast I can adjust to my existing look.

449,Dancer gem,"July 1, 2019",3,"Great app but it needs improvement I love using this app because it makes conversations between friends and family a lot more fun. Even though it is a great app my and friends and I were talking about thinks that would make this app a lot better. Clothing and style is a big one. It would be great if we could make our own outfits. Like being able to select outfits and mix n match them. It would be great if there were more choices for summer clothing such as outfits with more tank tops, shorts and flip flops. Overall, I think 3/5 rating fits the app. But if those improvements were added it would definitely be 5/5."

It‚Äôs so innovative and impressive how this is linked to snapchat, it actually makes me enjoy snapchat so much more. But the outfit options are painful to put it nicely. I‚Äôd never wear ANY of those combinations together but there are so many instances where I like one top with a different pants, legging or skirt. And a shoe from another outfit. Lol. Please give us the option to select our own clothes to put together and make an outfit of, by giving each item separately like select a top, bottoms, shoes etc. "
451,SPONGEBOB12321,"April 7, 2018",4,"Suggestion!! I love Bitmoji! I love that I can customize my avatar to look just like me. A few things would make this app perfect however: more weight options! I‚Äôm skinny myself so I don‚Äôt need it, but there are 4 types of skinny and only one type of heavy. There should be more body types! Also, there should be an option to put piercings on your avatar!! Lost of ppl have more than just ear piercings. Lastly, I think we should be able to pick a certain shirt to wear, a certain bottom, and then shoes, and then accessories, instead of only being able to choose ONE whole outfit."
452,KCSea17,"May 3, 2018",3,"More variety please.. I love this app and it is super fun to use. Many of the things that are available are great but there can still be upgrades. When I was building my own Bitmoji I found it hard to find a skin color that matched my own. Either I‚Äôm too light or too dark. I wish there was a wider variety in skin color! It would make many people‚Äôs Bitmoji‚Äôs look more like themselves. I also wish there was some more options for the clothing. I‚Äôve seen a lot of great suggestions such as allowing the users the ability to customize the colors of the clothing. Over all it is a great and fun app, just some things to work on."
453,Elisa $101,"June 17, 2018",5,Great This is great. I love it but.... I have a suggestion. Some stuff you can‚Äôt change to make yourself unique. I think there should be a step where you have a scale on the left side. Then you drag it to the correct height. Then you can control how tall you are. I can never find the correct eyes for me so there should be more options. You should also be able to customize your clothes... you could pick the style of a shirt and then pick the color and design. Thank you!!! Please consider these suggestions! üòÅüòÅ
454,Minecraft LOVER!‚ô•Ô∏è,"September 11, 2018",5,"Love this app!  :) This app is fun and creative! You can send funny photos to all your friends, and also it hooks up to Snapchat! You can personalize your own bitmoji to look just like you! This is truly a smart app and they did a good job at it. The only thing they need is lots of new hairstyles and outfits. Anything other than that is all good! I truly recommend getting this app! "

I ‚ù§Ô∏è how there are so many clothes üëóand ways to customize your character üëçüèΩ but I wish they would move like if they were real but it is super fun I wish there are more sizes for some people that aren‚Äôt that big or small. Over all I use it all the time. The one thing that I hate is the (friend) thing, i mean you can use it IF You have Snapchat account. But I don‚Äôt and I am not allowed to get it so it is so frustrating üò° but I bet a lot of people have Snapchat. Or maybe people don‚Äôt. At least I can use it for messagesü§™"
456,author-in-training,"December 26, 2018",3,"please let girls access the men's clothes!!!!!! I just want to wear a t shirt!!!! I really like having a bitmoji but it's really hard to find clothing options that feel like they reflect who I am. I think the easiest way to fix this would be to stop gendering clothing. If a girl avatar could access the ""guy's"" clothing or the other way around, it would open up so many new styles. Or outfit creation could be more like the face stylization. There could also be more hair choices, since hair is so distinct. Either way, it's an app I have a lot of fun with, I just wish there was more opportunity with the personalization when it comes to clothing especially."
457,The Gacha Squad,"April 2, 2020",4,"Needs some tweaks I like this app, and it has so many cool features that I‚Äôve never seen on any other app like this.  Though there are some problems.  Personally, I think you should add freckles, as well as other things like more mouths to choose from without buying the full subscription.  My only other problem is one that most of my friends agree on, and it is that there isn‚Äôt enough body types.  The ones we already have are great, but it would be better to have more of a average weight.  Other than that his app is absolutely amazing."
458,Layla Diaz,"September 9, 2019",5,There's not a lot of good outfits I rate this app 5 stars because it's a really cool and funny app but there is one thing I miss. Before they had cute brands such as Forever 21 and Steven Madden but now they don't have it anymore. Can you guys bring it back because they had way cuter outfits especially Forever 21 with the cute t shirt dress with the bomber jacket. I liked them way more and it was more how I dress so please bring it back because I bet there is people out there who want these brands to come back and new brands to be put into the app.
459,sophh10,"June 28, 2019",4,Love... but needs more personalization features I love the app and use it on a daily basis for snapchat... I wish there were more outfit options or that you could mix and match tops and bottoms with shoes! There should be more hair styles also so everyone doesn‚Äôt look the same or have a better hair style that fits when you do or like. I also wish there were more makeup options like types of eyelashes and eyeliner and such. If there were more ways or more options to personalize your bitmoji the app would be way more popular. I do love this app though and its concept ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
460,yoshikowo ‚ô°,"December 28, 2017",5,"Cute! At first, I was kind of upset I could only use this app for my avatar on Snapchat. Now, I actually really like it! It‚Äôs cute and fun, and the emoticons are relatable. Although I have a few feature suggestions."
461,BorntoBreathe,"February 13, 2018",5,"Love it but I do wish you had a few more things when it comes to decorating your Bitmoji Firstly I just want to say I love this app and it allows me to pretty accurately make a Bitmoji of myself but I do wish that you had more outfit choices or even be able to customize an outfit for your bitmoji. And in the older Bitmoji days at least you were able to give yourself earrings but I don‚Äôt think we can know, so with saying that I feel as there should be an option to give your Bitmoji facial piercings and ear piercings."

463,edmondmichelle,"July 16, 2018",4,"Bitmoji is ok. Hi guys! I just downloaded Bitmoji last night and it‚Äôs pretty fun to  make avatars and put them on Snapchat. Even though I like it there are 2 big things that I think should be fixed. 1. I was trying to make an avatar for myself and there was no blonde hair. I mean, come on! So it‚Äôs kind of sad that they really don‚Äôt have blonde hair. 2. I was trying to make an avatar for my mom and there‚Äôs no short hair! So at the end it really didn‚Äôt like my mom because she has a pixie cut. "
464,SaraSellnow,"October 7, 2018",2,New outfits I‚Äôve got to start out by saying I usually would give the app a 5‚≠êÔ∏è rating because I don‚Äôt ever write a review unless it needs work... but here we are.
465,gothgirl396,"December 28, 2018",5,Love this app!! I‚Äôve used this app for a very long time and I love all they different things that you can choose from. The only problem I have is is that I‚Äôm goth. There is like only 5 outfits I wish there was more to choose from. I‚Äôd also like a feature to where you can add piercings cause I have a lot of facial piercings. Gauges (stretched ears) would also be neat to. Not just small ones but like you could enter the size of what they are and then Boom! Your Bitmoji has the size you haveüòÅüòÅ I‚Äôd be very cool if you guys did this
466,Skylar nicole bertram,"March 6, 2019",4,"Love it but could be better Totally need more outfits, have not once seen Nike Shorts or sweat pants. I‚Äôm a lazy dresser and a lot of your user base is young to find more outfits and styles that appeal, and a lot more or give a top changing option, bottoms and shoes. More original for the individual. Also more hair styles would be nice. As for clothes I‚Äôm talking like a lot a lot more, like we need options I don‚Äôt wanna have lil me wear the same stuff as 20 others girls in the surrounding area. sure the options have changed buttttt I feel I‚Äôve been looking at the same options for the past 3 years."

468,emilia <3,"October 9, 2019",4,"I love this app, but I have some suggestions! I've had bitmoji for a while now and I love how my bitmoji looks! Thing is there aren't many options for certain things like for example (many have said this) more outfits! I would LOVE to see a make your own outfit kind of thing! Just like customize the pants, shirts, shoes etc. That would make bitmoji's more creative and expressive. I would also maybe add a tiny change like having the ability to make your character have braces! or other things, that make it nice :)."
469,Madison_BrookeÓÄæ,"September 25, 2019",5,"One of my favorite apps, but needs more customization options A lot of the reviews here say that we need more clothes and I agree. I wish we could choose our tops, bottoms, and shoes separately but even without that I wish we had more outfits. My favorite collections are the Hollister and Forever 21 collabs and I think it‚Äôd be cool if Bitmoji did a collaboration with another clothing company. I also think there should be more appearance options, especially more skin details and hairstyles. Regardless though I still love my Bitmoji ‚ù§Ô∏èüë©üèº"
470,obslek,"February 11, 2018",3,"Face Types So I downloaded Bitmoji and managed to keep my old Bitmoji character but when I saw the selection it was very disappointing. It gave my Bitmoji a face as long as a horse (you guys have taken away the Afro away as well, what‚Äôs up with that). And it‚Äôs making it difficult to somewhat depict me. Not everyone‚Äôs face is the same. I‚Äôm fine with everything being added. Just don‚Äôt be like Snapchat and take away the good stuff. "
471,Awesome minions,"February 14, 2018",5,Recommendations I wish that we could pick out the shirt and pants separately and pick out the shoes separately so we can design what we wear instead of you guys providing the whole outfit! There are so many shirts I like but not with the pants or shoes or there shoes I would like to be switched out or the pants. Maybe even extend the clothing brands like have an adidas line or under Amour. And tan tops and shirts. I love this app so much I just wish that we were able to do that. I hope sometime in the fights could happen? Otherwise the app is great and I LOVE it!
472,üòªCatDancer0428üòª,"March 25, 2018",4,"Bitmoji is Awesome But... This app is amazing! I use this app a lot, I mean a lot for my Snapchat! But there's a few things you need to fix, here are things you should add/fix. I almost forgot, I'm getting braces soon and I'm bitmoji there's no setting for adding braces on your bitmoji character, I was waiting and waiting to see if it will ever come but... it never did. Here's another thing you fix. You should add more hairstyles, like these for example: two French braids (yes I do wear French braids in real life), two ponytails (I do sometimes see people wearing them) and last but not least, flipped hair (I have flipped hair all of the time). Those were more female hairstyles you can add."
473,archerbortion,"March 28, 2018",4,"Love Bitmoji, but would like more options for Classic. I absolutely love how you can customize your bitmoji so that it looks almost nearly identical to you, but I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed by the bitmoji deluxe update. I‚Äôm not really a fan of this particular cartoon style, and it would be nice if the same customization options were offered for classic. Another thing I would love to see, and I‚Äôm sure many others as well; are more clothing options as well as being able to create your own outfit rather than have to pick from the limited pre-made outfits."
474,Nuttybug,"May 14, 2018",5,"New MLS outfits I enjoy using bitmojis when talking to my friends, and there is always a bitmoji for everything. This is one of the best apps out there but there is only one problem. I‚Äôm rating this app 5 stars because it is amazing, but I would enjoy it more if there was an outfit for the MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER. This would make me a happier user and my bitmoji could show my pride to the sport I play. In conclusion, soccer is one of the most famous sports in the world and it‚Äôs spreading like crazy in America, so it would be much more enjoyable to see that in the app."
475,Minty_Girl‚úåüèª,"May 28, 2018",5,"Please Add More!! I love this app so much and use it almost on a daily basis. I feel that there could be a few more customarily options, though! Some ideas for the eyeshadow, hair color, lip color: Maybe you could add a color wheel and be able pick the exact color. I also want some more hats, glasses, and outfits! I would suggest Harry Potter and other book themed clothes. Maybe even make an option to make your own outfit. I love how often you get more stickers, but one day make a huge release for a ton of stickers!"

I mean I‚Äôm only nine and I don‚Äôt have an account for Snapchat and I want to make Bitmojis of my friend without having to reset avatar, maby you could access it in gmail or something, just make sure it doesn‚Äôt involve accounts that kids can‚Äôt have.

Sure, they can still use the stickers and all that, but they can‚Äôt change the outfits! When I go to the ‚Äúfashion‚Äù section it says that I can‚Äôt change it because it‚Äôs a website. It‚Äôs a great app, and I think more people would be able to use it if it wasn‚Äôt website and all in the app. Overall I really like it, but I can‚Äôt change my outfit because of this situation.

I use it almost all day but there's a few things that need to be added. 1-we need more hair colors such as highlights, ombres, and different tones of browns. 2-more and NEW clothing variations. There's too many tshirts with emojis on them and button down shirts. 3-there should be a search option in the app. I know the keyboard has the search option but it's pretty annoying to have the app on the keyboard directly."

482,trxppy_val,"May 21, 2018",3,Clothing kinda needs work Ok so I‚Äôve been in the BITMOJI app so many times bc I just sometimes don‚Äôt like the outfits it provides for us so I‚Äôve been thinking about how cool it would be to customize our own outfits to something we like. You could have like a small slide and say Customize your own outfit where we choose what our bottoms can be and a shirt and shoes so it can look like something some of us can actually like bc i would like seeing some shorts I like for my Bitmoji but I won‚Äôt like the shirt and I would see the same thing with shirts so I think my idea would be good for a new update but if you don‚Äôt like it it‚Äôs fine
483,Puppygirl_7238,"October 20, 2018",5,Amazing app!! Just one update you need to add!! Bitmoji is a app where you can personalize your own emoji/character. It is very fun to play with. Just one thing you really need to add is we can create our own bitmoji picture!! Like you can put your own words and stuff!! Even your own face!! Like for example. I would take a picture on bitmoji and then my character makes that face and then we can add our own writing!! Also! There maybe should be a contest if this update does happen!! All of us would love it!!
484,Hey Azumo,"March 20, 2019",4,"Amazing app! (Some suggestions) I. LOVE. THIS. APP!!! It is flat-out AMAZING! That being said, I have some ideas for you guys. (I'm pretty sure these have been already asked, but it's good to have reminders sometimes!) "
485,Reveiw Writter,"April 21, 2020",4,Bitmoji NEEDS a wheelchair option!!! My best friend is in a wheelchair and it would mean the world to her if you could add a wheelchair option because that‚Äôs makes her. When you stare at a screen with only standing characters it makes you feel like you don‚Äôt fit in and that shouldn‚Äôt happen. Everyone should be included! There are so many things that people are dealing with so adding a wheelchair could make their day. Wouldn‚Äôt it feel good to know that you made someone‚Äôs day a little bit easier by making them feel included and accepted?
486,missmaple,"March 6, 2020",4,"Size diversity is lacking Bitmoji is a super fun way to communicate with friends. I originally wrote about it not having enough body sizes, but I see that the latest update added many. Kudos, but please keep adding there!"

At first I thought it was just the internet, because I wasn‚Äôt connected to WiFi at the time, but it wasn‚Äôt that. A few days later, I tried it again, at home. There was the same result. I even tried making a new account but it wouldn‚Äôt even let me press the sign up button. So if the developers could fix that issue, then the app would be amazing."

489,Kendal_Toby,"June 13, 2019",5,Fun App! This app is great but I have a few suggestions. Could you possibly make a way to favorite outfits? Like select certain outfits to put them aside for later. So that way you can have a few you really like so that way they‚Äôre easy to find.
490,Yo519,"December 26, 2017",3,"Needs work I must say, Bitmoji is a very exiting app, but a few things need to be improved. First of all, when you click Bitmoji in your messaging app, you hasn‚Äôt go back to normal text. And if you can, at least make it a bit more obvious. Or a lot more obvious. Plus, you only have one chance on your avatar. No changing what‚Äôs been done. I‚Äôve had to use a separate email because I didn't receive any information on the mechanics of creating my avatar. Also, some of the Bitmojis look basically identical. That is a waste of storage right there. The only reason I‚Äôm keeping this app is because my avatar looks smoking."
491,Meameapower,"March 27, 2018",4,"Update Question I‚Äôve been using Snapchat and Bitmoji for a couple years now and I still love both.üòä I know you asked on the Bitmoji app if you wanted the update for more outfits and stuff, but I didn‚Äôt like how it made you look, then, so I said no thank you. But now everyone has that update and I want it now too so I was wondering if we could have something in Bitmoji that would let you get that update it and be able to turn it on and off whenever you‚Äôd like. I know this is a stupid complain but if you could that would be greatüòä, thank you."

Please add this option back! And thank you, thank you for all the great improvements and updates to the Bitmoji which keep it current and relevant‚Äîit does not go unnoticed!!"
493,Gracey Hefner,"May 25, 2018",4,Good but can be better I love this app and all the choices you get to create your character. But I think I could be even better. First I think that you should be able to create your own captions for your bitmoji. Kind of like on the gif app where you cam create your own gif. Second I love the outfits you can choose from but I think you should have individual shirts and pants etc so you can be even more original with the bitmoji. I think thats all my ideas. So if you could take these into consideration im sure more people will get this app. Thanks!
494,lizzz0,"June 4, 2018",4,"Need more curly hair choices!! Ok so, Bitmoji has a HUGE variety of hairstyles, features, hats, and clothes to pick from, but there isn‚Äôt many curly hair choices. At the moment, I‚Äôm using Bitmoji Classic, and Bitmoji Deluxe hairstyles are open to me, but I can‚Äôt find a matching hairstyle for me. I have medium-long hair, it‚Äôs very curly but gets frizzy a lot. The closest matching hairstyle I can find for my Bitmoji is the short (not pixie-cut styled) and curly one, but I would like to have a hairstyle choice for longer curly hair! I‚Äôm sure most of my curly-haired friends would like the same. If that hairstyle is added, I would rate this app 5/5."

Jewelry, tattoos, choose designer sneakers that you can match with outfits. The hats look weird because it just looks like a picture of a hat in front of the Bitmoji instead of how a hat would look if you were wearing it.

I love this app so much, however I recently cut my hair short but my hairstyle does not seem to be available in Bitmoji. My hair is flat and straight and shoulder length, but the only shoulder length hairstyle Bitmoji offers is a wavy one and my hat is straight!! I would like there to be more diversity in Bitmoji‚Äôs hairstyles, so my Bitmoji can actually look like me. You guys should have an adjustable hair thing, where we can choose our hair length for a certain hairstyle. Like we could have wavy hair, but have it shoulder length. There should be a scale to choose our hair length."

Great job with the app and if this app wasn‚Äôt a thing then my texts won‚Äôt be as good! So again amazing job with the app and I don‚Äôt have anything negative to say! Happy 2019 üòò
499,Ann3357,"February 4, 2019",4,"mostly  AMAZING This app is so great because it‚Äôs free!! But I do thing there are some features you could expand on.... it would be amazing if you could add French braids to the hair styles just because I feel like it‚Äôs a pretty common hair style. Also I feel like the eye shapes are not as accurate as they could be .... but I understand that everyone has a different look and that it would be difficult to capture all of them. Besides that, this app is great and allows you to make your own version of your self or some one else. I really recommend this app!!"
500,Yvonneclark98,"November 15, 2017",4,"Great app, needs more options though Bitmoji is a great app and it‚Äôs has a lot of options for the sticker kind of things once you‚Äôve made one, but there‚Äôs always room for improvement. It would be a thousand times better if it was more customizable, as in more different options for skin tones and hair and eye colors and stuff like that. And more clothes options, especially just normal casual outfits because I cant ever find a good outfit and my bitmoji can‚Äôt look much like me because I don‚Äôt have the right options. But all in all it‚Äôs a great app and very unique."
501,Movie Critic 1,"December 12, 2017",2,"Seasonal rant. It‚Äôs that time of year again. The time Hanukkah stickers do not show in your Bitmoji app or Snapchat because your phone is not set to English. My phone is usually set to Spanish, with the region still being the United States. I just changed it to English and, just like when I did it last year, a whole slew of Bitmojis for Hanukkah come up. None come up when my phone is in Spanish. Despite my region being set to the U.S., there are also loads of other Bitmoji stickers I cannot access unless my phone is in English. I think by night four they started appearing in my phone while it was in Spanish last year, so maybe I‚Äôll get it this year before the holiday‚Äôs over."
502,thot_lol1738,"February 2, 2018",3,"Loving the new update but it needs more changes I‚Äôm loving the bitmoji updates, however I feel that it needs more of them. There aren‚Äôt enough body types provided to users, as not everyone is built stick straight and not everyone has skinny arms and legs and a giant stomach. There also needs to be more variety with regard to hairstyles and makeup. I would also like to see more clothing for girls that is current with today‚Äôs trends. I definitely feel that making these changes would make more users happy and make the bitmojis more realistic. Hopefully some of my suggestions will appear in the next update!"

This would be a great feature. Secondly I would like to be more goth and hipster looking. These clothes are great but I‚Äôm a little more trendy than the app has to offer. Lastly a custom look. Some avatar apps let you change just the shoes to your liking and the shirt to your liking. I‚Äôm positive if you change this people would really enjoy the app more.

If you guys could update and possibly add that feature back I‚Äôd love it. I no longer use this app due to the fact that my avatar looks so dull and different in those neutral cloths, I used to go crazy on Snapchat with posts. I just want my old outfit back üò≠"

I really really love bitmoji! i‚Äôve been able to mix and match my bitmoji for years. but there‚Äôs something i would like to suggest. 1) layered clothing. like we can have a long sleeve shirt and then layer a short sleeve shirt over it, giving it that ‚Äúeboy‚Äù look. or turtle necks under dresses for that ‚Äúe-girl‚Äù look. also, more accessories like chains for pants or piercings. lastly, we should be able to import a photo to put as a shirt design. thatd be uber cool and a fun way to customize bitmoji even more! please please please try it!"

The options. The bitmoji fashion is cool(cause you get to pick your outfit) but too limited. There are almost no t-shirts with print. I also always wear a backwards bandanna and my friend always wears necklaces, but we can‚Äôt give these to our bitmojis. I think there should be an option to put things around your neck (scarfs, necklaces, ties, etc) other than that, this app Is pretty good. Keep up the good work!!"

I really do love this app but I was thinking maybe you could add some nee clothing brands and Im trying to be a snob and so like Im rich because Im not üòÇ maybe you could add some other clothing brands I like the Hollister but maybe you could add like Gucci and Supreme and also a good idea is shoes if you added shoe brands and things like vans and stuff that would be so cool and just one more suggestion maybe add some like Xxxtentacion clothing you know for tribute that would be soooooo cool üòÅ and maybe even add his hair styles that would be super cool thanks! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è

A lot of times you can‚Äôt get a very accurate looking avatar because they don‚Äôt have many features to choose from but this app does and it‚Äôs really fun how many icons and choices they have to choose from. One major problem is that the App doesn‚Äôt have BRACES!üòû A lot of my friends and me think it‚Äôs smart to have braces on the app because most of your customers are teens and kids that like to use these kind of things and most of them nowadays have braces. So, if you guys had a brace choice it would be a lot more fun for everybody!üòÅ"
