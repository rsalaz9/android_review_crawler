0,Dr. Missile,"August 18, 2018",2,"Inferior to the mobile website I look at imgur for images not for comments. If I want comments I‚Äôll look at reddit. The problem with the mobile app is that each post is cluttered with other annoying and unwanted information such as comments, links, and tags and there is an unwanted toolbar persistent at the bottom of the screen. The result is that only 50% of the screen is dedicated to the actual image. Also, on the website, if you click the ‚Äòview more‚Äô button, it expands the the additional posts inline. The app takes you to a different page, requiring going back and forth a lot. Personally I hate this and much prefer the contiguous browsing experience of the website. "
1,Electrimatics,"July 13, 2018",1,"It gets worse every time Let me first correct the description: Imgur is not the easiest way to discover spicy memes.  There is a fresh batch of spambot posts every minute.  Your phone is about to get slower, hotter, and most definitely less funny."
2,coopman200,"June 5, 2018",1,"They don‚Äôt care about the community The Imgur Devs seem to pride themselves on having at least decent interactions with their community in the past. There was a kind of trust that the devs wouldn‚Äôt do anything to drastic to sellout the users. For example, around a year ago they made a promise that they would never have intrusive advertisements, only banner ads. Well they have either forgotten their promises or have decided that they don‚Äôt care about the users anymore, since ads will now show up in the middle of posts. I understand that companies that provide a product for ‚Äúfree‚Äù need to make revenue somehow, but this is too far. Making ads in intrusive places where people can accidentally click on them, (yes we know it‚Äôs on purpose), will turn users away. Not to mention all the malware and dangerous ads that can appear both on the app and website. I‚Äôve been on Imgur since basically the beginning, and it has gone from a small company that I adored to just another sellout."

4,Punkishgoddess,"October 12, 2017",5,"Great and (at times) Enlightening Time-waster This community is fantastic, even the trolls make you laugh at times. If you have yet to experience Imgur, please do yourself a favor and try it out.... sometimes it can take a couple of days to get hooked and see the beauty of this community. It‚Äôs five star hands down."
5,Cylentnyte,"January 25, 2020",1,"Ads have killed the app. Stay away This didn‚Äôt have ads for the longest time and it was great. As soon as they added them in battery performance plummeted. Like going from 20-30% of daily battery usage to 60%+ with no change in settings. Ads at the bottom of posts or comments weren‚Äôt always seen and could usually be ignored. They moved to ads being injected into the middle of the post, but could still be ignored for the most part and posters would work around them."
6,DCpwnz,"September 12, 2019",1,"Baffling lack of basic functionality As a standalone app, I‚Äôm sure Imgur works fine, but attempting to open a high-resolution image that you found through another service seems to actually be impossible. I found a reddit post with an image I‚Äôd like as a wallpaper for my phone. Some users recommended setting the imgur website to desktop mode for a high-res version, but that option has apparently been removed from the web version. Hitting the ‚Äúopen in app‚Äù button simply opens the apple store, trying to save the image to my account just tells me that the browser version has been discontinued, and searching the exact title of the image returns no results. Even with the exact imgur URL for the image, there is no way to access it through the app. This should be a simple process. The ‚ÄúOpen in App‚Äù button should just open the image, but it somehow fails to do even that."
7,UnableToThinkOfAWittyNickname,"September 26, 2019",4,"The ads....SOOOO many ads. I‚Äôm fine with the intermittent ads shuffled between multiple gifs on the same post. I‚Äôm fine with the full page ads between posts. The browser redirect ads though are beyond annoying. I tried to address the issue with support because those ads are SUPPOSED to be in violation of Imgur‚Äôs policy. Since reporting, it seems as though the amount of these invasive ads has grown exponentially. Every three to five posts and I have to close the App Store popup, then close Safari, and only then can I return to browsing in this poorly maintained, under managed app. I‚Äôd suggest avoiding this app if you value your sanity and the security of your phone."
8,Middleman445,"February 27, 2020",3,"Fun, was there since years ago but need some changes I was there in the beginning when imgur was getting started and have seen everything develop quite nicely. It is a fun community I think many would enjoy, if you haven‚Äôt yet give it a try! "
9,flxwerjjj,"August 20, 2019",4,"I love Imgur but... Tbh I love using Imgur to save photos in my own albums etc., but the only thing I was kind of dissatisfied with was when I guess every time I exceed the number of images in an album, it‚Äôll most of the time rearrange my photos in the album by itself even when I chose not to rearrange my photos that way. If possible, I hope there‚Äôll be a solution for this. And also for every time I put a link or something in the description part of the photos, when I refresh the page, the link will appear to be broken and not together. I hope that'll be fixed soon as well. I still love Imgur though!"
10,lahdidahdi,"November 23, 2017",5,"Do you like to spend forever in the bathroom I‚Äôve used this app for many years and it has caused several family members to wonder if I had some sort of health issues based on the sheer amount of time I will spend on the toilet. This app has literally made people think I have severe stomach problems... but totally worth it... the community is pretty cool, pics are funny, plenty of inside jokes and references. Out of all the image sharing sites this is my favorite one. If you‚Äôre on there find me lahdidahdi or find me in Facebook Lea jones in Hollywood üòä"
11,Aisha918,"November 24, 2017",5,"Nuff said It‚Äôs an app that I‚Äôve had for a long time, through all the updates and random changes. I‚Äôve been here since the beginning idea of folders, the pleas and after years the final hurrah of getting them. This app is addictive, strangely not in a bad way, and because it‚Äôs very easy to understand I can find things extremely easy. And it‚Äôs interactive. I LOVE how interactive it is. I wish the ‚Äúdid you miss the day before?‚Äù Option would come back, I loved clicking and going back to the posts I missed the day before. But it‚Äôs super amazing"
12,DontFollowTheHerd,"December 25, 2017",1,So trendy it hurts So you want to belong to a lifeless flaming community? You‚Äôve came to the right place:) this app is just as bad as everything everyone talks about....nothing original but reposted garbage and wannabe witty comments that how dare you comment or try to make sense or you will get flamed. 
13,NoahTBaker,"June 5, 2018",1,"It‚Äôs Getting Worse Imgur used to be great. The community was way less toxic than other meme-based platforms, and it felt like the owners of the website actually cared about users. Now, it‚Äôs safe to say that neither of those are really true anymore. "
14,Steven=42,"July 17, 2018",1,Currently petitioning Apple to pull the app from the store. Full of adware and spyware bits. This app used to be amazing but then they desired to do adds on pages .At first I wasn‚Äôt happy about the sponsored posts but whatever I could skip them. Then they put adds at the bottom of image posts that you could accidentally click on and they were full of virus links. Then they put adds in the middle of long posts and NEVER made sure the adds were safe. Literally every add is a scam ware add. That was the final straw imgur. Until you fix your mess up here I‚Äôm done with you and will always browse with a adblocker so that you don‚Äôt get any money from me. I hate to do this but you gave us no choice.
15,Zooby42,"December 18, 2018",1,"Truly disappointed. The ads are getting ridiculous. I get that they need to make money and I have no problems with that but the ads are just getting more and more invasive. First, they just popped up below the posts. After that, they popped up between images in longer posts and comments. That second one is where it started getting bad. They‚Äôd redirect me from imgur even when I didn‚Äôt tap them and the app would cause my phone to heat up and lose battery life. Once they fixed those issues, they started putting ads between posts on top of all of the other ad placements. Now, they‚Äôve added new ads that play sound without being tapped and the old malicious ads are back again. I love imgur and its community but the app is so loaded with malicious ads, I‚Äôm uninstalling it."
16,Worfner,"March 6, 2019",3,"Great App has a few problems though. Minor but great. Honestly. Used to love the app. It seemed like a good alternative to FBs drama and IG‚Äôs fakeness but I‚Äôll tell you this. It‚Äôs all a lie. It‚Äôs like reddit combined with FB, IG and Twitter but worse. People can spam images and basically farm points like there‚Äôs not tomorrow. I‚Äôve been on a year and got 13,000 points. Roughly 300 comments and 10 images the entire time I‚Äôm on. Guy joins 3 months and posts 20 images a day and farms 64,000 points."
17,C_PleaseFixThis_B,"April 21, 2019",1,The ads are done so poorly I think everything understands that imgur stays running due to ad revenue. What I don‚Äôt understand is how they can possibly think that the way that the implementation of the ads is done is in any way acceptable. The app has gone downhill and now have an atrocious user experience with overly intrusive ads that are terribly placed and prevent seamless navigation through posts. Half the time you can‚Äôt even scroll to the next page without so much as grazing an ad and if that occurs say goodbye to viewing what you were attempting to look at. Instead you get taken to a page for whatever junk they decided to plaster every page with. This app has just really gone downhill.
18,Thingsihaveloved,"March 29, 2020",2,"Heat issue, ad problems I really love Imgur as a community, and I enjoy the content it provides.  But it‚Äôs only enjoyable if you can access the content, which I no longer can."
19,theodoubleto,"September 5, 2019",1,"Horrible Ad Placement I‚Äôve been using the mobile app since launch. I enjoy the imgur community and it‚Äôs posted content even though it has become more and more tame in the last years. I saw the app icon change, UI changes, and the creation of favorites folders. When ads started to pop up, I figured ‚ÄúThey gotta make that bread‚Äù so I thought nothing of it. An ad at the end of a post or in between posts was fine. Now, the ad is fixed at the bottom of the app‚Äôs UI and cuts off a far amount of screen real-estate. This is more of a personal problem because I have a iPhone 7 but I still prefer this size of screen and phone. I wish the adds would revert back to what they were before."
20,cerbralone,"February 5, 2018",3,"It's pretty good, but still has problems It is really good if you need something to waste your time. Though the community is weird and can be really toxic, the general experience tends to be quite positive, interesting, and enjoyable. "
21,Greenman22,"April 16, 2018",1,"Won‚Äôt allow me to upload This is not user error, as I used to be able to upload pictures without problem. Whenever I try and upload an image it says ‚Äúinvalid captcha‚Äù and will not allow me to proceed. The problem is THERE IS NO PLACE TO ENTER A CAPTCHA. No box with scrambled letters and an area to type. No boxes to click on to check off. Nothing. I have searched the entire app for at least 20 minutes and then looked it up and this is a common problem. This is just sad that an app this large can fail so badly and for so long (this has been a problem for me for months). I will adjust my review if this is fixed, but I doubt it will be."
22,An angry aardvark,"July 11, 2018",1,"Update is garbage I have been using Imgur for at least 5 years now. Back in 2013 it was amazing. But thanks to the new update that decided it would be a good idea to put ads in the middle of posts with more than 7 images. This update makes the app impossible to use after 30 minutes. Also a different ad reloads if you scroll back up through a post, which uses A LOT more memory & data than it used to. I don‚Äôt recommend downloading this app until they decide to at least make it more efficient. I understand ads are there to help pay bills, but this is interfering with the app performance."
23,MWGJr,"July 25, 2018",2,"Crude Society There should be a button that enables a user to delete rude comments from their posts. I‚Äôve received of nothing but hate while being on this app and I‚Äôm honestly sick of it. I‚Äôm only using it to upload photos of my own to copy the links of it and email or text or message through the internet for my friends, family, etc. "
24,zerobitsmith,"July 25, 2018",1,"Doesn't respect notification preferences For some reason, imgur can't seem to figure out how to respect the notification preferences in the app, electing instead to spam users with whatever they feel should have your attention (read, what they're now promoting for profit). "
25,Bonzaiblitz,"September 6, 2018",5,"This app makes me laugh. As a person who suffers from depression few things make me happy...even less laugh. I‚Äôve been using imgur for about 7 years. My battle is constant, but at least at the end of the day I can count on imgur to have a user friendly interface, little or no ads and fresh funny high quality content. Thanks fellow imgurians and the Imgur team for making the end of each day a little brighter."
26,jimmy5544,"October 10, 2018",1,Ads ruined the app The app has started to include increasingly intrusive ads to the point where now some ads will even full screen themselves on your phone and are difficult to close without clicking on them.
27,MissSmith1017,"October 23, 2018",2,"It‚Äôs ok Ehhh.... it‚Äôs alright I guess. I‚Äôve noticed it is very glitchy. Tagging is a nightmare, I just cut and paste through my notes. You need to stumble through it and make a lot of mistakes in the beginning. I am posting art and have noticed people just troll most of the feed. Some comments feel like mass bots as they don‚Äôt necessarily match the images, and as far as I can tell there is no way to delete comments. Pretty stupid you are the one building your page. I would go with Insta over this if you are creative, but if you are looking for entrainment and not necessarily building a following it‚Äôs worth a try."
28,ketchcrap,"June 22, 2019",1,"Those ads though... As you browse imgur you will come across ads that won‚Äôt display correctly, which I‚Äôm ok with because who even purchases products based on ads these days. The real issue is Imgur‚Äôs inability to fix the problem when you accidentally click on one while scrolling and the ad sends your phone into a frenzy of trying to load an ad that won‚Äôt open. It‚Äôs just a never ending loading wheel that pops up every half a second until you close the app completely and then restart it. I even posted the issue on the app, if it weren‚Äôt for the teams blatant disregard for trying to fix it I would gladly leave a 5 star review."
29,Matt010288,"September 27, 2019",4,"Hmmm I love this app and the hilarity of the tagged #funny posts. The one problem I have the prevents 5 stars is that I will be many MANY posts into the funny category, will leave the app for as little as 5 seconds, and when I return to the app OT has restarted. I must start back at the beginning of the funny category and see ALL the posts I had previously seen or skipped. I have background app refresh on for this app specifically and that seems to do nothing to fix this issue. Please fix this!!!"
30,GeorgeEDT,"January 27, 2018",5,"Creative, even idiots can do it! It makes no difference how stupid you are this app has a place for you!   You want to be a mortician?   Come on in.  Somebody will find a way for ya to talk about where the embalming fluid goes.  Wanna be a crash dummy?   You too can find a crash dummy or two to give you some free advice about setting really still.  Come in, there is some crazy, sarcastic, weird, twisted, rap loving downugger here just for YOU!"
31,kakashi hatake,"June 5, 2018",2,"New update is absolute rubbish I have been using imgur for 3 years and not a once have I complained about ads but now it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. They added ads at the bottom of posts as small banners and I said ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Then they added ads in between posts and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine I guess.‚Äù But now there are MULTIPLE ads INBETWEEN images of a post, to which I say ‚Äúare you kidding me!?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if imgur is hurting for money right now but if they are, they need to come up with a better solution; this new update has essentially sucked the fun right out of the platform."
32,Tp3115,"June 8, 2018",1,"Ad Central Disappointments I‚Äôve been part of the imgur community for years and have thus far been very pleased with the app. However, recent advertising updates now have caused ads to be placed within actual posts themselves instead of on the sidelines. I understand the need for ads to provide funding, but the new placement is a violation of the posts we all come here for. I‚Äôm beyond disappointed with this choice and would not recommend supporting them until they re-evaluate their recent ad decisions. If you‚Äôre here for the content and not the advertisements, I would switch to a different platform to get your fix."
33,mcox_,"June 14, 2018",2,"Good Community Terrible App The Imgur community is pretty exceptional. However, the iOS app has been terrible in my experience. I use an iPhone 7, and the app has been consistently bug and crash filled for months. It has always been buggy in general, but I can barely scroll through 3 posts without the app freezing. Recently the number of ads has skyrocketed as well, increasing bugginess. If I accidentally tap an ad, it will continue trying to load even after I close it and scroll to the next post. The app is unacceptable at this point."
34,timbo2132,"June 15, 2018",1,"Drains battery life in background Maybe my iPhone 6s is a bit out of date, but it‚Äôs getting very hot when running Imgur. The app uses a lot of battery, and often is laggy. "
35,TheMercDeadpool,"June 19, 2018",1,"Ads and Battery Drain Used to love this app. It was always smooth and worked without issue. However, with the introduction of the obnoxious ads, the app has become unusable (and not just because I don't like ads). With the introduction of the ads, the app becomes more and more slow the more you use it - until it becomes unusable, forcing you to close it. With this slowness, your phone becomes increasingly more and more hot. With this hotness, your phone battery tanks. I can use up about 40% battery in 20 mins. The ads seriously need to be rolled back until the performance issues have been solved."
36,stephaniebooxx,"December 8, 2018",1,"Mostly just angry trolls I uploaded a few pics on my old account that didn‚Äôt really have anything on it (4 years old maybe?) and immediately got hit with a barrage of downvoted and hate comments. The pics were innocent, nothing offensive in any way. The app itself is nice and rather easy to use, but this community is trash and most people on imgur (with a few exceptions of nice ppl) need to be loaded onto a rocket and shot directly into the sun or handed over to ISIS to be tortured. This is mainly a community of incels that are angry for no reason. If your an artist or content creator You‚Äôre better off finding another platform to share your images."
37,Gum-gum payne,"May 19, 2019",1,"Terrible ""admins"" The mods are absolutely terrible, banning newer accounts for hardly anything, but protect accounts that are ""renown"" even though they partake in targeted harassment, sending users violent messages, etc. Extremely left leaning user base, that argues without facts. It's also turned into nothing but reposts with zero original content. If you don't want cancer, then avoid this website/app. I've already checked, and they won't cover my medical bills since my cancer diagnosis."
38,Yaryy97,"August 14, 2019",4,"I LOVE IMGUR, but.. I am and have been a huge fan of Imgur, it always puts a smile on my face and i just enjoy the content. However, with the newer update and with how images are laid out now to scroll down through them? I am not a big fan of, it now looks like Tumblr or Reddit. It lost its touch where you‚Äôd just click on a photo and keep swiping. Take that as a positive critic that is lighthearted. I for one would love to have the older lay out back :) thank you."
39,Kittykatemeows_13,"September 7, 2019",1,No. Just no. The app is fine. But the people using this app are pathetic. They attack you for no reason and no they didn‚Äôt attack me but I watched it happen to other people. This girl posted about her weight loss recovery and overcoming obstacles and they verbally attack her with awful remarks. Not one person said something nice and I lost faith even more in humanity because of this. If this is your type of thing by all means join IMGUR. The apps fine and I had no problems with it. I can‚Äôt believe the disrespect and audacity of people hiding behind a screen insulting others. I‚Äôd like to see them speak their mind in person.
40,J J Humble,"December 10, 2017",5,"This is one of the best designed apps out there Not only is it intuitive to use this app. The Dev team works tirelessly to make it great! The more you spend time looking at funny gifs and pictures of cats, the more you realize there is an amazing community here.

42,Diamondfinder511,"April 7, 2018",5,"I love imgur I love imgur and use it very often! Its just something I enjoy to do as often as I can.

Definitely browse imgur, it holds some great stuff."
43,Bar jack,"June 5, 2018",5,Will be erasing the app after this update The new updated added ads in between the photos in such a way as to intentionally make you press them by accident. I sincerely hope they fire whoever came up with this idea seeing as how their target audience  is millennials and ALL market research shows thatcher hate being directly marketed too. Way to do the opposite an alienate your core users morons!
44,gogoog,"November 14, 2018",1,"Some more complaining about ads Look. Were not idiots. Well okay most of us are not so those who are not understand the purpose of the ads. Imgur needs the funds to keep the app and the company going. But for the love of the giraffe mascot can you lads and lasses please screen the ads before slapping them on into the app. Gonna have to organize flash mobs to annoy the imgur staff to the point they change their approach. Oh you wanted to use the bathroom jimmy who works at imgur?

And every time they took a post down, they linked the community rules which state ‚Äúno nudity or sexually explicit content,‚Äù and anything NSFW must be tagged mature. However, when I complain that my post did not violate the rules, they tell me to read it again or flat-out ignore me. The moderators are unaccountable and downright awful!

51,Aythina,"April 4, 2018",1,WTH happened I understand the needing for ads but if you are implementing them to help out as far as revenue at least provide a better service than it was before. I have noticed an increasing issue with loading and getting stuck between post. I use to be able to go to the next post much faster when I first got the app when it first came out but now it takes a full minute of not more to move to the next post if it even decides to load. I‚Äôm all for ads if they allow you to provide a better service but this is getting ridiculous.
52,phr0ze,"May 21, 2018",3,Fake notifications daily! Every day the little red circle shows up on this app although I‚Äôve turned off most notifications.

54,Musical Bones,"June 20, 2018",5,"Ad Attrition What once was a pretty decent scene is now being encroached by more ads and worse ads as they juice their community for as much money as possible.

After having it for a few weeks it‚Äôs starts to freeze; every couple minutes! It happens so frequently that it makes the app unusable.  What‚Äôs the point of an app that doesn‚Äôt work? I‚Äôve tried reinstalling, clearing out the cache, clearing data ect, and nothing works. I shouldn‚Äôt have to utilize other apps or techniques to get an app to do it‚Äôs intended purpose.

Ever since my phone has been effed up. Everything‚Äôs loading super slow, all my sites. I‚Äôm very suspicious that malware is the first thing it loads even before the app itself and is now on my phone reporting back on every site I‚Äôm on even after deleting it. Arrrrgh!!! Don‚Äôt download it! It‚Äôs totally evil predatory crap!"
57,Shields42,"March 9, 2019",1,"Doesn‚Äôt do the one thing it was made for In the beginning, imgur was a place for Reddit users to host images and GIFs for linking on Reddit. You would upload your image, copy the link, and paste it into a Reddit post or comment. Now, there‚Äôs this whole imgur community. It has completely changed the functionality of the platform. Instead of simply uploading a picture and getting a link, they want you to give it a title, indicate a category, and post it to the imgur community. Literally all I want to do is get a direct link to my single image. I don‚Äôt want a link to an album with one image."
58,eslai,"June 24, 2019",1,"Can only upload posts, not images The app is tailored around social media and viral/meme posts.

So they have this nifty button that sometimes shows up that says ""view in app"". Whenever I click it, it takes me to the homepage of the app where I have no hope of finding the image I was trying to look at. They just love to take me to the App Store (to download the app I already have). So go frig yourself."

62,Scarysean1,"June 23, 2018",1,Has gotten greedy with ads At first it was nice and clean with only promoted posts and a subtle ad you can ignore. Then they put another ad at the very bottom below the top comments put above the other comments so you only see them if you want to go deep in the comments. Now if you have 5 or more photos in a post they will put an ad in between those. Which means one post can have around 5 ads including the two at the bottom. This has truly ruined my experience while I know they're other apps that are way less frequent with ads.

I'm sure this app is technically fine, but it completely misses the mark in its feature set.  The desktop website is headed the same direction.

It‚Äôs weird that the videos with sound won‚Äôt play their audio unless clicked, but now we‚Äôre be made to listen to their advertisers without a choice."

127,gibofthedesert,"June 3, 2019",1,Ads auto playing persistent phantom sounds through app Never experienced this until today. Ad sound will play (sound isn‚Äôt linked to any identifiable ad video) on every screen (even the main list view where there are no ad spaces) and persist throughout browsing single posts. Volume of videos compete with ads.  Sound also overrides sound preferences on hardware. Detrimental bug that makes the app unusable maybe even break some privacy settings.
128,ignorant millenial,"December 8, 2019",1,"Toxic ads I used to love the content on imgur. Hilarious, weird, informative, and sometimes helpful. But lately the mods have been policing the community and filtering out the less than perfect content. The ads that they have recently added to the website have been extremely toxic, I.e. redirecting you to different websites and opening up different apps, without you even clicking on them. It has completely turned me off from the whole user experience of Imgur."

I loved using this app to host my photos and screenshots but I guess that won‚Äôt be happening anymore.

They give you no control of your posts and people can post whatever they want in the comments and ruin a good natured post and YOU CANT DELETE COMMENTS ON YOUR POSTS. It‚Äôs terrible. I really liked this app in the beginning too.

If I want nearly no filter (and adult content), I‚Äôll go to reddit.  If I want civility, I‚Äôll go to Pinterest or Facebook.  IMGUR has no niche anymore.

My concern is in the structure of the App and the community therein. I‚Äôm using this App on a trial basis because a friend recommended it give it a try. The positive things I enjoy about the App is the easy way to share posts and interact, connect, and network with other users. However, there is not a internet etiquette structure established that does indeed insure the safety of your users not being cyber bullied and harassed while using your app. You state in your community guidelines that it is a place where your users can express themselves and connect in a safe and enjoyable environment. Within 24 hours as a new user to your app, I experienced cyber bullying, harassment, and comments  made by other users on my posts that were derogatory in nature, petty, and hostile. My replies to these individuals were always ones of respect, courtesy, candid and honest stating that although I understand this is the internet, there exists written and unwritten rules of internet decorum. I truly believed your system administrators for the app would have handled this negative behavior in an expeditious manner, yet they did not. I perceived and interpreted the reason for this is because decisions to act quickly or otherwise is subjective. While I respect the decisions to do so or not, action in matters such as the one I‚Äôve experienced so far needs improvement in my view. "

1190,RayleneAcosta,"August 12, 2013",2,"Far below expectations Many problems with this app. After having another imgur app created by an individual I felt conflicted about not being loyal to the official imgur staff by not having the official imgur app. Well I've had this app for a couple of weeks and I have to say, for an official app designed by the original imgur staff it's far below my expectations. For starters it's slow and has too many bugs and it crashes frequently. I can't even view an album in the gallery without it completely reloading the post and making me start from the top. It's annoying. It doesn't fully cycle through all the images either; meaning when I get to a certain point it recycles all the same posts and I'm forced to go back to the gallery, find where I left off and restart my whole viewing process until it starts me all over again. And when I'm browsing I can not do all the things I enjoyed while using the other app. Such as zoom. I have a small little iPhone with a small little screen- so zoom is KEY. My uploads never actually upload. And I just don't like the general design and layout. The comments get jumbled and confused when I try opening them up to view replies. The other app was just way more user friendly."
1191,Curtis/Cee,"August 18, 2013",1,"Warning: Do not upload photos from Safari on iPhone 5 If you delete photos from your imgur on your computer after viewing them in this app, when you go back to the app, the photo thumbnails are still visible! Clicking the refresh arrow doesn't refresh the page. But clicking on the thumbnails returns an error that ""The image you are requesting no longer exists or is no longer available."" DUH!"
1192,Threwssay,"November 9, 2015",5,Great way to waste time I've been an imgurian for about 2 years now and going mobile has been the best decision that I've made. 
1193,Silvos77,"November 23, 2015",3,"Keeps kicking me out Works great except for two things. It keeps kicking me out of the app which is really frustrating; I hate having to log in just to upvote after viewing new two images. And on top of that it keeps doing strange things with my comments. If I'm trying to post a broken up comment by replying to myself it will seem to work but later won't be able to find the comment, some will post and some won't. If I go on the computer I then find the comments in the comment section but not beneath the comment I replied to. It's very tedious to have to figure out what is and isn't actually posting where I want it to, especially when conversing with someone. "
1194,Kyle_Everett,"January 5, 2016",2,"Eh, would not recommend I love Imgur and have been using it for nearly 2 years now. But, I kind of prefer just using it on safari after having tested this app. I downloaded this because first, my images weren't uploading fast and I wanted to see if it was the site and not just my silly connection, and, I was also having issues selecting pictures I wanted to place in a specific album. Neither of those were really different on this app. I can't even seem to select various pictures to delete at a time or anything I was hoping I would be able to do on here. Instead, I get re-directed to the top and have to scroll allll the way down again just to delete one. And idk if it's just that I don't know how to, but I can't seem to even make or see my albums that I can easily access on the mobile site itself. I've given up on the albums at this point lol. But yeah. Unless you somehow prefer this interface, I say that the online one has way more easily accessible features even though they're kinda glitchy while also allowing you to explore a myriad of images. It also works just as fast or slow."

1196,Fluxion,"July 22, 2016",5,"Ads?!  Yeah, because it's a BUSINESS! I gave 5 stars as a show of support for the business called Imgur. Got a little nauseous reading one whining reviewer after the next crying about about Imgur's ""corporate greed"" for having the audacity to include ads in their FREE product. Do you people not understand what a BUSINESS is?  There are actual people who keep Imgur running. This is called ""having a job.""  For which, one needs to ""be paid.""  For Imgur to be able to pay people so that you can continue to enjoy their product Imgur needs to ""make a profit!""  This is called ""commerce.""  I suppose, everyone who is bemoaning the horrors of ads would just prefer to pay a monthly subscription fee to use Imgur?  Yeah, I thought not. People today are amazingly naive.  This is why a person like Bernie Sanders thrives. Such ignorance."
1197,Jason Goss,"September 14, 2016",5,"Definitely an App The Imgur app works. The data limit comment in another review is unrelated to this app. That person eats paint chips and blames Obama for natural disasters. There are small ads in a rectangular box beneath some posts. They are easily ignored and necessary to monetize the site. Anyone with a high school diploma could easily understand this basic economic concept. The Imgur community is a decentralized group of perverts, nerds and cat lovers who all seem to have a relatively dry sense of humor contrasted against a deep sense of compassion. I've only been a member for a short time, but I can mostly suggest not posting selfies, not begging for approval, not asking for money, and producing original and thought-provoking content. If this sounds like fun, I recommend the app. If not, I recommend that you continue sharing off-centered photos of overpriced Starbucks on your crappy Instagram."
1198,Dammitbooby,"March 13, 2017",4,"I waste a lot of time Only download if you're looking to waste a lot of time and stay up late. The app runs fairly well, although sometimes it'll close or tell you the Imgur flux capacitors are, well... at capacity. "
1199,smg2972,"April 12, 2017",5,"Imgurians are the best kind of people I've been on Imgur for four years, and I absolutely love the community of people. It's such a welcome change from other social media platforms in that the users and their comments are witty, funny, and inspire productive dialogue. Users are awarded upvotes (points) based on the quality of their post or comment, and earn a status with said points. The users police the content, so to speak, and trolls are simply not tolerated. If you're a jerk on Imgur you'll just be downvoted. Also selfies will get you downvoted. Original content (OC) is appreciated. "

1201,Andy (satisfied customer),"March 6, 2015",4,"Pretty solid. Some requests This app is beautiful and smooth and generally great. One thing I've noticed is that I don't think you can copy/save a specific image to your phone from a post. You would have to download all images which is definitely not efficient. Another thing is when you open a link in the comments to a picture, then close that picture, you go back to the top of the post. Then you have to scroll all the way back down to the comments which isn't horrible. Lastly, I feel like it doesn't have the same images as the desktop. Like the most viral new images from reddit aren't showing up or something. Anyway, those aside, this app is gorgeous and I like it a lot. Works well"
1202,Jeffjeff2012,"March 26, 2015",4,"Good but small issues I love this app and I go on it everyday, but there are small bugs that drive me crazy. Whenever I read a post that has a bunch of small gifs, every other gif will load. Sometimes certain posts load gifs and sometimes I wait and other posts never load. I have 3 bars of LTE and I usually get off and watch Netflix so I know my data is working. The most annoying thing though is when I scroll to look at comments, but I get stuck on the comments and every time I try to go back up the comments just reload. I always have to force close the app and start again. I give this four stars but I'll definitely give it five if the bugs can get fixed."
1203,Kraenak,"October 28, 2015",1,"Imgur has jumped the shark As if the consistent degradation of the site wasn't bad enough, they apparently decided to branch out their unstable product beyond the limitations of their site getting buggier by the day. Now you have an even worse app that tries to pretend imgur is anything other than a means to an end of hosting an image. Which means the entire point is lost in a horrible ui that tries to get you to join its terrible community that posts things whenever their upload service works. That's not the end of it, no, because a nonfunctional hassle isn't enough if you can avoid it, now if you click on an imgur link, it force loads the app. Which, because it's by imgur means the coding is crap it takes forever to load and since the community aspect is forced and obnoxious, you never have the app open. Imgur used to be wonderful when it knew its place and served its purpose efficiently and well. That time has passed I guess."

Well, I guarantee you that you may, just perhaps, possibly see a how-to GIF showing you how to do just that. You'll favorite that jiffy post and never apply yourself to make your own, but you will have learned how. Also, there are puppies to boop and GIFs that loop. Why are you still reading this review?

1206,Dr Danglerman,"April 23, 2016",5,"Fun yet Changed Imgur is as great as ever, though I feel like the site has migrated from either funny/happy to a more lower-tone. I do enjoy some of the more sadder stories sometimes inly because they are written well, but what I miss is Imgur's sense of ironicalness and random tomfoolery. It used to be that I could logon for five or ten minutes, get my laughs and  go. (I work for a major app company - I know how monetization works) but all i see now is people looking for clarity and for someone to back them up in their pain/ideals. For me Imgur was a place to just not give a care and just see what I havent seen. Now iys all political ( given the election {duh} i get it) but Imgur has still lost what it was created for in my opinion."

1208,Megan3393,"November 13, 2016",1,"Just...no Slowly but surely pathetic men started taking over this app. Imgur must be run by them at this point, because nothing is done to control Imgur's now disgusting community, Every other photo on the ""front page"" is a nearly naked girl posed in sexual positions for people to endlessly comment what they want to do to her. There is literally so much of this trash there is an option to filter it out so you don't have a feed clogged with it. But I'm done with Imgur after the whole ""NDelRey"" event. Done. It proved how nasty and disgusting people can get. Imgur users were stupid enough to donate to her fake GoFundMe account, expecting her to follow through. The girl didn't make a dirty enough post for them, so she gets insulted & threatened by Imgur's most ""accepted"" and ""popular"". Just a nasty reminder of how awful people are, but unfortunately Imgur is ridden with them and does nothing to control it's community to keep awful things like that out."

Just as the farmer spelled the end for the hunter-gatherer; so, too, does imgur annihilate any and all competition as it dethrones such titans of the Internet kingdom as reddit, Facebook, and even google itself.  What possible adversary can match the server power that Imgur wields?  What social media outlet can hold games on such a massive scale as zombie infection with as much user participation?  Surely other time-wasting sites tremble and quake in fear at the mere mention of imgur's user sub!  Anyone who questions the greatness of our lord and savior, imgur, must be swiftly executed and forgotten.  There is only one power.  There is only the one.  Imgur lead us to the promised land."

I do have one or two suggestion though, it's that when the user closes the app that when they reopen it, whenever, the app saves where they prefer to browser eg. It will open on Most Viral -> Newest instead of opening on Most Viral -> Popular all the time. Also it would be great if we could save pictures that people post as comments, currently I just screenshot but it'd be nice to have the proper image. Besides those two, I thoroughly enjoy the app."
1221,Danger miles,"November 9, 2015",5,"Great app with few shortfalls Imgur has always been the user friendly option when it comes to browsing the latest Internet funnies, and this app helps make the whole process easier. They still don't have favorite folders or search by subreddit (I think), and accidentally swiping during a long post will lose your spot if you try and go back, but none of these are enough to not download the app. I wish there was a way to post reaction gifs through mobile, but again, not necessary to have fun on this app."

I created a profile, clicked on ""upload"" (from camera roll), and the app crashed. So I re-opened the app, clicked ""upload"", and the app crashed. I deleted the app, re-downloaded it, opened it, signed in, clicked ""upload"", and the app crashed. I googled ""Imgur app upload crash"", found the Imgur troubleshooting page, found advice from Imgur that restarting my device might help as it would ""free up some memory"". So I restarted my phone, opened the app, clicked ""upload"", and the app crashed. I quit. I'm done. It's not worth the frustration. Don't download this app."

1225,Rainbowcrashie,"May 26, 2016",3,"Very good app, needs a few tweaks. The app is great if you just like to scroll through funny images now and then. However, if you're part of the imgur/Reddit community there are some shortcomings. The app does not allow messaging, notifications leave a bit to be desired, the 'source' button is something I have yet to find to bring me back to Reddit posts (this could be me missing it) and you can't seem to visit a subreddit's imgur galleries like you can on the website. (Such as r/earthporn, r/funny etc). I would definitely suggest making the app more social and working closer with Reddit. It's a very nicely made app otherwise, streamlined and entertaining."

I do wish it was easier to download a gif...like in 9GAG, I download it & it's automatically a video, which makes it so much easier to post on Facebook. With imgr, if I post it on FB, it's a thumbnail that opens up to a new page so people are a lot less likely to watch it. Other than that, it's great.

The community seems wonderful, witty, and funny.  I grow tired of the moldy freezer burn aftertaste of other cheese substitute communities, full of negativity and foul mouth nastiness.  Imgur is refreshing and has saved me from becoming obese from cheesy nightmares.  Thanks Imgur I'll always love you my sweet street boy."
1228,Lkyle50,"September 8, 2016",5,The Best Method I've Found For Wasting Time Imgur sets the gold standard for it use of user submitted content and the online community it creates.  New content floods imgur at an alarming pace.  This ensures you are never far from being absorbed into new content.  This also allows someone to flex their creative mind muscle and shamelessly attempt to earn fake Internet points.  While the points are infantile and meaningless to the rest of the world; you will soon find yourself selling your soul for the possible up votes gained from comments.  Imgur is a true masterpiece for social media.
1229,Rutabaga_Parker,"November 21, 2016",5,"Imgur As you can see I rated Imgur a perfect 5/7.

1230,stclark81,"July 27, 2013",5,"Good, but still needs work I'm very glad to finally see the official Imgur app in the App Store, but I'm a little disappointed in some of the app's feature. Most notably, I can't access the share options for GIFs from album view, only from my images page. I have a lot of GIFs in my account that I like to share in various places, and it's difficult to do so when I can't access the sharing links from my albums. Sharing works fine for photos - just tap the image - but not for GIFs."
1231,Flea350,"December 29, 2013",1,"Needs an overhaul Being that this is the only app that allows you to check your notifications, you should do something with push notifications, badges, alerts, etc. The message screen itself is all kinds of messed up. The box to reply is floating above the keyboard and you have to click two or more times in the box to just type. All of that being said, the gallery is a completely different beast. The app freezes randomly, switches from user sub to viral every time I try to back out of an image, doesn't submit comments all the time and crashes every 15 minutes. The only reason I still use this app is because I can only chat with my Imgur friends on this app. It's quite difficult to use."
1232,purpledroid,"March 23, 2015",2,"Nope. I notice there are posts on the desktop version that aren't on the app. I can't miss any posts! I might miss an inside joke being born. Also I can't see my comment as I'm typing it, which means I can't paste in a link. I don't like the almost-dark-grey used in the color scheme, it's not super easy on the eyes. Navigation is kind of an annoyance. Have to scroll to the top of a post to get back to the front page. There's no messaging. There are people I only talk to through imgur, so messaging is important. Everything defaults to most popular instead of most recent and I have to change it back every time I open the app. Spent a long time waiting for this app, gotta say, I'm disappointed."

Now most people would be confused reading this, however, the community on imgur is not like any other. If any one has used ifunny, Reddit, or any other image/gif app, they already know the countless, lovely hours you can spend on it.. Imgur is a whole different breed. Anything you see on Facebook, has been here first, it's like the underground community, there are inside jokes galore, and the more time you spend on it the more you understand it. Imgur is awesome!!"

1236,Nicky Goob,"June 3, 2016",5,"5/5 ui design Fantastic app with very bright and intuitive design. The color scheme really gives this app a pop effect. I enjoy viewing images that are shared on the Internet in the best quality possible and this allows it. Active community with funny memes, as well as personal life moments and stories, with pictures for perspective. You'll find anything on this app from funny memes to high quality wallpapers for your mobile/desktop. Overall, great time killer if you're sitting in a office waiting for an appointment."
1237,First iPhone Guy,"August 10, 2016",5,"The best parts of all social media in one Take the pictures, gifs, and videos from Instagram. Add the ""front page"" concept which shows the best posts, and allow the rating/upvoting/liking of comments on those posts so the best are at the top. Then allow threads of comments where you can reply to specific comments like Reddit. Then include the fact that most of the content is original. Lastly, it has a group feeling, where people will reference older posts, giving it an insider feeling. It's truly great."
1238,Umbreon2098,"October 22, 2016",5,"Only Review? Am I seriously the only person to review this after the update? Eh-herm... Anyway, the app is pretty good, I can easily upload images and add descriptions and stuff like that.

Comics, funny stuff, serious stuff, pictorial DIYs, GIFs... you name it, Imgur has it. Addicting as hell and it can be experienced in many ways, there are so many facets to this amazing community. For light browsing of popular material, start with front-page stuff. You can search for specific tags or view unlimited Random mode. And for the brave of heart and strong of stomach - there's always User-sub... but I didn't send you there."

I have given this new app a few tries, but have to ditch it completely. There seems to be some sort of sizing/resolution problem. The images frequently get cut off on the right side of the screen and if you pinch to zoom in/out it will show you the correct width, but then you can't scroll up/down to see everything.  The comments are large enough for my almost blind grandfather to read; I guess that's for iPhone.  Honestly, the layout of the old app was far superior, but it had crashing issues. I am using imgur less and less  since the update of this app."

When it does, gifs within posts load VERY slowly, but gifs in comments load with no issues in a quick manner (?). Occasionally the app will crash when in the middle of a long post which gets frustrating. Also, would be nice to be able to post from mobile, like other non-official imgur apps allow you to do. Otherwise, the overall layout of the app is simple and easy to use, it's just got some bugs that need attention!"

This really needs to stop happening."
1244,iTackleU2,"May 4, 2016",4,"Significantly Improved but still has minor issues The app has significantly improved over last updates and no longer crashes. The main remaining problems are sometimes pages will freeze/stall and not load or the app will have to be restarted because it's not loading anything (primarily when losing and reconnecting to WiFi). Also, the app still does not support messaging and there are not folders for favorites. Still far better and more reliable than using your mobile browser."

The service itself isn't frustrating, is easy to use, and is not complicated. There might be some questionable content on the ""front page"" or ""most viral"" sometimes, but it's not usually a problem and people will post what they will, it's not really on the service to police what goes on there.

1248,CL Jun-key,"January 30, 2017",5,"Why aren't more people using this?! This app is hysterical, it's like ifunny and Reddit had a kid. It's also very powerful, a source for many people to receive advice and support through whatever challenges and struggles they may face. Aside from that, it's inspiring. Images describing the story of a broke college student who traveled the world, recaps of all the positive things going on in the world and tons of funny animal videos. If you're bored and looking to kill some time and even learn something, download this app. #rindgetinge"

The content refreshes quickly and has generally good pictures(with some exceptions). My only warning about imgur is that its easy for it to become a habit. Its easily the number one app i use but sometimes i find myself going through the motions. I often close out of it and by force of habit i reopen the app immediately. I have seen everything and nothing makes me laugh anymore. Overall, eh not bad 4/5."
1250,ultimate idiot,"November 30, 2013",5,"So frustrating... I love Imgur, but this app is so frustrating I quit using it. My chief complaint is that it does this weird ""refresh.""  Expand out photos to see beyond 10 in the gallery seems to work fine, go beyond 20 and sometimes the page reloads. When it happens I can never expand out further. In other cases it will refresh back to the first image even though I haven't touched the screen. "

It'd be lovely if imgur were just something you only browsed and commented on, like a news site or blog. But honestly, it feels like a social media app where you can't post anything of your own. "
1253,milehighmassive,"June 8, 2015",5,"Don't do it, unless it's too late for you I'm making plea to you to not get involved in this...thing.  If you have any need in your life to be productive or have loved ones that need attention, do not download.  This addiction is a crippling disease.  It's a compulsion that goes beyond mere drive. I'm serious. You think you'll be different, that you don't even like cat pictures, or posts about Neil deGrass Tyson. But you're wrong, you're so wrong. "

I hate that you only get a few lines in and then your cut off until you reply to your original comment. If you have a lot to say, your putting up like 4 or 5 replies to the original comment and sometimes the replies/comments magically disappear, making you go through that whole grueling process all over again. Other than the comments portion... I love it.."
1256,Juulz5293,"March 8, 2016",5,I really like it The new improvements to the app really really took me by surprise I do not regret re downloading it after how bad it used to be. Love the up its animation or when you look at a comment link the animation of you flicking away the gif is so smooth. And the snap of going from image to image is great. Can't speak any better about the new app. Now all we need is folders in our favorites and maybe less downtime on the servers and it would literally be perfect

The community is all around a good place to interact with, always have your few poppyheads. If you love to do anything except that you're supposed to be doing, imgur is the place for you!"
1259,MarcusMerk,"April 23, 2017",4,"Overall awesome! Love Imgur and the mobile app makes it super easy to browse, comment and favorite posts and images. In many ways it rivals the desktop version or beats it outright. Would definitely recommend it if you use Imgur already and if you don't you should. It's a good place to laugh, learn and think about something new everyday. It's also a global community so you can get perspectives on things far beyond your own and see and read thing here you probably won't most other places."
1260,Dirty_Ketchup,"March 6, 2015",5,"Still has nothing on Pocketgur It's still painful to use when I compare it the the more elegant Pocketgur.  There are no tags and the thumbnail view isn't there.  The slightly zoomed out scrolling view is awkward, and it takes room any step to try to zoom into an image.  Also, the controls are awkward when scrolling down into the comments.  I really gave this new update a shot, but it hasn't won me over yet.  Pocketgur still ftw."
1261,Gaited Trails,"March 8, 2015",1,"Great if you have fast internet This app might be great if you have fast internet, but if you don't it is terrible!  On the webpage if a post has multiple gifs only the first one loads and you can load them one at a time. This allows you to skip the ones you've seen a million times or you can see are uninteresting. Or even better read the one line of text on each gif without bothering to load it."
1262,Dave_Z32,"April 23, 2015",3,"Please bring back search and favorites I'm happy with the visual updates and simplified UI, but losing the ability to view my favorites and search is a big step backwards. I access Imgur on my iPhone about 90% of the time and relied on those features quite a bit. "

Sure it crashes sometimes but what app doesn't. I see people complain about gifs taking too long to load. I actually never have a problem. The only problem I have and why I didn't rate a perfect 5 stars is because I would like the Imgur team to allow personal messaging through the app. I don't get notified about the messages I have and I have to log on through a web browser."

Thus, as the current meme on imgur goes around, i would give this a whooping 5/7 which translates to a 10/10 for any non imgur users!"
1266,Sumedocin23,"February 11, 2016",2,"Kinda nice? Overall the update is cool, except for the fact that all the buttons are at the top of the dang screen. So, all big phone users? Forget favoriting, or downvoting (you can still upvote with that neat new double tap ooooooh). Also, you can no longer pull down to go back to the grid, but they added a nice new button on the bottom menu bar (seriously guys why the moving buttons around) since it was useless at the top. But!

While one could call time spent of the imgur app a time waste, I seem to learn something every time I'm on it, in between laughing and sometimes shedding a few tears. The comments are often better than the posts and the community is, for the most part, encouraging and caring when needed by posters. Love imgur and love the app. Make the most of it and open an account so you can vote and maybe post as well."
1274,Lateralus685,"February 10, 2016",3,"Decent update Look and feel overall is good.  Text seems to pop more and it's cleaner overall.  Really annoying thing though is navigating to the comments on a long post.  Previously you could just pull up a bit and half the comments bar would show, allowing you to tap and jump to it (not the most elegant but hey it worked).  Now I'm having to swipe like crazy if I just want to see/add a comment, and of course I blow right past the start if I'm going too fast.  A comments button on the top would be nice."

I mean, there's no way to upload photos; hell, I can't even view my own photos on here, despite logging into my account.

1301,cgdmester,"November 12, 2015",5,"My only handle on reality I don't get to watch the news on tv or read the paper. So the only time I'm up to date on current events is on Imgur. Thank god for all those news reporters posting about Javert showing up all over the place. Or when the media sheds light on that Russian President, Dickbutt. And now I see John Travolta has finally come back from France to share his experience with us. God bless Imgur."
1302,E.S.P.ecially,"December 4, 2015",5,"Easier to browse and then on my desktop I've actually been quite impressed by the regular updates to make the app the most viable it can be; while posting favorited images can be a bit tedious, browsing, leaving a comment, and checking out responses is quick and easy, possibly a better experience than my desktop in some cases"
1303,W_Jake_G,"February 3, 2016",5,"Excellent Imgur itself is fantastic, but the app works flawlessly.  Super easy to navigate, easy to post content, and they even fixed it so that if you're looking at a long post and accidentally swipe to the next one, you can swipe back right to where you were instead of back at the beginning.  Probably use this more than any other app."
1304,Cryo-manus Luke,"May 15, 2016",5,"Current Version is perfect This app is a great mobile adaptation of imgur, the simple image sharer. I mostly view images, and the app works very well for that. Old versions were bad about crashes and images not loading, but the newer version seems to fix these problems, as well as add neat features like double-tap to ""up-vote"" an image, and zoom, even for gifs."
1305,MonoTai,"July 24, 2016",3,"Can't upload certain images. Some images i find won't show up on my camera roll for some reason. I think it's because they were from 2014 or something. So yea, I would be uploading a comic, but then some or most of the pages won't show up so it feels incomplete, and I can't find the reason why they won't show up. "
1306,Steven the pope,"August 5, 2016",5,"App review First, this app can be simple or advance in which looking up images is easy and no trouble; in and out. Now what I mean in ""advanced"" is that user could me accounts, communicate, share pictures, like comments; ect. Some users might complain that it's buggy but it's all narrowed down to what device, software update and Internet. In all great image application 9/10"
1307,hutchscouter,"January 7, 2017",5,"Words cannot express I'm giving it 5/7! And it's only because of imgur that I even understand what that means. imgur has saved me in my darkest hours when my needs to alleviate boredom have been at their highest: sitting in airports during layovers, waiting for friends to arrive, at my table in a restaurant before the food is ready, lying in bed when I can't sleep ... it's always there for me"

Hey another confession bear, whoa! Didn't see that comin! "
1310,Timpro,"July 19, 2013",3,"A good start but not that great The app is a bit annoying to use. The swiping is far too sensitive so you often find yourself loading the next picture although you wanted to scroll down. Also, you can never read all the comments because those ads at the bottom of the app completely cover the ""show more comments"" button and you can't close the ads or anything. The whole app just is a bit choppy and not smooth at all."
1311,Twipped,"August 5, 2013",4,"UI functional but not very iPhoneish It's not the most amazing app on the store, but everything I tried to do with it worked pretty much how I expected. I suspect that the majority of the app is a webui wrapper like PhoneGap, since it lacks any native UI elements and triggers popup dialogs for things like choosing and taking photos.  URL text boxes are all far too small and drawer doesn't act like how a drawer should."
1312,Rebecca M Scott,"January 18, 2014",3,"Good app when it's working It's a good app when it's working. I can browse popular photos, but it won't let me log in an see my own photos. When I try to use the Facebook login, it brings me to Facebook and back to the app but then it just goes back to the main page and doesn't actually log me in. Also, if it does actually work and log in, then it still forgets me the next time. I have to log in every single time I open the app. I wish it remembered me and my password."

I checked my profile later on and realized there were around 5 duplicates of the same images. "

But all around great so deserving of a perfect score, 5/7. I would like to see more plot, the storyline between posts was a bit hard to follow at times, sometimes the cooking detours add to the story and sometimes the plot becomes very sexual. All in all perfect."

However i the app has a few bugs. when running the app in the background then activating it again it has a tendency to either skip back to a previous post than intended or close the app entirely. i love the app and have been an imgurian for over 3 years but these bugs have put a damper on my experience
1317,zapata7516,"March 6, 2017",5,"Came from Reddit, stayed for Imgur Used Imgur for hosting pictures for Reddit like a lot of people. Really liked the app and got a client on my phone but unfortunately it always logged me off. This was around the time the official app was out so I got it and it's overall a way better experience. I love it so much I almost exclusively use imgur on my phone. 5/5 will download again."
1318,POTUS50,"March 26, 2017",1,"Where do I start? I love imgur it's a great distraction from being an adult but lately it's become crap. It started a few months ago when they brought in sponsored content which is fine, you gotta pay the bills. Then they added the ads below the posts which is again fine. Then most recently the app has had bugs, people have complained, more bugs are brought to light, more people complained and in the last week the only thing that's changed is now there are full screen ads that pop up, block the content, freeze the app, and that's just too far for me."

It's redundant."

Once I got this app though, which I didn't realize was the official app, all those problems were gone. This official app has caused no problems and the design is very easy to use. If you are an imgurian (chants one of us) then I would get this app. Enjoy!"

1325,NoobyDoobyDoob,"April 28, 2016",1,"Can no longer get it to work right. Loved Imgur, loved it! But this update now causes the combination of their ""allow notifications"" message and my keyboard to stop me from commenting or even backing out of the comment and just viewing the images on the app. This happens after I log in to comment, every single time since the latest update. Deleting and reinstalling several different times has not improved it. "

I wrote to complain, and, to the developers' credit, I received a reply within 24 hours, telling me to download the new version. Unfortunately, this one is at least as irritating and useless as the last one. I've about had it with this image host."
1327,Shostee,"February 23, 2017",5,"I lava imgur It's a great app, but it really should allow sharing from your own device or something. You can't upload pictures and post them from your phone in comments. You can do it for posts, but for comments you have to post a url. But I lava imgur and the app works as intended, just a suggestion for mobile users."
1328,CarrotPuff,"March 20, 2017",5,Imgur Is a great app!! This app is great you can choose all the options you want like the newest or you can search some memes or even other great things this app is a great app it has no ads for me which is great there are tiny little ads under the main thing that you are looking at but that is ok but overall this is a great app I am really happy with it
1329,Cardboard Tube Knight,"June 15, 2017",2,"Can you just go back to being a hosting site. I don't need you suggesting images to me or telling me to look at the top gifs for the day. You're app is there to host images, not be some lame social media site or cut out the middle man from Reddit. The comment section is trash and the new thing where every image opens in the Reddit app with related images isn't what I want. I want to see the image the other user linked to me. "
1330,Yupyupp,"July 9, 2015",1,"I've never written a review before this... Never have a written a review on an app. But the official Imgur app is so astonishingly abysmal that it had to be done. First off, it works ~50% of the time. Secondly, ~50% of the time it works only ~80% of all the features work. Voting won't work, or comments won't show. If I try to make a comment I can't see what I'm typing. Favorites disappear. Voting on comments/submissions are ALWAYS wrong. However, this app does do one thing without fail. It WILL crash at a minimum of once a day. If being nearly unusable was the Imgur teams goal for this app they achieved it, gloriously."

It sometimes shuts down, I don't know what causes it, and sometimes it freezes which doesn't happen often. The only problems other than glitches is there is no favorite folder and you can't reply with pictures or gifs. Other than that it's a good app and works smoothly for me."
1333,Fanboy4ever,"December 24, 2015",4,10/10 would upvote Good app but they need to remove the download button when you select an image. It covers the image with no way of seeing through it half the time. It's annoying having to wiggle the picture around to see whatever is covered. Also if I swipe right or left on accident I want this app to remember where I was at not reset me to the top. God forbid it happen on a lengthy post.
1334,amt17,"April 1, 2016",2,"Much better than previous versions, however... messaging is still left out. Fewer crashes and bugs, though! Good job imgur app team! It's coming along much better!

1337,Toucanjake,"February 14, 2017",2,"Update Causes Problems I'm all for updates, really, but I think they should be properly tested before being deployed.  The recent update regularly breaks some functionality of the app.  Several times a day, comments and some images don't load because of a SSL error that never appeared in previous iterations.  The tags added just feels like more bulk, and when I'm browsing Usersub or Most Viral, I'm not looking at the tags, I am looking at the images.  Will return to this review if and when issues are resolved."

Of course the app has some troubles where it'll crash from time to time, but every app does. The fact that people get so angry about it is stupid.

1379,Ishkebeh,"March 16, 2017",5,"Good app, use to be good community It's a good app, and use to be a great community. However their servers have been overwhelmed lately and the site has been overrun with snowflake liberals. No fault to the creators, it use to be entertaining and not so political. But I guess these lunatics are everywhere now, sorry I had to delete account I spent many hours on it."
1380,mitjmac,"January 11, 2014",2,"Ugh When the app works like it should it is a competent and worthy app, but that rarely happens. App crashes way too often requiring the user to force close it. Logs the user out randomly. The favorite button pretends to function properly until you check back later and realize it did not save your favorite, even worse when it deletes previous favorites. Maybe the next update can fix the more glaring issues and I can give a better rating."

It's glorious, thought provoking, hilarious, full of cats, and if there is a god he would deem it good. I'm a proud Imgurian of three years, and I proclaim this without shame. My son loves Reddit, and deems Imgur inferior. It's a shame he will be going to hell instead of heaven like me, I will miss him."

It's where bigger websites like to host their images but for some reason they have formed a community, all the while pretending like they are really important. Now the website thinks it's important and forces any link from another site to redirect to the App Store. First, I already own the app, second why tf would I EVER need to do that to see a simple picture of a cat. Get over yourself so I can change this review to a positive one"

Ads on every image? Look at the reviews. This app has already lost probably around 1,000 users from what I've seen posted elsewhere. Every other 'update' since around December has been messing with the UI anyways and making the app harder to use.

1411,Skoff87,"March 7, 2015",5,Awesome layout This layout is crisp and cool and a lot of flow. I am on user sub a lot and the refreshing is neat but I feel as though I miss a lot of content on the front page. Did you block the cross posts from reddit? I thought we were their sister or kid or something so why no more sharing? But I think it's very innovative. Go Sarah!!!!
1412,Tab25,"July 30, 2015",3,A much nicer but somewhat buggy app but missing share sheets This is a nice update. A lot more functionality. Nice layout and UI changes. Seems a little buggy at times. I'm most disappointed that they didn't take advantage of share sheets so you have to go into the app to upload photos instead of being able to do it from the photos app. Hopefully this will be coming down the line.

Not a game changer, just my thoughts"
1416,Ingram Laboratories,"November 5, 2016",5,Best app. Great community. 5/7 stars I've used Imgur since about 2012. It's gotten me through an entire military enlistment.

But I can not possibly understand why the admins allow borderline pornography to be on the front page 9 times out of 10. It's ridiculous and makes me not even want to go on the app, which is why I mainly use IFunny. I love the interesting stories and meme dumps on Imgur, but if I wanted to see porn/ pornstar recommendations I'd go to a much different website."
1420,JollyRocker,"March 5, 2015",5,"Crisp and clean Great app! Gifs load as you scroll and pause when you scroll past each one, so a gif series loads super quick. The layout is appealing to the eye.

Also the simplistic look is great until you get into interacting with the post as it feels better to look at than interact. "
1431,A flighty broad,"March 25, 2015",1,can't upload images What's the point of an image sharing host if you can't upload images? you would think having the app would be a convenient way to post funny pictures you took on your phone. You would be wrong. There's no uploading function at all. If you want to browse Imgur and not post it doesn't work that great either. What's the point? Stick to the browser version of the site because this app is useless for folks who want to use the image host to host images.

1460,Mandala7,"July 19, 2013",3,"Wish it was better I too am having a lot of issues with getting this to work consistently with the IPad. Sometimes when uploading the screen just goes black. It is often slow to respond. Some images say they were successfully uploaded then disappear from the gallery. Hope they can fix, would be very handy app."
1461,Darling124,"May 21, 2015",5,"Love it! I much prefer the app over the mobile site. My only issue is that you can't save the gifs or pictures found in the comment section, which are usually the best part. The app runs great; I've never had an issue with it. I love this site so much!!"
1462,Loupgaroublond,"August 31, 2015",5,"Doesn't keep your place in the feed When I first installed this app, it rarely crashed. When it did, it remembered my place. Now it crashes all the time, forgets which image I was viewing and worst yet, runs slower than my obese cat. THANKS OBAMA"
1463,Alla Mo,"November 21, 2015",5,"Latest obsession My 3-month-old keeps me up at nights less than Imgur does. It's so hard to stop. Maybe the best part is the comments. Those have renewed my faith that there are clever, hilarious people out there, who not only GET IT, but who can bring it to the next level."
1464,skinyblob,"December 25, 2015",5,Love imgur Ever have one of those days where you just need a laugh or a little inspiration? Look no farther! Imgur gives you both (and usually at the same time) for free! Can't get enough of it. Thank you imgur for making my work and sick days a little bit brighter!
1465,digitalbane,"December 27, 2015",5,"Up-vote! ‚¨ÜÔ∏è I have been a lurker on imgur for a long time and after using this app, I finally created an account. It's so easy to use, is really responsive and fast overall, and occupies a spot next to my most used apps. 10/10 would install again."
1466,K Gutierrez,"January 4, 2016",4,"Imgur 5ever!!! I waste so many of my waking hours on the Internet, much like the other denizens of this community, I'm sure. This has been such an improvement for my mobile Imgur experience. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to a slew of unexpected app crashes. Otherwise, a great interface for perusing the interwebs."
1467,Whiplashmtb,"March 29, 2016",5,"Good for the Chuckles I have wasted so much time on this app, it's not even funny.     Like when you're sitting on the toilet and you open it up for just a second...   Next thing you know, you've been in the bathroom for 30 minutes and your legs are asleep."
1468,gdrgsbxtagab,"April 11, 2016",5,"Imgur is great! Hey guys, imgur is truly a fantastic app. It is so helpful being able to just upload a picture to be website without a big hassle. No account? No worries. -- Also, the animations are very cool. You can tell that the imgur team really does care about design of their app. Thanks so much!! 5/5"

1470,JennyLMT,"January 16, 2014",1,"Did...did anything change? I stupidly got my hopes up that this app had been fixed. It looks the same and runs the same. Which is not very well. It still crashes every 7 pictures, give or take. It still resets to most viral/popularity when I'm trying to browse user sub by newest. Seriously, you overhauled the app 2 updates ago to what? Make the app unusable? This was a waste of time. It doesn't perform better. It's the same buggy, unappealing, and unusable app it was last time."
1471,LMendus,"March 28, 2015",1,"Stick with the web browser Interface is sluggish. Cannot quickly return to ""home"". You must back out each level. The whole image does not appear on the screen. You see the top left portion and have to click on it to see the whole image. Movement through pictures is not a swipe gesture as the rest of the world uses. One swipe of the finger and ten submissions whiz by. Never could get a GIF to load. I tapped, double tapped, hit the GIF button, cussed at the screen. "
1472,LaniMQ,"April 30, 2015",3,"Fun but buggy It would be nice if I could close out of posts without having to exit the app. The ""x"" button never seems to work. Also, I would suggest an option to allow you to save your place when you close down the app so you don't lose where you were scrolling before. Overall, the UI is smooth and content is good as always."
1473,Mullenoverit,"December 6, 2015",5,"No huge problems, works fine for me. I know some folks report having issues with the mobile app, but it's been working fine for me personally. Imgur keeps releasing updates improving the mobile experience and I couldn't be happier."
1474,Kiokenvii,"December 17, 2015",5,"It just bothers me That it keeps asking me to rate it. Yes, it's good. It's a time killer and I don't get that stupid over flowing or whatever message whenever I'm on the desktop version of it. Which is nice. Anyway I'm hoping it stops asking me to rate it here. The message after bums me out so I'm hoping it's gone."
1475,The greatest waste of time,"August 4, 2016",5,5/5 stars This is a great app for people who like to procrastinate. It's honestly a great way to waste time and it is easy to spend hours browsing through. There are pictures for everyone to enjoy. It's like the younger generations Pinterest but with more memes. 5/5 would recommend.
1476,TabooSushi,"October 18, 2016",2,"Not a fan of the new notification system I really do not need to know when every little comment of mine gets more than one point, thank you. It clutters my notification feed and annoys me that I have to clear them out all the time by clicking each one individually. Sometimes there are upwards of thirty notifications. Either add a ""mark all as read"" option or tone it down with the notifications, guys."
1477,JulesTheMachine,"January 3, 2017",5,"Good...but... Like the app, like the messenger. But I can't access archived messages and my message notification never disappears.

It's like the best app. I own. On my phone. How are we doing on word count? Enough to make it look like a legitimate review? Probably getting fairly close now. Imgur is great. Be careful of usersub."
1479,johnfrank,"July 5, 2017",5,Huge improvement-love this app I used to get frustrated on trying to find material that appeals to me since I am not a 25yr old male.  Since they have broken out the content into themes I can immediately go to content that appeals to me.  I definitely recommend this app.
1480,KatherineJM11,"January 16, 2016",5,"Best download I have ever downloaded in the history of my app downloads. I will spend absurd amounts of time just surfing images.

1481,WantCookieBombs,"March 15, 2016",5,"If You Like An App That Crashes Constantly... Go somewhere else, because this app is filled with great content. The IMGUR team is really making the app something great to have in your phone, and the community (for the new IMGURians) is phenomenal. I'm sure you can find great humor and content here."
1482,Liumeien,"June 19, 2016",5,Great Time Waster Love this app. A little too much. It's great for avoiding any real responsibilities and homework. I can never get out of bed until I have scrolled through the front page for at least an hour. Don't download this app unless you want to turn into a lazy sack of crap.
1483,Cryptik,"July 8, 2016",5,"Always worth a laugh A friend for me into Imagur when he wasboosting, and couldn't stop laughing. There's some very enjoyable stuff posted on Imagur: some cool, some very funny. There's also the occasional downer, or just horrible post, but the community rating system keeps good content near the top."
1484,Zack Zimmers,"November 7, 2016",4,"Great app, FAST uploads but pics are always out of order I like to upload my images in order so you can understand a process or a setting, but they always seem to get scrambled.

1489,Dank Bank,"April 17, 2017",5,"It's good You want memes, they have memes. You want jokes, they have jokes. You want some other third thing, sure why not. Collect images you make in photo shop or just of the internet to communicate. Needs a better search system though."
1490,Roggow,"May 13, 2015",2,"Gifs are a nightmare Any post with .gifs is nearly impossible to get through if you don't have a great connection. Rather than allowing you to pause the .gif to let if buffer, the app attempts to constantly play it, restarting it and freezing over and over again. It's honestly easier to just open the post in the browser and play the .gif there where you can let it buffer before watching it."
1491,t.albert714,"May 20, 2015",4,"Very satisfied Solid and smooth app (especially when compared to the unofficial apps that I had to rely on previously.

1495,Ftisch,"March 19, 2016",5,"Way better I originally uninstalled this app a while back because it was horrendously designed from a UI perspective.  This iteration is amazing and I love it.  I just wish there was a ""copy direct link"" button next to the image after it's uploaded."
1496,Hugohugoyeayea,"April 2, 2016",5,"Best app/Most used If my phone kept a log of which app I used the most, this would be it.

I will GLADLY pay for an ad-free version of your app. I've been a devoted imgurite/imgurian/imgiraffe for years and years and love what you do for all of us. Please, please, please, if you keep this ad banner on every post, offer a paid version so we can opt out of seeing it. I know you guys worked hard on this iOS app but these ads really detract from the experience and gives the app a very cheap feel."

1516,Satisfied Clasher,"December 2, 2016",5,"It's mildly adequate. Imgur has a decent community- not perfect but pretty good.  Generally some pretty neat posts on here, covering every topic imagineable.  Staff do an incredible job of weeding out inappropriate posts very quickly and interact a lot with the users.  Compared to other similar website/apps, Imgur is pretty good."

Make the GUI smoother, less ""website-y"". There is also a big problem with it locking up when swiping posts in the gallery forcing a restart of the app (which the most recent update claimed to fix)."

1523,The icewalker,"November 27, 2015",5,Way better than the mobile web version! It has its issues at times but overall this app is SO much better than the trying to use the mobile version of the site.
1524,AmandaJCook,"December 19, 2015",1,"Policy Changes It's unfortunate that staff decided to make policy changes so that the front page is garnished with porn every other image. Very very disappointing. Imgur use to be a fun relaxing way to catch up on news stories, get a good laugh and other relatable content. I understand you can change your settings. The filter doesn't catch everything. Wont likely be browsing as much. Which is sad. Time to find a new community. Boys go to a porn site to see it and keep Imgur old fashion."

Imgur, of course, apparently decided that adding upload capabilities to an image sharing site wasn't important. This app is completely useless to me and will be uninstalled."

Adds on every post taking away from the experience 100% can't express how disappointing it is to see them. Shameful to see Imgur take this direction in its latest update, hopefully most of the recent reviews being written will be a sign to turn back time and revert to their previous ways. Could be a serious problem for me browsing imgur using my mobile phone."

I'm browsing imgur way more now b/c of the app, so the basics are built in and easy to use, it just needs some refinement. Uploading pics is unreliable, browsing user sub is delayed and produces duplicate images, and checking comments can get outta wack. I love the swipe left and right, and upvote/downvote works well enough. Thanks."

It all starts off well and good, for the most part, but when you finally relax and gain viewing momentum, the software bugs and you are left unable to switch images or go to the gallery.

They're too distracting on my phone screen. It's sad because I've always loved browsing on my phone; it was my go-to time wasting app because it never felt wasted. But I can't support an app that doesn't allow me to purchase to opt out of ads. They are too hard to look past and I can't get over it."

This happens with every gif and doesn't help to try to reload, come back, close and reopen app, etc. I didn't have this problem until iOS 9, so I'm guessing it's directly related."

Great app if you like to browse Imgur. Not too familiar with how to post but I'm sure it's simple. Only downside is that there isn't any messaging on the app.
1584,TheQueenOfTheNight,"February 1, 2016",4,Can we get messaging please Overall experience is pretty good. I would really like to be able to see and reply to messages in the app though.

However, I'm usually a one-handed mobile user, and double tapping to zoom in on pics was the greatest thing since sliced bread! But it was taken from us. And making the .gifs play manually may seem like a good idea, but that makes it that much more infuriating when they don't properly load. This update has actually made imgur very difficult to use."

1651,Sea-Squared,"April 16, 2015",3,Better with an update There's no spot to upload your own images. Though I guess it's coming. Glad they added the ability to save images. Just don't like that they had to take 7 steps back for us to get excited about features that were available before.
1652,Jsmitty79,"June 2, 2015",5,So far so good. I used to browse user sub using safari. Terrible idea all the disgusting weirdness of usersub was very hard to navigate through. This app is better.  Don't forget to download my mix tape. 
1653,Ashers429,"August 30, 2015",4,"New update I love Imgur, and I exclusively use the app to browse. I really like the new update, except that I can't view anyone's (including my own) profile without it crashing immediately. If that can be fixed, then all will be right with the world once again."
1654,Katness11,"November 9, 2015",5,"Strive to improve every time This app has been improving from the start. It started off shaky, but they seem to really care about listening to users and fixing issues."
1655,Shawdowboxer,"November 22, 2015",5,Great app This app is better than all other imgur apps easy to login easy to comment easy to view account. Everything loads fast. Imgur is a lot of fun to look at and better than Facebook
1656,Adf95,"November 28, 2015",3,Not able to see my profile All of a sudden I was not able to view my favorites or any of my notification post? Kind of weird. Hopefully it will correct itself soon. Tried to log out and log back in. I also tried reinstalling app and that didn't work either.
1657,Giynu,"December 11, 2015",5,Pretty decent I probably use this app more than anything. Thank you imgur for being my companion to distract from working or doing homework. I would also like to add that this app has kept me company during my bathroom breaks.
1658,Commander Ross,"December 12, 2015",5,Awesome place to be when you have nowhere else to go. I've literally spent hours here and loved every second.
1659,DecryptedVirus,"December 21, 2015",5,"Top Notch App Development Not a complaint to be seen. App functions beautifully, with a similarly seamless user experience. Work such as this makes me long to become an app developer so I might produce the same tier of product. Excellent work, folks."
1660,Tupster24,"January 18, 2014",3,"Nice app Love the app, hate the procedurally loaded images. You made the same mistake on your mobile website. I hate having to scroll though the images, get to a bunch of unloaded ones, and wait for them to load! I downloaded this app in hopes that the images wouldn't procedurally load. I was wrong, unfortunately."
1661,Lover of funny things,"January 22, 2014",3,Freezes when you swipe to next pic LOVEEE Imgur but this app is ehhh...it works good (sometimes). It gets stuck when you swipe to go to the next picture and then you have to completely close out the app and reopen it. I hope they fix this problem because it is extremely annoying!
1662,Niddles18,"October 12, 2016",5,"Great app for people addicted to memes, gifs , stories, and more I love this app it keeps me so occupied. The people are friendly and funny. The only issue I have with the app versus the website is that the app doesn't allow messaging."
1663,NateDog411,"November 27, 2016",5,"Nothing better than IMGUR I don't hardly ever write reviews, but I'm trying to start writing more often. Especially for apps that are my top favorites. Imgur is without a doubt the best place for pictures & Gifs."
1664,This stupid name thing is crap,"February 6, 2017",5,"Good app, but some problems. Perfectly usable in its current state. The spam robots can be irritating, but it seems like the dev team is on it. Nice community, but there are a fair amount of unspoken rules that might confuse. Overall, I'd recommend it."
1665,dcbake,"March 5, 2017",4,Great website and a good app The app definitely makes it easier for mobile users on Imgur. It does need to have a few things fixed. It is unclear how to edit/ change some settings regarding your account or posts.
1666,iseanstevens,"March 14, 2017",5,"A surprisingly deep and meaningful community, and dank memes It's hard to describe but people really open up in beautiful, fun, silly and sometimes painful ways here, and help each other out."
1667,Fenderbender112,"May 29, 2017",4,Most popular/newest I love imgur! My only problem is that with my current version every time I close and open the app it starts on most viral popular and not most viral newest which is what I like to browse the most. Hopefully it is fixed soon!
1668,Justice_Nugget,"August 14, 2017",1,"Deleted the app today First this app was ruined with updates, now I'm getting errors saying I've exceeded my post limit and cannot FAVORITE anything. This was on the first thing I favorited that day. I'm not even trying to post anything! I tried to submit an error report, but the app says I have to have an email account configured with the default email program on iPhone in order to do that. "
1669,ccbchunks,"January 19, 2018",2,"Comes with spammy background noise, can't use at work I work in a silent office environment (a studio) and having Imgur open on my phone for some reason (because of the advertisers I think, or a bug?) emits either a high pitched tone sometimes when my phone is inactive in my pocket or plays weird audio when the app is open. Super frustrating. Can't use it at work."
1670,atm1998,"November 9, 2015",5,"Where's the imgur rehab center? This app is great but be cautious because it is extremely addictive. If you press the download button be aware that you are saying goodbye to sleep, goodbye to work, and goodbye to any and every social activity, you belong to imgur now."
1671,Solarnaut,"November 13, 2015",5,Excellent! Imgur's app is a wonderful way to view the site's content and to interact with its community. 
1672,iUse this app,"November 24, 2015",4,Keeps logging me out. A great way to pass the time. Otherwise it's a 5 star review. It might be a bug that could be addressed on the next update but it's a hassle logging back in each time. Never had this issue with the previous versions.
1673,ParvenuQ,"January 3, 2016",4,"Imgur <3 I love imgur and think this is a great interface for viewing content that I look forward to and find amusing. I wish the mobile app was better suited for sending messages between users as the website is, but other than that, I love the app!"
1674,Apppppppppugvytfyrcytvugvu,"January 23, 2016",5,"It's great, now let me get back to using it! The app is awesome. It's almost as good as using the webpage, naturally.  I'm only writing this review because it keeps asking me to rate the app and then leave a review. As far as I'm concerned this is pretty much it's only flaw."
1675,jdore8,"March 5, 2016",5,Won't start up after updating. I hit the update button 2 days ago & haven't bee able to get into the app since. I really like it though. Guess I'll delete it & try reinstalling it.
1676,JLB58,"May 3, 2016",5,"Love it. That is all. Every application for any system will always need updates to keep up with the times. I have no complaints, now there is a Corgi Butts section added several days ago! Woohoo!!!"

1678,Coco man52,"August 13, 2016",5,Really gud memes Honestly before I found imgur I thought I had seen some gud memes but I was wrong imgur has changed the way I see memes I have discovered new and awesome memes and would encourage anyone seeking a vast knowledge of memes and their history to download this app.
1679,Uggjggfugkhxhknjnkhydrchh,"August 21, 2016",5,Amazing Everyone keeps complaining about the ads when they don't even take up that much space on the screen. 99% of the time I don't even notice that they exist.
1680,tonynonose,"October 22, 2013",4,Solid app for one of my favorite websites Has great tools for an app. Only things that could make it better would be auto updating of the feed and clean up where pressing back takes you (seems to jump around pages).
1681,Jobdarbin,"April 8, 2015",1,"There is no upload feature in this champaign room It seems like including the ability to upload photos is a rather fundamental part of most social media apps these days.  Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram etc.  So one would expect that the mobile app a platform whose primary function is photo-sharing the ability to upload photos from your mobile platform.  One would be entirely wrong."
1682,Projekt808,"February 24, 2017",5,"Greatest app I would so love it more if you brought be the ""download all images"" option viewing 30+ pics can be tiring when you want to save them all one by one"
1683,fAllioX,"February 25, 2017",5,Better than the other social media apps So much more user-friendly and less spammy than the app you know I'm thinking about. Now I ask you. How many bananas will you choose?
1684,Ya boi billy,"March 3, 2017",4,Problems with user interface The app is mostly unchanged from the last version. I find it moves slower. And the interface makes the image block the titles. And forces the description to overlay the image on posts.
1685,Tommy Paper,"March 25, 2017",5,"Too soon for a title. I used to be depressed, have anxiety and a horrible self image. Thankfully, I discovered Imgur which has greatly compounded all those issues, but within the community they are perfectly acceptable with cat tax."
1686,garfnodie,"April 6, 2017",2,"Notification everyday, no idea what for though Everyday there is a notification badge on the app icon, go into the app, no idea what the notification is for. Go into app settings and turn off all notification, still get some unknown notification everyday.  I was finally forced to disable notification for the app in the System Settings."
1687,Ehngur,"April 26, 2017",5,"Ah, yes. Used to get my meme dumps on Facebook but they were few and far between. Now I can waste time for hours without having to open Facebook in hopes someone posted new content I haven't yet seen."
1688,TheRealNoahWarren,"August 7, 2017",5,"I'm on it every for hours a day.. It's a great app, what can I say? The images never end and the people just make better stuff. Want a great way to kill time? (Your data plan as well) Imgur is the way to go!"
1689,Wiggychiggy,"August 26, 2017",5,"A handy little mobile app With recent upgrades that prevent the Imgur app from randomly crashing and an easy-to-navigate interface, this app is perfect for image hosting or browsing on the go."
1690,Ehhsjdkdkdoxoxkskz,"October 4, 2015",3,Imgur should separate from reddit. The reason why I give this app a 3 star and not a 5 is because I think imgur would be better if it were separated from reddit. Mainly because:
1691,Rthamant,"November 9, 2015",5,"Update the app You guys need to make the app a bit better as I tend to crash often. Regardless I still love the community and I think by now you have my soul anyways,so I'll still leave 5 stars."
1692,Zildjianchick4,"November 22, 2015",5,"Always entertaining I won't admit how often I open this app. I also won't admit how much time I spend on the app each time that I open it. Let's just say that whenever I'm on my phone, the imgur app is open."
1693,Drearpepk,"December 31, 2015",5,"Love Imgur! First, Imgur is amazing & an absolute necessity in your life."
1694,JennyLane83,"February 19, 2016",5,"Amazing app It's an app for when you want to be a fly in the wall or share a story and gather a crowd.  It's a community and a place where people are welcome.  I hope we continue to improve the reputation of ""internet people"" as positive people who spread good."
1695,AAB_Soarin,"May 6, 2016",5,"Nothing bad so far... I got this app recently mostly for being able to get image links for apps that only allow posting links. Now it's becoming a regular returning app, on it everyday"
1696,jkalea,"September 12, 2016",5,"Best way to waste all my time. Goodbye free time, hello Imgur! Another app to kill time browsing the Internet...only you get to see the stuff your friends will post on Facebook in two weeks. Easy to use app, very well done."
1697,thefoxbox,"September 16, 2016",3,Crashes. Otherwise good. The crashing when selecting more than 15-20 photos is annoying. A workaround is to immediately hit Next and not stay on the selection page even a second longer than you have to. But it needs to be fixed.
1698,Manowarwolf,"November 7, 2016",5,"It's a fitting app for Imgur! Sure, there are plenty of ways Imgur can make its app better. But I'm not that hard to please. I like how it's responsive to notifications and it can kill a few hours I have in the day."
1699,Werda Bonano,"February 17, 2017",5,"Imgur!!! I don't know why you're begging me to rate now.. but since you are, I love you. Anyone who needs to have access to Imgur already does.. and if they don't.. their best friend does so it's all gravy.. you don't have to beg for my love. It's all yours."

Every time there are a lot of pictures in a post I try to go to the next set and it just starts back over. The side swipe button is too sensitive. And the save button has disappeared. Please fix these issues.
1702,Elzarcothepale,"September 18, 2015",5,Here because the App asked SO POLITELY Seriously. An in-app star rating followed by a non-pushy request to switch to the App Store? Class act.
1703,Flavanoids93,"September 19, 2016",2,"Bug, Crashes Well it seems the App Store doesn't have a bug report option anymore. Overall the app has performed well, until this recent update. My iPhone 6 Plus crashes upon launch. Made to clear all other apps from the background as well. Yet to see if a reboot fixes it, but still, wanted to let the Developers know."
1704,Softail's Moon Rise,"November 5, 2016",5,"Simply Amazing. Although there was/is a few bugs in this application, I can definitely say that I adore imgur. To users who can't save GiFs or for users who simply want to see shenanigans occur, this app is quite frankly the best."

1707,Jmichalecko,"April 16, 2017",5,Sensible and funny Enjoy the effort put into the content by the Imgur community. Educational informative and the comments are to die for. Better than scrolling through crap on other sites or apps.
1708,Hahvahd91,"May 29, 2017",4,"Really entertaining with minor issues It freezes up a lot for no good reason, and it always takes forever for gifs to load, no matter what kind of Internet connection I have. Otherwise super great."

1710,Imgurlvr,"July 9, 2013",4,"Not bad, still needs work. I'm sure that this is still being tweaked as I write this, but the app needs some help. The loading sign pops up often that it is frustrating to use. I'm looking forward to the finished product."
1711,CYM74,"January 25, 2014",2,"Buggy It's nice to browse, when it works. It freezes up, crashes, and randomly starts repeating posts as I scroll through. After I browse for 5-10 minutes, I have to force the app to quit and restart it to be able to keep going. Or I just put my iPad down and let the app crash on its own. Sometimes it's bad enough that I have to reboot my iPad entirely."
1712,Englex1,"March 10, 2014",1,"So many bugs While browsing, page sometimes refreshes over and over again and cannot be stopped until you reset the app. App freezes while turning to next page. Comments don't load, and the app itself crashes over and over again. If you're lucky, the app will work for at least ten minutes before glitching up all over again. So frustrating."
1713,Liishaniichole,"November 24, 2015",5,Awesome It's a great time waster. When you can go to sleep at night just browse through the app. Most of the images are sweet and make you go awww or laugh. Both of them are lovely at 3 am while your husband is asleep.
1714,VenAquaTerra,"November 27, 2015",5,You really don't want to work anyway The app for sitting at your desk acting like you're doing something when really you're just watching another gifv of people failing miserably or kittens being adorable
1715,Mattysolo,"December 16, 2015",3,Needs improvement The app has been crashing as soon as I launch it. Even after the last update. Hope to have this fixed soon. All in all Imgur is a great website with an awesome community! I look forward to a better ios version in the near future!

1717,Obskera,"February 20, 2016",5,"Good app, phone hasn't caught fire... Thanks to all the dank memes. For real, life is basically a repost after this, use the app at your own risk. You may find yourself trying to down vote in real life, having nightmares about escaping usersub, and randomly thinking ""I could make the front page with that."" But, it is a wondrous land to explore, and get your neck-beard hairs wet between shopping for trilbies online. "
1718,Windmaster,"June 7, 2016",5,Best app ever And I've only said that two or three times before!!  
1719,MILES KWON,"June 16, 2016",5,"Best app to use when bored This app will never leave you with nothing to do. Pictures from whatever, and you can look at them for hours on end. Great time waster."
1720,ZombiiManDan,"May 3, 2016",4,"I enjoy this app, not a robot. If you want to see all the post before they show up on Facebook then this is for you. Plus you can down vote things you don't like and reward quality posts! Again not a robot, just a love machine!"
1721,peinkypanna,"May 12, 2016",5,"Works great for me I always update iOS and never had any crashing problems... Maybe I'm lucking out. UI is much better now than before. I only view, upvote, and comment and it all works great for me."
1722,I'mAFanOfMusic,"July 13, 2016",5,"Pretty good! In my experience, this app is quite stable. It has both advantages and disadvantages compared to desktop but I LOVE that it remembers your place of you go back a post you just (accidentally) left."
1723,Terrance Whittenger,"July 15, 2016",5,"Imgur mobile review Great app for the phone, would like to see more options to create memes etc on mobile version. But works great and no issues so far, 2 plus years."
1724,Hotbrains315,"September 10, 2016",1,"Constant pop up ads ruin Imgur app Imgur app used to be really cool, but since the addition of the constant pop up advertisements, the entire Imgur user experience has been ruined due to these animated ads that distract. Imgur decided that EVERY SINGLE POST needs an obnoxious and annoying advertisement on a slight delay that pops up and completely ruins the Imgur experience. This app used to be an awesome way to spend time, now is just spam on every post."
1725,Coolrocket4,"October 17, 2016",5,This app This app is about the only app I use on my phone and about a good solid 75% of my battery on it.  I definitely rate this 5 stars but I would like to see more variety in the special topic.
1726,Lady1456785jjj,"January 28, 2017",5,Love it; Prefer Spout tho Imgur is awesome for photo sharing and this update looks good but tbh I spend most of my time on Spout because it lets me post anonymously to anyone nearby or around the world. Totally different app. Actually post a lot of Imgur links on Spout.
1727,prromike,"April 16, 2017",5,"Giraffes and Bananas This app isn't perfect, but the content and simple user interface make it so even I can see pictures. Me.. can you imagine? Some of them even move! They call them peanut butter."

1730,LrdKev,"March 10, 2015",3,Seems promising I appreciate the work you guys have gone through in creating this app. My only gripe is that when logged into your account you're not able to see the images saved as you would on your desktop. Hope that can get fixed.
1731,camelCaseIsCool,"September 8, 2015",2,Notifications Don't Work This is a major flaw in the application. It should've been fixed by now. I can't view notifications because it says the comment no longer exists and I can't even find the comment by going back through the comments. Even going on the mobile site it posts my replies twice. Please fix this.

1733,tototo31,"March 10, 2016",2,Horrible stutter when it comes to viewing gifs This is a great mobile application except for the fact that whenever I try to view gifs in this application the frame rate at which they are played makes 90% of them completely unwatchable. Aside from that however the application seems to work fairly well.
1734,Joydivfan,"April 19, 2016",5,Down the rabbit hole I go Excellent site to share gifs and photos. Great community of users. I open the app and know that I'm basically going to be unavailable for the next however long.

1740,DefectivePinball,"November 9, 2015",5,Great app for a great site I've been on imgur for almost 2 years now and the app esp. with its updates mirrors the experience on the computer as much as possible while being on mobile.

I also highly dislike that they enabled portrait to landscape, which can be remedied with rotation lock but it is still annoying. Overall just a step backwards for the mobile community!"
1744,TooManyPictures,"February 11, 2016",4,Love the landscape on moble! I love that Imgur has landscape view now! Although I especially miss being able to zoom on an image with a double tap. But if you double tap a bunch of times it does zoom! Too much work for my poor fingers.
1745,Gabbeygirl,"March 19, 2016",5,Imgur is amazing From cat tax to the supportive Imgurians! Imgur is perfect for picking yourself up when you're having a terrible day! And even better when you're having a great one! I encourage all to come participate in the greatness that is Imgur.

1748,UnicornBlastyBlast,"February 5, 2017",5,Effff Yesssss Reading the reviews made me wanna write a review! Imgur has been the coolest since before YTMND was a thing. Imgur has heart and smarts... and cat tax. And doggos for days. Plus interesting intelligent things that you don't get from Instagram or that pesky Facebook! I'd banana for scale Imgur all day.
1749,Open Minded Xx,"February 10, 2017",5,"My favorite app I love Imgur so much. I even browse it during class, shhh, so I can see what's new and funny, etc. I also use it on desktop to upload screenshots and images too. This is such a great app!"
1750,Super frustrating sometimes!,"August 2, 2013",3,Buggy Sometimes on the really long posts I can't get to the bottom or load more because it either quits and goes back to the main page or goes to the top of the post. It's super frustrating when after the fifth time it still doesn't work!
1751,hth89,"February 23, 2014",1,"Not Worth Downloading I'm a regular Imgur user, but have finally had enough and am deleting this app. It allows you to scroll through - maybe 10 to 15 photos and then freezes. After closing it out, doing a reset on the phone, and reopening the app - the app still crashes after scrolling through another 20 photos. You're better off browsing Imgur via your phone web browser."

1859,Jak Hawk 9000,"December 14, 2016",5,Improves with every update I'm almost exclusively on the app instead of the computer. They've now added chat. I can't wait till they add favorites folders.
1860,Urnewbuddee,"November 8, 2015",5,"My favorite app I use this app every day. That might have something to do with my serious addiction go Imgur, and this app sure helps feed it! Get this app and sink into the world of Imgur easier than ever."
1861,Reasonable reviewer LB,"November 10, 2015",5,"Great app You can usually see which most viral posts end up on the featured page of iFunny, so you get the funny before it hits iFunny. If that makes any sense"
1862,Miss LadyA,"December 4, 2015",5,"One of my favorites! This app always keeps me laughing! It's one of my used apps! I love it! I've also never had any problems using it, it always works great for me! Definite 5 out of 5 stars!"
1863,I need more hobbies,"December 10, 2015",5,"Perfect 5/7 I spend the most time on the imgur app so any little glitches are perfectly acceptable in the ratio of glitch/time spent on app. Idk, if you're downloading the app you know what to expect."
1864,Will nye the Asian Guy.,"December 20, 2015",4,"Still imgur Imgur has long been a great website, and their app isn't really denoting in any way. There are some small issues here and there but the app is really still in its infancy. I have faith that it will be perfect. (Granted I can't complain now)"
1865,Aoldude123,"December 25, 2015",1,Just selfies thrist Literally I opened it up and checked the front pages and there were nothing but selfies and Christmas family pictures and people complaining that they are alone or that women are mean too. So download this app if u want to look at google searches selfies and people making up stories or complaining that they don't have anyone to date cause they complain to much
1866,TravisJHp,"January 25, 2016",5,"I had to uninstall Because it's way too addicting. Haha. ""I'll spend 10 minutes browsing"" *an hour later* ""10 more minutes"""
1867,Perseus54321,"February 11, 2016",1,"Update is trash I love Imgur, but the update has ruined it. The upvote system is now painful, the downvote button and favorite are an inconvenience. Zooming is also more difficult since double tapping is now upvoting. Every time I leave the app, it refreshes to the top of the content, not letting me continue where I left off. If I can't delete the update, just make the thing bearable before I abandon the app and site entirely."
1868,Ryanlund33,"February 13, 2016",4,Like button After recent update the like button was moved to the top. It absolutely needs to be moved back to the bottom. Who wants to reach to the top of the screen for every post they like.
1869,Croopy9090,"February 16, 2016",5,"Is best Sure, sometimes the servers have a little trouble, but most of the time that doesn't stop you from enjoying all the wonderful content."
1870,Markkado,"July 12, 2013",4,Great except minor bug Awesome app. Only bug I found is that the advertisement at the bottom blocks you to see the bottom of the screen. Can't scroll down to see bottom comments for example.
1871,LinzyNicole,"March 5, 2015",4,"Great start This is a pretty good app and compared to pocketgur it's more easy to navigate. The one thing that is missing that pocketgur DOES have is the easy ""save picture"" option. I like to save all the good posts and send them to my sister so she thinks hilarious :)"
1872,InspectedInspector,"March 13, 2015",2,Could be great Everything about this app would make me give it five starts except the fact that watching gifs is almost impossible. It continues to load the gif and after trying so many times the whole app just crashes. 2 stars because it's literally impossible to use half the time.

1874,TheFoamFish,"May 28, 2016",4,"Entertaining, but often stupid I learn and laugh a lot due to this app, but there is a surprisingly large amount of idiocy which I can't understand how anyone would view it as quality of value in any field."
1875,Geronimo3576316,"August 21, 2016",1,"Disappointing ad update- SHAME SHAME SHAME Imgur now has ads on every. Single. Post. They're between the image and the top comments. So disappointing and irritating. I'm deleting the app, the ads take away from each post, they're that distracting. They're also huge in comparison to what you see on the app. This is on top of their ""sponsored"" posts that pop up at least every 5-10 posts."
1876,Red7332,"August 28, 2016",5,Tolerable. The content is still good but the ads right below EVERY post is a drag. Maybe an ad page after every 15-20 or posts would be more tolerable.
1877,Domesticfear,"January 2, 2017",5,What an amazing app!! Truly a great boredom killer and a great way to find things you like and some people to talk to them with! The Imgur chat is a great thing to have now and a wonderful simple thing to use!!!!
1878,Holden Koger,"January 12, 2017",5,A truly awesome app I am very satisfied with the mobile version of Imgur! I thing the team is definitely listing to comments and acting upon them to improve the app exponentially.
1879,Kakahcarrotcake,"July 16, 2017",1,"Ads I understand a free app needs to use advertisements to earn some revenue, but the ads are forced down your throat without even tapping on them. Either it's a bug or they programmed the ads to open when you want to go down to the comments. Either way it is the only reason I have decided to uninstall and never use the app again, 4/5 otherwise."
1880,MalcolmVH,"March 5, 2015",5,"Great start for a great app! Love it so far, glad the official app is back out. There may be a few minor bugs to discover as I use it more, but for now this is the only app I use to browse Imgur."
1881,ElHlD,"March 10, 2015",2,"Had so much potential I had such high hopes for this app when it was announced. Unfortunately, it seemed blatantly obvious that this was done by amateurs. As an Imgur user/fan and someone who works in the mobile app industry, I would have to say that this is one of the poorer apps that have come out of San Francisco. Do some more user tests, and increase your development budget. 2 stars."
1882,D peth,"October 27, 2015",2,"Crashes The app keeps having problems staying active. When I open it, it crashes and takes me back to the home screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but it still keeps doing it."
1883,Killrapture,"November 2, 2015",3,"Uploading is an issue I love the UI and the app is nicely done for mobile, the only problem I have is I get an error creating album when I try to upload more than one picture (which I do alot). I also cannot look as dm's in the app, not that I get enough anyways."
1884,Camali45,"November 8, 2015",5,Bathroom breaks take so much longer now. It is addictive and this one has a great design. Once you spend a few hours you will become one of us.
1885,Gracer208,"December 8, 2015",5,"Imgur is awesome! Would give 5 stars if you could message in the app. Doesn't make sense why you can't. Otherwise, some ""over-capacity"" issues sometimes but great."
1886,Scramble-girl,"January 1, 2016",5,Awesome Great app; rarely ever freezes. Just wish posters would stop copying others and posting the same thing weeks later. Down vote is a terrific button.
1887,Fishbein,"February 21, 2016",5,"Awesome! Imgur is my go to app every evening for hours. Not that long ago, it was terrible. They have improved usability, performance and really improved the overall experience.  Thanks!!"
1888,Dowd48,"February 28, 2016",5,"Imgurrrr Very clean layout and intuitive. They actually make worthwhile changes and so far, they've resisted the temptation to make changes for the sake of pushing ""updates"". Looking at you, Facebook...."
1889,Jkshands1s,"May 10, 2016",3,"Just a review. Praise Helix What kind of review were you expecting. Sure a lot of reviews aren't the best in the world, but people don't give great reviews for meth either. It's basically the same. It's addicting and filled with dark stuff, yet you find yourself coming back. 5/7 would recommend."
1890,Megrobbs,"July 19, 2013",3,It has potential. It looks great and has all the standard features. But it's nowhere near perfect. It often gets caught up when I try to sign in and goes to black screen. Takes forever to load images and I hate that you have to play GIFs manually.
1891,ZapTap,"August 8, 2013",2,"Needs work Definitely beats using the web version on mobile, but tends to break on ""load more photos"" and have a few other issues in general. I'd rather the interface match the website more closely but be optimized for the touchscreen. Would be great to have ability to save photos, as well."
1892,A5H7,"September 20, 2013",5,"Awesome App I was a bit skeptical about this app as it had no reviews but after a couple hours of use. It's a great app, definitely worth the download if you enjoy browsing imgur."
1893,cadenlaguna,"January 17, 2014",4,Not crashing! Finally. After 3 weeks of crashing constantly this new update works a lot better. Still glitches randomly but getting there!
1894,FishingFrank,"February 2, 2014",1,Really terrible This is easily the most glitchy and unreliable app I have period. It never works for more than a few images before freezing and it always locks up when I try to move from a gif to the next image.
1895,SteveIgur,"March 5, 2015",5,"Complete overhaul This is going to take some getting used to but so far I'm impressed! It has the feel of a tumblr app, advanced yet simple. No glitches so far."
1896,Dhawkz,"October 16, 2016",5,Wonderful way to loose time Sometimes you just have to scroll mindlessly until you finally find the hidden gold stash in the usersub
1897,Godzillafan1123,"January 27, 2017",5,"I like the app better than the desktop site. This app is absolutely amazing. Great community, humorous posts, and inside jokes like no other. Definitely worth a download."
1898,UmarDeblaze,"May 25, 2017",4,"More Info I like the idea that I'm able to see those who up vote my pictures. It should be the same with those who down vote my posts. Equal treatment of all engagement. Other than that, this is a great app."

1900,Spookz,"January 22, 2014",1,"Seriously needs work The app freezes and crashes every few images (or it seems like that anyway) and I am forced to close it and restart it. If it doesn't crash, it will reload the post I'm looking at multiple times.

1905,Afw22792,"December 8, 2015",5,"Amazing This app is far better than the predecessor. I deleted the old app because it wasn't functioning right, but the new one is absolutely amazing. Well done Imgur team."
1906,Mr. Man Sam,"December 20, 2015",5,"Amazing This app is amazing. It's like combining Reddit, iFunny, Tumblr, and Instagram into one app. Defiantly would recommend. Though, I would like to see a feature where you  can follow people"
1907,Jwjwnhesyegygey,"May 31, 2016",5,"The Best Social Media App... By Far!!! This app is really in all aspects amazing. It is different in a way that makes it an enjoyable for everyone. From categories to filters, this app has it all. Thanks Imgur!"
1908,techh101,"July 22, 2016",1,App was already bad With the addition of ads in the last update I might finally stop using imgur after 4 years. I've been a dedicated imgurian but focusing on ads instead of fixing crashes and other problems shows just how much the imgur staff really cares about us. If they act this way towards loyal users of their site I can only imagine how new users will feel
1909,A_Shady_Zebra,"April 24, 2017",1,"Thanks, Imgur. They haven't added favorite folders to imgur even though everyone is asking for them, now they've updated the app with no improvements and pop-up ads. Don't update, problem solved."
1910,Mr.Frazier,"December 13, 2015",5,This thang is sweet. I think it's awesome that you can upload gifs into Imgur from your phone even though when you save them they're mere motionless pictures. I mean.. Yeah that's it.
1911,Astrowzrd,"December 21, 2015",5,I love my fake Internet points. This app/website makes me feel good about my jokes that I'm too afraid to say irl. Plus it definitely makes my day go by so much faster and enjoyable.
1912,Formoka,"February 2, 2016",5,Funnies section is amazing! Click the funnies section and go in every other day for a few hours. This is some of the best entertainment I've had.
1913,Daverost,"March 16, 2016",1,"Hijack app, no thanks It works well enough for uploads, though I feel like it's a bit complicated in that regard, but as long as it's hijacking my browser to open itself when I click an imgur album link, there's no room for it on my phone. Give me the option to disable that and I'll gladly change my opinion. I want links to open in my browser, not the app."
1914,GigglesMcgee0109,"August 6, 2016",5,"Addicted I LOVE imgur, and the absolute only thing i would change is the messaging system in the mobile app. The community is friendly and supportive!"
1915,Oogzy,"August 17, 2016",1,Don't update. Will add tons of ads! So I made these mistake of updating the app. Big mistake. There's now ads at the bottom of every single post. Every. Single. One. There's no way to get rid of them or turn them off. Do not update the app if you enjoy an ad free imgur. This update completely killed the imgur app for me and I will quit using this app until this is removed. Thanks imgur for killing your app.
1916,CheesyTurtle,"September 8, 2016",5,"So many lost hours I can't count the days I said to myself ""I will just look at a couple of posts"" and end up sitting on the app for hours. Truly outrageous."
1917,beautifulgaby,"November 8, 2016",5,Weird name. Loads of fun tho I LOVE IT!!! Thanks to all the people working hard to make it happen. And to the ops who post their hearts out and to the commenters whose comments are sometimes funnier than the posts and thanks.
1918,bland grape,"December 16, 2016",5,Yes. Loove the new chat and follow features! Also quite possibly the only app with notifications that don't annoy me with constant alerts or for junk I don't care to see.
1919,Chaucer85,"March 3, 2017",5,"Latest update broke several features Descriptions and titles now run into images. Prior to this, iPhone app was running beautifully. Eagerly await next update."
1920,SoupNBread,"March 15, 2015",1,"What's the point? I use imgur to just host images so I thought it might be a good idea to grab the app in case I needed to grab or upload something on the go. Nope, I was completely wrong. The app has no way of viewing your own album uploads nor does it have its own upload function. The app just serves the function to further some weird social aspect of the site that I didn't know existed."

1925,Whoisniko,"December 8, 2015",5,"SERAPLS Awesome app. When I'm bored at work and having nothing to do, I browse imgur for 8 hours. I no longer have friends because all I need is this app. Meme? Tuh, I've probably already seen it on here üôÉ imgur is love, imgur is life. #TeamCats and Boobs"

1927,Blorgish,"February 5, 2017",5,5 bananas for scale It's imgur... but on your phone and even better. The app was fairly messy and not too neat but it has improved drastically. The layout is great now. Makes imgur even more great
1928,Claspie,"February 18, 2017",4,"4/5 Only cause 1 feature missing... The app is amazing. They've really made it a nice experience. However, we need to be able to get to user albums from the app and not going outside of it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

1932,Yasss63829,"December 2, 2015",5,"Great app! Only one concern is that it boots me out from time to time but it's usually when I've spent too much time on there already, so I don't mind it. Other than that I love it."
1933,Ahdleithbskirb,"December 8, 2015",5,Too addicted to care about the bugs It logs me out occasionally and crashes when it's thinking too hard. But I'm too addicted to it to care.

1955,najsvdh173,"June 3, 2016",1,so funny but why are you downloading content without my permission?! I was pretty happy with the app - for the first 15mins. then I noticed that images had been downloaded into my camera roll - like a hundred pics that I've never seen before. very eery. I wondered what other invasive operations I would have to expect but guess what: you'll never find out. the privacy policy is offline.

The whole app is pointless for me"

1971,aacook,"October 13, 2016",2,Confusing album upload I've tried 3 times now to upload a new album. When I hit submit the upload window closes. No where in the app is there a pending upload UI or notification. Either album uploads don't work or this is a real user experience issue.

1975,Stranger2Danger,"June 3, 2017",5,"Mobile App I'd be a lot more productive and focused without Imgur. However, I wouldn't smile or laugh as much so it's an even trade. I love this community. Also, favorite folders would be great."
1976,Frequent forum visiter,"July 12, 2017",5,So good Where did all the time go? Its easy to get in an educational trance looking at posts. Its just as dangerous as reddit when it comes to losing track of time.
1977,oh the humanity!,"August 1, 2017",5,"Every day Imgur helps me learn, laugh, and find new subcultures to despise. Despite the consistent feminism/trans/racism awareness-bashing (and it really does baffle and bother me) I can always find someone smarter than me and learn something"
1978,Brooksmanzella,"August 2, 2017",3,Zoom is wonky Used to be able to tap once to full screen an image and then double tap to zoom. That feature is gone. Now if I want to zoom I have to use two hands. Why would you reduce features?

1983,Bojukana,"December 14, 2015",4,"It's a decent system Found this pretty useful. Overall works well. The UI is a little goofy in certain places and it can eat up your data if you aren't careful. But if you like imgur, I'd recommend it."
1984,DWhittem,"December 17, 2015",1,"Non functional App hasn't been able to run for more than 2 days, even with 2 reinstalls. Even when it is able to open it constantly crashes, logs you out, and is unable to maintain browsing placement like the website. Has been frustrating in the past but there's no point keeping an app that can't open on your phone."

1996,BoredMeteor,"November 26, 2016",1,"Imgur is dead on iOS. All gifs are blown up so big that you can't see the whole image. Zooming out? Impossible. This useless app behaves the same way as the webpage does in Safari. But the app ads a sidebar that is a cluster of ugliness. Do not use this app to show animal gifs to your kids, they WILL be exposed to porn, it's only a matter of time. Imgur needs to go. It is now a cesspool and it is unusable on iOS."
1997,J-Cub 123,"February 8, 2017",5,I haven't been outside in weeks Perfect app for forgetting you're a person who isn't achieving their full potential. This is a great app. Other apps are garbage! So sad!

2004,Sl3nd3rkill3r17,"July 21, 2016",4,"Meh This app is one of my favorites, the only reason it's not my favorite is because I can't download most of the gifs. Some gifs I can download but some only download the image and some don't download at all"

2014,Vurcease,"December 1, 2015",5,"Solid The app works well and does what it aims to do. Sometimes the content of Imgur is bloated and the app can't fix that. Giant gif videos, galleries with a hundred images and so on. Good little app. Keep on kickin'!"
2015,SpellingBeeHanger,"December 23, 2015",5,"Up vote your mood This app makes life better. Thank you Imgur and Imgur community for helping me smile despite it all. I guess this is like downloading a smile app. Yeah, there's an app for that and you're lookin' at it."

2021,Kevin Lange,"March 6, 2015",1,"Completely non-functional Imgur is an image host, right? Wrong! Not anymore! And this app drives the point home. No uploads, no albums, nothing at all of my three users as a registered, paying user is available in this app. To add a little salt to the wound, imgur's mobile site has ceased to exist, turning the entire imgur experience on iOS into a steaming pile. Imgur may well have lost me as a user forever with this."

2032,Wekilledbambi03,"August 1, 2016",3,Fix landscape mode! Great app. Except the slightest turn changes to landscape mode. Then flipping back takes you to the last image you clicked on. Even I you scrolled 100 more down. So hard to get back where you were.

2037,Torey10,"January 18, 2017",5,Imgur The Imgur app is awesome just like the website. If you are a part of the Imgur community then you already know this. If you are not I urge you to find out for yourself.

2051,Mooman219,"April 7, 2015",1,"Unusable I really like imgur, don't get me wrong; I proudly paid for imgur pro to support the site. That being said, I couldn't use this app. The initial startup time before viewing images is ludicrous on my iPhone 5s. Frequently it just hangs until it crashes. A workaround has been to reinstall the app after it starts to get bad, but that is unreasonable."

2060,Boozershere,"January 3, 2017",5,Much affection. Such wow. I love it! People around me don't. They will be talking to me and mid sentence I pull the phone out like I got a text but really I'm just in user sub lurking with the rest of the heathens.

2064,Ricosto8,"February 23, 2017",5,Imgur rules Most used app on my phone. It appeals to the slack jawed dimwit in me that needs to constantly be provided with cool stuff to look at that I normally wouldn't see. It's a community and I love it.
2065,Dkmbamafan,"March 2, 2017",5,It's freaking awesome I love it. It helps me get through the days that have no laughter or love in them. I don't agree with all the opinions but I'm not suppose to either. I just abide.

2070,bah644,"January 9, 2016",5,Most amazing waste of time there is I love imgur and this app is the best. I love how you can search gifs and how you can text imgur posts directly from the app.
2071,Gabosarriab,"February 5, 2016",5,This is the correct one I didn't know which app was the correct Imgur app so I downloaded them all to try them. This is the one developed by imgur. It's awesome get it
2072,Steampunk Astronaut,"February 11, 2016",3,"Good, but a step backwards. Technically much improved, but the voting bar needs to be back at the bottom. As phones get bigger, putting it at the top makes it more inconvenient to vote. Also, the text colors seem a little too vibrant? Like they're glowing."
2073,joeyvp,"February 13, 2016",5,"Pretty much perfect Its perfect - easy to use, doesnt freeze, loads quickly etc."
2074,DonnaSueR,"February 24, 2016",4,A lot of fun! Meeting people all over the world is amazing.  The app is missing a message feature which is on the PC.  The app occasionally gets server errors from the volume of people posting.  Cmon Imgur fix this!
2075,drumpfinthetrunkf,"March 3, 2016",3,meh meh No delete button on comments. Sends me notifications of my own comments. excessive columns in profile tab. While in user sub newest will rocket me to user sub rising or most viral without notice. Better than previous version but needs work.
2076,Omnibus spending,"July 6, 2016",5,Good stuff I'm really happy that the app works out just like the browser version. Can't wait for more updates on the app! (Favorite files pls kthx)

2080,BrownieSundown,"November 6, 2013",5,"Works great! This app works great - just like the mobile imgur site, but optimized for iOS.  It's great if I need to upload a picture to send to a friend over Skype in a hurry."
2081,Sorrynoload,"March 5, 2015",5,"This is great So much better than the other imgur mobile apps. Really really great. Even the small details like the image ""falling"" when you are done looking at it, love it. Yay imgur!"
2082,Someoneqwq,"August 28, 2015",1,"None of the images are showing None of the images or gifs are showing. The comments load and so do the titles, but where the image should be, there is a black empty rectangle. (It has nothing to do with slow internet either, all other image apps work) Also the app doesn't allow you to search images by title."
2083,Vexano,"September 18, 2015",4,Nearly perfect but... you can't look at subreddits like on other third party apps. Still works fine and will use when away from my computer.
2084,Wilrow,"November 21, 2015",5,Great way to pass the time I spend so much time on this app that I had to up my data plan form 10 gigs to 30 gigs a month. I live a sad boring life.
2085,Tinker314,"December 10, 2015",5,"Good, Dangerously Good Great content but be wary of using the app without a wifi connection b/c you will want to watch all the hilarious GIFs, and then cry when you see your data usage."

I'm uninterested in the app, but they try every trick in the book to make you download this app. So I did, and it is terrible. (Sad trombone). So thanks for wasting my time, imgur. Your deceptive practices led me to finally cave and try your app, and it is absolutely the worst. I'm genuinely amazed at all the astroturf reviews you guys must have bought to get that rating."
2088,mewshie,"June 8, 2017",2,"Newest update has some bugs The newest update causes the comments section to have duplicate entries, and it will never load fully. I must close the app and restart it to get the comments section to load fully again. I love Imgur and I'm sure they will fix this soon."
2089,john97912109,"July 14, 2017",1,"Can't sign in with Yahoo Can't even use the app. Either won't load Yahoo sign in page, or it sends you in an endless loop of trying to sign in, then auto sending you back to the app. Very poor UX. Also ridiculous that going to an Imgur link in iOS automatically open the app rather than viewing page in browser."
2090,Redfox1997,"January 27, 2017",5,"Love it I'm addicted to this app. Much better than iFunny (sorry iFunny users, but the Imgurians have you beat...also, our mascot is a giraffe, so beat that!)"

2094,Furious_Dawg11,"March 17, 2017",5,I need rehab for this Imgur is a mysterious website where time seems to not exist. We're Reddits little brother but we have pictures so take that!
2095,THat Guy Big Ben,"March 27, 2017",4,"Good app Imgur is a great app if you want to spend some hours scrolling through the posts and be entertained, laugh, feel sad, or feel happy. Don't use the app if you wanna be productive. Thanks and have a great day!"
2096,darrontrask,"April 10, 2017",5,Awesome The app works great. Saves me from having to get my laptop when I just need a few minutes of browsing.
2097,The_Uber_Wolf,"May 4, 2017",5,"Great Casual App I had a cousin suggest Imgur to me once, and I've enjoyed it ever since then. It's a great app to pass the time, because there is such a large variety of great posts all the time. Great app!"
2098,JJSpaceGhost,"May 14, 2017",5,"Imgur is one of my favorite apps If you like gifs, memes, and dickbutt, this is the app to be on. Really well designed and the Imgur dev team cares about their users. Most people vote 7/5."
2099,eboyblue3,"May 17, 2017",1,"No Imgur, this isn't how you get people to use their app. Somehow the upload button disappeared on the mobile website and now I have to use the app to upload. Along with not allowing people to directly link to images anymore this is VERY user unfriendly and in fact goes against the terms that Imgur was originally founded on."
2100,Drew Adams 85,"April 16, 2016",5,Goodbye Facebook I've been trying to find a way to break away from Facebook and this was the ticket. Couldn't be happier. The community is pretty Awesome.
2101,Grieheart,"April 18, 2016",4,"Almost perfect The new update makes it so I don't loose my place in really long threads of i accidentally swipe right or left, and I love that. But I really wish it had mobile messaging"
2102,Ikthalon,"May 22, 2016",1,"Web app adds cancerous The app itself is lacking in options but the promotion put forth by imgur is some of the most obnoxious I've seen. Right now if you are viewing an image on imgur via mobile it has a loudly colored View in App link. I like imgur as an image hosting site, it's great and has been ideal until now. Want more people to use the app? Make a better app."
2103,Protops,"June 18, 2016",5,"Well done. In 20 years of the Internet, this is the only thing I've found that actually makes me lol"

2108,Ruffboy,"December 8, 2016",5,"Lots of cool and funny Good app. Lots of original posts by real people. Sometimes comments are funnier than posts. IMO too much video game crap, but just keep swiping left."
2109,Jimmy nutrition,"January 1, 2017",5,"Great Community I love the support for members like the Olympic swimgurian Cody Miller, and the home for the holidays campaign.  There are some great inside jokes (banana for sale, moon moon) and some hidden gems like finding Michael Cera or confused Travolta. Get the app! The users are great."
2110,Jmarambula,"December 18, 2015",4,"Entertaining buuuuut... There are a few things on mobile that can't be done on a regular computer. Also, the app occasionally acts up and comments won't show up."

2114,Whatchatalkinaboutwillis,"February 12, 2016",3,It's blue just different so going to take getting use to but there really wasn't any reason for the changes I guess. I liked the floating up/down buttons and have found myself not upvoting or downvoting just because it's extra effort
2115,Gr8wh1te,"February 13, 2016",5,"Sure, they changed the layout But it's still the best way to forget how long you've been sitting on your toilet."

2117,Igaboo57,"March 3, 2016",5,Too good for my good Imgur is a place where you can lose yourself for hours. I credit my first ever F on imgur. I ended up deleting it just to force myself away.
2118,Writer of a review,"March 12, 2016",5,"Definitely worth getting. Great for keeping up with all of the Internet stuff out there. Just a heads up, it's imager, even though it says imgur"
2119,Giant Baby Hands.,"April 6, 2016",4,"Imgur Sometimes offensive, but never not funny. May not be for everyone. Even I admit the content and user base can be fairly problematic at times, but you can always find something good to counterbalance the bad."
2120,Snarkum,"August 1, 2013",1,"Unbelievably sloppy Compared to their desktop website, this app is really poorly designed. Not only that, I also can't access my images of my gallery at all, it just stays stuck at loading. Did they not do a beta run or anything? This feels like they threw something together in a hurry without caring about performance or anything."
2121,mCoates,"March 5, 2015",1,Can't Upload or View Uploads? This is SO COOL! An official imgur app that doesn't even let you access your own photos!
2122,PublicFriendemy,"April 10, 2015",1,"Latest update ruined it. I don't use Imgur to look at the gallery, but to get photos from my laptop to my phone easily or upload photos to send to friends."
2123,Kreiel,"June 3, 2015",4,Better than average This app is a definite step up from the old version.  My only qualm is that random mode seems to be bugged and just shows the front page to me.
2124,SkiDisJawn,"July 29, 2015",5,"Search bar? Everything is working great so far, but when are we going to get a search bar?"
2125,Kdktjskg,"October 4, 2015",5,Quality I prefer it over ifunny and thats saying something
2126,Nevigrofnu,"October 14, 2015",1,"Unreliable Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  The app loads, frames load.  Sometimes pictures don't load.  Sometimes comments don't load.  Sometimes GIFs play 2 seconds and stop.  "
2127,Hoser9127,"November 9, 2015",5,"No more spare time I prefer the app to the website. Makes time wasting accessible anywhere.  For real though, the comments are great, very clever insights."
2128,REECON_,"November 21, 2015",4,"Great but Love the app, much prefer it to the desktop experience. Wish it had an integrated gif creator or when replying to a comment, a like ""attach"" button and it would reference the users ""favorited/hearted"" gifs. "
2129,mosb1000,"August 5, 2017",1,"Total garbage, don't waste your time with it. The interface is inscrutable, and as far as I can tell, doesn't do anything that most users would want. I will be deleting this, and probably won't be giving it another chance. I don't know where the positive reviews are coming from, they were probably bought."
2130,Kiffergin,"December 26, 2016",5,Great Functionality and form I have been using the Imgur app since public day one. There are hiccups but the company listens and updates in a timely manner.

2133,Alex L..,"February 23, 2017",4,"Good stuff So far, this is indeed the best iOS app for browsing Imgur. Devs do give it a lot of love, and it's come a long way from launch. Every gripe I have is not app exclusive, but general - favorite folders, blacklisting tags, etc etc."
2134,Znuxaji,"March 3, 2017",4,"New version is broken! Previous version worked very well, can no longer view post titles or posters..."

2138,Mich1126,"May 21, 2017",5,Imgur my new favorite time waster!! Satisfying. Best place to waste hours upon hours of time. Time you never get back. Super worth it! Comments from Imgur peeps just as satisfying and funny AF.
2139,12066549,"June 13, 2017",1,Game ad? I got this app because someone on Reddit said it was a destiny manager and there were comments on how to do it but there were by to people so please stop doing that it's ignoring the crap out of me that you would use this to recruit people when it's not true if they want to chat get discord if they want memes get a trustworthy app like ifunny please stop being a piece of üí©
2140,Wilwithonel,"May 9, 2016",3,Issue with comments This update really brought some good features but now many comments with more than one line are cut off after the first line.  GIFs also seem to get in the way of some comments.
2141,Imgurina,"July 26, 2016",5,"TOTALLY DIGG this APP I love imgur , I've been on it for a long time. Before that I used to use 9gag .. But compared to imgur it's nothing! Just love it.."

2157,Jordanjordan10,"February 5, 2016",5,"Fantastic This is a great app! It's really well designed and easy to use. All of the interactions just make sense and the 3D Touch support, although ultimately useless, is a fun addition."

2161,Heytherejake,"December 25, 2013",1,"Please start testing your updates... I've had this app for a long time, and i'd say one out of every ten updates is buggy, or has something bad that completely ruins the app. Right now, the problem is (as everyone else has said) it crashes all the freaking time. At least once every 10 photos. App completely unusable."
2162,Heptite,"January 3, 2014",4,Too Buggy The bugs that I have experienced from the start persist and they have introduced new ones. They have had plenty of time to get it together.
2163,Thisappfreakingsucks,"March 5, 2015",2,It finally happened! This app badly needs an upload feature. I use imgur so I can post pictures to forums. The pictures are on my phone and I was hoping for an easier way than plugging my phone into my computer every time and then uploading them.

2168,Jud5un,"March 4, 2017",4,"My preferred social media app to avoid my life Lots of stupid, neat memes and stories to distract you from your responsibilities. Pretty good people on there, although, there are some trolls and angry dudes who voice loud opinions, seeded by ignorance. The community overall is great."

Too much politics BS, ads, and not to mention that you can't express your views without being insulted by people that care too much about fake internet points.

2228,Senpainoticeme,"January 3, 2016",1,App crashes and interface could be better This app needs improvement to its interface. It's slow and often crashes on my phone. If it was optimize better I would give it a 5 star but right now there's too much issues that needs to be iron out before I would consider using it full time.
2229,beetsbyrei,"August 23, 2017",1,Long time user I used to be a daily user but I can't anymore. The app always says there's a notification when there isn't. The app is always slow. If I switch to another app real quick and come back it loses my place. I used to find a lot of funny memes but now it's a lot of crying and complaining like I'm doing here.

One out of every 5 or 10 images would be understandable, but this is just too much to use. Did you forget that this is a platform based upon the content of the images?"

2294,Krdshrk,"March 13, 2015",1,Way to completely change things for the worse Seriously?  Change the browsing - fine.. But completely remove any way to upload photos?  That's the only reason I really used the app.  This was the worst update ever.  I wish I could roll back.  I just want to upload some pictures...
2295,Sumeh-sammy,"May 13, 2015",1,"Smh Imgur I only give this app one star for effort. I wished that my iPhone wasn't setup to automatically update, as this is the worst update to date. I don't understand why the format had to change and we lost complete function. Browsing is difficult as well as refreshing. And no way to check sub Reddits or upload content."

I would rather it go back to the way it was."

2770,Toicat,"November 14, 2016",2,"My 2-cents Imgur has eroded down to postings of two varieties...cute pet photos, and bikini clad women. Excessively vulgar comments by users with the F-word used to the point where it seems like normal conversation. I have had the app for 3-months and will soon delete it to free up memory."

2880,KtNugget,"August 31, 2015",1,Problems! Updated today (8/31) and am very disappointed. Crashes constantly. Notifications appear and then the app says comments don't exist. Can't even manually search for it as it won't show up. Shouldn't have updated as I was pleased with the layout prior.

2886,Lyn2Myself,"November 21, 2015",5,"I can be snarktastic! Love it. Wish it would quit logging me out, but 100% of that is just me being lazy and not wanting to remember passwords. Viva la Imgur!"

2890,betanine,"August 28, 2013",2,"Uninspiring It seems the majority of the content revolves around recycling images with cheesy tag lines written on them. It seems like a great collaboration of pics that get shared all over Facebook in one place. Nothing really new or fresh, in my opinion."
2891,KauaiSkyGuy,"January 18, 2014",1,"Used to be good before update This app has crashed 10+ times in the past 20 min of just browsing the gallery. It was good before the update.

2931,Biggus Stockpickus,"June 2, 2015",1,Terrible change for the worse I am deleting this app and my browser bookmarks because of imgur's policy change of content and comments. This change takes away too much of what i loved about imgur. I'll go back to facebook when i want censorship.

However, I simply had to write a message on my typewriter to give to my personal stenographer who I insisted write this review verbatim, that this app has, at a constant and exponential rate, caused a man to potentially see hope and happiness in the world through the lens of interconnectivity. Sure, there could be issues such as the app crashing at obscure and incredibly inconvenient moments, but that simply adds to the flare and fanfare offered up by the unequivocally gifted engineers who sacrifice time home with their 4 children who, day in and day out, hope for the moment that their family can return to them so that they could all maybe, just maybe, have a hot meal to enjoy in the company of those few who are loved by one another but noooo we just had to spring for a household upgrade so now we both have to ceaselessly work ourselves into our own graves whilst sacrificing the joys of life for a minimal stipend just to pay the mortgage.. But we are getting off topic Sharon so cut that part out; for this ethereal shrine of wonder. I can only hope to behold marvels such as apps of this nature in my remaining years on this seemingly doomed planet and pass down the knowledge of banana for scale to my futuristic and totally cool, obviously, legacies. 5/7: best app ever."
