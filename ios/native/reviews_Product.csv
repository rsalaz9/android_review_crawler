0,polygrafix,"April 29, 2018",5,"Like consumer reports and reddit had a baby Ok, first off, I don‚Äôt do a lot of reviews unless something catches my attention that is of exceptional value. Product hunt is that app.  It keeps me on top of the tech scene by letting me know what is the hottest things (or about to become) in tech, books, software and more. It has a voluntary community that curates things that get voted up or down, so there is a democratic process administered by the internet, it‚Äôs like consumer reports and reddit had a baby. "
1,AndrewMcMahonJr.,"April 26, 2018",5,The most productive infinite scroll out there I‚Äôm a product designer and thusly just love Product Hunt in general. I‚Äôm glad that they introduced a solid mobile experience so I can stay connected and inspired even when I‚Äôm indisposed. üòú
2,SandraWNY,"May 1, 2018",3,"I appreciate so much about the PH website, but ... ... this app, well...  New products, apps, websites, services: Product Hunt delivers. And that the makers participate in the discussions is pure gold to me. My first impressions of this new app are 1) please don‚Äôt make my eyes hurt, grey on lighter grey would be tough even for a kitty; 2) it's crashed a couple of times in the past 15 minutes; 3) where are the categories/tabs? All I see are new products, listed from mewest (actual typo, but I just have to leave it) first. Probably a bit of fine tuning ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù would make it better than ever. (P.S. I‚Äôm setting up my new laptop and it doesn‚Äôt have a single kitty sticker on it. Sad, so sad.)"
3,dannypizarro,"April 4, 2018",1,"Horrible update I am a very long product hunt user, which makes writing this review that much harder. Huge fan of PH and the community and platform they have built. Their last app was not amazing, but it was pretty good and got the job done. This app is absolutely useless. Not sure if the problems are only on iPhone X or all devices, but it‚Äôs literally unusable. I open the app and click on a product and nothing happens for a few seconds. Then the page opens, the app bugs out, and everything I try to click is unresponsive. This update is so bad that I have found myself using PH on my mobile browser or just not checking it at all. "
4,heyluis,"May 15, 2018",3,"Missing potential I like product hunt and what it does for browsing cool products. However, the app is actually really bad. It‚Äôs super unresponsive, tons of bugs which cause crashing, sluggish and constantly reads my touches/swipes incorrectly. "
5,TheAirBender,"April 25, 2018",5,"Great design, effectivity, and usefulness. I found Product Hunt a few months ago, on Google. I started using it on my desktop/laptop and subscribed to their mailing list. I then realized they had a mobile app and realized I can take this on the go. It was really great to see the development of the mobile app and then taking feedback from users and actually implementimg them. The company owners and adminstrators are also friendly and I love how they shed light on these startups and cool programs/tools."
6,dwilsonsf,"May 4, 2018",5,"Best place to find new products and trends I often find myself searching ProductHunt first when looking for products to use, or I research. "
7,BRuLeZ,"March 5, 2019",1,"Good content, but terrible iOS app The developers must have thought it a good idea to implement their own scroll view.. then failed miserably at it. "
8,Spencerncrane,"January 18, 2019",2,"Can‚Äôt login with Google? I love Product Hunt and have always used the web version, and have just discovered the app. However, on the web version I‚Äôm able to login with my Google account (which is what my entire account relies on); on the app version, I only see the options to login with Twitter and Facebook which means I can‚Äôt access my account."
9,AteamSF,"May 2, 2018",5,"Tech Guru of Startups 5min/day to capture a ton info on latest startups, new features and the talk of the town. You‚Äôll find everyone from C level execs and the brightest SWE here talking about what‚Äôs good and what not. A quick look at the daily tab gives me a good info on what‚Äôs new, what‚Äôs trending, and what‚Äôs worth buying/paying for. I would highly recommend NOT wasting time on buying expensive tech magazines. PH is the key to your tech house!"
10,tjs0,"April 25, 2018",5,"A place to connect Product Hunt is not only a place to find new products, but a place to find entrepreneurs to talk with, build with, and share with. "
11,markjohn1,"April 25, 2018",5,"What I needed I enjoy reading about new products, but don‚Äôt always have the time to follow everything. With PH I get to not only read about new products but also interact with others about said products. It makes my life easier and it‚Äôll do the same for you if you‚Äôre like me. Great job PH TEAM!"
12,@prodsunday,"April 25, 2018",5,"Amazing! - Just needs a bit more. I recently downloaded the ProductHunt mobile app update a while back, it is amazing! I‚Äôm loving the dark mode and just being able to upvote new launches üõ†üöÄ. But one thing I think it is missing is being able to check your Ship Subscription üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I think that being able to manage this and your launches would be awesome! üòÄ"
13,Rami D.,"April 26, 2018",5,"Overall great package I‚Äôm a huge fan of PH it‚Äôs the number one thing I do as soon as I get to my office in the morning, the app is fast and pretty easy to get used to but there could be some improvements in the navigation system sometimes swipes as misinterpreted :( "
14,jdavini,"April 26, 2018",5,My goto App for all Startups! Product Hunt is an addiction and with an enhanced mobile app it further grows that addiction because I can find all the new best products and startups where ever I go!  The app is simple and that's all that is needed when I'm sitting on the toilet or even walking on the treadmill. This app helps me discover the best apps and products instantly!
15,RubenzeoG,"May 2, 2018",5,"The holy grail for makers The best part about the product hunt app is the fact that it‚Äôs well...an app! If you‚Äôre on the go and want to keep updated on the latest web apps, App Store apps, devices, platforms etc. Then it‚Äôs the best place to stay updated on the best digital and physical tech based products. If you‚Äôre a techie, entrepreneur, or just tech fiend then download the app and join the tight product hunt community."
16,Andr√© Web,"May 4, 2018",4,"The app experience Is a bit laggy and not the same as the website which I use daily. I wish you can filter out all of the apps to just showcase iOS apps on the iPhone this way you don‚Äôt have to deal with a bunch of slow loading formats instead it takes you right to the App Store. Overall I love this company, but the app needs a little work :) "
17,Joe Bruck,"May 19, 2018",2,"Memory issues The new design looks great but this app has some sort of memory issues. It runs fine on the first couple launches but then the animations will slow down like crazy. I‚Äôll click on a product and about 30 seconds later, a jittery opening animation will slowly start. Once I force close the app it works correctly for a little bit. I‚Äôll be glad to send screen recordings if it‚Äôll help investigating the issue. I‚Äôm on an iPhone X so I didn‚Äôt really expect to see performance issues with a simple app like this. Hope it gets fixed."
18,Ian1Dlover,"October 17, 2018",3,"Good but needs fixing... Product Hunt is a great community for finding the next big thing whether it be apps, websites, products, etc... however the latest update isn‚Äôt too great; the looks and functionality is fine but I‚Äôm constantly logged out every single day and I constantly have to delete the app and reinstall because It crashes and won‚Äôt open. I‚Äôve gone to using using the mobile site because the app has been so buggy. PLEASE FIX!!!"
19,omarooh,"January 20, 2019",1,"Disappointed Long time PH user here, sad to say that I am extremely disappointed in PH mobile. Since they redesigned the app, it seems like all the functionality went down the drain. There‚Äôs barely anything left to do on the app, as a matter of fact, why do we need the app anymore? Why can‚Äôt I browse categories? Why can‚Äôt I view my notifications without it flickering and never showing me the notifications? Why do some products never load even though I‚Äôm certain I have a stable connection. So much wasted potential here. Will uninstall until they release a new version."
20,Eddie A Rodriguez,"April 25, 2018",5,Slick! Love that everything was streamlined. There's so much to see and browse through when it comes to the products and the app is built to get out of your way and let you explore. I do wish though that force touch would work though.
21,mattmetrovich,"April 25, 2018",5,"Awesome app. Product Hunt keeps on surprising me: they carefully listen to the feedback from the community and the user experience of this new mobile app is the digital proof of that. With a clean design, great UX, the right amount of features to discover products quickly on my daily commute."
22,SirJconny,"April 27, 2018",4,"Love Product Hunt, but mobile is now limited. I love Product Hunt, but lately the mobile version seems to be limited. It‚Äôs seems you can no longer search by categories, and now the search is only for a specific thing. Still, I love product hunt and I love browsing for new things!"
23,Evan Palmer,"May 30, 2018",1,"Garbage, barely usable The new design is nice and all but the tradeoff here is a significant one - performance. The app freezes regularly and the card view often takes double digit seconds to load, if it loads at all. View refresh requires a force kill more than occasionally. The list goes on but, at the end of the day, the application is broken."
24,ZeroDrek,"September 13, 2018",2,App is full of bugs. This app used to be decent but ever since the last redesign it has been absolutely horrible. I constantly get logged out and have to sign back in via Twitter. I can‚Äôt even view my profile; Tapping my profile icon crashes the app. The notifications page is unreliable and is currently flashing like it‚Äôs having a seizure and is completely unusable. Better off just visiting the website at this point.
25,Big Appletite,"February 15, 2019",4,"Great site, not so great app I love PH. Truly. But the app is not so great; "
26,Banditiiii,"March 9, 2019",3,"Glitchy Hey Product Hunt,"
27,newillusions,"March 26, 2019",2,"Screen bumping up on scroll When scrolling down through days (today>yesterday etc), the screen will bump up when you scroll down, causing you to lose your place and need to scroll back down. The further down you scroll into past days, the more it happens. Just a quick bug report as otherwise Product Hunt is great."
28,Kguy18,"July 20, 2019",3,"Love the concept The app is great in theory, unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt persist your location in the scroll view so when you hit a product and then go back to it you have to scroll back down to where you were previously. Would love to not have to do that. Also, a fair amount of network errors pop up - on wifi and LTE. Other than that it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do."
29,Khglynn,"November 9, 2019",2,Still crashes daily Update: years later and this is still the most frustratingly unstable apps I use.
30,hawluchaa,"April 25, 2018",3,"Incredibly useful This is a great app. I‚Äôd have missed out on so many new services (and so many pre order discounts) if I wasn‚Äôt on Product Hunt. The services I‚Äôve found on this platform have helped me immensely with my work (launchaco was a lifesaver). To the team at PH, I‚Äôd say keep up the good work, and never stop using the Google Glass cat as your mascotüê±."
31,Tobins,"April 25, 2018",5,Easiest way to keep up with what‚Äôs new! The technology industry moves at a fast pace and keeping up with where things are going takes a lot of effort. Product Hunt makes it easy to see what tomorrow‚Äôs makers are building.
32,yisrael_87,"April 27, 2018",5,"Love Product Hunt! I've been a Product Hunt user for years! I don't even know how many of my most loved apps were first discovered on PH. If you're an early adopter or someone who loves great tools, you definitely should check it out!"
33,itzel yrv,"April 28, 2018",5,"The best app to discover new tech products PH is an excelente place to keep up with the latest products on the tech scene. Also, you can publish your own product and receive feedback from the community, LOVE IT!"
34,icysquish,"April 29, 2018",5,Keeps you ahead of the curve. I‚Äôve been following product hunt for some time now and the app is awesome. I love the ratings of the app of the day and just the variety of apps you can look at in one place.
35,@shacheng,"April 30, 2018",5,"Daily rotation The PH is in my daily rotation. There‚Äôs no better place to see community support and surface the best and new digital apps, podcast, books and more. Definitely worth downloading if you love trying new things."
36,scottpenton,"May 2, 2018",5,"Must download Product hunt is the perfect app if you‚Äôre looking for new apps to try or if you are a maker of things and want to get your product out there, whether it‚Äôs an app, book, gadget or whatever."
37,KankleKobra,"May 8, 2018",1,"Cannot use on iPhone X Even with latest update. If you click into a product, app locks up and phone begins to overheat. I have to force quit the app. The app has been like this for over a month or so now and no update has addressed this issue. Multiple people have mentioned it. I have saved a safari bookmark to my home screen which works just fine and I can actually view ProductHunt without my phone overheating!"
38,nicksterdude,"May 8, 2018",5,"My go-to app every morning Do I drink coffee? No. I use Product Hunt. Discovering the best products from around the world is my favorite way to wake up every morning, and their new iOS app is the bomb dot com."
39,Ycellardoor,"June 18, 2018",3,"Love PH BUT, recent version is a problem Since the latest update, I get constantly logged out and have to keep reconnecting my twitter account. Most times the app stalls out while trying to connect to the twitter login screen."
40,TruBluNoDoubt,"April 25, 2018",1,"Basically non-functional I üòç PH. It‚Äôs a daily activity to see what everyone is making and connect with the makers directly. The community is full of great insights. HOWEVER, the new app is down right unusable. It‚Äôs horrid in the way it loads data, locking up the UI, and making it so a 2 second interaction takes more like 2 minutes. For a team who is focused on helping people launch product people love, this is disheartening."
41,hemigirl7,"April 25, 2018",4,"Love PH App! I use PH every morning on my phone for ‚Äúwake up‚Äù inspiration for the day. Love the app for quick browsing, sharing, and saving. Have it 4 stars as I occasionally experience screen load lags on iOS. But, overall, one of my fave apps!"
42,FVP!1,"April 25, 2018",5,New UI The new app UI is great and fast for navigating through new products that are launched every day. I especially like the easy way I can swipe through the products via cards. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
43,BeeeHoff,"April 25, 2018",5,"Part of my morning ‚Äúroutine‚Äù Love me some PH. The iOS app is part of my morning app checks. Overall very happy, just wish it had a bit more features inline with the website. "
44,Talbot911,"April 26, 2018",5,"For startup enthusiasts I literally look at this app or site every day. If startups excite you, this is the app for you. It‚Äôs incredible the amount of cool products I‚Äôve found only from using this app."
45,yanirnulman,"April 27, 2018",5,Product Hunt rocks!- Product Hunt is my favorite place to learn about and connect with other makers. The tools I've found on PH are tremendous. The app makes the experience only better.
46,Lmick002,"April 28, 2018",5,"Great community for up and coming startups to gain traction If you love discovering new products and being in a community of people that enjoy creating new products, this is the app you‚Äôve been looking for."

48,Mtgpix,"April 28, 2018",4,"Keep Your Finger On The Pulse of Tech If you‚Äôre trying to learn more about tech or startups, look no further.

49,RyanRallen,"May 3, 2018",5,An awesome resource for all things ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù Simple UX. Consistent content. This easily-digestible feed brings you all the latest Product updates you need.
50,Thehacker1245,"April 8, 2018",3,Great but missing something The app is great. Reading descriptions about the product. Upvoting if you like the product. That‚Äôs all great. But I want to see what my upvotes are and need categories like the website. The idea is brilliant but missing a few things.
51,JC7133,"April 25, 2018",5,Long timer PH user I‚Äôve been using PH for years and love it. The new mobile app has removed the bloat and I love how fast it now is. Keep up the good work!
52,JellyyRoll,"May 1, 2018",3,"Love the app, still needs a lot of work The layout of the app is great. But it still feels kinda clunky and slow. Pages take a while to appear and lags when transitioning. Can't wait to see the improvements"

56,Jaykayshay,"May 24, 2018",1,"Buggy on iPhone X Buggy as all hell on the iPhone X. It‚Äôs a shame because the app is on my second home screen and I open it at least once a day, but often times tapping into a product causes it to freeze and I have to then force close+reload. Easier at that point just to go to the web page."
57,Jingle Himer,"May 30, 2018",2,"Incredibly buggy and lost all my hunts The most recent update managed to remove all my hunts I had saved and made Facebook the only way to log in.

58,Arthur Abadjan,"June 28, 2018",2,"Please re-design iPad Pro layout Hey guys, as for now it‚Äôs ugly with huge empty blocks and over structured in a 20% of the display. It makes it not just unattractive but very UX-unfriendly, especially upper block with photos and video."

Obviously fixing the Twitter bug wouldn't resolve that, but I would like to see the experience become a little more visual (ie--thumbnails of products/sites instead of just headlines). I also wish the default view was for the site/product link, and not the people up-voting. Which is more important for this experience? And Pocket support would be quite lovely. I guess I'm just being critical because this concept of a service is very cool and something I've wanted for a long time."
131,ChristieJ1217,"August 24, 2014",2,"Potentially Cool I could potentially come to love this app but right now it's too big of a pain in the neck to even bother with.  The ""Details"" tab should provide a few more details than a one line blurb about the product. A photo and price would be ideal :) Then I can more easily determine if it's even worth going to the website for further details. Especially since every time I click on the ""website"" tab I get the spinning wheel of death forever and end up having to open it in Safari to actually view the product. Add a photo of the product and speed it up and I'll quickly change my rating to 5 stars! ;)"

From Digital nomads living in Bangkok to Silicon Valley techies and all the way down to the Silicon Beach bros of LA. This revamped version of the app is executed flawlessly and has many great features. One of my favorites is the much awaited feature to add products to your ""collections"". You can also now reply to comments and the overall flow of the app is smoother and the animations are oh so slick. Mad props to the IOS Engineers who put this together and a big shoutout to the PH team which is near and dear to my nerdy heart."

I want to be able to update my profile picture and the background image so that I can further identify myself socially on this app. Given that I utilize the Twitter sign on when I log onto your app, then my images automatically transfer from Twitter to Product Hunt. I do not like that they cannot be different then what is on Twitter. I hope I'm just missing how to update this. Thanks for any assistance and future updates to allow this!"

Also, if you're viewing a previous day's products, click on a product, then navigate back to the product list page, the page refreshes and only loads the current day's products.  You then have to manually load each day's product list to get back to where you left off."

I can't change the username to match my Twitter handle and whenever you select my product hunt user name it links to a completely different account than mine. I've also been a member for over 3yrs so this isn't a new user issue.
