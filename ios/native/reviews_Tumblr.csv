0,Q.p. Doll,"November 16, 2019",5,"Unexpected/feeling heard I’ve used tumblr for many years now- It’s been my own personal diary. I can’t even tell you how many followers I have, because I’ve never cared to look. I’m giving this app a complete, solid 5 stars for two reasons: One, it’s been my escape, the only place I can post, as me, feeling completely anonymous- which is why I feel this is my diary. Two: when I typed the word, “depression” in the search engine.. the message I received read: “Are you okay?” And gave many links to deal with how I feel. That made me think twice about a lot that I’ve been thinking about lately.... So, with that being said, my five stars come from the feeling of the one place I can express myself, outside of social media (likes and follows), but also because of the individuals behind this app, TRULY care. I have never witnessed that, in this age of social media. I have more respect that ever for tumblr. Thank you... When I typed that one word.. I felt less alone, just from that simple, automated response. Tumblr has been here for many of our new aged diary emotions. The fact that the developers are aware, speaks volumes. So, genuinely, thank you. For all of us that stepped back to take another look at our lives. For feeling heard in a place you usually wouldn’t expect."
1,"Why do you need to know, cop?","March 23, 2019",1,"I love Tumblr, I hate this app This app has so many issues that have yet to be solved after at least a year or two of them existing. Despite the messaging system, which I’m sure has been critiqued plenty, inconsistently and unreliably updating or not updating while you’re using the app- you also can’t click on asks or even keep track of your asks in any way through the app. If you want to go look at one of your apps, you had better be keeping constant track of whoever asked it because all you’re going to get is a notification, and clicking on the notification (if it was answered) only takes you to the person’s profile. The app will randomly crash for seemingly no reason, even while under little to no stress. The double-click-to-like feature doesn’t work unless you tap a large body of text or an image and even then, it may not register properly (maybe user error but still inconvenient). You also can’t keep track of submissions in any way unless you just miraculously remember- I think you get notified but I don’t even think you get that much. Aside from all this, there’s a myriad of other functionalities and nuances that are almost entirely unimportant (like how if you click on a person’s name that’s attached to a post, it’ll take you to a dedicated page with nothing but that post and a couple other posts from that person’s profile below it). This was a poorly-thought-through review but I think it covers most bases. Otherwise, it works enough."
2,Charlie & Punkin,"January 3, 2019",2,"Brand New Review I’ve reviewed before but gave it the same rating. Before Tumblr was a mess because of their bad coding — crashing after a little while of use, GIFs and images refusing to load almost constantly, videos not playing correctly, the list goes on. "
3,Ethereal92,"October 13, 2019",3,"Primary and Secondary Blogs I like Tumblr a lot. It has a few bugs, but not too many more than other apps. However, it really, REALLY bothers me that you can’t switch between which blogs you want to be your primary. My primary blog was one I made when I was 13, ignored for years, then logged back into and wanted to start fresh. When you tap the search bar on your profile, it has suggested tags that someone can select to see all posts on your page with that tag. Even when you delete all posts with that tag, it remains, and you can’t delete that."
4,Jason9800,"December 13, 2018",5,"Ya’ll are good Tumblr I just want to say ... You aren’t going anywhere yes there is a community of “NSFW” blah blah blah people but let’s be honest you guys are a great asset to the internet and just because we can’t see nudes anymore doesn’t mean your site & or app will “fail, be doomed, etc.” Kudos to the business decision your team made and I am glad you are (or at least I think) back on the app store. Tumblr you are more than just nudes, you are more than just explicit content, & you are more than the terrible content that unfortunately slipped through the cracks under your watch (but you are fixing/fixed it). Good luck and I’m sure I speak on behalf of the content creators, innovators, & fellow humans that work as music artist, graphic designers, sports enthusiasts, meme creators, fitness lovers, comedians, architects, political activists, political commentators, gif makers, life style bloggers & a myriad of other things that YOU not your “explicitly sexual content” helped give a platform to, & in some cases helped bolster a persons celebrity, hell for proof of my reference to what I just said look no further than one of my favorite artists A$AP Rocky and how Tumblr helped skyrocket one of his singles (Purple Swag). Anyway Tumblr/TumblrStaff keep on striving keep on keeping on and good luck 💙!"
5,Dchen78998,"November 4, 2017",1,"Crashed in big time I have being using tumblr for over a year now and it crashes me in big time. As I clean up on blogs that I follow the number stays on 514 but nothing to click on follow or unfollow and dashboard did not move at all as I tab for the update.  Both web and app absolutely failed to move at all.  Social media site like tumblr needs to be significantly improved on the platform.  I am working very hard on my leisure to develop tumblr society for the world.  The system video, photo, and multiple formats are very restrictive.  We need tumblr to admit that most of there users are not children in fact very small percentage and so the platform needs to be a whole lot more adult friendly and at the same time more true society interactive social friendly.  It is being existing for ten years already right?  Please completely redesign and turn your app to be minimum 18 years or older and preferably 21 years and older.  It doesn’t make any sense to do what Twitter or Facebook can already do and in other format alright.  Seriously, can your team member truly just listen and truly make that difference?  Most of your tumblr user don’t mind of paying for subscription, however, all of us care about all the inconvenience.  This cannot wait, please make the major redesign and changes at once and not waiting at all.  Your teams technology is too outdated, it needs completely overhaul and be five thousand times better and I mean it."
6,Desssssssssssssi,"January 29, 2019",1,"I used to love tumblr I’ve been using tumblr since 2010... my best friend put me on to it. I’ve been on and off for a few years now since i graduated high school. The app used to be good but now it’s just annoying. Still has funny post and is very informative but i hate the auto-reload feature. Since i don’t get on often, i like how i can scroll til forever without getting bored or seeing the same thing... but if i were to screen shot and send the funny or motivating picture to my friends or boyfriend, it refreshes as soon as i get back on. Small issue but highly annoying, i end up just not coming back for awhile again. Instagram i think is the only social media that doesn’t automatically reload. Yes you took away the NSFW content due to child pornographers which i 100% agree, get rid of the creeps! BUT to get rid of all nudity even if it’s pictures that are tastefully done or meant to be seen as art and not porn eh.... i think there should be a filter process... tumblr was great for expressing and exposing talent and creativity. You can’t put a limit on that. I don’t want porn back, but i don’t want my pictures being taken down because of an exposed nipple. Tumblr just not the same. People that were on before ALL the many many changes, know what i mean. Tumblr was a different outlet from your regular instagram or Twitter... it felt more private.. it felt more free... a place for creatives.... now it’s just.... blah. 🤷🏾‍♀️"
7,BeeLizard,"December 18, 2018",2,"Needs to change. I’m going to say that Tumblr is definitely unique in the creativity of it’s community, and serving that unique and diverse community with bans on explicit content, or NSFW content, is simply offensive to artists and people who celebrate and want to create a safe and helpful space to celebrate those topics. I am deeply disappointed in Tumblr with what it’s been doing. I admit that targeting porn bots who want to spread viruses is an admirable goal, but in order to achieve that there needs to be different algorithms to target that, rather than banning everything that falls under an “explicit” rating. What I find incredibly degrading is the labelling of “female presenting nipples” as offensive and explicit. If “female” nipples will be banned, but male nipples will not, then it’s simply inequality. those who wanted to be open about their bodies and share that with people, no longer can because their bodies are labelled and tagged as explicit and outrightly sexual, which is backwards and wrong. i wish i could say that Tumblr was a good place, and it’s users (while not all of them) definitely are people who wanted an outlet that let them express themselves creatively and freely, which can no longer happen. i only hope that people like me, who see that this change is harmful and discriminatory to the users of Tumblr, share their opinions and leave a review also. Thank you for reading."
8,Standpoor,"September 24, 2017",2,"No Excuse for this App For one of the most popular social networking sites in the world, and after all this time, and given that most people access it through their phones, you'd think Tumblr would manage to put together a decent app. Alas, their army of nerds has failed. If you follow more than a few active users and only check your account a couple times a day, you have to scroll and scroll and scroll, waiting for each new page to load, to find the specific kind of content you're looking for (say, videos, images, etc.). If the app crashes, you have to spend another five minutes scrolling to get back to your place. It's 2017. How is this still such an issue? There should be some kind of comprehensive, accessible filter that lets you fine-tune your feed. And automatically brings you back to where you had last scrolled? There's not even a reliable workaround: the archive button doesn't exist or the user has to choose a separate app theme or something with that specific function? It's definitely not there by default. And the ads. They're so large. Again, it makes infinite scrolling a chore; a quarter of each scroll is ad space, meaning more pauses for loading and less easily accessible content. I'd happily by a reasonable subscription to disable the ads. Is programming really this impossible?"
9,Keytothetruth,"April 4, 2018",3,"Sadly disappointed in a once amazing app Tumblr has been a place I’ve come to for years to express myself. It’s somewhat my secret outlet. Having an app available is super convenient and I honestly prefer to use the app versus a desktop. If there wasn’t an app available i probably wouldn’t even use tumblr anymore. It’s extremely annoying when you’re in the middle of using the app and it crashes out of nowhere exiting you out the app. It seems like every time you guys update the app to fix bugs etc. there’s just another bug that’s created. How difficult can it possible be to finally get this right. Don’t update the app if you’re not sure it’s absolutely going to fix the problem. Sometimes posts are missing from my blog or others. I can’t even refresh my notifications without it freezing and me having to exit out he app and enter into the app again just to see new notifications. I can’t even view my drafts on one tab without exiting out my blog, which was one of my favorite features. Now I have to go to settings to view my drafts which is INCONVENIENT! Would be 5 stars if I didn’t have to exit the app 20 times a day just to use it. Using tumblr shouldn’t be a job people. Fix it or you’re going to lose people’s interest in a great website."
10,Suoerlilyapplover,"September 26, 2017",1,"Take off the safe mode!!!! 😡😡😡 I have been using the Tumblr app for over 2 years. I actually was a fan of the major update that happened because I believe it made everything much more organized. Unfortunately I absolutely despise the latest update that moved the safe search to the settings. What's the point?!? The icon in the major update that let you press on it to show unfiltered posts and pictures and not show those posts and pictures was perfect. It was on the side, so it was not in the way of anything and worked perfectly. So why in the world did you get rid of it!?!?! The reason why I'm so mad at this in the first place is because certain things don't show in ""safe mode."" For example, the search ""soft beige"", which is not an inappropriate search at all, doesn't let me see any pictures because of this ""safe mode."" And I can't see any of these pictures by going into setting anyway because for some reason I have to be 18?!?! So you're telling me a 17 year old (my age) can't see pictures of a color because of this safe mode feature?!?!? This wouldn't be a problem if that icon was back. If you don't want to lose users because I know A LOT of other people probably have the same concerns as me. Return safe mode the way it used to be, an icon that you could press."
11,PixelatedTraveler,"October 25, 2017",1,"As of yesterday... I have a constant grey message box at the bottom saying “Hmm...try again?” And that I should log out and back in if it keeps happening. So I log out and back in, and it’ll work...until I leave the app and come back, the it happens again, and it’s a huge pain to have to keep logging back in. Stuff won’t really update while this message box is running."
12,Landofthebri,"December 3, 2017",1,"Borderline Unusable After the most recent ""best stuff first"" update the app functionality has plummeted. As others have mentioned, no matter how good my internet connection is and even when my other apps are loading just fine, Tumblr can't seem to load anywhere near the pace that it used to. On top of that, I'm constantly having an issue where as I scroll it'll suddenly freeze. Waiting a few seconds for it to catch up again is fine but I've waited upwards of a minute before. Again, the app has always had glitches and I've put up with it for the most part but these issues make the app incredibly frustrating to use. Also, it's great that they included a switch for you to turn the ""best stuff first"" off so you can scroll chronologically. What's not great is that the button doesn't actually work. Any time I refresh my dash it goes back to the algorithmic organization, and the only way to get it to be chrono again is to close out of the app completely. "
13,apmanda,"August 22, 2018",2,"Suggested posts, Too many porn bots I actually like this app for the most part, but they keep adding new features that suggest posts and blogs to you and while I like the IDEA of that, it’s SUPER ANNOYING to have that in my feed. I HATE THAT. And I also HATE having peoples posts pushed to the top of my feed because I may have “missed them.” It often screws with the chronology of some of the things I follow. Please remove the features from the feed and STOP BRINGING THEM BACK IN NEW WAYS, like, I’m not stupid, okay? Also, I get that this is probably a site problem, not specifically an app problem, but the porn and spam bots are a huge turn off for me. One thing that would make me more okay with it is if you could block blogs w/out having to go to them, like if I could just swipe and block them in my notifications, that’d be great. You may be able to do this on the computer, but I don’t use Tumblr on the PC enough to look. Other than that, I’ve enjoyed this app immensely. I don’t think it’s issues are really any worse than some other apps like instagram and Facebook especially. I have plenty of glitchy problems on BOTH of those apps just as much, so I’m not sure why people expect this one to be perfect when it’s handling much larger and more variant files. Weird."
14,TumblrIsDead,"December 17, 2018",1,Get rid of the pedos and the nazis instead of ruining the site Via tumblrs new guidelines they’ve yet again screwed over their audience and sent thousands of their users scattered to the winds most of them going onto twitter instead of tumblr. 
15,Amberh27,"December 19, 2018",1,"The staff who runs tumblr are idiots The worst, most non-communicative staff I've seen for any site. They will ignore any and all problems with the site, unless it threatens their revenue, then they'll ""fix"" it with the laziest and most destructive possible solution. For example: instead of hiring actual moderators or making even slightly competent bots, to combat the issues with users who used tumblr to share cp, they decided instead to ban any and all NSFW content, causing adult content creators and artists to lose revenue, as many used the site for their work. Their bots targeted any posts that it thought had NSFW content, that actually ended up not being NSFW at all, and shadowbanning people who they didn't like. While this all was happening, nearly their entire user base revolted against their ""Safer"" Tumblr (even though after their banning spree, porn bots and nazi blogs are still rampant on the site), what did the staff do? Nothing. No change to the policy, no ""lol jk"", not even a single word addressing the problems people had with the policy or the thousands of creators it's screwing out of a job because they didn't feel like coming up with an actual solution. Just another cog in the internet censorship machine. (Also the app and website are filled to the brim with bugs that the staff will never fix it so just deal with it I guess)"
16,Bo 👌🏻,"December 21, 2018",1,"Never should have been put back No app that contained any amount childporn should never be put back up for download. Blocking all “adult” content does not actually solve anything. Tumblr was slacking big time in keeping their users safe and keeping pedophiles and other disgusting people off of their site for years. I have had tumblr for 7 years and have used it about everyday because I love pictures, but no other site that I’ve ever been on can you accidentally run into illegal porn or dead bodies without having to search for it. We have been asking for years that tumblr’s age of use be moved up to 18+ because of the literally mentally damaging images you can accidentally see. not even mentioning that tumblr does nothing when someone under the age of use is on the site and refuse to delete them even though they are breaking the terms of service. banning adult content isn’t keeping the minors on the site safe because they have already been exposed to this stuff since tumblr has never cared enough to properly filter things and remove abusive and illegal content. Tumblr is not and has never been a safe or family friendly site. I was really hoping apple wouldn’t put tumblr back up and I’m honestly disappointed in the morals of both corporations but then again they’re corporations and don’t listen to what their user want so I’m not exactly shocked."
17,xkittypie,"December 22, 2018",1,"I think it’s awesome that you guys are deleting bad reviews, that you censored most of your own platform, that you ALLOW racists, white supremacy, and hate on your OWN platform. I can’t believe you’ve silenced most of your users, ruined your own app, and STILL HAVENT GOTTEN RID OF THE PORN BOTS!!!! Y’all can go ruin tumblr without me. I’ve had a blog since tumblr was first introduced, and now after a very disappointing week, I’m throwing away a blog that I’ve had since before I started my first period... sad that tumblr doesn’t actually care about its users, just the people who decide if you’re on the App Store or not lol. Notice how plenty of websites aren’t on the App Store but do just fine without it. After a very long run with tumblr, unfortunately they have silenced my only voice. After having a safe space to post WHATEVER I WANT, I get to go back to nothing. So I’d say thank you for the website, but honestly the app has always been extremely glitchy. The app has always sucked, no one ever thought the app worked properly, it’s never been convenient, and not once has it been helpful. The only advantage tumblr had on its competitors is that we could post whatever we want. Now that’s gone, and we have really no reason to use tumblr. Good luck with your self destructive app, and I hope for the children’s sake, that you get rid of the Nazis."
18,Idkhere'saname,"December 25, 2018",1,"Uncaring staff The staff of Tumblr have recently rolled out the censorship of any posts flagged as explicit. While this would be a great way to stop p*dophiliac content, n*zis, and anything else potentially harmful for other users, the system is broken and till this day (december 24th, 2018) continues to flag and censor posts that do not meet the nsfw requirement for being taken out of public viewing. Instead of content that could harm other users, the system-which is completely run by a simple bot not meant to handle this complicated of a task-instead flags posts that fit within the new guidelines. All over the site and app pictures, artwork, text posts, etc have been wrongly censored despite having saw content. Thousands of complaints have gone to staff about this issue, yet they have done nothing to help the user base on Tumblr."
19,jo irwin,"April 27, 2019",2,":( This app is... frustrating on a good day. When everything seems to be functioning properly, it’s fine but that so rarely happens anymore. So many things go wrong on any given day, it’s hard to keep track. Right now, asks seem to be busted for me and several others. We’ve gone through batches of “test asks” to see if they’re sending and receiving properly, after noticing a lack in our normal ask activity. I’ve also noticed a lot of trouble with posts disappearing  after hitting send, not postings at all, connection issues, replies not showing up, and more. Most of this was noticed prior to the update but have shown no improvement after updating. I’ve had numerous issues with the app, especially after the December 2018 update. Please please please take your user base into account in a more interactive and comprehensive way. I’m sure you’re doing your best, but I think it’s time to re-evaluate your tactics. I’ve seen nothing but complaints about user interface for years now (to the point where it’s become a sarcastic joke) and a huge lack of addressing those issues from staff. I can’t see myself not using the app for good, just bc it’s where so much of my own following and work is. But I do frequent it less and less, due to these issues. So only two stars for now. Hoping to bump it up in the future."
20,Jules211111111111110,"September 14, 2017",1,"Awful, don't get it please I've been using this stupid website for 6 years and got the app on my phone some years ago and it's been a pain ever since david karp left and the xkit guy was run off. audios were horrible video playing has generally been horrible. nothing ever loads in a timely fashion even when there's full wifi bars. sometimes when i quick reblog things on my dash, the silhouette of my blog will stay there while i scroll, once this starts there's no end. the silhouettes keep appearing until the stupid app crashes and then you can't use it until tomorrow, even if you restart your phone. stupid app, stupid web developers, shame on you for fixing things that don't need fixing and ignoring ALL of the numerous bugs you have."
21,Riley Wa,"October 18, 2018",1,"A frustrating app to use I’ve been a tumblr user for years, both on desktop and with the app. In recent times I've found myself using the app much more frequently, but that may be changing. Since the beginning, the app has had an issue where it frequently refreshes itself if you switch between apps, which is maddening if you happened to be reading a particular post or enjoying a particular piece of content just to lose it and have to scroll miles back down to find it again. But another feature that is ruining the experience is the recommended blog posts. There is no option to disable this feature other than to individually ‘X’ out of each post as they appear. Between these posts and the ads (which are understandable, as it’s a free app), most of my dash feels cluttered with content I don’t want to see. If I were interested in these recommended blogs, I would seek out and follow them on my own. If there were a way to disable this feature then it wouldn’t be an issue, but unless that becomes an option in the near future, I anticipate my use of the app will slowly dwindle until I don’t use it at all. And because I rarely use the desktop website, I wonder how much longer before I just delete my account altogether."
22,e.zra,"December 16, 2018",1,"The new guidelines are transphobic Exactly what the title says. By banning certain images based on a “female presenting nipple” basically staff get to decide who is a woman and who isn’t. This is one of the few sites where there is so much body positivity to all different types of bodies. This app is used as a source for so many sex workers who depend on their clients. By creating the NSFW ban, they are putting trans sex workers out of work. This isn’t just some ban, to a lot of people, these are their lives. The new guidelines say classical nude statues will not be banned, which translates to only white ppl get to naked? When we create accounts and agree to the 18+ age limit, we are signing up for all of these things. Don’t change the whole app for the sake of making it “child friendly” this new update isn’t bettering the app in any way, it’s destroying the community tumblr has built. The only community that is left now are all the bloggers rallying to protest and leave. If tumblr really wants to make itself better and safer for the community, start flagging the Nazis and pedophiles, don’t create rules with underlying racism and transphobia. These guidelines need to change, and this is NOT the change it needs. And until it does change in the way the tumblr community (not staff, the ACTUAL community) needs it to, do not get this app."
23,ErinaceousM,"December 18, 2018",1,"Crashing and burning I’ve been using Tumblr off and on since 2011. Usually I discontinue use for personal reasons. The user experience has always been terrible and Tumblr is notorious for making changes no one asked for. New “features” are nearly always unnecessary, buggy, or lessen the user experience outright. The recent debacle over censorship is just the latest in a long line of poor choices Tumblr has made to alienate its users and damage its reputation. Consumers are much more conscientious than Tumblr thinks they are and will indeed find somewhere else to spend their time and click on ads. MySpace, Friendster, AOL, Google+, and countless others have gone the way of failed social media platforms and even Facebook is imploding on itself as we speak. This is just going to be the next platform to die the SNS death. Troves of Tumblr users are discussing ways to shift their fan base, client base, and friend base to other sites. A few of these users, who have hundreds of thousands of followers, are the driving force behind Tumblr’s continued viability. Without popular users, Tumblr stops being a place to interact with minor celebrities and becomes an outmoded place to find porn (that is still easily available following the supposed Purge) and Minion memes your mom posted on Facebook last week."

25,Mechromage,"December 27, 2018",1,"A terribly coded and moderated cesspool of Nazis and racism After being removed from the App Store for child pornography, tumblr staff has decided to moderate their platform for the first time by banning all nsfw content. However, “nsfw” content is automatically flagged with a terrible coded and ineffective bot that blocks anything from pictures of Garfield to posts made by the official staff themselves. Meanwhile, pornbots are still rampant on the site and staff has made no attempt to moderate hate speech and extremism despite YEARS of complaint. It is easier to find Nazis on tumblr than it is to find a picture of a black person. Tumblr doesn’t care or listen to their user base while actively promoting racism, extremism, and genocide."
26,EventideReverie,"December 29, 2018",1,"Horrible Management This website does not care about its userbase—only its own image. When the website gives examples of allowed content that could be viewed as explicit (such as breastfeeding women, ladies protesting while topless, and surgery images), it flagged the examples on the staff’s own posts on the matter. Preferring to flag first and then examine later, as sort of ‘guilty until proven innocent’ policy on adult content. At one point, you could bypass the bots searching for adult content from pornbots by tagging your posts with #sfw, and the pornbots swiftly took to doing so to avoid getting taken down. They briefly censored some of the minor tags with adult content but I have other, more popular tags, avoid being locked away from view even when those tags had way more pornographic content to sfw content than the censored tags. Everything I have said so far is factual, and I have seen it happen. I am not exaggerating or lying."
27,Elastas,"January 4, 2019",1,"Is Tumblr a Good App? Once. Amidst all the screaming and can't evens it was a nice app. It did what it was supposed to do. You could run multiple blogs for different purposes and share things with your friends. Then they said they were ""making tumblr a safe place for all audiences"". Which it was as long as the artists and bloggers, the dedicated users who usually did, tagged their content to keep the roadstops clearly marked. Parental supervision belongs to the parents. Your image was already tarnished by the cesspool of thought-police and angry hormonal 16 year olds taking to the site to voice their displeasure with different opinions. But it still persisted because of a loyal fanbase that liked your product. "
28,Camy T.,"February 4, 2019",1,"TONS of problems The NSFW ban in December did very little to fix the actual problem that users had with porn bots who are still everywhere on the site. In addition, blogs that post things advocating for Nazism and racism are still allowed on the site yet “female presenting nipples” are not. Tell me how that makes any sense. Not to mention with the NSFW ban they have severely crippled artists who use tumblr to get their art out and gain commissions and now they’ve limited text posts to only 100 word blocks and stopped posts with links from being shown in tags which affects the very large community of fic writers on the site. With these things, they’ve alienated almost every one of their users and made it clear that they care very little about the actual feedback that they receive from said users as evidenced by these new updates and the purely flippant way they address the emails that they receive from users that have very real concerns. As someone who has used the site for years, I’m honestly saddened to say that the way tumblr has been run since yahoo acquired it has made me and many others entertain the idea of simply leaving the site and never looking back. Something needs to be done to fix the site or else they may just run it into the ground themselves."

I ended up deleting it because I never really got on it, I was busy and it was taking up room. So I tried creating a new account today said my email was in use, fine use another I have like six. All of them were in use! I’ve NEVER had it before until literally a few months ago(“last year”)! So when I try to SIGN IN it say NO ACCOUNT WITH THIS EMAIL!!! What the hell is going on?? I do not understand??? I just wanted to look at peoples art and an article that was on twitter😭😭😭 I’m so confused it keeps doing this I deleted it again and I’m gonna try to reinstall this is not what I was hoping for. I’m sorry I’m having issues trying to sign in. Also it does nothing when I say I forgot password, it just takes me back to the sign in screen when I click the email it sends me.

And that's assuming they even display usernames correctly - sometimes it shows people who only liked posts under reblogs and I find nothing at all. And it doesn't even show reblog comments separately!! So if a post gets more than 4 notes there is no way to see comments in your notes. This might seem like a small thing, but being able to see who is interacting with your posts is essential to using this site.  Not being able to see when people at reblog comments is especially bad because it prevents conversion, feedback, & interactions. And I have to waste a stupid amount of time just to figure out which of my posts are getting notes. This has removed all the community feel I had and despite still getting notes I basically feel I am screaming into the void now with no simple way to see what my followers are sharing, what they like, or what they're trying to say back to me."
31,JosieFFFF,"July 19, 2018",2,Great stuff. Horrible app. I honestly LOVE Tumblr. It's so much fun and there's so much to see. But this app is driving me insane. It's actually made me cry more than once. I have had this app for many years and it has always crashed. And I don't mean every once in a while you're pretty much crashes about 20 to 30 times a day for me. Making it pretty much impossible to see anything. I try to update to see if that helps and it never ever helps. I don't think I can be on Tumblr for more than 20 minutes without it crashing. Sometimes the worst part is ample today I was on it for two minutes and it crashed I went back on there and then after about five minutes I crashed again and then minutes without it crashing. Sometimes the worst part is ample today I was on it for two minutes and it crashed I went back on there and then after about five minutes I crashed again. It's super frustrating when I'm looking at something or I am in a specific place and then it crashes and then I can't find where I was before.
32,Ashton Claire,"December 17, 2018",4,"It's the Hotel California of social media There's many reasons you could find Not to get this app/make an account. From the porn bots who put random links on your posts about Spider-Man to the way you never know if it's actually gonna load anything or delete your account for any given reason staff can find. But biggest thing to note or advice on is I give on this would have to be to run. Hit that back button. Swing left. Hit the arrow. Leave this page because when you join Tumblr you never leave. Forget anything good about Tumblr and just save yourself. I've been on it for almost a decade and I yet can't get myself to delete my account or even log out on my phone. Please at least know that you are selling your soul to staff and I've never seen anyone truly leave. It's fun to see people grow and change with you though. Go through movie franchise and T.V shows progression together. See funny videos and news from around the world. No matter who you are, you will find your people. You will find your place on here. Maybe that's why its so hard to leave."

Not only have you destroyed something that has become a safe place for many groups that desperately needed it, you have also managed to alienate a majority of your users by choosing an app over the wants and desires of the people who would be using the app. Did it ever occur to any of you that, just maybe, we aren’t the issue and that you should have tried to attack the actual problem instead of taking this ridiculous “no tolerance” stance? Why should the majority be punished for the actions of the minority? And the issue is your own fault! If you were actually able to find a bot that worked, it would never have come to this. Hell, you still can’t make a bot that works considering how many porn blogs that are still fully accessible, but my blog has been flagged for content despite having no explicit media of any kind. I post pictures of my dogs, and that’s pretty much it. So tell me, what exactly did your new rules achieve?

They still allow nazis and white supremacist to use the app. They are doing a terrible job and just allowing tumblr to become a joke (seriously, everyone everywhere is making fun of how terrible the app is, even people ON the app). I get it, tumblr is supposed to be the place where you can just put out anything and be accepted and not have to worry about social constructs or anything. You can be as edgy, aesthetic, whatever roots your horn on tumblr. You can find safe communities to talk about your difficulties, being part of the lgbtq+ community, anything. But tumblr still allows perverts, nazis, white supremacists, homophobic people, basically everything terrible, but you won’t allow nsfw. It’s perfectly fine, just make people aware that they have to have a sensitivity thing or warning or something instead of just causing many people to lose their media platforms.

36,SuddenSparkles,"December 22, 2018",4,Tumblr features fresh original youthful innovative content I’m not a tech nerd so my comments in this review are limited to content. Also I’m not on Tumblr that much but sometimes I wish to escape from the repetitive content found on other platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Facebook I rarely use. I think the market niche of a social media application is important but that trying to be all things to all people can be a mistake (and not just online but in real life (#IRL) too!) and so I applaud Tumblr for outlining its community standards policy in a way that is full disclosure and not being sly about things like the other better-known entities. I’m still learning the app but the content is largely dependent on who you follow. If you want quality content choose your “friends” wisely! There’s a great deal of quality but one of the greatest concerns it seems to me is quality control and artistic rights ownership of content and protection. I’m not sure that’s an issue that is easily addressed here but it’s the ultimate Roman Colosseum in many ways. Throw out the content and watch it get “chewed up.”
37,gravitygemjj,"January 31, 2019",1,"Still upset I made a review earlier about how mad and disappointed I am in the NSFW ban—which I’m still upset about, but I’m here to review another issue. Tumblr just changed their color scheme to be a bit darker—which for me isn’t a big deal. HOWEVER, for others it is. Depending on the impairment, people have either gotten either better or worse from these changes. Worse as in some have gotten in the seizure zone. Which is never a good zone. But like I said, some have gotten better. Thing is though, tumblr has once again denied users of choice. It’d be better if they made the change an option so people could choose what they prefer and what is actually healthier for them. Instead of taking care of the real problems—like the literal nazis and white supremacists on this website/app, tumblr changes their shade of blue to a slightly darker shade of blue. Revolutionary. Really. Oh wait, I’m being sarcastic. Ha. So, anyway, I—among MANY users would appreciate it if you got rid of the real problems on this website/app. Your tiny change is not enough and not a step in the right direction. Fix your bugs. Undo the ban. Clean your mess. Give us options. Be considerate. Do better. Start listening to your users—before there’s none of us left."

They’re claiming they’ve made the site more accessible, but they seem to be forgetting that not every disabled person had the same needs. Not that tumblr has actually ever cared about any of its users that aren’t pedophiles or actual Nazis. Tumblr has been deleting people for no reason since before their Dec 17th ban, and they have admitted that when people try to regain access to their accounts. They claim it’s an accident, but let’s be real no one believes that. The recent ban has targeted the disabled and LGBTQ communities whether they admit it or not. This is not the first time the site developers have targeted these communities. They’ve locked the tags for any type of minority group, but they keep the porn tags open and well maintained. They claim that they're just trying to prevent sex trafficking, yet they keep the blogs that post literal child porn and advocate for the murders of disabled, LGBTQ, Black and Brown people. The developers for the tumblr app and site claim that they’re making the site more enjoyable for everyone, as long as everyone is straight, able bodied, and white."

One thing that’s always bugged me though is that I can never see when a post has been posted or reblogged. This is kinda frustrating when trying to tell what blogs are active and which haven’t been active for upwards of a year. I’ve had multiple cases of blogs that I love becoming inactive while I was away from the site, and also cases where I see a blog that I like and I follow them, only for them to never post again because it turns out their most recent post/reblog was actually made a year ago and I just couldn’t tell because there wasn’t a time stamp for the post."

After resetting the password it’s fine until I use another app. I don’t even close out of Tumblr and yet the moment I move to Music and change my song, Tumblr decides to begin the process over again. 13 passwords later, and I’m more than a little ticked off at this point.

Basically, to put it in simple words, I can’t view my notifications or scroll. At all. And when I somehow manage to fix it it’s by a series of random steps like switching blogs’ notification tabs, then switching back again. And on top of that, when it actually works it is so much more inefficient than the previous system. I enjoyed looking through my notifications and seeing what my mutuals reblogged and then looking at the tags on what they reblogged but now mutuals and nonmutuals are grouped together under one post so that I can’t easily tell if a mutual reblogged or interacted with my post. And when I click to view the group of people who interacted with my post I can no longer touch the tab and be automatically taken to that post on my mutual’s blog to see their tags. I really dislike this. It feels like necessary features that improved my experience were taken away."

43,averysadboi,"December 17, 2018",1,"Really bad Ignoring real problems with the app and user base to focus on ad revenue by sweeping anything they would consider nsfw out the door. Nice job blocking many, many innocuous posts, especially those from lgbtq+ communities and for some reason those dealing with chronic illnesses are not allowed to speak. Nobody is foolish enough to think tumblr actually cares about being a better community. If that were the case, you could have started with the rampant bot problem that STILL persists, or maybe the hate groups that are everywhere. Your app is still buggy and broken, just from a technical standpoint instead of a content one. It crashes frequently, for all manner of reasons. Sometimes just trying to refresh the home page crashes the entire app. I cannot search tags on my own completely sfw page. The bot deployed to find nsfw images was clearly either completely untrained or minimally trained to detect the nsfw images, as images of text posts were even being flagged despite being sfw. Of course any visual detecting bot is going to have trouble distinguishing, but that’s a lot. "
44,Linzerj,"December 18, 2018",1,"Tumblr doesn’t really care about its users The old system for filtering nsfw content worked fine. When used correctly, the sensitive content toggle and nsfw tag were enough to keep minors from accessing adult content. The problem comes when Tumblr staff refuses to listen to its users about issues such as porn bots and neo-nazis running rampant on this hellsite. Porn bots don’t tag and follow everyone and continuously spam other people’s content, and yet with this ban they’re still here. Furthermore, unfiltered neo-nazi propaganda is arguably just as harmful to minors on the site as other nsfw content, yet tumblr has never made any move to remove these toxic people. The decline of tumblr really began when Yahoo and Verizon took over, so a big 🖕 to you for wanting to keep your site “pure” but not actually listening to users and enacting such a discriminatory and overall stupid ban."

Thus not providing that information to the people who were voicing their concerns to begin with. I know that there were multiple users who were working on creating platforms that would be a better service than tumblr for they would not censor anyone. It is appalling to me that in spite of them hearing about porn bots, nazis (hate speech) and pedophiles they attempted to fix this problem by not removing those aspects but instead censoring artists  for the first week and half and then backpedaling after its users staged a revolt. If there are any business executives who are reading these please DO NOT network with Tumblr or its affiliates. Censorship isn’t business, its immoral."

With the implementation of the ban of pornographic material on this website, Tumblr has condemned legitimate sex workers, artists, writers, the LGBTQIA community, the chronically ill, and all others who came for the creative freedom of expression to a place that no longer welcomes any of us. But sure, keep up with leaving the Nazi propagandist and nationalist blogs up and free to spout hate and vitriol against minorities. Do absolutely nothing about the porn bot blog spam. The ban of pornographic content has done nothing but exacerbate the original problems that millions of Tumblr users have complained to the staff about for years. Tumblr has always been a shoddy website from a programming aspect and this app is proof of that. However, they kept a loyal user base of artists because they weren’t censored. Until now. And now, Tumblr is paying for it. Thousands have migrated wholly to Pillowfort, Twitter, and other various social medias in an attempt to regain their loyal followings from their heyday of Tumblr. And if something doesn’t happen to fix this issue, they’ll continue to lose users."

49,What the f89,"July 22, 2019",1,"Disappointed To be honest, I like the concept of tumblr and I like seeing tumblr posts on Instagram so I gave it a try, but I couldn’t really get the hang of it. It’s one of those sites where I feel like you have to be an OG or really good at navigation. I like all the features on it and SOME of the little remarks when something doesn’t load or show up or anything of that kind. But the main reason I downloaded it was for a comfortable and accepting place for things NSFW type content where I would feel safe viewing. I was unaware about the whole banning thing. What happened to “go nuts, show nuts?” Making Tumblr a better site is what you should’ve done instead of banning a whole community of people. And when I searched up NSFW there was a little snarky remark about not “getting” it and it was kind of a punch to my insecurities, not gonna lie. Because NSFW content is kind of like a type of art and if you kick someone down for liking it then aren’t you a bully? Just saying. And I feel like you should also gain some common sense about banning popular content after losing a ton of your users. Anyways filter better, do better, bring back NSFW. Or die out. We’ll find out soon i guess."

Don’t like nsfw etc you can actually block all posts with the hashtag nsfw you can block any and as many hashtags you want so you don’t have to see things that trigger you etc yes if something’s trending and you see that someone says something you don’t agree with oh well that’s life but this app is way better than any social media imo I deleted my Facebook twitter Instagram Snapchat and kept tumblr bc it’s just happy kawaii things that make me smile and I can post my art and not feel the need to get lots of notes and the pressure I felt on other social media you will find and discover yourself on this app it’s just simply amazing!

It was a simple touch that would take you to their reblog and then you could hit the arrow to go back to your notes for the post and scroll to the next user that reblogged your post. That isn’t the case anymore. Now, every time you click on a reblog, a menu pops up and you have to hit “View Reblog” and then when you hit the arrow to go back, it starts you back at the top of your notes instead of where you left off. Which can get really frustrating if I have hundreds of notes to scroll through and have to scroll to the spot I left off EVERY TIME and then hit a menu just to view an addition a person may or may not have added to a post. This is really frustrating as there was no need for this random menu addition or to reset the user at the top of the notes. Please just fix it and return it to the old system?

Verizon should be ashamed of themselves for saying they support minority groups, yet take away the platform in which they felt accepted and part of a community. Tumblr helped me realize being gay was acceptable and allowed me to discover different kinks I didn’t even know I liked. Where is this community now? I suppose something new will pop up and allow tumblr’s banned users a new platform to feel accepted and part of something again. Until then, tumblr is a huge disappointment and feels no different than a dictator attempting to censor and kill off a population they wish didn’t exist. Sorry, folks, people have sex, are gay, enjoy various different ways of thinking, and need a place to call home and feel together. Tumblr was a place where I learned about sex ed for the first time, as my school did not cover those topics. For the sake of humanity, I hope a new platform comes soon. Tumblr is dead.

54,B-Hodge,"December 17, 2018",1,"Smh I understand what they are trying to do but the way they are going about it is just wrong. Of course child porn is bad and should not be allowed but that does not mean they guys have to start hiding all adult content, that is like putting out a candle with a fire hose; it’s just excessive. What they should do is target the problem at hand and work on improving their algorithm and other methods they use to screen illegal content such as child porn, so it is more effective; that is literally what other social networking sites do and it’s proven to be very effective. By hiding all adult content they are hurting themselves (as I cannot imagine this is having any net positive effect for you guys just based on the public’s reactions over the past month and especially today), upsetting a lot of people, destroying the time and work people have put into developing their blogs, and ruining not only people’s enjoyment but for some a source of income.

HOWEVER their filtration algorithm for said content is an absolute joke. Users primary issues were NOT with general NSFW content posted by artists, but with the rampant and ridiculous number for porn bots and spam bots on the site. Just as well, the site has major issues with Nazi/white supremacy blogs, as well as CP; NONE of these issues have been addressed or resolved by this new terms update, even though blogs and content such as this poses the most threat to user safety. Furthermore, this new half-assed algorithm they’ve chosen to ‘flag’ NSFW content doesn’t even work. I still see porn bots and spam all over my dashboard, in my inbox, and in my followers list. In fact, it’s even gone up in frequency since this new update. Ultimately this was a slap-dash non-effort on staff’s part to resolve an “issue” that wasn’t even an issue to begin with, and completely ignores the actual safety breaches and user comfortability problems this site has had for years.

An NSFW ban can really destroy an artist’s livelihood by not allowing their art to be seen by potential commissioners, and when it affects more than just NSFW art, you know it’s a problem. Your system flags art that is skin colored, even if the art itself doesn’t even feature “female presenting nipples” (and how dumb as that phrase?). Not only are you hiding artists from potential buyers, but you haven’t even gotten rid of the problem areas of tumblr. Literal nazis are using your website, but have not been purged from it in anyway. Bots of all kind plague every corner of your site, but you have done nothing to destroy them. Actual pedophiles have active accounts. How are you claiming to be “family friendly” when people like that are on your site? How can you claim that, when blogs about positivity are marked as NSFW and blogs preaching hate are allowed to roam free? Banning NSFW is not the answer, but it’s what you’ve chosen, because you’re hungry for money. And the ban doesn’t even work, so that really shows how well your team is. Happy holidays ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

It has become pointless to continue putting effort into running a tumblr blog for my art, since posts are getting flagged and hidden.. even if no censor regulations have been broken. And we are told to report incorrect flags, but when we do report posts, staff responds with “have you tried reporting it for review.” Tumblr had numerous problems, and was justifiably removed from the App Store. In their desperation to get back in, they did the equivalent of placing a bandaid on a finger to heal internal bleeding. The problems are still rampant, but now they can say they are “fixing” them, so it’s all good. ((Also, the term “female-presenting nipples” is obtuse to begin with.

I log out to sign into another blog, then attempt to log back into my main, only to be rejected and kept out of my own account. And I guarantee you, my password and/or email are not wrong! My password has always been the same, working on desktop and other platforms, so it’s not me being a ditz and forgetting it. Nothing is entered incorrectly, and yet it won’t let me sign in. It takes multiple attempts, clearing my app history, repeat. I’ve had to delete and reinstall this app so many times to attempt to fix this simple glitch.

Porn on Tumblr is something Verizon needs to wipe out if it’s going to  make any money off what it thinks is actually valuable about the  platform — enormous fandom and social justice communities that, just  before the Verizon acquisition, Khalaf was insisting the staff figure  out how to better monetize. Two former Tumblr employees said they were alarmed when Khalaf chose  Black Lives Matter as an example of a community that the company should  focus on converting into Yahoo media consumers. One told The Verge,  “Simon explicitly said that Black Lives Matter was an opportunity to  [make] a ton of money.”"
65,nax-zela,"December 18, 2018",1,"A great site that turned lazy and greedy Tumblr, since its creation, had been a place for those 17+ (the age STILL lasted on the App Store) to enjoy content with fellow adults. To this day, even with the influx of minors that should not be allowed, people make sure that their content is appropriately tagged so everyone can have a safe and happy experience. But because Tumblr actively chose to ignore its user’s complaints about porn bots, pedophiles, and their too loose policies, they’re creating policies that don’t work, don’t make sense, and aren’t fair to the ACTUAL age group and demographic they’re apparently meant for. I still have at least 160 followers that are just porn bots and that’s because I’ve given up blocking and reporting them. "

67,Ninjafrost09,"December 18, 2018",1,"Most recent update ruined the entire experience Tumblr once made itself a staple social media platform by catering to the niche communities of fandoms and creative artists that other major platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram never did. The moment they made the site unwelcoming with a sudden change in their ToS, the atmosphere changed- artistic expression became restricted, blogs were either accidentally or purposefully removed, loss of major creators leaving for better platforms- all for the chance to cater for a middle/high school audience and mimic the larger platforms I mentioned at the start. By trying to become your basic social media platform, they lost what made them unique in the first place and what made them a preferred site over FB/Twit/Insta for many years. All there is left are repetitive memes, shallow safe art works, and a totally censored site that wishes to divorce the imagery of sex and sexuality from the spontaneity and randomness of normal average life. If you want to use tumblr, don’t expect any different content from what you will find on every other major social media platform in the future. That is their goal after all."

I can go on, but all in all, you guys messed up a lots of people’s lives and yourself when YOU DECIDED to put out a bot that was not programmed correctly and ready to get ride of actual problematic posts. You should have taken the time to correctly program your bot so it can get rid of the ACTUAL PROBLEM you guys had. Now a lot of people’s hard work over countless years is gone! Their hard work and posts has been deleted. NSFW communities have been destroyed. Your view counts and traffic counts have decreased since you banned NSFW content. Did you think we were joking when we said that we were leaving if you went through with the ban? Just update your bot please? CORRECTLY this time. And bring back everyone’s accounts that were effected by the ban. Again, you ruined people’s lives. Hope you are proud of what you did to your own company. Hope you are proud...🙄🙄🙄"

This is because once a week I have to go through and block all of the porn bots that have followed me. I literally block at least 10 per week. My blog is not popular by any means and I never reblog nsfw content. It’s a Voltron fandom blog and yet I’m finding myself getting follows from these bots with obscene (and sometimes triggering) content plastered all over.

The conversation moves upward to the top but it visually remains a as the the conversation that should be knocked down. Notifications come in regarding notes or comments yet when I check they don’t appear despite constant refreshing. And now at times when I scroll down completely and it buffers for a bit to retrieve older feed it’ll completely refresh and send me back to the top of my feed. It’s utterly frustrating.

Nazi’s, pedophiles, etc. roam the site with little to no repercussions, but people who post nonoffensive suggestive or NSFW material are punished for posting “female presenting nipples,” no one is being hurt by these blogs and yet tumblr decides to enact a widespread deletion (or snap) of all the NSFW blogs and instate a new, barely functioning, algorithm.

I don’t mind ads but the ads are super inappropriate, I don’t know what yahoo was thinking. And I can understand the nsfw ban as it’s a bit more trendy with other apps even though I technically don’t agree, however, it still has room show the actual bad, triggering posts that gets made all the time. The algorithm of reports is horrible. You can never get in contact with anyone and most of the time they are just like, “sorry looks like there is nothing we can do :/.” The actual layout doesn’t really make too much sense and it makes it so hard to see who you are following/are who is following you. I think there should at least be a search engine like every other app. Lastly, tumblr has one of the best tagging system but it’s underutilized. We should be able to put in certain tags that we do not want to see. Especially since there is a problem with triggering things. I just can’t believe this is where we are at.

The only reason I updated was in hopes that the crashing problem was resolved.

I block these accounts and report them to the staff under the categories of inappropriate content and fraud, but nothing has changed. I LOVE TUMBLR, I never want to see it go. So many people use this site to express themselves in ways they don’t feel comfortable doing on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Tumblr truly is, or used to be, an internet treasure, but these porn-not accounts are no secret, they aren’t hiding, if staff even LOOKED at any of these accounts it’s very obvious what they are. But they don’t care enough to look. They don’t care about us, they care about money. They could fix the bot problem if they gave us, the users, the power to report the bots specifically instead of trying to report them for “fraud”. We want to help.

We still can’t change our blog URLs through mobile. App crashes. No easier way to alternate between accounts with different emails. If Twitter can do it, so can y’all. Also you’ve made a really unnecessary change to adding tags, it’s really a bother to go through the process just to tap and tag a post. Not sure why the layout in general was ever changed. Devs add in little unnecessary changes that didn’t need to be made. Also, where’s the time stamps on posts? And messages? And this website STILL hasn’t fixed the issue with bots, I’m constantly reviving messages and follows from them, it’s annoying to deal with.

84,"Very, Very Tired.","December 13, 2018",1,"Terrible tech handling Tumblr has a slew of developmental problems from an IT perspective, but the cherry on top is the new nsfw content filter. It has a flagging system that appears to be by a bot that seems to randomly pick what is “inappropriate” and what is not. You can submit posts for review, but the reviewer is *also* a bot so you can have a completely nude man go under the radar while a bowl of mushrooms gets flagged for inappropriate content. Not to mention how in their new terms it allows for nudity in terms of art, medical, or educational conduits. Then I saw a lovely post that talked about a tattoo shop that helped people with scars on their chest get over the trauma by having art done over the scars. It was a medical, art based, and educational post, but the bot flagged it as nsfw, it was submitted for review, then the *review* bot said it didn’t follow their new terms. And I’m not even going to touch the cesspool of hate speech based blogs that flagrantly go against “a better and safer tumblr.”"

When we asked them to do something they did nothing. They only did something when they were kicked off the App Store, but what they decided to do was to blanket ban any NSFW content. The issue is, the bot they are using is completely ineffective. Porn blogs can tag their stuff as SFW and the bot ignores them. Art that isn’t anything near NSFW is getting flagged, the artists’ blogs are being muted and the review process doesn’t actually involve a human so innocuous pictures of cats stay flagged. Also, any posts related to the LGBT community is automatically flagged, no matter what the content actually entails. This is straight up homophobic. "

But now those blogs are being threatened by a continuing series of utterly useless and pathetically executed new rules and guidelines on Tumblr’s part. First, the so-called porn ban. This ban is carried out by an algorithm that cannot tell sand dunes from actual female bodies. The staff expects this algorithm to work, yet their own post showng acceptable images was flagged by their algorithm. And the supposed intention of this ban, the elimination of rampant child pornography on the website and app, is... well, it’s not working. Instead, sex workers and artists are being driven off the app. This leaves people like me, who came for the nerds and stayed for the nerds and other wholesome blogs, to contend with rampant Nazism, white supremacy blogs, and the endless stream of porn bots who just change up how they do things to get what they want.

The issues are almost too many to count and the staff has shown that they don’t consider it important enough to actually fix. They’d rather piece together a barely-functional bot to flag posts as explicit when a good deal of the time they aren’t. Tumblr needs to get it’s act together and start working to make their platform what it should be if they want to keep the users they have left after the idiotic porn ban. They need to stop trying to make Tumblr breast-free and ‘safe for kids’ (which it was never meant to be, the app itself says 17+) and start actually doing something to get rid of the pedophiles, nazis, white supremacists and pornbots that are still posting away without a care.

But know with the censorship you are not only getting rid of a majority or fandoms and the people who provide content for the fandoms, but also creativity as well. Nsfw art and other things that y’all deem wrong still effected the art world in a sfw way. Many find inspiration and ideas from others art and transform it. With many artists being nsfw if you can’t even get in their account or see their work it’s useless. You have killed creativity and therefore have killed the fandoms. I see no new stuff, my dash is dry, there’s no one here! The only reason I still go on this app is because this is the only place that has the more random and less popular fandoms.

The app used to work perfectly fine, with the group of people who complained about not being able to post images on reblogs I understand the need to change that but along with this change came many more that were unnecessary and bothersome. First: the biggest complaint I have is the tags, before you could press the reblog button and easily add tags and continue on. It was simple and honestly one of the best parts of the app. However with one of the latest updates it opens a separate page for tags and takes a lot more time to do than before. Second: you can view when someone is online, not only is this annoying especially for people who are on but don't want to be bothered but it puts people who have run into toxic people at risk while using the app and site, you can see if someone is online even if you aren't following them.

I’m not sure if anyone else has experience this problem, but it would be great if it gets fixed. I just want new content and I want my feed to be in chronological order. Also the random posts that show up in my timeline from people I don’t follow nor want to follow?? I use tumblr specifically for what I personally want to see. Not to see other people’s stuff that I have no interest in. And it’s not just one or two posts.

The suggested blogs I keep seeing on my feed or incredibly annoying and not anything close to the types of things I normally follow. Tumblr needs to acknowledge the adult users rather than the small percentage of children. Make the app more adult friendly and stop catering to the minority. Safe mode is nonsense and a giant hinderance when trying to share posts even privately to my husband. I swear I constantly have to check my settings and ensure that safe mode is turned off because it somehow always turns back on I guess after every crappy update.

Those women beating, women are only for your harem type ads that for SOME REASON are popular with companies) every four posts isn’t worth your time. All in all, in you’re looking for a well running, good looking app that the creators listen to feed back and make changes that are actually good and beneficial to all than look no further...than any other site because tumblr has none of those things going for it and probably won’t be around in a year because of how stupid they are.

And when I tried going on safari to the Tumblr website to request the desktop site, that didn’t work either.

I think they are not at all what is going to make Tumblr “a better place” for anyone. But I never write reviews and I needed to because the new update has made the app the ugliest I think it has ever been. The contrast between the white posts and the dark background is blinding. My brightness on my screen isn’t even up that high. The font as well is not appealing. It should be something basic and easy to look at. I have been primarily a mobile user because its just more convenient, but I’m switching to desktop so I can get the xkit extension that reverts the dashboard to the way it was before. Basically Tumblr has lost the charm it had back in the day, but of course no one is actually leaving, so it will continue to go downhill and we’ll all complain about it but very few people will actually jump ship. I suppose because no one wants to care that much about a platform that doesn’t care about us."

After a very crude and sloppy attempt to slash through all the NSFW content on the site, not only is it still NSFW anyway but it took down numerous perfectly appropriate SFW posts with it. Many of the users simply left, and blogs that remain look like wastelands with half of their posts like censored closed caskets, completely unviewable and gone forever. Despite the fact that the majority of users are over the age of 18, the staff has chosen to treat all of its users as children and allows zero accessibility to any of the content that they deemed “inappropriate”, regardless of the users actual age. Not only did this not fix the issue of ridding the site of porn bots, it also failed to effectively distance minors from any of the NSFW content that still remains. There is even still readily available access to blogs that can have a very negative influence on impressionable minor. All it really succeeded in doing was take away much of the sites character."

Conversely, it MIGHT post... five times in rapid succession to flood your blog, typically with all of your commentary removed. And now the cherry on top of it all is that no matter how many times I log out and log back in, I STILL get an error message telling me I should try logging back in again so that I can use the app at all.

It’s sad cause it’s not just porn or something to jack off to, it’s a way to bring awareness and normalize sexuality and difference bodies. A way to help people feel more comfortable in their own skin  because of the vastly different shapes sizes and colors of bodies and faces on this site. For some it’s a way to pay their bills and to keep food on the table and to support the people that depend on them. For some it’s simply a way for people with different likes and interest to find a community of others like them so they don’t feel so alone. Please note that we asks for nazis and pedophiles off this sight, tumblr ignored the problem until it grew so big they decided to take the easy way out and ban everything good and helpful about the sight."

The most recent is their ban of “adult content,” and yet the incompetence of their AI system has made the problem even worse.  Completely innocent posts are being flagged and many blogs are falsely labeled as explicit and hidden from search results.  Some blogs have even been deleted entirely for no reason while porn bots continue to run rampant.  The bots were able to bypass the AI by simply tagging all their posts as “#sfw” instead of “#nsfw,” which just proves how little effort Staff put in.  Regardless of whether you agree with the ban or not, a larger problem stems from their refusal to ban the many, many nazi and white supremacist accounts/blogs present on the website.  It goes without saying that when “female-presenting nipples” are a greater offense than genocide, the priorities of those in charge need to be re-evaluated."

Tumblr shouldn’t have the choice to force someone into Safe Mode because they are younger than 18. We should have that choice and if the younger get in trouble because of that, then they must live and go with the consequences. It’s completely absurd that a 17 year old can’t be able to choose anymore and it made me so sad because I am a fan girl at heart and now, there are things on tumblr that I can’t see anymore!

But, even then, who knows if the post will actually go through. Since I have started again this semester I have already missed my first blog grade because tumble quietly didn’t successfully post it, never told me, and then when I opened it back up a week later, of course the notification that it didn’t upload just disappeared (why would I need a connection to a post that didn’t get posted?!

Yahoo, Verizon, Tumblr, everyone involved are ruining the site/etc are completely censoring valid users while letting the disgusting hate blogs flourish. It was never the nsfw content that was ruining Tumblr, but the staffs lack of competency towards actually keeping disgusting content off tumblr (aka what started this; pedos).

All the purge has done is target users who are content creators, marking their blogs as NSFW when they are safe and requiring each falsely accused person to manually go through their entire blog to find flagged posts (usually inaccurately) to make individual appeals to the already overtaxed Tumblr staff. Since the purge I have had 27 porn bots follow my account and have seen at least 12 content creators make a statement about leaving the site to go someplace else because their blog was incorrectly marked as NSFW. Tumblr’s algorithm for catching issues is so bad that it has marked every single post staff made about the purge as flagged for inappropriate content.

153,Honeyfromastone,"December 23, 2018",1,"No longer a valuable place to be When they banned adult content on December 17, they banned it in such an ineffective way that people are scared to post anything. Posts of cats and deserts and runway models are being flagged as explicit. People who have never posted explicit content have had their blogs flagged and hidden from view. Certain people have had their posts, photos, and links deleted, again, even when there is nothing explicit in its content. The staff keeps telling us the filters will get smarter, but they are certainly not smart enough, and do not seem to be better. Many people have left. Maybe 60% of my dashboard is still active."
154,Cat Comander,"December 29, 2018",1,"Listen to the users Honestly, tumblr places an overall ban on anything that was preventing them from being in the AppStore. This app has been a safe place and has actually helped a lot of people find information in topics that either acclaimed in a bad way or hardly explained at all in real life (such as sex, periods, sex between same sex, healthy relationships/getting out of toxic situations). It’s ban on all “female presenting nipples” goes against what many users posted as some did commissions (art) for money as well as banning anything tagged as top surgery. Also, you can literally just search up Nazi, white supremacy, and other terms and find blogs dedicated to them while some blogs talking about transitioning and chronic pain/illness is banned. What the hell, staff? I know there are child porn problems, but maybe hiring people to actually GO THROUGH and delete these things, as well as those account bans, would work out better than just banning anything tagged specifically as NSFW. Its rather silly."

156,duchessrider99,"December 30, 2018",1,"Didn’t solve anything The new ban on nsfw has done absolutely nothing but cause a big mess! Regardless of if something posted is sfw, it’s still at high risk of being flagged as nsfw by the programmed scanners. The main issue was the porn bots that were all over tumblr but this ban hasn’t affected them much if at all! So many of the accounts I follow completely left tumblr, have been shadow banned for posting sfw posts and having them flagged wrongly, or have gone out guns blazing knowing they’d be affected. So many users that have been banned used to use tumblr as a platform to promote their personal business and share some of their work but can no longer do so."
157,Flynntus,"December 31, 2018",1,"Censorship The blatantly obvious incompetence that the staff of this website display is disgusting and clearly disconnected from the user base. They have time and time again refused to make changes that users want and instead force changes they think will make it better, often without notification or choice. Recently with the mass censorship, hundreds of artists who had used this platform as a base for their business have been shut down, while those spouting real hate, racism, and fascism are allowed to continue to spout their message. This is an unacceptable change and I would never recommend this app or platform to anyone until its problems are fixed. That being said. This platform has potential and has the ability to redeem itself. With a more advanced filter and communication with its users, I can really see it becoming a form of media to rival twitter and Instagram like it used to. Tumblr needs to reevaluate its choices and fix the mistakes it has made before it fails."

(Also, the mobile website for tumblr is awful. They have engineered it to redirect you to the app, or force you to download it if you have not.) That being said, it could have some improvements. The largest annoyance for me is when you are listening to music on your phone and you want to watch a video on Tumblr. You have to manually restart your music after you exit the video instead of it automatically un-pausing. Using control center to do this is easy enough, but not ideal. Content loading, such as video buffering, on a slower connection is far from ideal as well."

And yes, I have triple-checked that both my tumblr and iphone settings have the correct configurations and should be working properly.

In doing so they have harmed artists who produce such content, flagged posts that are completely safe, removed blogs that have never posted anything relatively NSFW, and even flagged THEIR OWN POST as NSFW. This sort of content has never been an issue on Tumblr and yet it’s being demonized. The real issues that we’ve all been begging and begging for something to happen to are spambots, pornbots, disgusting ads, literal NAZIS, pedophiles, etc. The list goes on and on and on. Yet the staff makes it more and more clear with each update that we do not matter. This app and the site are for profit and not people. It’s heartbreaking because I used to love this place but lately it feels more and more torturous to even attempt to blog at this point. The only reason I’ve stayed so long is because there’s no alternative like it. It’s a shame."

However when I log in I see a whole bunch of fighting that appears to be happening between tumblr and the users who want to participate. The format of the site seems to have changed and it’s LESS usable and effective, and It looks like tumblr saw a problem and decided to correct it by taking a good principal and shoving it aggressively down peoples throats in a controversial and frankly idiotic manner. I’m disappointed. I logged on for good content, and I’m logging off because of the pointless bickering with the users and staff, the pettiness at trying to be over controlling and flagging every stupid little thing, and the fact that it seems everything interesting has just been dumbed down into nothing at all. Going back to Pinterest. Everybody just needs to chill. I mean yeah lay down some ground rules but for Gods sake stop being stuck up and over-the-top about it."

This must have been with a recent update, because this didn’t use to be a problem, but whenever there’s a link on my dashboard, clicking anywhere on the same line as the link or in the vicinity of it takes you IMMEDIATELY to the link. This is a huge nuisance, especially when there’s posts that have an entire page of links and I have to scroll past it. It’s incredibly frustrating, and can even be dangerous if it’s a link that leads to a virus or a shady website. I don’t really have any complaints other than that, that’s the biggest issue I’ve been having with it lately."

I've tried deleting the app several times, turning my phone off, opening and closing the app, almost everything I can think of (and no, it's not my internet.) While I will continue to keep trying to make the app work, I really want to stress how many problems I've had in the past. The altogether blocking of certain tags, the randomly deciding to stop loading my dashboard and other blogs, and the sites history with its questionable interpretation of ""adult content"" has rendered the app almost completely unusable. Don't get me wrong, I've been on the site for awhile, and I LOVE the community I've found on there, its just that the app needs a lot of work."

It’s the best internet thing to ever happen to me. I have found so many special friends on tumblr. I’m part of communities and fandoms that have changed my life.

174,El Witch,"December 18, 2018",1,LISTEN TO YOUR USERS FOR ONCE Banning all NSFW content didn’t take down the porn bots or child pornography blogs.

175,rpgresearcher,"January 1, 2019",1,"Disappointing I’ve been a goblin denizen of Tumblr for several years now, and I’m disappointed by Tumblr’s recent dip into censorship. I’m not really sad to see truly pornographic material go, but I understand the frustration artists are expressing in the wake of this new hardline policy. Tumblr bills itself as a site for self-expression and the pursuit of personal interests. It has a wonderful community and a unique platform that focuses more on content and creation that identity, which is a relief compared to Twitter and Facebook, where identity is intimately tied with each account. But Tumblr has become more limiting over the last few years, and it’s frustrating to watch. There are more ways to make your app more “family-friendly” than a total ban, like advisory content warnings, and frankly, there are more important things Tumblr could be focused on, like addressing the racism, misogyny, hateful language, etc. that surfaces in the darker corners of the site. But no. It’s the nipples that must go."

Tumblr itself is fine, but in the past few years it’s continued to go downhill as Tumblr staff has continued to implement new “features” that have only limited the user experience and done nothing to fix the problems they set out to solve. Most issues that users come forward about are left completely ignored; it’s only when a source of revenue is threatened when staff decides to take action on anything. This is a large part of why Tumblr has dropped exponentially in value, but that’s beside the point. The mobile app in particular is an absolute mess, constantly crashing and bugging out. Blog formats made off of mobile aren’t visible on mobile, and often blog links don’t work on mobile either. Generally horrible app for a mess of a platform."

A major amount of people have been using this for that for years and years and then you start this BS.  You people are deleting and blurring photos that have absolutely nothing to do with adult content and as far as I’m concerned you’re violating my first amendment rights when you do so.  You’re putridly despicable and I’m done with you and your pathetic BS forever after you completely, greedily, selfishly, and pathetically ruined all my pages that I only had for myself.

I understand that wanting to keep it organized on blogs by only searching tags seems useful, but not every post ever gets tagged so it was helpful back a few years ago to have it search by a key word and have posts mentioning it pop up. Though I see why that left it open for annoyances like bringing up irrelevant posts just because the word you searched was in someone’s user name, I’d rather have to scroll a lot for my results rather than get the “The search found nothing. Here it isn’t.” message a hundred times when I know what I was specifically looking for had that key word even if it wasn’t tagged."

People with post an image and it will be removed for “violating community guidelines” when it really doesn’t at all. For example, one girl posted a drawing of cute little kindergarten characters having a pillow fight, and it got taken down. Another time, a guy uploaded a funny, vine-like video and it was removed for SEXUAL CONTENT. So, if you are going to upload an image of video to tumblr, be aware that it could be taken down easily.

Please make this app cohesive and come out with an update that makes things easier to search and user friendly. Maybe try things like being able to add a couple blog types to each blog, so you can search for blog types rather than solely by tags on posts (since many get spammed with irrelevant tags). Or perhaps improve on the ""discovery"" section to build and promote new posts making a large amount of notes for the day, etc. Thank ya, appreciate ya tumblr but please improve.

I have used this website VERY actively since 2011, and during that time the staff has had near-constant mistakes in the form of updates that make the user experience less friendly at best and completely break the site at worst. However, this new entry in the history of tumblr staff’s absolute disdain for the needs of their users takes the cake.

I feel like the problem could have been a simple fix with inserting one of the filters that requires users to prove they’re not a bot while registering and prompted it for current users as well. Instead, they insisted on doing some insanity that deleted half their user base and half of the porn bots, most of which just found a loophole to continue their annoyance. The app itself isn’t fully functional as it never delivers any of my notifications and usually will make me refresh the newly opened app to even see the message.

I don’t get why this problem hasn’t been fixed yet. It’s not like it’s new, it’s literally been years. I get that tumblr holds a lot of data, but so do other apps and they don’t crash all the time.

Don’t post the same things others are have tried using the text post instead of the photo post, have tried saving as a draft then posting. None of it works and I’m at the point where I’m considering leaving tumblr b/c all the content I’m creating isn’t being seen and it’s EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. I used to enjoy tumblr but now I don’t.

200,r4ch3lb,"October 23, 2017",2,Can’t tell if it’s tumblr or iOS11… I’m mostly a mobile tumblr user but recently since the ios11 update its almost impossible to do anything in the app anymore. Every time I log in it won’t update my feed to show me the newest posts and it tells me to log out and re log in and when I do that it just updates my feed but I still can’t do anything. I also answered an ask and the mobile app cut off half of my answer. I’ve tried to message people through the messaging system and it tells me that it’s not working or that “something went screwy” but it doesn’t fix it. Also a problem I’m STILL having is that the notifications it sends to my phone are so ungodly large four notifications take up my entire phone screen. It’s like they’re spending more time on their witty update descriptions than actually fixing the problems that are staring them in the face.

Constantly the staff are made aware of their presence, but they’re never removed. They allow white nationalists to call for violence against Jewish people and people of color on their site. Spam porn bots linking to harmful websites selling malware filled sex videos on any post have been an issue for years, and the recent change did nothing to slow them down. But their faulty removal algorithm flagged safe for work pictures and non-human, non-sexual posts as nsfw and removed their content from their site. Removing an avenue of monetization from artists who already struggle to make a living. The priorities are backwards, and the execution is consistently sloppy from this app. Would not recommend"
203,paigemetal,"December 23, 2018",1,"Tumblr: A Privilege To Post Revoked Wrongfully I find it difficult to believe that Tumblr has even managed a three-star rating. What was once believed to me an online community that allowed users, bloggers, and artists alike to share media, is now a poor excuse of a platform. From personal experience, the functionality of the site and the app is poor. Though, as a user, I excused the issues which I perceived, because I am a supporter of many community members. Now, Tumblr has decided to implement policies which unfairly restrict the platform’s users. Tumblr is responsible for removing, and in my opinion destroying, the property that many individuals have toiled to create. I find this to be outrageous, as many undeserving profiles are stripped of their works. Instead of working toward making a better site/app for its dedicated users, Tumblr would rather demean those who have made the site so popular by deleting their work and censoring the ability to express."
204,DragonBleed,"December 29, 2018",1,"Censoring it's userbase, but not harmful users and bots Tumblr recently banned all ""adult content"" under the guise of getting rid of porn bots that were causing havok on the site, and posting illegal images. Instead of dealing with the specific problem, Tumblr has silenced it's users. The irony is that porn bots have learned how to beat the broken and shoddy algorithm Tumblr has placed to ban such context, and are still running rampant. To make matters worse, Tumblr has not reacted to consumer complaints about blogs that support Nazism, white supremacy, and harm against minority races and ethnic groups. Tumblr claims to want to be a safe space for free expression, but it has proven itself to be a sex-negative place that is safe for racism and misogyny, but not sensual and sexual expression. Verizon, who bought Tumblr, does not know it's core user base, or how to properly manage a site.

The team running this website clearly does not know how to make this a functioning and effective ban, either. Porn bots still run rampant. Completely, 100% sfw posts are being hidden. I’m sorry, wasn’t this nsfw ban supposed to, I don’t know, get rid of porn bots and actually protect the sfw users?

Timestamps for messages would also be a big improvement instead of just one every hour (especially during continuing conversations, because it brings unnecessary attention to the fact that it’s a new hour, maybe have it come after sending a message 1 hour or more from the last). And finally, have it so that if someone answers your ask, you can click on the notification and go directly to the post, instead of just the person’s profile (this is especially useful for people who post often or people who don’t use Tumblr often, as so much scrolling is a pain)."

217,Maddy Len,"December 19, 2018",2,"Buggy, strange format and overall disappointing I’ve been on this site for about 7+ years and the mobile app has never lived up to expectations. Randomly it will crash and eject you from the app, notifications can appear ten minutes after they were originally received, and most annoyingly at times when sending a post to a well-known friend that you have sent posts to before, their blog name will not come up when you type it into the messaging search. Despite their blog still existing, tumblr will claim “eh??? No one’s here”. Extremely frustrating and annoying. Would not recommend using this app on mobile at all. It’s a fun community and all, but its flaws outweigh the benefits. After all, there are lots of other messaging apps you can use to communicate with friends, ones that won’t crash quite so often or claim your friends don’t exist."

The last update made tags no longer show up under an edited post unless you manually refresh the page, and messed up the dates under the schedule function. Also why do you always have to check your queue when you schedule a post to make sure the app didn’t randomly change the time you input to whatever the hell it felt like changing it to?  It’s always small inconveniences, but the inconveniences come with such regularity that it begins to feel like the staff is just pushing random buttons and calling that an update."

This ranges from a post about someone baking bread in the shape of a frog, to flagging various classical art and sculptures where the subjects are nude, even though you indicated that nudity in art and forms of protest were acceptable on your platform! And you still haven’t made any effort to get rid of the Nazis using your services- but then I guess under the current political climate, antisemitism, eugenics, genocide, racism, and white supremacy are actually not only not a problem, but also a source of controversy, free advertising, and revenue generation."

Pictures of my eyeshadow, my dog, the food I’ve eaten, or reblogs from 70s sci-fi art pages have all been flagged. Imagine being SO bad at regulating content to make sure nothing illegal stays up, that you heavily impose new restrictions on every user just to remain relevant on a mobile platform - then screw that up as well with a flagging system that obviously doesn’t work. Not only that, but I am still frequently followed by NSFW not accounts - so it appears that legitimate users are being targeted, but a major issue is still plaguing us. I visit the app less and less.

How about instead of banning art and pictures that have nipples showing, you actually solve the child pornography problem?  And get rid of those useless bots that flag posts that aren’t even NSFW (one of my posts got flagged that was a girl wearing a crop top taking a selfie).  Guess what else?  You can’t even appeal your posts that got wrongfully flagged anymore either. Why is Tumblr banning any and all nudity when it should be banning neo-Nazis and white supremacists that seem to be everywhere on Tumblr?

The David Karp who put everything into this site is kicking himself, no doubt. Instead of being competent enough to weed out illegal content, and implement a more accurate filtration system, they’ve decided to do away with a whole percentage of the content on their site. It’s lazy, it’s messy, and above all it’s a few thousand mile-steps backward. A company who ignores its consumers concerns and inconsiderately addresses the issues with it is bound for failure.

It flags Tumblr’s own post explaining that the filter will not flag anything. It is unable to flag tentacle porn, and you can make other pornography go unfiltered merely by changing the color palette, or by adding a picture of an owl. The appeals process involves running the flagged content through the same filter that flagged it in the first place. There is nothing I can say in this review which will adequately convey the fractal scale of the problem here.

Artists and creators and sex workers used tumblr because it was one of the only sites left that allowed adult content to be shared freely, and the administrators decided that actually, women shouldn’t be able to exist on their site either. Trans people, artists, any marginalized group that creates on tumblr is punished for doing so and is forced to leave the only site left that still had a large audience for art and such content.

The staff of this site are so god damned inept they literally can’t maintain any form of quality control without feedback from other tumblr users to do their jobs for them first. None of the communities suggestions were ever taken into consideration when updating the website. Tumblr deserves to just get lost into the dark web forever just like MySpace."

Ever since y’all decided to remove all sensitive content no matter what age you are, people have been hating y’all  for it. It is taking away their freedom of speech! Freedom of expression on the internet. I would like for this to be removed and I want y’all to add sensitive content back onto the app. This is just for your good.

Verizon immediately set out to squash all of that because no one on the site actually wants to click on ads, obviously. Add the FOSTA/SESTA debacle and the subsequent banning of all adult content, whilst allowing literal Nazis and White Supremacists continue to run their content free of punishment. It makes zero sense to ban all adult content instead of simply reporting and removing actual illegal activity, but Tumblr's programmers also don't know what the hell they are doing, and haven't since probably 2012. They're just having to answer to Verizon now as well as apparently having to adhere to poorly written, socially destructive legislation.

Not only that but the bots that spam adult content are now tagging their content as sfw. This is a massive failure and could have been fixed with the implementation of one thing: CAPTCHA. Any time the user intends to make a post or reblog with comment they could have put a captcha and had the entire issue dealt with. Moving on the 75,000 5 star reviews are rarely (if at all) genuine. It’s obvious that Verizon is cheating the system as within an hour of this reappearing on the App Store the rating went from a 1.9 to roughly 5 stars. My advice? Go elsewhere.

However, the blatantly misogynistic and homophobic community guidelines recently instituted by Staff (please explain to me why my nipple is considered literal porn when a “male” nipple is not, and why almost all LGBT+ art historical content on my dash was flagged under the new algorithm) have finally driven me away from a site, despite its many extant flaws, I’ve engaged with for the past 8 years.

This recent purging of nsfw content is one example of how tumblr cannot properly deal with an issue plaguing the website. Instead of having a proper filtering system, tumblr has decided to use a faulty algorithm to detect wether or not a post or a blog is nsfw, and, a lot of the time, it fails to do so properly. Many blogs have been terminated or simply marked as “adult content” when they are not strictly nsfw blogs. Also, many posts have been marked similarly, when they are not nsfw. Meanwhile, p0rnbots/spambots and nazis still run around the website without any trouble.

I really miss old Tumblr and at this point I would settle for bug fixes. What’s all that ad money paying for if not to get your tech team to fix this app?"
293,turtleboi200,"August 18, 2018",4,Lost of adds It was fine until like a week after I got it and it just started giving me adds.  I would scroll down a little bit and there were two adds it is very annoying to so many adds.  Otherwise I love the add it runs smoothly and I works without WiFi (yay) that is helpful when you are on the run all the time.    It is a lot of fun you can post stuff.  But 1 thing about it is a lot of people who do tumblr try to commit suicide (sorry for my bad spelling) and it is sad so people have been putting up antisuicide (spelling again sorry) on that I am 1 of these people so if you do tumblr please don’t commit suicide. Overall I love this app but not the adds and people who try to commit suicide.
294,SilverM.W.,"November 8, 2018",2,"Extremely Bugged Anytime I click anything in my notifications, messages, or really anything that isn't my dashboard directly (including my inbox), the app tries to open it in the tiny add-on window that normally is only supposed to support messages.

295,DavidArchuletaGirl,"December 18, 2018",1,"New Policies The new NSFW ban is not productive and it is frustrating. Posts of mine that are absolutely fine ( such as a girl dancing fully clothed and safe for work ) have been marked as inappropriate. Posts of others of actual NSFW content remains. Spam porn bots remain. Nipple policing dependent upon presentation of gender as far as tumblr staff perceives people’s genders is problematic in multiple obvious ways. For one, who is tumblr staff to determine who on the site presents as female enough to be inappropriate? Additionally enforcing this rule is inherently sexist and discriminatory. And frankly a dated way to look at content creation and the world in general. Nipples are not sexual things. People of all genders have them. They are not sexual organs. They are not harmful or inappropriate. They are parts of the body. No more would I recommend banning posts of fingernails on feminine presenting people."

As someone who has been on the website/ app for years I can honestly say the user base has been trying to get them to fix the issues (stated in the title). They blatantly ignored us. As everyone knows they recently used a PUBLIC ACCESS bot to flag ‘nsfw’ content, it doesn’t only flag nsfw it flags everything from cats to cookies. Not to mention there are still ways around it. Tumblr wanted to get back onto the App Store because of money but said it was “to make a safer place”. Yet, if you actually go into the app/ website the porn bots, pedophiles or *MAPS* (the only 2 types of porn that were ever issues) are still there. The Nazis and the Nazi propaganda are still there and Tumblr shows no signs of removing them. This extreme censorship was brought on because from the beginning of Verizon/Yahoo has ignored the user base of Tumblr."

Why do you think ‘female presenting nipples’ is the hill you want to die on? I’m just curious. Why did you think that banning ALL nsfw content was the answer when the problem wasn’t adult content? I don’t think that the issue with your website was people exploring their sexuality. I don’t think the problem with your website was people drawing adult art or making and selling adult toys.  I think it was the nazis and the child abusers. And "
298,ububdjiheesgvdt,"December 23, 2018",2,"Wasted Potential Tumblr itself is filled with many fantastic and diverse people with all sorts of amazing interests but it is poorly run and coded. Bots have always and continue to run rampant even after a poorly executed and unwanted nsfw ban was implemented. While I personally don’t have too many qualms with the ban itself, many blogs have simply been deleted with out warning and for unwarranted reasons. The bot designed to catch undesirable posts is frequently incorrect and marks safe posts as explicit and ignores the ones that need to be marked and they system to put them up for a appeal is simply inconvenient and could be much better in design. My advice? Actually hire enough people to fix this and they’ll actually appreciate your site for what it is. You won’t get anything out of a business if you don’t put anything into it."

Porn bots and pedophiles are still out there and terribly easy to find; I still block and report the bots on a regular basis at a rate which hasn’t really changed since the ban. Meanwhile, the majority of artists that I know (including me!) have had platforms and follower bases that they’ve spent years building up crumble. Recent changes have only fractured communities and forced artists to pick up and move elsewhere, something which is immensely damaging when one’s livelihood depends upon their visibility. Incompetency is no excuse."

304,Gemfemme,"December 18, 2018",1,They don’t care about or listen to their users Tumblr staff are the most incompetent people running a social media site/app ever. They roll out a “nsfw ban” but all it did was delete and/or flag innocent users while porn bots and Nazis and other gross types of accounts continue to remain on the site. The bot they have flagging content continues to flag completely innocent things while the stuff that’s actually bad slips through the cracks. 
305,Cerial Shadow,"December 19, 2018",1,"From bad to worse Tumblr’s never been a great app, it crashed constantly, struggled to play videos, and often flat out wouldn’t play music. Despite this I enjoyed the platform enough to stick with it. But recent decisions have shown that the staff doesn’t care about their user base. The bots and racists are still active, people who don’t post explicit material are getting flagged as having adult content and hidden from others’ dashboards, and posting art is a risk because even pictures that aren’t nsfw are getting flagged and appeals to remove the flag aren’t always working as they should. This isn’t just about explicit content being banned, this is about making the entire website less useable and less friendly to long time users, many of who stuck with the website for years despite the less than stellar app, the bots, and various other issues."

The ai that they use to find inappropriate pictures (female nipples, flesh tone photos) is a complete fail. It flags anything with skin as a female presenting nipple or porn. Even Tumblrs own post about what can and cannot be allowed on tumblr is flagged. Tumblr says you can show female nipples in a artistic or non pornographic way but the ai doesn’t know better and flags/deletes everything. Innocent blogs are getting shut down because of this. Lana cc find (the sims 2/3/4 community biggest blog) almost got shut down because this. Tumblr you either have to fix this terrible ai or remove this policy and find a different way of reporting child porn because this policy is bringing down everyone! I mean take a lesson from Facebook/instagram or Twitter, I never seen them have these issues."

I originated on the computer but migrated over to the app for easier access to the website. However, the app is not always efficient. It crashes, loses your spot while scrolling, has tons of ads that aren’t relevant and sometimes holding false information. The recent ban on adult content came to late and at this point is too hard to be contained. My account still is followed by hundreds of porn bots, some of which, were around when I was 13. I understand wanting to create a more marketable, family friendly site for teens and older users, but their recent decisions destroy the freedom of speech outlook they once originated. There are still sexual predators, nazis, and porn spam on the website which are more harmful then the female presenting nipple."

Outside of the actual running of the app, the new update hasn’t done much to help with many of the problems that users have been identifying for years (rampant and active bots, hate speech, etc) and has instead caused many issues for users who don’t post any kind of NSFW content while still allowing the issues to continue or slip through the cracks. The bot the company has created to flag accounts and posts as NSFW does not work, instead flagging anything it can find, seemingly.

Why is it then rated 17+? Is it because people shouldn’t be exposed to literal Nazis until they are 17? Or is it because you know your filters are incredibly flawed? I know I won’t get answers and I’ll eventually move to a site that makes more sense but it’s puzzling to think that you value the “community” but eventually everyone decent is going to leave because it will be over run by the hate.

Please make this an 18+ only app since the content within is definitely an adults only situation with the state of the bots (especially since these bots can follow, message, and allow children to still look through their unflagged blogs). Not to mention that they allow hate groups which, y’know, are a bit more damaging and inflammatory than the vaguely beige images that are actually being hidden. On the technical side: app freaks out with ims, doesn’t send notifs when they should, glitchy, and not everything shows up in tags."

This update, though, is driving me up the wall because if you look at it wrong, you open a link. Oh, what’s that? There’s a source link somewhere in this post? Looks like you’re opening five Wikipedia pages now. You happen to scroll past someone who’s put a link to their Instagram under a picture? Yep. Leaving the app again. I’ve literally had to restart this app (multiple times!) because I was scrolling past someone’s tag list and every time I’d breathe in my screen’s general direction it was just [opens a Tumblr] [opens a Tumblr] [opens another Tumblr]. I know links exist to be followed, but I’d love to get scrolling back at some point in the near future."
340,Oh lord have mercy on this app,"October 22, 2017",1,"This is the buggiest app I've ever used. Safe mode is annoying enough, and doesn't even really work. With it enabled, I'm just missing random memes and art posts and not really anything explicit. I think this would have worked better if you had given us a way to block certain tags instead. Safe mode aside, this app never works. I haven't been able to even get it open since this last update (which is par for the course) and frequently I can't click on things and posts overlap. Even if I have service and other apps are working, Tumblr just won't load. The website is great, but the app isn't really worth the frustration. Bare minimum, a social media giant like Tumblr should be able to at least make an app FUNCTIONAL. Please focus on making sure each update is actually ready to roll out before writing the witty tag lines."
341,Yoni Rubenstein,"November 9, 2017",2,"Unacceptable amount of bugs As a software developer, I know how difficult some bugs can be to deal with. That's why I'm understanding of the occasional crash (even on  my new iPhone 7 Plus); after all, tumblr can have to hold hundreds of megabytes of data in memory -- though they should have a better way of freeing memory than crashing. Unfortunately, some bugs persist across updates that should be dealt with quickly. For example, notifications usually won't show up without forcing the app to quit. They sometimes show up under the wrong day, and you often can't scroll far back (25 max). Instead of fixing these little bugs, they add new and unrequested features. As a developer, I know that it's more fun to add new features than fix bugs. As a user, I don't care."

It keeps me up to date on news (and memes) and allows me to make friends with similar, if not the exact same interests as me. The dashboard is a good way to go about things, and my suggested feed almost always manages to interest me. There are a few bugs though, especially notifications when it comes to asks and mentions. Also, when it comes to censored content. Porn is not covered by safe mode sometimes while completely harmless things are censored? It misses the entire point of having safe mode on, so I just keep it off. Overall, great app, but I definitely wouldn’t give it 5 stars with all the problems it has."

Females can not post their nipples because it’s too sexual yet a male can. This is discrimination and sexualizing female bodies without their consent. The staff will also flag random pictures such as animal as adult content and the blogger has to wait a week while they investigate the post. All bloggers who posts that are flagged are  not informed either. The site original gave a safe space for nsfw and creative work yet to make money the company blocked many users and shown that even on 2018 females are not equal to males.

Going into the tags is bugged out of use, the flagging of the blogs is completely unwarranted. Tumblr’s staff has been failing to regulate the actual issues on the site as a whole. Porn bots run rampant and lets not forget the fact they’re allowing racist blogs to run without being flagged or marked as inappropriate. The site has been deteriorating in recent years, but the whole purge that occurred has been a deciding factor for many artists and users to jump ship. It’s unfortunate because this was a place for artist to share their content and now it’s fallen to pieces.

I only hop on Tumblr for 5 to 10 minutes max because there’s nothing to look at. Non-nsfw posts and blogs get marked as NSFW so you can barely find any content.

They rushed out a useless, broken “solution” that doesn’t work and alienates a lot of the user base. Things that are completely harmless like pictures of cats are being flagged. Now, the tagging system has become so screwed up it’s hardly useable for anything, and the site has shadow banned so many blogs that are completely non explicit.

Despite this censorship and when I went on earlier to delete my blog, there are still some NSFW posts allowed through Tumblr’s filters, many non-NSFW posts and profiles being labeled and such, and numerous profiles and posts dedicated to hate and bigotry such as white nationalism, radical Islamist extremism, antisemitism, and homophobia are still prevalent and allowed to thrive in the Tumblrsphere.

Instead of dealing with this issue, their organization has decided it would make their platform more “family friendly” and censor anything remotely NSFW. Their filters now incorrectly flag much that wasn’t NSFW to begin with, and apparently, Neo-Nazi, anti-LGBT, and white supremacist pages are considered family friendly, as there is no shortage of that content available to view.

Most users stay only due to unique content and environment that tumblr offers. Banning any “adult content” and whatever else gets caught in that net means alienating a large portion of that userbase and tumblr should understand that.

Also posting has very versatile formats, so you can kinda do whatever you want, where as with other social networking apps, it’s pretty much just one style- for instance Snapchat only does picture and video posts, and Facebook is predominantly text.

I don’t go on tumblr specifically for nsfw content, but I don’t think it’s fair to just get rid of it. I think having it there is part of what made tumblr more unique than other sites.

I understand there are valid reasons regarding certain pornographic posts but doing a full censorship of anything and everything deemed “inappropriate” is wrong and unfair to those discriminated against for their art or expression, especially since the fundamentals of Tumblr were meant to contain full self-expression.

Now, practically everything you post is immediately flagged as adult content because the bots they have trying to sift out nsfw posts are so poorly built they cannot tell a picture of a puppy apart from an explicit image.

That gives users the opportunity to tell the community it's explicit. I think it should just block explicit content overall. All social media applications have its flaws.

I’ll type “dog” and it’ll come up with zero posts. Come on, Tumblr!! Listen to your reviews!! I UPDATED MY PHONE TO IOS11 JUST TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP. (And I immediately regret it now.) Are the lame “update” messages really necessary? I don’t want to delete the app, but I don’t know if I can keep something that doesn’t even function. It only takes up space."

I've already tried signing in and out, uninstalling and re-installing, turning my phone off and on, and nothing is working. Also before it used to show posts related to the one I was viewing, now they have disappeared? I really like that feature. "

So if you go far into a tag or you have a lot of likes and is trying to find something you liked along time ago( like a month or so but that's if have been liking a lot of stuff) the app becomes slow and then it crashes and reloads so you have to go through your likes again and if you try to unlike anything I takes forever and it's really annoying please fix.

I have no issues regarding reblogs, likes, gifs, and posting my work. The only small problem I have is that when I edit my page it scrolls past the thing I'm editing? It's nothing major and doesn't cause horrible frustrations, or anything bad to happen. Other than a minor inconvenience it's a great app overall. I had my expectations set rather low as I've had troubles with other apps (ie: DA and Pinterest)), but turned out to be smoother than anticipated."

If there was another social media platform that offered the same anonymity as Tumblr, I would have been off of here years ago. It doesn't matter how many people report nazi blogs, terroristic blogs, child porn blogs, etc. They have never taken them down, and they have never handled the actual issue. It's a dumpster fire of a website, and with the incompetent staff they have, it always will be.

The changes I’ve seen have been unhelpful and discriminatory. They have not listened to what their own user base has been begging for, and instead make drastic and unnecessary changes in order to save their own butts. Instead of taking a harder stance against shameful and hateful bigotry that is STILL left on the site, they instead make a blanket ban on any “adult content”, with a horrible filtering system that cannot even understand the difference between adult and regular posts. I’m disappointed, to say the least, and hope that the Tumblr staff can relook at their actions and take actual helpful measures towards making their app/website a better place to be a part of."

Whenever I get notifications and check them, it’ll ALWAYS say I still have notifications and will NOT go away. It’s so annoying and no matter how many times I refresh it, it will still show up. This app definitely needs an update, just to fix the minor bugs it has. It also needs to be wiped clean of all the porn bots that follow everybody. So much for keeping tumblr “clean and safe” when you block out the actual people who aren’t even posting remotely as bad stuff as the bots on this site."

First up, staff. Users have reported pedophiles, Nazi’s, white-supremecists, TERFs, pornbots, etc. for years while you sat on your thumbs. Rather than utilize an actual solution, you chose to ignore it until it threatened ad revenue. I don’t believe for a second that you grew a conscience when that cache of child porn cropped up; you haven’t cared about the people harmed in your platform for a long time. Second, Apple and the App store’s stranglehold over the internet was the real impetus in this change. The removal of tumblr from the App Store scared advertisers, and staff along with them. Apple’s power over the availability of their apps and in our current mobile market is terrifying."

I would spend endless hours looking at memes, porn, and art. Now it seems empty it’s missing something. Tumblr will never be the same, most of my favorite blogs are gone along with the content. I’m not sure what will replace tumblr but I hope it has no restrictions on nudity. I understand that child pornography is not to be taken lightly but fix that issue! There’s a reason we don’t see that on other social media platforms. Tumblr can do it to.

In the time since this kicked off, I’ve suddenly been followed by several porn bots and watched various artists move elsewhere. So, thanks for that I guess. Can’t keep posts up by following rules if in practice any random post can be hit or even entire SFW blogs. I think Verizon is trying to destroy Tumblr to sell it off tbh because this has accomplished absolutely nothing in regards to the original problems.

Secondly, if I switch apps for a few seconds then come back to the tumblr app instead of opening where I left off, the app opens on some totally random post from a blog I have notifications turned on for! Also, whenever I post an instagram link in the caption of a photo post, the photo I'm posting from instagram pops up in the caption and I'm forced to delete it if I want to JUST keep the link in the caption.

464,kakogai,"December 27, 2018",1,"Really???? Instead of removing hateful and hurtful blogs that contain nazi/white nationalist/etc rhetoric, the platform decides to drive all nsfw content away, wiping out years of artwork and other personalized and very unique content. While it’s arguable that the safety for minors using the site isn’t the best, (I understand a case of child porn is no small issue, and definitely needs to be addressed), that can be fixed easily with actual care put into the monitoring of NSFW work, (no more bots please!) as well as the tag system/not allowing underage users to turn off safe search mode until they are 18+. As it was before the “purge.” Also really sad that so many of my favorite artists and their work were wiped.

I don't know how often it actually gets updated, but it seems as though its not very often. Because every time I go on this app, theres a new bug.

Tumblr has achieved a lot for being an uninhibited platform where you can easily find a web of content from like-minded people. So why ruin that entire core concept by forcing everyone to see random memes and often political posts, seriously! The moment someone makes a similarly uninhibited web-style platform that becomes popular Tumblr is dead with literally the only new features ever being added including more ads, forced content, and retiring features."

Setting this listing back to “sfw” is not possible in the tumblr settings anymore. Blogs of mine that have no bit of skin are blocked.

I was followed by two this week. And if you are going to remove one group of despicable people, why not remove them all? Instead of banning the human body (but only women, I guess, because that isn’t backwards and sexist), ban the Literal Nazis who proudly exist on your site.

Now it’s just a big corporation who would rather make a ‘blanket-solution’ than find solutions that actually go after the real problems the site has. This app still is no where ‘kid friendly’ that they now claim to be with its promotion of self harm blogs and hate speech blogs; but yeah I’m sure banning all nsfw content was totally the right approach. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’ve used this site for over five years and it’s just disappointing to see it come to this.

So the options are either to not label NSFW work as such (which creates chaos and triggers for people who don’t want to see that), or to just not make anymore kind of work like that. Their are people who like PG stuff in their fandom(s), but let’s not forget that a huge portion also likes NSFW work as well. It’s always been a part of fandoms, and I doubt it’ll ever stop. This is just a lazy “fix” that’s creating more trouble than not because a lot of posts that aren’t even NSFW are being labelled as such and being censored.

I frequently have to restart my phone or delete the app and re download for it to function.

Neo-nazis/white supremacists, violent misogony/homophobia/transphobia etc.,  pedophiles, and porn bots all run rampant on this horrible hellsite.

And then crash again when you try to reopen it. And again. The audio player’s only feature is that it has a play and pause button; forget about trying to skim through it you can only press play. Can’t queue anything up. Miss something? Can’t go back. Have to exit out of the player, press the link again, and start it over completely.

Artists, cosplayers, people who used Tumblr to see content that was lewd or sexual now are forced to go somewhere else, even if they have a big fanbase that can’t just all up and move to a new social media platform.

Tumblr has begun to flag and remove posts containing nudity, anything sexual seeming and anything violent whether it be acting or not.

I was followed by two this week. And if you are going to remove one group of despicable people, why not remove them all? Instead of banning the human body (but only women, I guess, because that isn’t backwards and sexist), band the literal Nazis who proudly exist on your site.

Unfortunately, a lot of posts I’ve reblogged that include paintings of nude figures, photos of semi nudity, and even some artwork with no nudity whatsoever have been hidden.

The staff refuses to listen to its users, showing that the only thing they care about is the money and further proving the negligence of the site."

Even though there are 18+ filters and other things to prevent people from seeing NSFW content if they so choose, the occasional “female presenting nipple” is more inappropriate than Nazis threatening Jewish people on this app. They went out to deactivate users like pornbots and users that post child pornography, but did it in an inefficient, ineffective, and flat out lazy way that their users blatantly do not support. This is censorship, plain and simple. Not only is it censorship, it is censorship that does not solve the problem that Tumblr set out to solve. This is another major fumble by Tumblr staff."

People who literally get money and make a living off of adult content are now just being thrown out the window. Tumblr used to be so great for that kind of thing! The way it’s formatted and how you can reblog posts is amazing, but this new ban is ruining  everything about it. Honestly, skip this and go over to Instagram or DeviantArt since apparently they’re more supportive of all content (even though Instagram can’t show any size picture and DeviantArt can sell your content behind your back.)"

Completely tearing it all down I feel was a terrible way to go. There was a great chunk of community that kept to theirselves that Tumblr lost by doing this, including myself and 20 of my close friends- and so much more people by the hundreds.

Sadly, it seems that even to this day it has a stigma on it that it’s just creepy rapey men who watch porn and/or read erotica that are sexist (surprise:that stereotype is false. I, a bi wlw, like my nsfw content too and do not view women in a sexist way. Heck, there’s even nsfw content on men if you’re into that, so even straight women or gay men can enjoy it too). Anyways, anecdote aside, tumblr is going to lose a majority of what makes tumblr tumblr and many will sadly lose a safe site to view nsfw content (that which including me since nothing else seems to work sadly).

Adult content algorithm for flagging and removal is highly faulty and poorly designed, regularly flagging non-adult content as adult.

Videos are terrible, the video players mechanics are bad. Rotating a video for horizontal viewing pauses the video and can potentially stop the video from playing all together, which cannot be fixed until you close the video. Turning your phone horizontal also loses your place on the feed. There’s really no reason for the horizontal features to NOT run seamlessly."

Also, I hate how it ‘organizes’ who you’re following now, it’s near impossible to find anyone without alphabetical order. What I’m trying to say is, they’re making it worse.

Completely disruptive and incongruous to my interests. I don’t understand what Tumblr is trying to do here or how their algorithms could be so entirely opposite me interests. It’s as if they were trying to deliberately steer me away from what I like rather than toward what I might. Their new strategy specifically disrespects the user.

This means that the most popular blogs show up on your feed first, and you may never see posts from smaller blogs that you follow who don’t get as many notes. The smaller blogs will get less and less activity, resulting in original content creators leaving the website.

One of the only consistently good things about Tumblr has been that, unlike every other social media platform, it at least gives you your feed chronologically. I appreciate the service Tumblr provides and I often recommend it to others but the team behind it seriously needs to rethink their updates. The userbase uses the platform to tell staff when we don't like a feature. Listen."

The algorithm used to flag inappropriate content is so poorly designed that the definition for adult content seems to change on an hourly basis, and the flagging system itself would be more effective if content was individually filtered by a team of highly trained housecats. The company as well seems to prioritize having a bro-friendly office culture over hiring competent individuals whose coding experience is greater than the free python course on codeacademy, and it shows in the functionality of both the app and the desktop website."

They decided to fix things by “making things child-friendly so the kids could be safer”, but in the end, users (including minors) are STILL getting followed by p0rnbots, nazis are still roaming free, and users are getting hurt by the bot sent out to track down and flag NSFW content, which is so vague that it would flag a photo of a beige wall as being explicit.

Verizon bought yahoo and at the time the site was still going strong. Verizon wants to sell more advertisements on the site and so they ban all NSFW content. Nudity and pornography, whether real, animated, or drawn, was made completely inaccessible and invisible. A significant portion of tumblr’s userbase either frequently or occasionally interacted with this type of content, and despite thousands upon thousands upon thousands of users explaining how this ban would drive them away and how it goes against the essential hands-off freedom that tumblr was founded on and run on, the new corporate overlords plugged their ears and alienated half the users.

There is also no visual hierarchy between body text and tags anymore making posts seems longer and cluttered. And while there is nothing wrong with changing fonts the one selected lacks legibility and readability because of its geometric shapes. Letters like “l” and “f” have very awkward kerning. As an “#artist on tumblr” this most recent update is severely disappointing. Change can be a good thing but this one was just too drastic and honestly it was a very unnecessary change when you look at the many other bugs and issues with the app that need more attention.

Wether tumblr staff has a complete lack of insight, is going entirely retarded, or are blind with greed, I’m not sure. I do, however, know that tumblr will take a massive blow from this.

Further, their “””ban””” is a poor excuse to enforce moral judgments on users - the bots automating the ban have caught many innocent posts in the backlash. There was fanart of a guy with dogs that was picked up - there was nothing untoward!! It’s also a shame to be pushing down the marginalized nsfw artists instead of tackling, yknow, nazi or white power blogs.

There are too many posts that are walls of text with nothing but hyperlinks and it makes it difficult and frustrating to get past them, because everywhere you click opens a hyperlink.

654,quintotarantino,"March 31, 2019",1,"Disappointed. I’m sad to say that tumblr is no longer a place to openly express yourself, but just another app like Instagram or VSCO with mindless photos ands videos. Prior to having the 18+ and NSFW content removed tumblr was a community that I felt made individuals open to talking about sexuality in a safe place. It’s sad that instead of better vetting on their profiles and content they removed the part of tumblr that gave it a niche population of supporters. The phone app is also riddled with ads and fake accounts that even after the “re-vamp” haven’t been removed. The app has no aesthetic pleasure. You cannot move between your different blogs easily and profile editing is null and you you cannot convert to a web style if you choose to."
655,ashlynEwhite,"March 31, 2019",1,"tumblr will be dead in about a year, don’t even waste your time trying to board the sinking ship now i honestly cannot believe how horrible Tumblr is now. i’ve been on tumblr for 7 years now and recently it has been killing its entire user base. every update is worst that the last and its rules keep getting stricter and pushing out people that DONT DESERVE to be pushed out. Real people. the site is festering with nazis and porn bots. there’s got to be more porn bots than there are actual people that use tumblr. The bots are the problem and Tumblr’s algorithm targets real people that do no harm while the bots slip through. i’m almost to the point of just deleting my blog and finding some better place. i hear Pillowfort is nice this time of year."

FIX THIS!!"
657,haveaniiiiceday,"October 16, 2019",5,"A means of expression and connections degree. Tumblr has always been an outlet for me, in terms of being able to reblog symbolic photos or poems. It is easy to use via phone which is my go to method (they have a great app). I enjoy the ability to see my thoughts through out the years and how my blog has changed. Tumblr is a great way to connect with people and a good way to document your life; sorta like a diary but in other people’s words and photos. 10/10 would recommend Tumblr to a friend!"

Every time I get a new notification and go to check it, it doesn’t go away. The number is still there when I exit the Notification Center. The only time it clears is to put another notification in its place. Please fix the bugs 😔. I really like this app and I’ve been using it for eight years now. Thank you."

Sometimes music doesn’t play and pics don’t load, but that’s mostly to do with bad service. Anyway, all around a good app. It looks nice and is well adapted from the online site. :)"
662,Frodisman#,"February 17, 2018",2,Updates are killing Tumblr This once great app is slowly loosing its luster. Every time I update it one cool feature either goes away or it doesn’t work right. First off if there is a group of pictures but one isn’t working then you can’t click on any of them like in the past. Secondly the videos won’t play after a small period of time. You have to close then reopen. It crashes more. Lastly the preview pictures are gone. Used to be if you clicked the link of the photo or video it would show you 9 different boxes of samples of that link location. Only works 5% of the time now. Best advice is to not update until they figure out what’s wrong.

The pictures take forever to load regardless of internet connection. We asked for a better app and you guys were like ""an app that works...well we made it so tagging posts requires two extra steps, hope this helps 😘"". Also, there have been several 'unknown errors' lately."

Pros: you can now add pics, videos, music, and other junk to text posts. Great! Cons: you can only make text posts now. You can add pictures and things to them, but they all format like text posts. Meaning if you uploads like 5 pictures and try to arrange them, they all end up in 1 column. Worst part is you can’t even see this until you’re on the desktop version. It looks like your pics are arranged how you want on the app, then on your computer they are all in a column. "
666,Kirk's Place,"December 15, 2018",1,"Crashes AND Censors Constantly Don’t bother with tumblr app. Most annoying thing is that it crashes constantly even with top of the line and max memory devices. You have to keep going into the app settings and force clear the tumblr cache to keep it stable. Now add to that mess their new censorship guidelines. I’m fine with blocking illegal images and videos, but let’s face it, with all the constant content being put on tumblr their only option is to use algorithms and software to define and scrub what they set as parameters. That’s only going to work if they just block virtually everything. Best way to avoid the crashes and soon-to-come nightmare of everything being questioned is to not join tumblr at all."

The staff’s last “attempt” to resolve these issues was pathetic and just showed how little they actually care about the users who want to create positive content. Maybe when the staff actually does something to fix their website which so many users love and don’t want to see burn as a horrible dumpster fire, I’ll fix my review.

The screen will freeze, I’ll get an error report, I’ll get duplicate notifications or no notifications (when I can see on the browser there are notifications).

When they came out with the app I was like I have to get that when I get a mobile device. So once I got my iPhone it made sense to get the Tumblr app. Using the app has made such a difference I get notified when certain blogs post. It's also quite nice to blog when I'm out and about. The functions of the blog are easy to use. When you want to edit the theme of your blog I find it super easy to do.
674,Nicki Kazekage,"May 5, 2018",2,"Needs work. The app was great to use. After each update it seems to get worse.

After 3 or 4, it won’t show me any more unless I repeatedly restart the app then once to notifications do show up, the app decides to force close. It’s irritating. We should also be able to maybe categorize or have an option to select how far back into our “likes” we would like to go instead of having to scroll endlessly until we find what we’re looking for."

Instead, let me recount something that happened on the 17th—Tumblr flagged a sideblog of mine, a sideblog specifically centered on the video game Kingdom Hearts and that had only been active for two weeks, as NSFW, and I wasn’t informed about it until a friend had told me so. Are you more sensitive about video game spoilers than you are about child porn? Listen to your user base for just once, it is LITERALLY that easy. I’d rate no stars if I could."

Suddenly tumblr execs are feelin pretty motivated to do something about it, so they....implement a single-layer machine learning algorithm to ban anything it claims to be nsfw from the site. Currently, because this algorithm will never be more sophisticated than a rusty spoon, nsfw content being banned includes fine art, cat pictures, and...tumblrs own post about how nothing that isn’t nsfw will be banned.

I’ve gotten more follows from porn bots since the update than I did the rest of the time I was using tumblr. Plus this new color update is horrible for people with sensitive eyes. I know many people that can barely use tumblr with it because of how bad of a headache it does. Instead of focusing on the real problem, tumblr decided to update the colors. Wooooo"

Well, the porn bots are still following me even after your “update” that got you back on the App Store.

Despite its problems this has been one of my favorite sites but that is because of the community of people that use it not the site itself. The community of people that Tumblr is now screwing over.

Specifically I can’t see some of the posts that the blogs I follow put up. And by some I mean a lot of the stuff. I have found a fix for it, but it was only a one time use.

This isn’t about just the porn this was a site for all kinds of people to express themselves. People were here to share their art of all types. Verizon is only after money they do not care about the people who use this site. They can’t make money with ads if there’s porn.

The flagging system runs on an algorithm that doesn’t work, and will flag anything with flesh tones in it. Tumblr’s large artist community is being forced to leave, as nsfw artists can no longer rely on a fanbase there to gain commissions, and sfw art is frequently flagged under the broken algorithm. Furthermore, staff consistently refuses to listen to users. They ignored the issues with porn bots until it got them taken off the App Store, and then rather than actually putting in the effort to fix the problem, they just banned all adult content, and that didn’t even work."

I’m hugely disappointed with the staff and with the changes that have been implemented post yahoo and Verizon acquisitions.

Customer service is completely non existent, and approximately 40% of my dashboard is taken up by advertising and “recommended posts”, none of which are ever relevant to the content of my blog and the majority of which are just not interesting in any way.

On top of, they’ve followed the same format with “Recommended” posts. It used to be a row that I could look through or ignore. Now it’s that row, plus they fill your timelime with full sized recommendations that don’t even relate to the content I follow. I spend more time “Whooshing” away unwanted accounts and skipping 3, I’ll say it again, 3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADS, than I do seeing those I’ve chosen to follow.

Yeah, standing up for racism and sexism and such is important but I’ve heard about multiple innocent users being attacked and accused by these SJW. I’ve seen SJWs telling others to kill themselves. They especially like to attack artists who appear to be “white” and start bashing them for any little thing they can find. Now, I wouldn’t write a review if Tumblr actually did something about these SJWs. I’ve seen or heard nothing about an SJW (or group) who’s attacking anybody for no reason being banned from the app. It’s disappointing that Tumblr can’t moderate the users on this app and it’s probably one of the biggest problems with the app."

Now so many people can’t express art they want to post, and people can’t find that art as easily, since tumblr is now like this. A lot of people came for that kind of content. Also, a lot of people who want to express themselves in ways they couldn’t on other site, can’t.

707,Ashlynn Thompson,"January 10, 2019",1,"Horrible staff, don’t download. I know this has been said multiple times but the staff on this site is utter garbage. We all know about the NSFW content ban, but my biggest issue is it didn’t even do anything except censor many people who relied on the site for a livelihood. The fact is their algorithms and methods to weed out the NSFW users are flawed. This is evidenced by the fact that since the ban, I have gotten 25 new followers (more than I usually get in this time period) and EVERY one of them is a porn bot. On top of all of this, Tumblr has still yet to address the issue of nazism and white supremacism that runs rampant on the site. Nothing about the way tumblr runs their platform is okay and I’m honestly sick of it."

When I tap on where the text should go, it twitches up for half a second then disappears.

There’s an explore page for a reason, if I want to see new blogs I go there! I mark every single suggested post as “this isn’t interesting” but that seems to do nothing to stop the app from plastering them all over my feed.

Yes, there’s an issue with bots, but the blanket NSFW ban is doing nothing to stop them while limiting creators and discriminating against women and the LGBTQ+ communities. Further, actual hate speech, such as Nazi and white supremacist rhetoric is still allowed. “Female presenting” nipples are banned while bigots get a soapbox. You used to be better than this Tumblr. "

Since the beginning staff has ignored us. Apparently p0rn b0ts and Nazis are less offensive to staff than “female presenting nipples” whatever that means. Also, since I’ve logged back on I’ve seen more ads for “hot singles in your area” with scantily clad women who look like poster children for human trafficking victims. These are sponsored ads.

There are multiple other problems that were caused by your carelessness, but outright banning nsfw content has to be one of the most laziest and careless things that you have done.

Their posts, some that don’t even have people in them, let alone porn, are flagged and shut down. Many can’t even post and be seen!

Tumblr has decided to wage war on “NSFW” content but artists are getting caught in the crosshairs. There is a fine line between pornography and art and I truly believe the staff of Tumblr do not know the difference. Art is being flagged and banned while porn bots still follow people by the dozens. I understand the reasoning behind the new updates, but this is not the way to go about it. I really do hope they figure this mess out before they lose their artists for good."

They’re indiscriminately deleting living documentation of people’s lives, blogs that have years worth of deep personal experiences, all in an effort to get more advertising in front of more faces.  If I had the choice to pick up my blog and go elsewhere, I would.  Unfortunately there’s nowhere like tumblr, and until there is, the staff will continue to ignore the community and do what it feels is cost effective.

Not to mention the spread of bots and white nationalism is only increasing while more and more content- even stuff staff claimed is perfectly acceptable- drops off the map.

PornHub is free and at the fingertips of many. So it clearly isn’t about the sexual aspect. It’s about censorship and removal of artwork. It’s about the fact that Nazis are allowed to keep their blogs, and are praised for having “decent content free of nudity”.

Sometimes, I just come across posts that are too long for me to deal with on mobile, or there are videos or shop links or other things I want to engage with on desktop before reblogging. I can’t do that anymore. Any post made on the mobile app is now unable to be edited on desktop, including drafts and queued posts.

I’ve been using Tumblr since 2012 and it’s always been an open and diverse platform, but when you ban art, don’t fix the issue with rampant nsfw bot accounts, and allow neo-nazi’s and Pedophiles to use the site with out repercussions, it certainly doesn’t feel as open as it used to.

The sudden new censorship, whether you care of NSFW or not, seems to be a final nail in the coffin for them to determine who’s work they like and don’t like.

It seems they've figured out how to take a popular, original post with pics or video from someone else's blog, and replace the commentary with their own, including links to their virus-ridden sites. So, basically, you could post a short clip of your dog being adorable, and some porn bot could alter it and make it look like YOU suggested that your followers go look at the porn bot's blog or click on their links.

I feel this new ban on adult content is sexist at is finest. “female-presenting nipples,” “permitted are exposed female-presenting nipples in connection with breastfeeding, birth or after-birth moments, and health-related situations, such as post-mastectomy or gender confirmation surgery.” What makes the female breast “adult content?” Why isn’t the male breast “adult content?” Female breasts were meant to breastfeed children, not in any way meant to be sexualized as the American society has portrayed them to be.

I just, I can’t believe this. You’ve completely lost my support. I get you wanted to crack down on child viewers. But there are numerous ways to circumvent and block underaged people from viewing said content that doesn’t require you to completely ban thousands of people from showing their art that THEY did, because THEY wanted to.

I’m sure Tumblr has lost a lot of people due to this, and hopefully they’ll run out of business or maybe fix their rules and settings so we can all have tumblr back the way we had it!

The load times are awful, you can’t backlist tags, you can’t html modify posts anymore on mobile. When people send me messages most times the app tells me it’s from person “A” when it was actually from person “B”. And the way they handle porn bots is insufficient. I should not have to open a blog and see its content to block it."

Myself included and there were filters for explicit content to make sure minors didn’t see them.

P0rn spambots are still following people out of the blue, whatever algorithm they’ve used to detect nsfw content is so wildly inaccurate that there’s still plenty of nudity and sfw posts are getting flagged as inappropriate, I personally have not seen any cp but I wouldn’t be surprised if there was still plenty around.

It gets pretty dang annoying the first few hundred times over ten minutes, let me tell you. Will no longer be using Tumblr mobile if it can be helped until this can get looked at. Have isolated the problem to this app specifically on my iPhone 8 iOS 13; no other applications seem to exhibit this tooth-grinding behavior."

I can only see the queue and drafts in a dialogue box that displays the middle of each line, but not what is next to either margin. It also doesn’t show the edit button.

The problem that the userbase has been yelling about for years is the nazis, pedos, and staff indifference as well as horrible update after horrible update.

949,madeline-valerio,"April 9, 2020",2,Many issues Tumblr has lots of issues. You can tag your posts but when you search for them in your blog nothing shows. You can pick one of the tags under the search bar on your blog but it won’t show them to you. You can’t consistently “whoosh away” the blogs they put on your dash. Every 6 or 7 posts is an ad or tumblr sponsored list of blogs. Photos won’t load even if your WiFi connection is fine. Posts you save in your drafts can be edited but not always posted. These are a few issues I have experienced. I hope they fix them soon.
950,Headshot2010,"October 29, 2017",1,"Stop releasing updates that break it After they fix these freaking bugs, I think i'm going to avoid updating it again. It's honestly miraculous how often they put an update out that breaks the app. Whenever I log in, it's a gamble if it will load normally or give me ""an error occurred"" message. Then, when I'm actually browsing around, it's a gamble if it'll actually load, or if it will just crash. Usually this happens if I'm swapping between the dashboard and notifications (if these developers ever actually read reviews). "

Also, the app is full of advertisements- some are products, but mostly it seems to be angry liberal posts which angrily preach at me, which infuriates me even though I am a liberal because I don’t use your app for politics.

What’s the point of asking how the app is if you guys don’t actually fix anything suggested? I’d have made a post to ask the tumblr staff, but I can’t use the app these days.

Go on the app and you’re just scrolling through blank posts cause the photos won’t load. Then the pornbots came and instead of fixing that problem they just decided to ban NSFW. Of course it’s tumblr so all the stuff that’s getting flagged is SFW stuff. The Nazi’s are gonna take over this site now because god forbid tumblr kick them off.

Now I know it is a sin to be a woman with breasts and all, but it was nice to be able to get away from that on this site and appreciate my body and the things it can do with other bodies.

The algorithm just isn't working well enough. If tumblr plans to reverse this decision (or adapt it into a more workable filtering system to allow for responsible adult use of the platform) I'd be happy to change my rating to a 3 or 4 star.

Then the parents could set up some parental controls that limit what kind of content can be searched for. That would have been so much better than what you have done, and the older tumblr community would have understood your decision completely.  Just my opinion. But I think a lot of people would agree."

Spoiler: there are still pornbots (and they didn’t even try getting rid of their nazi problem, so they’re still hanging around too), and the site will absolutely put them in the middle of your dashboard as a recommendation because the bots are spamming tags.

In this past month alone since Tumblr’s return to the App Store, I have blocked more porn bots than my entire eight years just normally browsing Tumblr.

I don’t see myself coming back to this when I already use instagram in the way you’re trying to make Tumblr to be; further more I much rather associate myself with a platform that promotes positive adult content such as consensual sexuality rather then nazi & homophobic propaganda. So I ask you with all honesty who is this app for? Who is your targeted demographic? Surely it’s not children and families? My mom has a hard time doing instagram and my grandmother can’t figure out how to work Facebook let alone manage this app.
1055,Xassainx,"December 15, 2018",1,"Great until recently Tumblr you were one of the best social media platforms out there, I could always find a blog about whatever I wanted on your site but with the recent ban on porn which not only goes against the very nature of the app but also censoring many peoples way of life and livelihood, many of them will be out of work and needing a new job, I know my review may not get you to reconsider but know this not only did the NSFW community leave, but all of their supporters who may not have been NSFW and all the alternate SFW blogs of people who ran NSFW blogs this wasn’t a great decision and Verizon’s stock after your decision and clear silence on Twitter has shown this"

I contacted Tumblr for a reason and after a month, no response.  I created another account but will be deleting on DEC 17th.   That is the date that they decided what was correct expression for everyone.  It’s a shame they have sold out the members that made them what they are.  I guess it will now be a site for teenager cartoon drawings and pictures of flowers and the sky.  Hope the lilies and clouds are not censored too. Way to go Tumblr.  Not sure who nominated them to be the moral compass of the public.  Your actions have tried to judge, oppress and shame users."

Ban “nsfw” art and leave the pornbots and nazis to roam free. What makes it even worse is that things that are very obviously sfw are getting flagged. Sure, you can ask for a review, but the review process is also automated. “Yeah, sorry, that picture of baby ducks is super sexual, can’t post it. You want a review? Too bad, the review agrees.” This is 2018, we don’t need companies pushing their puritanical BS. Oh, and by the way, the app is super glitchy, crashes a lot, lags massively, and is just an all around turdfest. Good job tumblr. You played yourself."

It flags things that are not explicit constantly, and most of what tumblr is made up of its artists sharing content, be it fanart to original works. This update was supposed to be for tracking down and terminating blogs that had child pornography, naziism, and all of the porn blogs on tumblr, and yet all of those things are still found pretty easily. Meanwhile the algorithm is targeting people sharing art, and consensual nudity. Tumblr has made mistake after mistake but I don’t know if anything tops this one."

The dash doesn’t load or refresh properly; posts will either not load at all of be out of order or extremely delayed (I’ve used the web version of Tumblr to verify). Audio posts don’t work half the time. Changes made to theme/icon on computer aren’t reflected in mobile app. The app has been around this long and you still can’t see and accept submissions on mobile. Just really disappointing that none of this gets fixed despite frequent updates."

There are typically constant updates fixing the small bugs that don’t really affect people that much but it’s been over 2 weeks from this review since they last update and it’s riddled with bugs and half the posts don’t load and overheats my phone. They need to work on the large bugs instead of navigation and design. Easy 5 star if they worked in fixing the bigger problems with the app instead of long holding the search button for a fast search

I’m so frustrated at you tumblr. You keep updating the app but what is there to update if you keep updating the same thing over and over. I can’t even save pictures horizontally because of the stupid black hue overlaying the top and bottom of the pictures now, it looks ugly.

The app is still not great, but it’s at least usable now. One easy improvement would be moving the safe mode toggle into the actual Tumblr app, with all the other settings, instead of hiding it in the Settings app for whatever reason. And considering how many legitimate posts Safe Mode hides, it really shouldn’t be on by default for users over 18."

I know this is the internet, free speech and all that flaming slew, but tumblr promised to do something about it and only ended up being the metaphorical bull having a fit in a china shop. From mass flagging pictures based on color tone to randomly deleting blogs for no reason. A literal coding hell hole. There are still elements of the cite that exist after they’ve removed them. They just cover stuff up, remove access. It’s like a sky scraper made of wet cardboard boxes. "

What used to be one of the most lively and interesting websites, has been ruined. By it's own hand. Oh--and adult porn is a big no-no but nazi's, necrophiles, pedophiles (that don't post porn--hopefully the ones that do were rid of with the new system) zoophiles, AND SO MUCH MORE that you just IGNORE but consensual nudity is TOP PRIORITY and SUCH a big problem, huh?"

But instead of that they just got rid of anything, and I do mean anything, that was sliiiiightly NSFW. Which in turn turned away a HUGE portion of their user base.

1073,ray313det,"April 23, 2019",5,Tumblr review I’m sorry but the new standards are wack. Maybe giving people the option to be able to view certain content is a better idea than policing the entire site. Especially when it seems that the there’s a bias against content that has people of color. Perhaps the site police are flagging the things THEY personally feel isn’t up to standards.
1074,jjeanl,"May 21, 2019",2,"To restrictive In your attempt to make this a more palatable and “kid friendly” site you have alienated the nsfw community and ostracized then from the one place they were allowed to exist that was safe. This has lead to there being a lack of scientifically accurate sex education that is already too hard to come buy, a lack of content through loss of art work, pictures, videos and more. Artist can’t share their work and this lack of exchange is be reason this website is dying. I’m your quest to drive more traffic towards the site you drove users away."

It crashes so often I’ve come to expect it and will save a longer post to my reading list before diving in in case the app crashes and I can’t find it again.

I’ve emailed support many times since then, asking if my account could be restored because I have alot of cherished memories and friends on it. No response! I’m beyond devastated. I used to love Tumblr and the communities I was in, but now I don’t even want to make a new account if it’ll just be terminated without warning again.

Before the ban on adult content, it was fine; there was no censorship. Now, you ban adult content yet still allow hate speech because you disagree with censorship. If you disagree with censorship, how about you legitimately go without censorship? If you feel comfortable enough censoring adult content (in an ineffective way I may add), what makes you feel so uncomfortable about silencing hate speech? Is hate speech more agreeable than “female presenting” nipples?"

Tumblr was my comfort zone in bad times, and seeing all the art, comedy, photography talents and writers’ proses were all I was there for. The satisfaction of looking at my pretty blog was my therapy. Now that’s ALL gone. I understand the ban on pornography, even though the explicitness and rawness of the site is what I admired.

While I understand what they were attempting with their new policy, they failed to get to other serious issues while allowing those that may cause harm to other be able to continue their way. With the recent policy taken into action on December 17, maybe people who's blogs where of no harm have been marked or flagged or deleted or just blurred. The issues were not resolved, rather it created more and while doing so lost many of the decent following it had that were forced to move their company and blogs to other sites.

1085,Seriouslywtftumblr,"December 23, 2018",1,"Alienating users and disenfranchised communities with a single app Rather than solve the problem of porn bots and child porn on its app, tumblr opted for the laziest path possible by eliminating all adult content using the most degrading, debasing language they could muster in their excuses to users. They went out of their way to shame women, the lgbtq community and others by their message that the female form is shameful. Furthermore, their technology epically fails in flagging the adult content and while completely benign posts are being flagged, porn bots are still getting a foothold on tumblr. Go back to the drawing board and stop alienating the users who made your app a success."
1086,GuardianSage,"December 27, 2018",1,"Wow, much safe, many secure, such ban..wow Their NSFW ban is a complete failure, you can find a bunch of porn bots on it and most inappropriate posts aren’t flagged. That and I have to question their priorities when one of the reasons for the failed ban is the safety and security of its users when there is a significant portion of racist and hate filled groups untouched. If they want to make tumblr supposedly safer for its users, then they either need to take a long look in the mirror about what’s dangerous. I think the majority of tumblr users understand the difference between adults  being sexual on a blog properly labeled as 18+ only and blogs that support and promote violence, hate and racism."

What was running through their minds while coming up with a solution to this recent censorship I would would pay a million dollars to know.

I RP and reblog mainly comic book related and Supernatural related things, and yet somehow that was grounds to mark me as explicit and make it impossible for me to go in and actually access my own content while logged in. And yet somehow porn bots thrive alongside Nazis and pedophiles *sarcastic applause* way to go Tumblr. What a way to provide a safer experience, and god forbid your a woman with nipples."

Every time I refresh I might get something from two days ago, or four hours ago, or three seconds ago. I have no way of controlling it.

If you want to see porn there are websites for that; nsfw stuff is not what was intended to go on this website. Tumblr is a great platform to connect, share thoughts, and not be judged. Just because the new update didn’t take out all of the porn boys doesn’t mean that the update wasn’t any good. Download and check it out for yourselves! :D"

We’ve been asking you to get rid of the porn bots and child pornography for YEARS now. Instead of actually getting rid of the problem, you chose to implant some kind of (bot?) that censors things that shouldn’t be. Plenty of GOOD artists are losing their accounts and their art is getting flagged for no valid reason. This app has always been somewhat chaotic, but I still enjoyed it bc of the content and artists; but now that you’ve taken that away I can confidently say this app has went down in quality tremendously. Good job, Tumblr."

With every update to the app or change to the site that has occurred since creating my account over 5 years ago, I always think “surely they can’t make this even worse or less enjoyable,” yet they continue to surpass my expectations. A vast majority of the real issues that staff has attempted to address persist despite dramatic changes. However, if tumblr’s ultimate goal is to get real users to delete their accounts and have only spam accounts remaining, then they’re doing great"

I’ve made many connections and thoroughly enjoy the interface this microblogging platform offers. HOWEVER, I have never encountered a more completely uninvolved, clueless of its own audience, almost utterly absent staff and management team. I have emailed support three times because their anti adult content algorithm is not working, and blogs that are swarmed with adult content continue to interact with me, mainly bots. This update has resolved nothing. And the staff is also unwilling to resolve. If it weren’t for the people on the website, and the interface, I’d be long gone."

The user base age limit needs to be raised to at least 16, the consenting porn and nude art and photography need to be brought back, the porn bots need to be removed (yes, they survived the purge of nsfw content), and for the love of god the nazi, racist, and other toxic blogs need to be dealt with!

On a personal level, it affects me, a random blogger with less than 150 followers, because my SFW blog has been deemed NSFW and I have reported this mistake to Tumblr twice with no response. Most strangely, they removed my blog’s header image. It’s a picture of my cat sleeping on a couch. I tried adding it back twice but it keeps getting removed.

They randomly ban legitimate users and have certainly ruined the livelihoods of a few people at the very least.

Not ads but just junk posts from whatever garbage they think you should see. The posts are the only thing you can x out. You cannot x out your followed blogs or ads. You can even say why you don't like them. Tumblr however will continue to show you the same dumb post over and over you already said you hated even when not an ad. I understand putting up with ads.

The app itself won't let me sign in to my account after I tried to reinstall in order to see if the constant crashing would stop if I updated completely. Turns out, after i redownloaded it and tried to sign in it- it WOULDNT LET ME. FIX IT. It's ridiculous that such a popular social media sight can't even get a simple app working properly anymore. You've done it before. Adding pointless updates is just ruining it and making the app useless."

Staff has never really appropriately responded to a problem in 5+ years, and every year they lose a new group due to some issue. Sometimes it’s child porn, other times it’s neo-nazi’s, or censorship, but if you’re looking for a stable platform this isn’t it. It isn’t a safe environment for kids, artists, or anyone- but if you’re here more for a casual half assed sharing of media and discourse then you’re in the right place."

Now Sfw blogs and posts are being flagged and everything is a near impossible to sort through tangle of garbage and waste. I don’t know how, but when everyone thinks the staff has managed to hit rock bottom with tumblr, staff manages to find a pick axe and keep digging down.

To my surprise it does, I can no longer have my posts in queue from the improperly flagged posts (of SAND) in risk of having it all jumbled and confusing.

This was my most used content application for sfw and nsfw content even more so than reddit. The fact it’s now censored limited the content we can see ruins the whole point of having an account. Being afraid of what we can post possibly not having our content published because of faulty rules drives creators away. Maybe putting parental controls if keeping content away from minors was the priority would be the best course of action so that adults and content creators can remain actively posturing sfw and nsfw content

In addition, the text on some blogs have letters replaced by question marks, which isn’t HUGE, but it’s still irritating. Great app, but fixing those two issues would make it better"

Art has taken a big hit too, and don’t even get me started on how all of this has affected the LGBT community. I understand trying to make this a more age appropriate social media platform, but this is utterly extreme. If I didn’t need my account to talk to friends, I would delete it in a heartbeat.

That was the sole selling point, like, yeah, half your followers are annoying pornbots, but at least my communities can speak freely.

As a woman, I find the ban on “female presenting” nipples a misogynistic insult. The removal of custom theming on web clients is nipping users’ customization freedoms in the bud.

The lack of action against pedophiles, nazi’s and hate in general is borderline complacent with what is happening on their site. Their banning of anything with a female nipple or what they consider “pornographic” is also ridiculous. There are plenty of ways to keep younger people from being able to access this content, however banning this and not pedophiles (actual illegal things) makes it quite clear what they think to be more important. Absolutely disappointed."

I saw the first examples of non specialized nudity on Tumblr when I first joined. These examples of nonsexualized women were some of the first I had EVER seen. I used to hate my body and suffered from eating disorders. This previous app helped me heal and love my body. I am thoroughly disappointed with the change to prioritize profit and to censor the female body. Eliminating a positive expression of art and human expression, is not the change to gain more users. This change is not a step in the right direction. This is a step towards more people hating their bodies."

Instead of fixing the problem of bots and Nazis and pedophiles, they’ve decided to target artists and users who come to the site to enjoy the freedom Tumblr used to offer. If you are going to punish your user base, it would make sense to punish EVERYBODY, including the nazis and bots and pedophiles. Hurting everyday users only hurts the site, but it is obvious that neither Yahoo nor Verison care and this is an obvious ploy to shut down the site. Man up and delete Tumblr or listen to the users and actually do your jobs."

What I want to see are the people I follow and not have their content buried by the flooding of references and advertising. I’ve addressed this and it’s gone without answer.

This site used to be a haven for people to safely express themselves and has turned into an oppression based site that targets LGBTQ and human bodies, yet does nothing to stop people who actually want to physically harm people from having a platform.

They said their new rules are to “protect the children” or whatever, and maybe there was a child p0rn problem (idk I never saw it). From what I saw, the real problem was the spam bots and nazis.  The reality of the situation is that they just want to make more money from ads, and rather than dealing with the problems they put out a blanket ban on nsfw content, punishing everyone for the faults of a few."

Posts in chronological order and the ability to view adult content.

Good luck if you’re the type of person that wants to see the most recent posts on your dash because you like to keep up with the blogs you’re following, because they will just show you the popular ones at the top no matter what feature you disable. I have not been able to get quality or user satisfaction out of this app for the past 6 months so I highly doubt they are trying to change anything. Guess it’s good for looking at your own posts and likes, but that’s about it."

I want to be able to log into multiple accounts rather than just one. I would also appreciate if the activity chart would actually work. Sometimes it’ll show that there is no activity on my blog, but then I’ll look at my actual posts and see that there has been activity! Notifications need work too."

So I downloaded browser extensions on the computer to continue displaying them the old way. Up until today, my mobile app had never messed with gifs at all. But now it seems that, if a gifset doesn’t match the dimensions it’s all fuzzy and blurry and messed up.  So now my blog and everyone else’s looks horrible."

But I’m giving it only 4 stars because of one very annoying thing: it keeps showing me the SAME DAMNED TUMBLRS as “suggested” over and over again. I would LOVE to have a way to say “please don’t show me this particular Tumblr again.” It’s not that they’re bad or offensive, just that I’m sick of seeing the same post from the same Tumblr repeatedly."

Well those people don’t run it anymore and now it’s trash. They allow hateful content like Nazi and alt right blogs, but they put out a mass censoring of things such as “female presenting nipples”. They act like it’s to create a safer environment, but that’s a lie. The new owners wanted to make more profit off of Ad revenue, so they alienated most of their users in a move of corporate greed. They used to have a section where you could message the staff if you had concerns, they deleted that feature after announcing this decision. They ruined it."
1306,thecloshow,"January 7, 2019",1,"Screw You You ruined everything that made Tumblr great. Just because of a problem that you ran into with people posting things that had to do with minors, you had to go and ban all adult content. Some of us used this site not only for enjoyment but for artistic expression. You say you do this to keep the site safe but yet it is infested with MAPs, Neo-Nazis, people idolizing murderers, and White Supremacists. You ruined it for the mass majority of us who use the site, ADULTS, who cannot get content we came for. Absolute disappointment. I want the time back that I spent on this site since around 2012. 🖕🏻"

Text posts and tags are deleted from the site if they contain words deemed inappropriate by the websites staff, though the rampant nazism, pornbots, and child pornography remains. It’s lost much of its appeal now that the fandoms on this site are so heavily policed, and it ruins the place meant to be for communication. It’s no more child friendly than it once was.

No matter how careful I am while scrolling they open anyway. It makes using the app really annoying. Tumblr has already been irritating enough as is since everything has been censored/banned. I really miss the old Tumblr. It used to be a safe place for everyone to express themselves. Also, I couldn’t find a place in the app to report bugs like the link issue. I don’t want to have to write reviews to report things."
1310,LegalMoose,"April 17, 2018",3,"Better The latest update fixed the settings issue where media would play over cellular data, even if you’d set it to never play or only play over WiFi. But it still continues the odd display of the original poster, and still doesn’t allow you to strip off the original poster’s notes, even where they’re spam links (the web interface is better on this aspect; it’s not clear why they changed this in the app)."

While I'm not sure if anyone else is having the same problems, I've seen some other reviews mentioning something going wrong after the update. Overall, I like the app itself, but it's hard to like it when you can't even get on it."

I personally now only in the Witchblr community and it’s so positive."
1313,The_Cupcake_Kid,"June 23, 2018",1,"Tumblr recommends children. As of lately, tumblr has felt it necessary to recommend blogs for you to follow. Because of this, over 40% of my feed has turned into sponsored ads as well as recommendations for 17 year old kids and even as young as 15. I’ve contacted tumblr as well as took precautions by deleting and or blocking recommended posts, but like plucking a gray hair, for everyone I delete, 4 more pop up. My feed has become NOTHING I like, all the recommendations are poor and offensive. This app encourages the following of minors and appearing to attempt to link adults to minors. High encourage tumblr to reconsider their values."
1314,MowgliBones,"August 1, 2018",1,What happened to Tumblr? Use to give Tumblr a 5 star rating. Now it’s a 1 for me. What is up with NOT having a choice but to view posts and blogs on my dashboard that I do not follow? Most of the time it is completely irrelevant to me and my purpose on Tumblr. What is the point in choosing what to follow and look at if other things are just going to be shoved down my throat. Have turned off every single feature that I can find and it still won’t stop. For me this makes Tumblr useless and pointless. Terrible “feature” to force on people. If Tumblr doesn’t change soon I know I’m done.

You could’ve just made it that NSFW content was allowed but had to be marked as nsfw so that accounts not interested in seeing nsfw content didn’t have to. You could’ve just removed the bots and explicit photos of children."
1319,Levondrius,"December 27, 2018",1,"Neo-Nazi user base is apparently more important than artwork of nude people now. So, in light of this app being removed from the App Store for allowing child pornography to be circulated, the absolutely incompetent staff running this site decides to run a bot that is so incompetent it bans the staff’s own post regarding the NSFW content ban. This does nothing except show that Tumblr does not care whatsoever about the child porn problem itself. Even better, there are still thousands of sex bot blogs still up in addition to the countless numbers of neo-Nazi and white supremacy blogs. How absolutely incompetent and money hungry can a social media website possibly be?"
1320,Ringtaile,"September 17, 2017",1,"3 updates, still terrible EDIT: Three updates later, this app is still practically unusable with its crashes and slow loading times. It doesn't help with the overflow of bots, 5-star bot reviews, and even the outright generousness of some people thinking we're ""too mean,"" especially when their review points out the same flaws we do. This has to stop. Tumblr already has notoriety with it, and some of us just want to simply browse in peace without a crash that makes the app virtually unusable to the point we have to constantly delete and redownload the app just to use it."
1321,Christine. L,"October 6, 2017",4,"Safe mode and chat The app overall is amazing. What I would change is the safe mode and  chat. Safe mode should be on for any users under the age of fourteen. The chat could be improved as well. It would be nice to be able to go back to old convo without the app crashing from scrolling too much. A option could be typing in a certain year, month, etc. and it goes back to that convo."
1322,Lee Horvath,"October 12, 2017",1,"Unusable. App crashes before it can load I enjoy Tumblr, but this app is terrible. The first few times I use this app, it will show a blank dashboard and then eventually load the posts. However, after a few uses, the app will simply crash before loading anything. Opening and closing the app or restarting my iPad (or both) have no effect on its functionality. I haven't been able to do anything to get the app to load before it crashes. The only fix I have found for this is to completely delete the app and then reinstall it. It's very annoying."

It's really frustrating."
1324,Angry Free User,"December 28, 2018",1,"Disappointing The core of tumblr is good-- great, even --but its management seems incapable of even pouring water out of a boot with instructions on the heel. It's sad to see this platform degrade every day. Little care for its userbase and its desires, even outside of policy changes made to anticipate new Internet regulation laws. Basic functionality has to be provided by third parties. Staff is woefully inept and cannot take care of its spam bot problem. Their NSFW filters are laughably ineffective and block SFW content constantly. Stay on this platform only if you've been there for years. There is no point in becoming a new member today."

Their staff doesn’t care about you or your complaints/wants, all they care about is ad revenue and using what was once a site for people to express themselves (albeit in occasionally tumultuous fashion) has now become ad fodder that ignores loyal members of the community and allows for heinous content such as white supremacy, nazism, and child p*rn*gr*phy. Until they actually wake up and learn to listen to their user base, avoid this site and app and find one that actually deserves your time and attention."

But the freedom of hard drug users and nazis/ white supremists, and serial killer glorification that is also on this app is way worse. If you just made your app age limit 18 and over and monitored more of the posts on there to prevent child pornography, it would easier and more user friendly. But instead you blocked out any type of pornographic freedom to users but still allow videos of people using hard drugs like crystal meth/ cocaine or allow users to post love letters to school shooters.... disappointment."

But don’t censor the rest of the (LEGAL) adult content that is a huge reason why a lot of people even go to tumblr in the first place. By censoring that content, you’re censoring the very audience you claim to want to inspire to be open and free about themselves and what they like, who they are, etc. Seriously disappointed to see the once great tumblr reduced to this."

They ban even sfw blogs, just posting pictures of rocks or lizards. SO many posts that are not nsfw get flagged, in fact it’s not even worth posting at all because of how likely it is to get flagged. And staff knows about these issues, they’ve known about the child predators and nazis for YEARS now, and they’ve still done nothing about it.

A lot of people are hating on the new update with the dark blue color, but I, as someone who can’t see very well, really love it and DO NOT WANT TO LOSE IT. So to accommodate both sides, maybe make it an optional thing. Somewhere in the settings put an option for the dark blue or the lighter blue. That way those who think it’s too harsh of a contrast can go back to the old one but those of us who need it can still have it."
1356,squirrelyranda_,"April 7, 2019",3,"Absolutely love it! (Especially since the NSFW content has decreased) It’s my go to app, day, and night. Buuuut, it’s been making my phone severely hot since the last update. It’s also been crashing a ton too. Fix that and I’ll increase stars and edit my review. I love the app though. Seriously. The community is by far the most beautiful. I’d just like to be able to be on it for longer without it crashing and making my phone feel like it’s going to explode. Thanks."
1357,bearjellies,"May 3, 2019",1,"I hope pornhub buys tumblr I’m done, they did nothing to stop toxic rapey porn accounts, race fetish accounts. All y’all did was make the porn blogs remove their hastags and continue to blog without censor and create different hollow accounts to continue blogging. I want trigger warnings back from harmful porn that i can filter out, not stumble upon every post that’s promotes unsafe practices and have to report it. I want to enjoy healthy porn with tags if choose to click onto. I want sex education and a platform for artists and sex workers who use pornography to make a living. If situation was bad before you made it worse."
1358,GeneralyUnhappy,"May 3, 2019",4,"Terrible place for demon people Tumblr doesn’t run well, the format is awful, the users are poison, and I’ve been on the site for ten years. The whole website is just one giant social experiment to see how the human mind breaks down when left alone for too long. Plus there’s more nazis than all the Indiana Jones movies combined. To be honest it’s a good website if you can wade though the emotional muck of it all. Lost a star for the nazis tho."

I see updates and bug fixes but none of these bugs are fixed."
1361,Techshiek88,"May 19, 2018",1,Terrible Update I love tumblr. I think they’ve done a good job improving the app over time. But this update has tripled the spam in my dashboard. I am fine with the promoted posts and the recommended blogs I get that tumblr has to make money but now I’m getting 5 recommended posts every few scrolls and I’m getting these huge pop ups ads as I scroll through. You’ve essentially tripled the amount of stuff I don’t want in my feed in one single update. Not to mention the recommended posts have NOTHING to do with the blogs I follow. This update makes the app borderline unusable. Please fix this.
1362,Phygfire,"May 20, 2018",1,I hate you I hate you for turning what was a relatively good app into a buggy mess that is filled with crashes and glitches and loading problems and then adding more garbage for me to load on my feed that nobody asked for. Whoever came up with the idea to put garbage on my feed without also adding a way to turn it off should be fired and gunned down. What kind of a stupid idea is adding things I don’t want to see above the things I do want to see? The ads don’t bother me as much as the unfunny jokes and bad art I see as well as the long posts of 1 person just talking a lot. Please revert!
1363,foxxyguy,"July 11, 2018",1,"Everything is awful With the tumblr app, that is. Message notifications appear, but not the messages themselves, forcing me to quit and relaunch the app. My feed is LITTERED with ads, and even the content I do want to see gets buried. Searching for a blog? Good luck, because the tumblr app never returns relevant results. And to add insult to injury, Yahoo STILL requires you to sign in because content “might be sensitive” with no way to opt out. This entire app and the tumblr service is beyond frustrating. Why Yahoo? Why are you doing this? The tumblr app and tumblr could be such a useful platform and you’re ruining it!"
1364,Shyamm Monifa,"August 7, 2018",1,"God awful The content of Tumblr is beyond great, I love everything in and I’ve been apart of the community for a long time. The first time it crashed I thought maybe I was scrolling too fast, maybe I had too many apps open. "
1365,Greystrip13,"December 17, 2018",1,"Don’t even bother The recent changes to the community guidelines have destroyed tumblr. An overreaction to an easily-avoidable problem has completely ruined the creative hub we had before. Now all art, pictures, audio, and video must be 100% kid-friendly. Whatever AI they’re using to detect not-child-friendly content is wildly unpredictable. Innocent images of seashells and snakes are being incorrectly flagged and wiped by the AI, which sees them as not-G-rated content. Don’t support this decision, and don’t bother joining the pathetic pile of remains that the tumblr userbase left behind when they all jumped ship. It’s pointless now."
1366,superflyduskull,"December 18, 2018",1,"“Female-presenting” nipples are bad but Nazis aren’t? Maybe, I dunno, get rid of the real actual problems plaguing your site instead of using a general censor that censors tons of SFW things (even one of the generic site icons!). As if a NSFW ban is gonna get rid of porn bots? And it’s good to know that getting rid of the pornbots is a higher priority than removing Nazis. What’s also good to know is instead of figuring out why we hate the term “female-presenting nipple” and changing accordingly, you condescendingly state you know that we hate it without doing anything to acknowledge why. Peace out, I’m going to pretty much all other social networking platforms."
1367,Grunt nightmare,"December 18, 2018",1,"WAS good until everyone had to be under a thumb I’ll be honest. The adult blogs was originally why I came. The utter expression of free reign, and free speech, and unrestricted content. But now that Tumblr is excluding an entire portion( and arguably their biggest statistic) of their users, it’s becoming  clear they only thing they care about is public image and investors, rather than staying true to what they were for almost-if not over- a decade. Until changes have been made to bring back this major population of Tumblr, they will lose, and continue to rapidly lose patronage from not only me, but countless others."
1368,VolcanicVocaloid,"December 18, 2018",1,"Take this back down immediately This platform is filled with the most vile scum of the earth imaginable and the staff have zero interest in actually cleaning things up. apples draconian policy’s about explicit content aside, the website is flooded with white supremacists, pedophiles, and militant social justice warriors, and the “fix” that the staff implemented to remove sexual content has already been found to have half a dozen glaring vulnerabilities that make it easier to work around then it is to tear a piece of single ply toilet paper. Apple should immediately remove the app again until they actually fix things"
1369,ColonelSamuel,"December 21, 2018",1,Went down hill I’ve used this app for several years. Much of it was NSFW. But then hundreds if not thousands of bots started showing up. My blocked listed just became the bot list. Not to mention I could never see a full list of who I follow or who follows me. And when it did show who I followed it often repeated them so example a blog called anime central would show up three times on the list. But other blogs wouldn’t show up at all even though if I search them up I still followed them. Now a all out nsfw ban and I still have these problems. It used to be such a good place. Not any more
1370,Olixia12,"October 14, 2017",5,"I love this app! I have a couple of requests though. Can you guys add voice chatting/Video Chatting please? I would love to be able to verbally communicate with my boyfriend aside from texting. Also, please ban porn blogs, I had to block a lot of them that kept following me and it makes me uncomfortable. I would make others uncomfortable as well. Thank you in advance ^^"
1371,JBFSU,"January 6, 2018",4,"Fun and frustrating Great app but buggy with messages...the ones you receive and select aren’t the ones you intended for that come up.  The one above or below does instead of the one you wanted.  As well, vid uploads are extremely frustrating.  Multiple multiple uploads of same vid haven’t uploaded.

But other than that I love it!"
1374,Scarred4lfe,"May 28, 2019",2,"Don’t have multiple blogs The tumblr app always worked fine for me until I decided to make another blog. Now whenever I get a message to my second blog, sometimes it won’t let me switch to its messages, same goes for notifications. It sometimes gives me the option to switch but it’s like rolling a dice to see if I can actually get my messages. The worst part is it still tells me I have a notification without letting me see it, and my OCD hates having notification bubbles on certain apps."

The people on this app are true gems & anyone who is able to read & view their images/ gifs should know how lucky they are. I’ve simply grown up with this app & people are far too critical.

Boy howdy do I have a website and app for you. It’s called Tumblr. You can start a blog for your insanely stupid word diarrhea AND the staff doesn’t even bother censoring it! Here’s the kicker, their stupid intelligent filtering system will flag completely mundane content, while your unsolicited Klan rants will run free like the nightmare cattle it is! Oh! Also forgot to mention that their has been almost no effort to stop the spread of adult content which contains minors. So tell your trash pedo friends too!

Tags like #gwlg #girlswholikegirls #womenlovewomen #menlovemen #topsurgery are consistently being flagged with its censorship for images that do not include nudity. While users have asked update after update for porn bots to be removed tumblr staff responded by removing artists content, gay couples celebrating their love, and our trans community celebrating their wins. Marketing this “censorship” as anything less than a homophobic, transphobic, and discriminatory act is reckless disregard for the truth. White supremacy tags still live while a photo of two gay women is tagged as inappropriate."

1382,cmore423,"December 21, 2018",1,"“t” is for terrible. Their new content regulations are absolutely ridiculous. All sorts of nudity gets band, but offensive, extremist, racist, and homophobic content gets to stay. Seems a little backwards if you ask me. There was definitely a better way of going about cleaning up the app to get rid of anything illegal, but the approach they took was just all wrong and they lost millions of content creators in the process. They destroyed the community that was created, which was the main draw towards the app in the first place. But don’t worry, white supremacy still lives on through various blogs."

They cowtow to Apple’s idiotic censorship rules, ignoring the fact that adults provide and pay for the lions share of the phones and content that is produced on their sites.  This site was incredible as a place for people of like minds to find one another. Now it’s another site afraid of Apple and the morality police. Pathetic and sad."

I have spent several years enjoying Tumblr WITHOUT the App; only recently returning to it for a tryout. Same CRAP different year. I enjoy Tumblr, but the folks trying to corral this herd of feline bloggers needs to understand the joy of freedom of expression & uncurtailed movement in a non-judgmental (and mostly supportive) environment. Tumblr Staff needs to get it together and rise to the occasion. "

The app itself is confusing to use now, way worse than the old version. Everything just seems to be in a separate tab and you have to jump through hoops to get to certain things. Please, start listening to your users and what majority WANTS, not what you think would be “beneficial.” A lot of people have given up on this site because it is so confusing now."

The newest thing is getting stuck in a video and it won’t go away, even when I force my phone off and back on. But in general it’s just awful. I know it’s not a limitation in technology because Facebook and Instagram aren’t like this. Maybe if Facebook buys tumblr they’ll finally have an app worth using."

Keep up the amazing work guys and gals!!!!
1395,MitchSFO,"June 10, 2018",2,Declining rapidly I use tumblr daily and it is slowly driving me nuts. I see same sponsored post all the time. I often feel that I see recommendations more than I see content from the tumblrs I follow. I get that the site needs to make money and drive engagement but the way it currently functions is turning me off the app altogether. I used to tolerate tumblrs they advertise stuff but I’ve started to prune my follow list because I felt as though I was being inundated.

It used to be well run and a safe place to protect everybody and all ideas. But in December 2018 the management has decided to become dictator’s of what is right and moral without any consideration for what their customers truly want or need. It is my sincere hope that they see the error in their decision but somehow I don’t see that happening anytime soon.

To take away art is a disgusting thing. To take away porn because of a few pedos and lack of good moderating is not the most logical action. Tumblr has provided a safe space for many, many people. It has brought the LGBT community together and helped spread awareness. It has seasonal ideas and beautiful images. However, taking away porn and nudity will destroy this platform.

Targeting women and any form of “nudity,” they created a flawed algorithm and mismanaged the actual threats to their site.

Even a reblog of Tumblr's own blog post announcing the new policy was flagged.

If Tumblr is so concerned with making it sexual free they should just make another app that allows their users to post what they want, and see what they want. Child free.

This ban does absolutely NOTHING to fix the issue that got Tumblr into this mess in the first place. It does not get rid of porn bots and only serves to censor those users who have adhered to the terms and services since the beginning. It hurts artists and writers. And it hurts innocent bloggers who do not even post NSFW content by flagging their posts. I’m very disappointed but not surprised, we have been telling you about the issues with porn bots and nazis for a long time... and you refuse to listen to us."

It’s the pornbots, the things that we’ve been forced to see since we were young, the things we blocked and reported but knew nothing would come of them. It’s the nazis, white supremacists, and generally just the dirty, nasty blogs we reported. We wanted you to help, to actually do something, not get rid of our freedom to post what we wanted and be helpful and kind to others. We wanted you to rid this site of fake porn blogs that hacked and infiltrated our own blogs. "

I’m only keeping it downloaded so that my review stays up, of, this trash app. It’s highly hypocritical to the 10th power how you allow female nudity, but, ban male nudity. It’s sexist, it’s homophobic and it’s downright unfair man... This app is a waste of space on your phones ladies and gents...

Your only option is to completely close out the app and lose whatever new blog you were looking at or all the progress you made on your dashboard. Also, videos that come from Instagram do not play.

The new ‘censoring’ feature is broken and hasn’t been fixed. Not only that, but the porn bots are worse than ever. Many people have complained about these issues but none have been fixed."

The algorithm that flags posts as nsfw is extremely inefficient, and tags non-nsfw content simply because there are flesh toned pixels. The overflow of bots could've easily been fixed with a Captcha test, and the content that directly harms children could've been removed through moderating the site, rather than banning everything nsfw. The app is already rated to be 17+ regardless, banning adult content is not the way to go."

Aside from that issue, this app is complete hell to use. It’s always glitching, randomly locks content so it’s not editable, and it’s quite evident that no one on the coding team ever talks to each other. Every “update” breaks something or decreases functionality. They are super lazy at dev and they don’t ever actually manage site issues or user reports. They simply want your eyes on the site to sell to advertisers. Your attention is their product and they don’t care about you."

The website as a whole is difficult to navigate, but the app is absolutely abysmal. If staff was willing to work with users to create a functional website, things would be different. The basic idea was great, but do to poor management and a complete disregard for user satisfaction, the execution is just awful.

By taking away our nsfw you are starting to become much like the other social media sites and that’s NOT a good thing. Also due to this whole thing your banning innocent posts.

I’m unable to see content from any of the blogs I chose to follow on my main blog and can’t find any way to remedy that. I’ve powered through a lot of annoying updates and bugs before, but this is making the app literally unusable for me."

Whenever you can if you could perhaps fix this I will be happy and continue on using it. Thank you. 😁
1485,princessfawned,"December 22, 2018",1,Tumblr is dying The owners of tumblr have no idea what quality control is. I guess when they went to business school they skipped that class. Child porn has been on their site for years but they didn't care to handle it until apple pulled their app. Instead of coming up with a solution they just inconvenience most their users and refused to listen to them as they’ve always done. My account is stuck in some kind sensitive material mode that I cant fix. My icon is stuck on one of their terrible designs. I wont be supporting tumblr in the future.

However, the new guidelines have censored absolutely everything, even content that is in no way inappropriate. What’s more, there are still pornbots, pedophiles, Nazi’s, and homophones crawling all over the site, and the staff has yet to do anything about them. Almost all of the LGBT content has been flagged, and countless innocent blogs have been shut down for no reason. Don’t support this website."

Now they decide to censor sexual content, for what appears to be no reason other than cause they got jealous. Still don’t censor hate speech, nazis, rude or inappropriate behavior but god forbid a titty is showing. Twitter still allows nudity though, just a suggestion!"

The algorithm does not work, and has also been formatted so a reporting system no longer has an explicit way of reporting the large deaths of neo-nazis and pedophiles who were largely unaffected by a site ban. Staff and owners need to realize what the real issues on there site is, which are the porn bots, nazi, and pedophiles without blaming the LGBT+ communities and POC who use their site.

Additionally the recent NSFW purge did next to nothing except kick out thousands SFW users. There are still many blogs and users that are or openly support pedophila but aren't noticed because they've started tagging their posts as sfw.

If it’s truly a safer tumblr that you’re going for as in safe for kids, remove NAZIS, PORN BOTS, PEDOPHILES, and the ANTI VAX MOVEMENT.

Additionally, the censorship algorithm hardly works in the first place, and of course does nothing to remove the truly offensive content perpetuated by the nazis flooding the site.

For some reason, the tags I blacklisted disappear from the ""filtering"" menu once I click out and go back in later. I had to access the mobile site on safari to remove the blacklisted tags. Stop your cheesy one-liners and go fix this. I'll give five stars if you do!"

I’m so close to deleting my account and uninstalling the app. I’m so tired of how the devs and staff ignore criticism and feedback in favor of garish updates and “quirky” dev notes. Also, they allow white supremacists to run blogs without repercussions. I don’t know how much longer this platform will exist. They blocked all NSFW content from being shared. The ads are suffocating and ridiculous. The tagging system doesn’t work anymore. I hate this app and website."

You did absolutely nothing to fix the real problems. Porn bots, nazis and pedophiles are still running rampant, yet perfectly sfw artists that make a living of your site are being flagged. But I guess that doesn’t matter to you now that you’re sitting all high and might cause your back on the App Store. This ban is misogynistic, homophobic and apparently pro-nazi."

The real problem wasn’t the alt right it was those darn female presenting nipples. Anyway, there is a man I met on there who is interested in buying my 4 year old daughter for THREE camels!

1562,Lunar Sloth,"February 9, 2018",1,"Nice Customization, Sometimes Unintuitive I like the app. It's very different from the desktop version, but it has its own charms. However, sometimes updates come out with little warning or notice and that can really put a damper on the user experience until you suss out exactly what's changed or you find a user post about it, and the location of some of the settings is rather unintuitive, which can make customizing your experience harder than it should be. Still, there is a lot of room for customization, which is appreciated."
1563,Meg Kolaho,"February 12, 2018",3,Awesome but.... I really love tumblr. The only thing I dislike is the changing privacy and timeline settings. It randomly changes without really telling us or letting us change it back. I get two different timelines on phone and computer even though I have them set up the same.

These are not adds, they’re pages the algo thinks I might want to see based on an errant click or two on a page that I was trying to dismiss.

The Staff is so incompetent that it’s still occuring, the bots literally tag themselves as sfw (safe for work) and they can post lurid content without harm, There is also multiple violent groups that home themselves on tumblr (neo nazis, pedophiles, mass shooter worshipers who literally plan out attacks) Like I could go on.

They installed a bot to combat porn, which in itself is ok with me, but the bot in place is absolute walnut. Anything with any skin tone and/or nipples (not even of the female presenting kind) was flagged and then later deleted. Even some of the most mundane photos were censored. You can ask for a photo to be manually uncensored, but that’s just kinda a pain. Of course, us users have been trying to combat the censorship, but nothing has worked.

If your age rating is still 17+, there is no reason to make tumblr more “family friendly” by banning, purging, and censoring NSFW content. Neonazi blogs and tags are still searchable and can be found by literally any one, but the trans, mental health, and sexworker blogs and tags have been flagged for “nsfw” content. This might just be me, but if your goal is truly family friendly, perhaps think about removing blogs dedicated to hate speech and the genocide of millions of people with different ethnic backgrounds/sexualities.

Which is quite a lot given how many spam bots there are) but continue to flood dashes with spam. And now even worse, spam bots are managing to hack accounts.

Also tumblr is not and should not be meant for children! Instead of listening to user concerns re: aforementioned issues, staff mocks us—most recently in response to rightful upset regarding the “female-presenting nipples” stipulation.

The website also purposely crashes on phones to try and make you use the app. I'm sure you make more money and track more data through the app. But the app is inferior in every way. Your search engine is terrible. I generally have to use google to search your site for me.

That’s weird. "
1609,AzizaAin,"June 23, 2019",2,Notifications being deleted This has been happening for months now and I don’t understand why it keeps happening. I’ve uninstalled it and reinstalled it thinking that it would work but it didn’t. I’ll get notifications and for example I’d have about 35 notifications so then after a few minutes of not going to check on the app and then going to swipe down so I can look at them they’ll all be gone. Then I’ll end up getting new ones.

I hate trying to reply to people on my secondary blog and my primary one being the on that shows up as the one that reply. It probably confuses people a lot. Or at least give me the option to switch which account I would like to reply with. Or submit different things to other accounts. It’s always my primary account that shows is replying or summiting and it’s really annoying. It should be like twitter where you can have multiple accounts and they’re not linked in any way 🙄

The layout was so easy and compact that I could place stanzas in the format I wanted and it still look neat. I can’t quite remember when the change happened, but the quotes became longer because of larger text which in turn makes the quotes take up more space and not look at visually pleasing. It would be awesome if a revert to that format was considered. "

I never see anything I’m actually interested in and it’s gotten so bad that recommended posts are outnumbering posts of blogs I follow. Why is this even a thing? There’s a search/explore page for recommended posts so why do they need to interrupt my dashboard as well? It’s messy and unorganized and I’m really considering not using the app anymore."

Afraid to make any post to know that a bot my mark it as “inappropriate”, is what’s going to ruin the place forever. To Tumblr, good luck trying to maintain the platform after tomorrow, you might be regarded as the second MySpace.

Now just because of certain individuals ruining this for the others, everyone suffers.  I’m going to back up everything and hope another website replaces a once amazing app. Your time is over."

Did they fix the porn bot problem? Did they increase staffing oversight?  No, no they did not. They chucked their history of harmless smut out with the harmful stuff and are using an algorithm that has so far proven to be useless to handle moderation. Congratulations, tumblr, you played yourself. Add it to the list of things Yahoo! paid too much for without thinking about it. Soon the crickets and bots will be the only ones reblogging."
1619,Kxsuki,"December 18, 2018",1,"Disgusting. So far tumblr has NOT listened to their users, they have instead taken it on their own to remove every little thing that popular artists make. Tumblr is hurting It’s community and is absolutely disgusting. I’ve been on this eight for two years now, and before they were alright. But now this is disgraceful. Pieces of art that people spent hours upon hours on are being removed, and the NSFW ban is unneeded. What we need is to get rid of the Nazi’s and such. The pornbots as well. It’s hard to believe that they still haven’t listened. This sight is the worst I’ve ever seen."

I have to log out and back in ever two minutes to even look at my dash, and I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling, resetting my phone, and even logging out of other devices. It’s hilarious considering the version description is that this was the perfect update, and that all others would just stray further from perfection - that’s a load of bull."

Searching tags is awful , notifications won’t load , constantly having a message pop up saying error, some times my posts won’t upload and if you edit the text on the app then go online it’s normal text (maybe done on purpose idk but kind of sad). On top of all that you still can’t edit / cut posts if you want to."

Completely harmless posts are being slashed because of the dysfunctional sorting system. Save your time and just don’t use this site."
1631,Kattertot,"December 21, 2018",1,"No NSFW? I guess I don’t need tumblr As a feminized female I was disappointed to see Tumblr take away a popular platform that gave a broad range of sexual voices to audiences that were not heterosexual male specific. What made tumblr appealing, was it’s driving popularity factor was not popular opinion like-based hearts. Tumblr’s principle seemed to allow individuals to express their individually, and others to seek comfort in the familiarity of likeness. I see no further point to have a tumblr, since this unique expression of individually no longer exist, and I already have a Instagram to brag to friends on 🤷‍♀️"

The safe search worked fine, you didn’t have to purge all content deemed “NSFW”. That was a ridiculous call, and absolutely unnecessary. If anything needs to be purged, it’s all the hate groups that are still up and running on here! Porn is bad but Neo-Nazis are ok?! Tumblr did not think this decision through at all."
1634,ThatElfFromSmirkwood,"December 29, 2018",1,"Doesn’t care about users There’s a childp0rn and p0rnbot problem on this website. There’s also a pretty big nazi/white supremacist problem. But instead of putting in the work to actually fix that stuff, tumblr lazily employed a subpar algorithm that flags “nsfw” posts. The p0rnbots are getting away with their behavior, and so are the nazis, but renaissance art blogs? Fitness blogs? Flagged. Ridiculous. They only did this to get back on the AppStore. Meanwhile there are actual children being harmed by some of their users, and nothing of substance has been done for them. Absolutely shameful."

I’ve had tumblr since 2015 and I’ve been one of her followers ever since. Recently, her blog has been blocked from my view. Her profile picture doesn’t show and most of the time, I have to search her by name to see her blog. It’s honestly ridiculous.

I had a picture on my blog of a frog that was marked explicit and the only reason I can see for that is you can see a hand somewhat in the picture.

Their idea was to just block any and all adult content, which is flagging posts that don’t even contain nudity and labeling sfw blogs as “explicit”. The app it’s self if buggy and broken and tends to just crash whenever it wants. Don’t download this app. Stay on Instagram or Twitter unless Tumblr fixes its self.

After years of asking for the various problems on this app to be fixed (including pornbots, nazis, and a huge child pornography issue), or at the very least addressed, tumblr decided to “solve” it by banning all nsfw content, forcing a lot of its content creators away. If they had listened to us and fixed these problems, the app wouldn’t have gotten removed in the first place.

It’s users were begging for them to please suspend people such as Nazi’s, Pedophiles, and other truly disgusting people, but instead, Tumblr decided to ban any and all nsfw content, which includes ART, by artists who need people to see and buy their content in order to have a life. This also includes female presenting nipples. Notice, I said female. They don’t care about male presenting nipples. Either ban both or ban neither.

The worst of all is that it keeps crashing, and won't open when I try to, and in the end I always have to delete the app and reinstall it again in order to be able to use it...

It’s more likely than you think!

Now, instead of actually doing their jobs and getting rid of bots, they're being LAZY and choosing to ban people and censor people who use this app and site as a safe space to express themselves fully. This is an attack on sex workers, and women. It only bans and states it bans ""female presenting nipples"". This is straight up sexism. I am no longer happy and don't know if I feel keep this app if you do not stop this. Thanks for the good times. ✌🏼"

What matters is making money, because advertisers don’t want to put ads next to “female-presenting nipples” (so Tumblr bans NSFW). But promise to leave the art, text posts, and pictures that omits private parts (spoiler: they don’t keep their promise). "

Jokes and art and everything else in between. But since it is the internet, there were some negative aspects like apparent Child Porn. But instead of taking care of that and removing the rampant amount of Nazis and Racists on the sight, Tumblr shot itself in the foot and banned all adult content. It’s a censored mess that I wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for a creative outlet. "
1684,Sky-SPR,"December 19, 2018",1,"Tumblr is Nazi garbage Even if Tumblr says it’s welcoming to sexual minorities and communities, the mere fact that it polices sex more than it polices hate speech, fascism, and Nazis means it’s already sold its soul to the Puritanical, evangelical “Christian” wing of consumerism and capitalism."

We had a nice close knit community of furries and other misunderstood niche groups that interacted on your site before the 17th. Many of us stopped logging in after the Dec 17th in protest. Many of what we feel is normal and acceptable in our community was deemed pornography. It was a very beautiful relationship we all had with each other and your sites’ freedom allowed us to interact with each other like a family. But no more.
1687,Avis Lupus,"December 27, 2018",1,"We’re here, we’re queer, you’ve betrayed us Tumblr was once a place for queer, mentally ill, and other ‘undesired’ folks to get together and discuss our experiences. Due to the NSFW ban, much of our discussion and interactions have been deemed inappropriate and banned, leaving us with few places to express ourselves freely. Because of greed this was taken from us in the worst way possible. We are silenced and the original problems still persist. Tumblr as a company likes to pretend they are woke and progressive but in this action they have proven themselves to be nothing but incompetent and greedy."
1688,Kelli9792,"December 29, 2018",1,"Going in the Wrong Direction How they decided to deal with the growing problems of inappropriate posts on the site was not done right. They didn’t solve the problem of the bots or hate speech. They only screwed over the people following the tagging rules in the first place. They say that these things are hard to fix in general, yet they put the programs in that messed it up within days of being kicked out of the store. It just shows you that they didn’t care what their users wanted, only what impacted their finances."

So instead of simply saving it, i have to screenshot the photo. Hopefully this is something that can be improved. Other than that, i enjoy this app a lot and its unique style."

It’s buggy, it crashes regularly. There generally isn’t a time you will use this app without having to force quit it in order to get a vital function to cooperate. It shows a huge lack of interest on the company’s part. Judging by the app, which should be a HUGE initiative, I am assuming they will fade Tumblr out completely.

I’m not going to go on FB or IG and blast about a side of me that my day to day life doesn’t see. Tumblr was an escape for many people, and it’s been gutted.

The only real problems I had were with the hateful, bigoted, misogynistic, or even outright Nazi bloggers who would often brigade LGBTQ+ bloggers and allies. Now, Tumblr has banned any adult content and left these hate groups to flourish. The people I follow are abandoning ship due to content being flagged even when there is no adult content present.

If they wanted to be a kid friendly website they should have made a children’s website not one that was originally for adults and then forcefully purged any adult content."

The NSFW ban that the Tumblr staff issued on Dec 17th, 2018 had little to no impact on the site. Porn bots still spam posts and inbox messages, posting inappropriate content without any indication of staff disapproval or account termination, while any post with images that are even remotely flesh colored is flagged and taken down.

1761,long-time tumblr artist,"December 20, 2018",1,"Horrible Staff The staff of Tumblr couldn’t give two shakes of a lamb’s tail about their users. By alienating and even deleting their loyal, big-time users, Tumblr staff has shown multiple times that they can’t be trusted with running a website (which was already working before Yahoo bought it). The site is rampant with child pornography and nazis, and staff does nothing to fix these issues despite adamant user request to do so. Tumblr has fallen prey to corporate greed- and it will come “tumbling” down before it realizes that its not a social media monopoly."
1762,mydatewiththepresidentsotter,"December 20, 2018",1,"I wish I could give zero I’m mostly doing this out of spite, I must admit, but in all seriousness, the tumblr staff has never once listened to its userbase. The only helpful thing that staff ever did was moving the reblog button to the bottom of the post, rather than the top, and that was at least 5 years ago. This censorship nonsense that is going on is literally fixing nothing and hurting innocent users. What about the nazis? What about the white supremacists? No. All Tumblr cares about is female presenting nipples and how that’s hurting their advertising revenue. Are you kidding? What a disgrace."
1763,Just A Simple Snail,"December 24, 2018",1,"A big disappointment and loss It’s absolutely appalling to see what has become of Tumblr and the way it is regulated. To single out and ban an entire gender while letting nazis run around freely on their site is horrid. Instead of fixing the problem they had Tumblr ruined what was being created, fan bases, friendships, working artists and a platform that for some was the only one they had to speak out a out what they believed in. I never thought I would see this happening to what I thought was the coolest place to show off your passions."
1764,Bcxdhbnkgds,"December 26, 2018",1,"They don’t care about their users They make decisions for their users based on how they can get the most money. They don’t listen to any complaints. They don’t  care that nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups have flourished on their site because it hasn’t been in the news or cost them any money. The only good thing about it is that the dashboard sorts by most recent instead of what’s popular. They would change that if it was profitable though. They don’t care about the site or it’s users. Just their money."
1765,iloseeverythingitouch,"December 26, 2018",1,The problems that caused the app to be removed from Apple store have not been fixed Porn bots are now hacking accounts and the bots are still very prevalent. The decision to completely remove adult content from the website was about as effective as slapping a crusty old bandaid on an obviously broken arm. Tumblr isn’t fixing the original issues. They’ve continued to ignore them and created an entirely new set of problems as a result. Innocent posts are being flagged as pornography while true porn is oozing through the cracks in their “security” measures.

For years they’ve been writing and rewriting algorithms that ruin their site and their user base, most recently one that decimated the artistic community but will leave blogs by literal Nazis alone. This site is full of nsfw bots and the Tumblr admins continually ignore requests from their users to remove illegitimate accounts and users who deliberately bully others. I can’t make a living as a freelance artist using this site anymore but stalkers, abusers, and pedophiles can keep targeting people all they want."
1767,MaddieMcClain,"January 2, 2019",1,"Quality is awful after nsfw removal Tumblr does not listen to its users and will continue to do so. Removing nsfw content was unrealistic and discriminatory. That content on tumblr was not only artistic, but educational in a lot of ways. Tumblr was a huge outlet for me as part of the LGBTQ community to learn about sexuality and alternative identities in a space that made me feel safe, and tumblr made the decision remove all that information, but leave nazi supremacist pages. This was once an app I loved, it is now boring, stale, and unresponsive to its users. No longer recommend."

I had a selfie on my blog so I sent them the link to that post as well as a recent selfie with a time post. Tumblr then stopped responding to me.

I myself gained over 7K followers from my posts. The mobile app became incredibly annoying months ago with ridiculous suggestions and recommendations of who I should follow? Sorry. Love cats.

This is the one where I can’t use the website or the app any more. My artist friends’ content is taken down, forcing them to move to other platforms just to exist on the internet. We’ve lost creative license over our own content."

In a desperate attempt to reclaim the app’s spot on the app store, they removed any and all sexual content, while racist and other such harmful content, as well as spam robot accounts, are still running rampant across the platform. In my opinion, they made a hasty choice which did not touch upon the actual reason behind the app’s removal from the store in the first place. On top of this, the AI they put in charge of moderation is broken at best."

Had no idea tumblr felt that gay ppl and black ppl were more dangerous than the p*rnbots that are still active and the actual nazis that were somehow spared. Luckily though, I came back to about 6 new p*rnbots following me. So that’s cool. If I had known artists, women, people of color, and queer people were the actual problem, I’d have stopped asking staff to get rid of the actual threats to kids. Good to know."

Two weeks after the ban of all NSFW content and there are still porn blogs with shady links interacting with my posts, not labeled as NSFW, yet half of my mutual followers are considered “sensitive content”. If not for the fact that I have made many friends before in my 2+ years of using this app, I would delete my account in a heartbeat and never use this company’s services again"

This site isn’t worth it anymore and I hope everyone else starts realizing it too. You guys don’t even deserve one star.

They site also allows nazi and other dangerous groups to spread hate speech on there site. The staff fails to listen to its users and fix its real problems. My advice until tumblr staff gets it together don’t bother with it.

I still get the occasional pornbot following me. They have a writing limit which harms the authors.

Overall I’m obsessed with tumblr because it’s just so well... tumblr I absolutely cannot live without its trendy pictures and hashtags it’s amazing.
1864,Aly vs the machines,"February 11, 2018",5,"Fun app Rey user friendly for new comers and always updating something new for us veterans. It’s mostly for sharing in your enjoyment. Share photo sets of your favorite movie or tv show, read someone’s analysis on your favorite book if you like, make new memes, or rp as your favorite actor or singer. I love the fan art most of all."
1865,Tatuuumm,"February 15, 2018",5,Amazing I’ve had my account since i was 12 years old and got the mobile version when i was 14. The app never really changes its layout too much and everything is simple and easy to use. I’d give up any other social media platform except this one.
1866,Kellie136,"February 17, 2018",5,Tumblr Blogger since 2011 I love this app so much! I have three different tumblr accounts. There all for different things. This is app is a great way to express yourself and meet new people that live elsewhere. No body I know in person follows me. That’s what I like about it. I don’t have to hide how I truly feel on this app.
1867,JBABCBDB,"February 18, 2018",5,"Best App I love how everyone on the site is respectful towards one another. Tumblr has really changed in the past couple of years for the better. No more explicit photos and inappropriate posts, the mobile app is really accessible, and posting things has become so easy. Thanks!"
1868,Amkam1473,"February 28, 2018",2,"The bugs aren’t fixed. The app keeps crashing. I’ll open it and immediately the app will crash. I’ve had to delete and reupload the app several times but it continues to crash immediately after reupload. Also, why aren’t you guys at Tumblr doing anything about copyright infringement? I have had several friends have their content stolen and when they try to bring up the issue to you at tumblr nothing gets done about it."

1870,Scott D..,"September 26, 2017",3,"Love Tumblr, hate today's update Tumblr has been my go to for social expression. I have been on board with all updates until this point.  They just removed security feature (password when opening app) and intermittently when you update the app, you can not paste anything into the comments when you reboot. "

1872,HotPieceOfBread,"November 8, 2017",1,Annoying issues After the latest update my app is slower has more bugs and now leaves a little one notification on the app on my home screen even though I have no new notifications. And the only way I can fix this is by logging out and back in. But when somebody causes a notification it’s right back and it bugs the hell out of me. I’ve used tumblr for ages and since being bought by yahoo has gone to hell and the latest updates have been the worst I’ve seen it.
1873,Valien_of_the_knight,"November 13, 2017",5,"Love it While I don't use it too often compared to other social media's I do love it the most as it's a place for creators to be expressive through aesthetics, fanfics, and much more. Tumblr truly has a bad rep due to some of the people that use it but I do believe that it is one of the best social media sites I've used."
1874,TeamIgnis2010,"November 13, 2017",4,"Almost 5 stars, but.... Still loving it. Only reason it didn’t get 5 stars (for me, don’t know if anyone else is having this issue) is since the last update, the app constantly tells me I have messages even when I read them. Just a bit annoying always thinking I have new messages, otherwise it works great."
1875,RandomGirl16,"November 20, 2017",1,"Great website, terrible app This app has a problem connecting to my account and makes me log out and back in every single time I open it. And I really do mean every single time. Sometimes I’ll log in and then it’ll immediately have the same problem again so I have no time to post or reblog anything before having to log out and back in again. Imagine going through this on an endless loop, and you have the tumblr app experience. Guess I’m sticking to the full website on my computer."
1876,repilequeen,"April 17, 2020",4,"Not horrible but not great I’m a person who posts my own content in bulk but the recent update made it where when you click on every photo it takes you in to an editing screen before you can add it to your post and that’s hella annoying and just pointless, please change it back."
1877,Vampria227,"November 27, 2019",1,"Links are too sensitive? A recent update proclaimed to improve accuracy with links while browsing the app, but now links are too sensitive. Tapping anywhere around the link ends up opening the link immediately. Some styles of posts contain a large number of links and scrolling past these types of posts is impossible as tapping even on the far end of the screen where the hyperlink does not reach still causes the link to open and redirect wherever it wants me to go."
1878,AndyOro.,"November 27, 2019",3,"I don’t know There is something wrong when I want to search for a blog.  I don’t know if it’s an error of the application or my phone, but when I enter the name of the blog, it doesn’t appear and the search bar freezes (the app does not hang, only the search bar) and, doesn’t register the entire name neither, only the first 3 or 4 letters, I hope you understand what I mean and fix it, please!  🙏🏼"
1879,Sierra Storm,"August 13, 2019",1,"UNHELPFUL SUPPORT Accidentally deleted my entire account a few months back, an account I had been using since 2010, and barely even got a response from support when I reached out DESPERATELY to see if they could help.

1880,greentyphoon,"December 30, 2018",1,"Just terrible I have used tumblr for years, but this year I quit and moved onto twitter. Constant bugs and a staff that doesn't listen to the user base was the final straw for me. Other users have said that they have reported pedophiles and nazis with no sight of either getting taken down, causing harm to other users and children. The UI is awful and deserves an improvement, the reports do nothing, and the whole site is covered in spambots. It is only a matter of time before this site is run into the ground and taken offline."
1881,megansue18,"January 1, 2019",1,"The new update fixed NOTHING I’m a minor, I’m one of the people this update was supposed to help. But still I make a post and the notes are flooded with bots, half my followers are bots, and nothing has changed. Actually no, scratch that, what changed is that my SFW posts on my own blog are now marked NSFW for NO REASON and I can’t fix it! All this update did is harm my blog and hide many of my favorite blogs from my dash, and I’ve never made or interacted with a NSFW post. @ staff moderate your site instead of turning the experience into a hellscape."
1882,15378262822,"January 4, 2019",4,Actual trashcan of a social media platform This site is literally trash but sorting the the piles of literal garbage is worth it when you find that one good meme that makes you laugh for ten hours and then never think about again until 2 years later at a funeral and start laughing again. so I would give it 8 out of 10 shreks
1883,alicat0625,"January 10, 2019",1,"Strange priorities Porn bots and neo-nazis still run rampant, but “female-presenting nipples” are gone. Admittedly, I never cared about there being “NSFW” content to begin with outside of say art pieces or protest pieces, but many people did. Their algorithm for flagging it is awful. Tagging things as SFW confuses and will get it to pass things automatically, but I’ve also seen it flag anything from some girl’s flower tattoo on her wrist to sculptures with nipples as NSFW. I get they just did this to get back in the App Store, but they didn’t actually solve any of the problems we actually wanted solved."
1884,Opal Mongoose,"January 11, 2019",1,"Horrible app, horrible staff For the past year I have been consistently followed by porn bots and it’s only gotten worse since December 17, 2018. And every time I post a profile picture it gets blurred like I’m nsfw when my blog is completely fine. Please fix the bot problem or you will continue to loose users. I wish we could file a case against you guys because at this point it’s harassment and I’m not enjoying the app like I used to. "
1885,Lunascarred,"January 23, 2019",1,"Had to do it to em. I’ve been using tumblr for the past 6 years, I used to love it, but the only consistent thing about the site now is the unanimous decision upon it’s users; that the editors and creators of tumblr worsen the quality of the heckin web page with every update. "
1886,Anon Blogger,"March 8, 2019",5,"Blog I personally use it to create a online anonymous blog where i can talk about my feelings. There’s tons of people on here that do that (writing, art, poems) and it’s really cool that you can just have a little fan base or none and just have something to look back to and feel happy and content"
1887,Naomi Ballinger,"April 25, 2019",5,"Nice Coming here from Pinterest after their recent RIDICULOUS update. I'm new to Tumblr and just wanted to say the UI is beautiful. However, sometimes when editing the dashboard thing, it kinda bugs out and won't let you click anything except for cancel or save. Fix pls. <3"
1888,yraliH,"July 15, 2019",1,"Trashy advertising I can’t remove. My feed is crowded with advertisements for “Blue Chew” which seems to just be chewable viagra. Photos for the ads match that idea. This is TRASHY and does not belong on my feed. I do not want sexual ads, especially without any way to report it or hide it. I understand advertisements are necessary, but not this filth. In addition, there is no way to contact Tumblr to ask about this. I am deleting this app until I hear that this issue has been fixed. "
1889,foxesarecute,"June 22, 2019",3,"Flagged posts Okay I get the whole adult content thing, but.. it personally ticks me off that if I have a post that’s flagged on my blog, I don’t have the option to see what it is or even delete it off of my blog. Chances are I don’t want it there anymore, but there’s no option for me to get rid of it?? I try to appeal what I can but some posts aren’t accepted, so what, I’m just stuck with this on my blog forever? Thanks."
1890,hadestitan90,"December 14, 2018",1,In time y’all lose more then you think With these new changes y’all are going to end up closing up and shutting down the app iTunes has already taken it off its App Store so people that get new iPhones or iPads can’t get your app this is a place for everyone and everything just because some snowflakes have there panties in a bunch. You should put a security setting that anyone under 18 can’t see certain content but hey let’s destroy our app because of some snowflakes. Good job tumblr keep up the good work.
1891,your review too,"December 15, 2018",1,"It never was for under 17, still listed that way The bots are still running rampant, now they just hit SFW posts.  CP will still be available in written form with no filter. You will still be able to “hate” unaffected, hey if the nazi’s can do it why not you. My friends that found this as a safe space to explore their sexuality beyond the “1950s man woman married with twin beds“ no longer feel safe. The artists I enjoy can no longer freely express or show all their work. "
1892,psychosomaticpianist,"December 17, 2018",1,"Is this seriously how you deal with a problem? Tumblr’s adult content ban does literally nothing but enrage and alienate its userbaseband probably won’t even kick the porn bots off. Plus they haven’t even dealt with the Nazis (who are posting content that is literally illegal in certain jurisdictions) and the trolls. On the verge of uninstalling the app and deleting my account. If the website ends up being shut down because of this, then it frankly deserved it. Will never, ever buy or download another Verizon product for the rest of my life."
1893,stardustoflucis,"December 17, 2018",1,"Staff, Figure it out Tumblr has continuously ignored bot problems and racism/white supremecy while rolling out features to ‘make tumblr more safe and positive’ that only harms the users who aren’t hurting anyone. Many art blogs are having posts flagged that are perfectly sfw while i’ve had porn bots popping up relentlessly unders tags such as easter, fall, winter, etc. Generally safe tags. Tumblr has failed their userbase once again, wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people left en masse. It’s not a good fandom space anymore, honestly. It’s barely worth having installed."
1894,Messiah of Authors,"December 18, 2018",1,"Censorship Instead of fixing real problems like the Nazi, white supremacist blogs and bots, they decided to just go and censor everything that will ultimately hurt artists and even cause problems for many classical art blogs (lets be real, people will abuse the flagging button for anything). Also, the app has crashed thousands of times since I’ve gotten it and it has never been really fixed. Good job, Tumblr. Also, what’s with censoring “females presenting nipples”? What about our non-binary and gender non-conforming folks on here? Way to be smooth, y’all."
1895,SilverScreenCreative,"December 18, 2018",1,Tumbled to delete the app Once they decided to start censoring profiles and images and content it took away from what it used to be as a photo community. I understand some images were on the edge of pornography was somewhere actually beautiful and even though they might be considered pornographic they were art. It was a cool place to look at and exchange images... at this point I would go to Pinterest or Instagram because this no longer has what it used to have which is freedom of expression
1896,Bill Overbeck,"December 18, 2018",1,"Delete This Review Poorly coded, poorly managed, and poorly upheld. The new terms and conditions did nothing to solve the problem of making the site “family friendly” and has harmed many content creators. Taken down briefly from the App Store in the midst of an illegal pornography scandal, the management promised to do something about adult content only to ultimately fail their goal and punish many users while bots that solicit unwanted porn run amuck. Overall, Yahoo has shown utter incompetence and little to no concern for its customers."
1897,Cittykat17597,"December 20, 2018",1,"The Purge and then some I think it’s all been said here already; the Tumblr purge is just wrong, even though I myself have no interest in porn. The bot is a piece of crap and staff are idiots who can’t fix the real problems.  On top of that, the app has been SUPER BUGGY lately.  If I click on a notification it bugs out my inbox and won’t open the post unless I have already opened tumblr to my inbox.  And when I want to reblog posts, it often glitches so its trying to make me reblog it to someone else’s blog."
1898,Rubber Lizard,"December 24, 2018",2,"Free Isn’t Free Let’s get something out of the way — the app is fine. However, as everyone knows, Tumblr has recently banned adult content on the platform. I get it — you can’t put an advertisement for a Chevy under a photo of a couple engaged in BDSM. However, the algorithm is inaccurate and just destroys the experience. I would like to see the introduction of a paid tier which would allow you to bypass the ads and the NSFW ban nonsense. Creators deserve better, and so does Tumblr."
1899,msathena123,"December 30, 2018",1,"NSFW and iOS compatibility First since the new tumblr was released it’s been horrific, y’all literally killed your user based by banning nsfw post. Think it’s pretty messed up imo. Main reason I came to tumblr was for that exact reason now that I can remember. Second tumblr is terrible on iOS phones. Constantly crashing, scrolling through liked post after 20-40 post it starts to lag and no long show, videos struggle to run. I’m very disappointed and this is why I never am coming back to tumblr."
1900,leahkalei,"March 5, 2018",5,Tumblr is amazingly creative I love tumblr for all its creative images and all the art you can find on there through poetry or photography.

I’m fairly new to Tumblr, so take my review with a grain of salt.  With that said, Tumblr promotes very strong anti 2nd Amendment posts/blogs, while not promoting a single pro 2nd Amendment post.  While this is well within their right as a private organization, it does not allow an open and honest dialogue.  I will not give a 1 star review because of political/religious beliefs, but it is concerning that a social media outlet promotes an agenda and not free thought."
1904,Mr.universal,"March 25, 2018",5,Long Time User Multiple Interfaces This app is hands down the wave of the future when it comes to communicating. Would love to be a beta tester and share some insight to propel the app and site to a global arena. Impeccable Marketing Skills!

1905,Literroy,"June 30, 2018",1,"“Recommended” posts defeat the point Ever since the inclusion of ‘recommended’ posts in the timeline, this app has been borderline unusable. I carefully curate who I want to see on my dashboard, and the recommended posts are irrelevant at best, and highly offensive at worst. I get why you have to show me ads, you have to make money, but there is no reason to show me these posts. Remove the feature, or give me the option to disable them, but I don’t think I can use this app anymore until one of those things happens."

It is really obnoxious because to put them away I have to click X, and the settings doesn’t work either, they stay there anyways, and is not just one or two, is about 5 or 6 in a row. Not even counting of how much adds are in the middle, is getting out of hand"
1908,macxpv,"September 19, 2018",4,"A wonderful app I like Tumblr and am most fond that it hasn’t become like every other social app. I discover abstract art and still come across posts where I can stay connected to the outside world.

Not that user friendly. "
1910,~TheodoreKeeler95,"October 6, 2017",3,"Few things. I love the app. The app could be more worked on since the app crashes after preloading page after page from scrolling so much.

It eats the posts and picture you try to put on your page until after awhile you either give up out of frustration or the app just crashes all together.

For years we warned them about the increase in p0rn bots and ch*ld p0rn appearing on the app but they ignored it! It wasn’t until the issue became too great that they decided to just remove all content they deem nsfw. My art pieces and drawings of Greek sculptures/figures were flagged as inappropriate. Rather than communicate with users and listen to our warnings, they rather attack the nsfw community. Oh and funny how they’ll go after nsfw blogs but they IGNORE Nazi and White Supremacist blogs. Just shows who they want to give a platform to"
1921,yepyep987,"December 22, 2018",1,"Bad, do not care about their users They don’t care about their user base and what they want. They still haven’t added simple things, like volume controls on videos. They think that nipples and human bodies are more offensive and damaging than nazis and actual fascist propaganda. They oddly think tumblr is a family site when it has literally never been a family site. Of course Apple has a hand in Tumblr’s censorship, but still, they’re sacrificing their current user base for a user base they never had."

There are still porn bots, and oh YEAH there’s still nazis c: Not to mention the fact that my dash is just garbage now cause it’s not showing half of the people I follow’s posts. Maybe you should actually listen to your customer base and I DUNNO fix your site instead of doing random purges.

Content that is perfectly safe (like a dog laying on a couch) are being censored as nsfw. Women’s skin is nsfw. They continue to do nothing about the nazis. There are still pornbots everywhere. They haven’t fixed anything but simply made it worse. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option. Do not use this terrible app or the website."

If this app had a better staff team then those problems could be managed, but instead the staff would rather wait 4 years so their app is shut down and rush out a messy fix to get it back up, because regular updates and community feedback is too much for their apathetic minds."

1935,Amelia 😄,"July 19, 2018",2,"Too much effort Too much effort on the wrong things. That’s why the app crashes and freezes. It’s a mobile app you can’t fit the whole site on here. It’s thoughtful to try and accommodate the mobile users but it’s affecting the experience at this point. I used to think it was bc I had an old phone but I have an iPhone 8 and very slow, freezes, glitches while I try to edit, scrolls me out of place. I love tumblr and I’ll be loyal just help us out😩"

I can’t get into my old account attached to my email and it’s currently inactive (because I forgot the password) But now it says “email in use” and I can’t do anything on my new account. Please please please change something so I can do stuff. Thank you😁
1937,Katelyn☕️,"September 5, 2018",5,"Tumblr Personally I think this is a great app, the whole set up in general i just absolutely love.

Some commission are nsfw, and because of that tumblr banned them and all their art.

1939,shadowbannedartist,"December 18, 2018",1,Money is all that ever matters Couldn’t careless about its users and this apple bs is what ruined so many artists and content creators. They shadow ban people and now you’re trapped in an echo chamber of only people who were always following you. No one else can see you so there’s no point in posting. You might as well not exist. I’m never dealing with apple again after this. This just proves that no matter what no one can just run an app without big companies and them playing bankruptcy chicken. Until one of them capitulates.

The only reason I don give it a 5 star rating is because it doesn’t have the ability to navigate someone’s blog in the archive mode. We post a lot of content these days and navigating one post at a time a real pain."

The app will work for a couple uses, but once it crashes, you’re done. If you try to open it again, it just immediate crashes. The only solution is to delete the app and redownload. Then you start the cycle over. This has been going on for most of 2017, and despite multiple updates, this issue has never been fixed. Completely frustrating."

Otherwise Tumblr is a great app.

I love this app it is really great."

There is a new awakening about all the different sex roles, consenting adults have.  Your portrayal of very tastefully done nude men is what you are famous for.

1955,Ariizzz,"December 28, 2019",2,"Tumblr used to be better I enjoyed tumblr more when “naughty” content was allowed. I don’t believe showing a woman’s nipples, for example, should be completely unacceptable. If the problem is regarding kids seeing that content, make some sort of regulation that restricts those Children from being able to access that content. I’ve been using tumblr for more than 10 years & I use it less now, mainly because of that."

Thanks again."
1960,Mauddiepie,"December 29, 2018",1,"Seriously? It used to be a great place to meet people who shared your interests. Then the Nazis and the pornbots came and no matter how much we begged, Tumblr wouldn’t remove them. Seriously, this has been an issue for YEARS! They honestly didn’t give a crap about what was on the site until they got taken off the store. Then, all of a sudden, it’s like jumping back in time 300 years and Goody Perkins is going around yammering about witchcraft. You can’t talk about your experiences as an LGBTQIA person, but pornbots and Nazis are perfectly OK."

1962,JaxAnimations,"December 30, 2018",1,"If I could rate 0 stars I would.. ..because your new policy is garbage! You didn't fix a single thing, in fact all you did was making artists leave your site. All the Nazi blogs, p0rnbots, and just bots in general, are still running rampant through the site! What's even worse is that ever since the ban on nsfw content I've been seeing MORE of those Nazi and white supremacist blogs, of which I've never seen UNTIL you banned nsfw content! If you wanted to completely ruin your site then hey, you did a great job, you idiots."
1963,uuugggggghhh,"January 2, 2019",1,"Censorship Tumblr is an absolute mess of a social media site; it always has been, with its bugs, unhelpful updates, and unresponsive staff. But now? It’s censoring not only nudity, but practically all fanart, and many pictures of perfectly sfw content. The pornbots, of course, are thriving, and Tumblr staff clearly has no problem with actual Nazis, bigots, and p*dophiles. Plenty of bloggers I know have stopped using it all together because of this disastrous, faux-family interest-oriented, patchwork algorithm. Bring back the artists’ content, and throw out the fascists."
1964,adamsentz,"January 3, 2019",1,"Posting via app shrinks photos/videos Posting photos and videos via URL are the main things I use the app for, but a few months back the app started massively shrinking photos and making the video embeds really small on my blog. I have to post from mobile Safari to get them to work properly which pretty much makes the app useless to me. This also means I can only make single photo posts since that is all the mobile web interface allows which is also a bummer."
1965,Toothie Forbush 9,"February 20, 2019",4,"Post Limit So, I wasn’t aware of this, but tumblr limits your reblogging and posting to 250 a day, reset at midnight New York time. Which in my opinion is very very very stupid. This site is designed for posting and reblogging, and then after ONLY 250 posts, it blocks you from doing any reblogging, posting, answering questions, or anything like that. Fix this for 5 stars."
1966,KawaiiNeko139,"March 3, 2019",2,"Nothing’s changed After the NSFW purge, I expected that there would be no more porn bots but alas I am still being followed by porn bots. Getting rid of all NSFW content hasn’t solved anything and I believe the bot problem is just getting worse. Before I would just be followed by a bot once and awhile, but now I am being followed by them every few weeks. I go on Tumblr everyday, but ya’ll still haven’t fixed the problem we told you should be fixed."
1967,Bigdozer1980,"March 3, 2019",1,Hate the change Been a member for years. When they announced the changes in dec it went to S#^+ and now all the search engines block certain words stuff that has nothing to do with nudity it blocks it says nothing exists on that subject. Which I know is bull crap cause I’ve looked that stuff up for years. So I wish it would go back to the way it was or someone would start a new blog to take all of tumblr’s users and we could start over fresh and go back to way things where

Now they’ve added “suggested pages” to the dashboard about people and posts that I could care less about. And it takes F.O.R.E.V.E.R. to weed through them all. I will outright tell you that I was flagging every single one of them. This feature is so stupid and annoying and I have deleted my tumblr and the app because of it. After 5 years.

Such a shame the ‘Community Guidelines’ are being changed to prevent any nudity from being posted and shared. The unfiltered approach to social media of what made this site/App special. I’m sad to say I won’t be using this site as a source for sharing and viewing content with all my friends and Followers once this horrendous update happens on the 17th.

Even reblogging a gif can get taken down now. They created this ban, instead of improving the moderator system, and now Tumblr isn't even decent anymore. No matter how ""cringey"" I thought Tumblr was, I did enjoy expressing myself and making online friends, and now that's not gonna be possible anymore.

I understand that they would want to at least get rid of the pornbots, but taking away all nsfw content? That’s disrespectful and uncalled for. Maybe creators work hard to share their pieces, whether it’s sfw or not. Taking away that aspect of their work is taking away a freedom they had. The right to freedom of speech and such. They have the freedom to draw, create, or do as they please, because that is their right. Thank you for your time, hope you understand."

I’m basically only still using this site until I’m better established on other social media, such as Pillowfort (which y’all should check out! It’s nazi free, doesn’t have puritanical censorship, and actually VALUES its users!!). I’m taking my female presenting nipples elsewhere, at least until they get their act together, which I’m less and less optimistic is ever going to happen."

Every update makes the app functionality worse, and it’s to the point where half of the time, it doesn’t even function.

Great community with supportive people.

When will I be able to edit posts without all the html crap popping up and no way to switch out of it. It would be great if you created an option where we can switch back and forth between it so that people with html experience can use it and people that don’t have the experience and don’t want to mess everything up can just edit it like they would on the desktop.

This includes the app crashing and refusing to work ever again (it must be deleted & redownload at this point), images refusing to load at all, and counter features (# of messages, followers, notes) being broken or inaccurate. This app has inefficient and convoluted design, and counter productive features that make the experience of using the app frustrating to use at all. So yeah way to go. Nice Job™"

The pornbots even have found a loophole from getting flagged which everyone was complaining. They removed people porn type of content but kept the white nationalists and nazis. They make the website worse and made a lot people’s works get deleted. There system is flawed and I still see nsfw content on my dash.
2004,Mrscribs,"December 30, 2018",1,"At least you tried It was a great app, at first you could post whatever and meet new people sharing the same fandom with you but now after the update on the 17th , it’s barely anything at all . You get censored for everything you post , nsfw or not, at this point I don’t even care about nsfw , I care about how everything is blocked and everyone is getting deleted , it’s not even getting rid of p0rnbots ,but a nipple will get your blog deleted ,it’s stupid .ya had a good app , but ya went and ruined it."

I’m going to leave it in few weeks when I have complete back up of my pictures and see where others are going. There are many other options out there! Thanks everyone for your work on this app, it used to be good."

Whether I’d be a repost, text post, quote, or anything, when ever I tap to type my message it refuses to bring up the keyboard and glitches out.

This app is ate up with so many disgusting things that the child porn problem was never taken off! If your not careful Tumblr will actually recommend disgusting content for you to view! This app is not taking swift action to clean its self up. In fact I feel like they are promoting the problem! We need Apple to take it back off the market place. They are rotting the minds of thousands and no one is taking the stand! So here is my stand!! BEWARE THIS APP! ITS VERY DANGEROUS AND DISGUSTING!!"

Honestly pathetic they cannot accept criticism, apparently, since it’s happened to so many people - I will continue to voice my displeasure no matter how many times my review gets deleted. The app already crashed and barely loaded but this new adult material ban ruins artist careers and fandom space. They are destroying their own site and they clearly don’t care about their users. Tumblr never was for children to begin with. Removing all adult content was the wrong way to solve content problems."

This website used to be my absolute favorite, so much so that I’d put up with the mediocre app. This is truly the end of an era. Don’t download or get invested.

Not to mention erroneously flagging perfectly appropriate posts without notifying their users or providing us an easy way of finding and disputing them, while spamming us with pointless and irrelevant ads. This lazy and irresponsible response to being removed from the App Store is going to be the downfall of what was once a great app/forum for social media and fandom."

Livejournal and FFNet both cracked down on adult content, and no one uses them today. If tumblr doesn’t shape up, that’s its future.

The policy isn’t even well written, citing something known as “female presenting nipples.” What is a female presenting nipple, exactly? This wording (and other bad grammar) leaves users confused about what is and isn’t allowed on the site. I can’t give more than one star until the site changes its policy and runs more smoothly."

It used to be a really great app and I love tumblr I’ve been using it for years but now I barely use it because it’s just too slow and doesn’t work more than half the time that I try to use it.

Porn bots are still rampant and staff has done nothing to fix that. Same with the neo-nazis and white supremacists. It’s all rather stupid to be quite frank. The updates they roll out have done nothing that users have been begging for.

Their detection bot is so poor it even flagged their own post containing examples of “acceptable female-presenting nipples” This website is a mess and until it starts listening to its users I would not recommend joining."

It was the only platform that was unique in comparison to Instagram. It allowed the human body to be recognized as an art form. For them to make it “inappropriate” is absurd and has jumped on the bandwagon of being “user friendly for all.” In life you can’t please everyone and tumblr was that but in the form of social media.

A lot of SFW posts were flagged, even some blogs were taken down. Sure we can argue these things take time to work out, but all this has seriously accomplished is breaking your community and app/site more. I’ve been on this for 7 years, it was the cool “anything goes” platform away from the other social sites. Here’s to the end of an era I guess."

Don’t push your inability to filter child pornography onto it’s users. And the real reason you put the ban is just so Verizon could start to put ads in tumblr. Apparently Verizon can’t put ads in next to porn. Disappointingly you’re like every other corporation who only cares about money, not their user satisfaction or happiness."

At this point, it’s really not worth joining if you don’t already have an account as the site has just gotten worse and worse over the years and it’s at an all time low right now for sure."

2241,Turkk33,"August 12, 2018",1,Remove “Recomended” content Tumblr allows you to turn off a slew of recommendations so they don’t clutter your dashboard. Yet they still keep their own “recommended” content where they see fit. I get that ads need to be present and they are easy to scroll past. But I’m tired of of clicking the “x” to then click “whoosh this particular post away” for 5+ pieces of random content. I turned this all off already! Get the hint. I don’t want your stuff on their either. This ruins the platform.

After I downloaded it I started to get lots of emailed spam and it never stopped.  You have to be careful what you click in and post cause they will shut down your blog for posting anything that might offended or hurt someone’s feelings. Not worth downloading because of how restrictive they are about what you can and can’t post.  You can’t express yourself like you can with other blogs.

You have issues tumblr and taking away nsfw content or Female-presenting nipples isn’t how you fix them. You should be taking away the pedophiles, porn bots and nazis."

It was bad enough when they started showing me what they thought was “best” first, but now 2/3rds of what I see in the app are suggested posts. And the app doesn’t seem to learn what you as the user actually want to see. It continues to suggest way off-topic tumblrs.  On top of that the app has lost its simplicity. Bleh."

I don’t know who got paid what to make that feature permanent but they need to take a long walk off a short bridge over a lot of spikes and lemon juice.

It’s my love. But,,,, y’all... never listen to the people. Y’all just do dumb stuff and then go “oops oh well” when everyone hates it. Maybe listen to your users instead of not caring about us and only caring about profits. I love tumblr and I don’t want to leave any time soon."
2293,nayalovescookies,"December 16, 2018",1,🤷🏽‍♀️ It appears as though the staff is stupid...taking away the ability to post NSFW content will hurt so many innocent people such as artists..if you think about it NSFW is what made tumblr because there’s nothing really special about the app..and on top of it you choose to do this but won’t address the other issues that have been going on for years 🤦🏽‍♀️and also innocent things are being flagged down 🤷🏽‍♀️for what? And can i just say why don’t y’all focus on the bad people

Unapologetically disrespectful to their userbase. Hopefully the Dec 17 logoff sends a hint if this pile of one star reviews doesn’t. Oh oh lest you think this is all a made up review I’ll add on a technical level, their messaging system is a mess, I’ve seen “saved” drafts just disappear and most times whoever left the last note on a post fills my entire screen with that one notification. It’s a dumpster fire technically too."

2298,Annoyed Tumblr User,"December 18, 2018",1,"Staff is the most laziest incompetent conservative faces on this world Don’t sign up. Don’t download the app. Don’t relate to tumblr at all. They’re so lazy to get rid of bigotry on their site but removes progressive movements and even now adult content than go through to get rid of pedophiles, nazi’s, and other harmful hate groups. They’re just the absolute worst. There’s always going to be bugs and glitches on the apps as well. They’ve still not fixed the random unfollows that’s been going on for more than a year now."
2299,j2taranto,"December 18, 2018",1,"Deleted the app, my acct, and considering switching internet service providers Censorship is just not tolerable. The new policies are sexist and are deleting years worth of queer-sex-positivity culture. This is the vhs vs betamax of our time. You can’t maintain your prestige, nor any shred of the alt-desirability you once had. Perhaps the platform changed, but it WAS something authentic and free. I’ll step up my usage of Twitter until someone decides to listen to the consumers you’ve forsaken in a struggle for means to whatever futile end awaits your platform. ✌️"

I constantly check to see if there are updates and after checking today, I decided to write a review. Hope we can get this worked out"
2301,Darcibeth,"June 22, 2018",5,Perfect interface Having Tumblrs is therapy for me.  I don’t even care if anyone reads them.  I hadn’t posted on any of mine for a while so when I opened this recent update I was super-pleased.  The interface is so clean and intuitive.  It just makes posting so easy and fun.

I’ll be in the middle of reading something and it’ll just close and I’ll have no way of recovering the same article because I didn’t like it. The most it crashed on me so far was 10 times in 2 minutes. It’s starting to get annoying. Please fix it. I don’t want to have to resort to deleting the app because it doesn’t function correctly."
2303,MrAntiSocial666,"July 5, 2018",5,I love it Like facebook only much better and less invasive with unnecessary censorships. Finally a place you can express yourself and your likes and dislikes more without having to worry about your posts being automatically removed.
2304,Happy_Wanderer_19,"July 10, 2018",5,Tumblr Tumblr is a great app! But I have one little request/question. Is there a way that you can put a date on posts? 
2305,La_Mendoza,"July 13, 2018",5,This app is quite amazing! I’ve found Tumblr to be quite amusing and organized. Whenever I want to look for something in particular it gives me exactly what I want. Thank you Tumblr for always having something new for me everyday.
2306,Chickenluver4ever,"July 14, 2018",3,Problem with submitting a post I have a second tumblr that kind of relies on people submitting posts and what not and a new problem I’ve noticed is that people who aren’t on mobile can’t submit stuff so I think that’s a thing you need to fix because I do have the thing on that lowers you to have people submit stuff on and they just can’t.

Then after that I just see new conjured up recommendations. Please tumblr get rid of this feature it’s so frustrating to scroll through my dash now because it doesn’t even feel like my dash. It’s like someone hacked my account and is following blogs I’ve never seen before. Allow me to personalize my dashboard how I want.
2309,buckchels,"October 18, 2018",5,My favorite app Tumblr is my favorite app ever. I love how there are so many things to read. I also love all the things that pop up on my dash. The knight problem is that if I’m on a tag after a while it crashes. Doesn’t matter how far down I am.

Otherwise everything else works pretty well."

A large majority of the tumblr user base use the mobile app. Putting best stuff first is only gonna promote memes. I like tumblr for its chronologic dashboard. I would get bored if the “best stuff” was always first. Just let me see new stuff and new content at my convenience without having to turn off a feature? I’ve used this site for like 5 years and I’ve stuck through other updates but this is ridiculous.

2331,Fuzzybunniz,"December 31, 2018",1,"Tumblr isn’t what it used to be I’ve been using tumblr for over 5 years now and it has just gone downhill very quickly. I started out by making connections with people over niche topics, but now half of my followers are pornbots that are able to surpass the algorithms in place to get rid of them. The new path tumblr is going down is not one to benefit the USERS, which is what should really matter. Developers tend to forget the customer is always right."
2332,Frank 154,"January 4, 2019",1,"Interesting “improvements” made recently Trying to figure out why my posts are being flagged at sensitive. Noticed there is no longer NSFW blogs or content. Also noticed that Tumblr is still categorized as 17+. So its a SFW platform that is still 17+ users only? According to the TOS, it is 13+   So what is it Verizon? What has happened to this mess of a platform. Another thing I noticed, there are a lot more advertisements on my feed than there were before the last 3 updates in 2 weeks."

The actual app itself has almost no proper notifications, you can't see who all of your followers are, and the porn bots are out of control, the staff has claimed to try to fix problems with it with the new NSFW ban but it has done nothing to actually help. Serious change is needed here."

The new no-adult-content policy, which is nonsense to begin with, is apparently being enforced by useless algorithms, since perfectly SFW posts and blogs are getting flagged left and right while pornbots still roam free. I’m a creature of habit and therefore stuck in this digital hellhole until it finally crashes and burns, but if you haven’t joined tumblr yet, DON’T. Spare yourself the misery."

The staff also chooses to disregard all user feedback and opinions which will eventually lead to the end of tumblr."
2343,nuttymegg,"December 19, 2018",1,"What about all of the other problems? Censorship with NSWF content is one thing, but what about the other content that is dangerous to users? Not only are there Nazi blogs which are harmful, there are also eating disorder and self harm blogs. Why are there still accounts that encourage eating disorders? Or ones that post pictures of deep, self inflicted wounds? Why are those images not flagged but a woman’s bare chest is? There is more to worry about than NSWF content. Tumblr will lose its users because they refused to listen to them."
2344,SexySlayer,"December 19, 2018",1,Version lays another website to rest Version bought Tumblr and is now trying to sell ads. To do that they need to appeal to brands. Just another way corporations’ interests come before people’s. I had two accounts with several blogs between the two. I’ve since deleted my accounts and I encourage everyone to do the same. If you’re not going to use your account please delete it so their user count goes down.
2345,Phoucme,"December 20, 2018",1,"Dicks are banned but white power isn’t Tumblr and Verizon did a horrible thing to all kinds of content creators and pop culture fans by banning all nsfw content . Incidentally, they also gave a huge high-five to white supremacy and other hate groups by not deleting content that is racist, homophobic, and otherwise terrible . This app was seriously such a fun distraction and now it’s just not the same . (Funny how they got rid of nsfw content because they couldn’t make money off it but kept the racist stuff ..) 🧐"
2346,Eselgeist,"December 20, 2018",1,"Mixed bag of terrible decisions On the one hand they knowingly allow rampant racist content that actively espouses murderous genocide and nazi ideology, and other such sources of bile and hate, but in the other hand they have implemented automatic banning policies that stifle, censor and remove content that has nothing to do with the pedophilic pornography that got them kicked out of the istore to begin with. They are literally marking Rothko paintings of abstract color fields as adult content while nazis use the platform to organize death camps, so. So it’s a little of this, a little of that."
2347,lindseymarie1234,"December 21, 2018",1,"Incompetent Staff Instead of purging the porn bots, the child porn blogs, and the Nazi blogs, staff opted to punish the user base by banning adult content with a horrible algorithm that flags SFW posts as NSFW and impacts the usability of the entire site. Staff is completely incompetent and does not listen to users. The ban was just a way to look like they’re doing something so they could get back on the App Store. Staff has ignored the porn bot/Nazi/CP problem for years despite many users asking them to fix it. Their “solution” was to punish users instead."
2348,Heartholder101,"December 26, 2018",1,"Nope Do not EVER download this app. It’s discriminatory ban has done nothing to solve the actual problem. If anything bots are even worse than before. The Tumblr staff have shown time and time again that they don’t actually care about their user base and it shows, not only in the most recent weeks but for years. The glitches in the app as well don’t even make it worth it. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to because I promise you, you don’t want to be here."
2349,ThePentaclePinup,"December 26, 2018",1,"So unprofessional I understand running an app is difficult. However the complete lack of professionalism and functionality on this app is laughable. The staff of mods and programmers allow for blatant hate crimes to occur but censor classical art pieces and works. Not to mention the blatant homophobic lense their “flagging” system has. And of course the site and app is just over run with spam porn bots that have begun to hack other users accounts.

It’s like every app development meeting they just completely forget that they rolled out a heaping pile of garbage and called it a functional app."

This app is garbage and they know it’s garbage but since we’ll all keep using it there’s no need for them to change much. So here we are, stuck with this dumpster fire of an app."

It's not my password because I've reset it three times and I can log in just fine on my laptop, but I can't log back in anymore through my app. They need to fix this new update."

Maybe instead of getting rid of content creators that actually keep themselves on NSFW channels on an app that’s 17+ maybe you should work on weeding out racists that spread hate speech if you’re so concerned about what children can get access to."

I’ve already written a review on the subject but since they keep pushing out new BS updates to hide all the negative press.... the new nsfw policy is unacceptable.

Not only by making the site ‘SFW’ but other means such as disabling links, putting popular posts at the top, etc has severely limited artists on this app. Anything can get flagged as nsfw cause the algorithm for it is trash. Where are artists supposed to post niche stuff now, DeviantArt like it’s 2008? This app & site is a joke don’t bother with it just go to Twitter."

You aren't and never have been a family app or platform, stop trying to police your users so harshly so you can sell more ad space. Also, your censorship algorithm doesn't even work. You flagged your OWN EXAMPLE of what is ACCEPTABLE as adult content. what the hell."

People use Tumblr to make a living by taking art commissions, so when their system erroneously sees something as adult and flags it, that’s an actual dollar loss. And while they flag content that’s not even remotely adult and block entire blogs erroneously, the porn bots are more virulent than ever and don’t get blocked as much as actual people with SFW blogs"

It is removing all NSFW content as if that will help with the actual issues of CP and MAPs and Nazis. By blatantly ignoring its own tagging system its crippling itself and its users, as well as alienating some of its most prominent userbase in the LGBTQ+ communities. On top of which the search feature is purposely broken. also it is still advertising on the app store as a safe place for 17+ content when that is clearly now a lie."

They don’t listen to what their users want and continue to make the app terrible. HEY YAHOO!!!!!

I still used it, even with the horrible new rules. And then they updated it. I get this ugly, eye straining blue as well as a new font, and a surprise bonus item, AKA it eating through my phone battery like it’s a bag of potato chips. My phone was at 74%, I open this app, it drops to 69%. What the heck. Altogether I’m just finding less and less reasons to stay. Step up your game, Tumblr."

The LGBT+ community is also flagged. Hell you cant even post an elbow without being flagged. Also PORN BOTS ARE STILL THERE.

2404,ghoulsong,"December 17, 2018",1,Yikes What can I say? I always came to Tumblr to enjoy myself. Post and see the things I enjoyed. Of course some nsfw content was an inherent part of it. Now it’s filtering and deleting nsfw posts that haven’t done anything wrong. Instead of banning the child porn or nazis or blatant racism that’s freedom of speech and allowing them to speak for things they believe in isn’t what tumblr wants to stop huh? But perfectly tagged nsfw gets the boot just cause you don’t want a female nipple showing. What a sham of a social media site.

It was a site that was great or artists and for people to explore and be who they truly are. When porn not started popping up, we the users called for action, again when pedophiles and nazis found “safe spaces” for themselves. Their NSFW ban is causing people to flee and for communities to be broken. There are still pedophiles. There are still bots. And there are still nazis.

The update in question released bots who favor scanning for “female presenting nipples” and marking the wrong things as explicit. So, yeah, i’m a little disappointed, but not at all surprised."

2439,saturniiine,"April 2, 2020",1,Wow I’ve used tumblr for over ten years. I enabled two factor authentication and was never sent any codes to login and am now locked out of my account. I have tried to contact them through support and by phone but no one will help me get back into my account. Absolutely ridiculous to lock users out of their accounts due to tumblrs own failure to send authentication codes. If they don’t help me with this I will be permanently deleting the app. Beyond upset and so disappointed.

Bring back all the other people that have been here since the beginning, and take the p0rnbots and spambots with you. I have notes and reblogs from p0rnbots every day and it’s annoying. Just take care of the real issue, not what doesn’t make you money."
2456,dis ethan,"December 30, 2018",1,Bots and racism still run rampant The site decides to get back on the App Store with a broken censor system that censors any post with even the remotest colors that may look like skin tones. The nsfw ban punishes artists yet spam and porn bots remain. They cite the reason for the changes to create a more family friendly cite yet it remains a powerful tool for the recruitment of neo nazis / white supremacists. The staff remains tone deaf to their base and is only out for the ad space. The only reason the users are fleeing in mass is the lack of comparable alternatives.
2457,Digitydogedy,"December 31, 2018",1,"Listen Please listen to your users. If you’re gonna make a ban, at least make sure it’s effective. I’m still seeing porn bots up and down my feed while sfw images are being flagged and artists are being driven off while nazis and other hate speech is still allowed.

As your app slowly dies and withers away into the graveyard now occupied by AOL and MySpace, remember that the community that you brought together—the ones you turned your back on — is the same community that eventually but reluctantly dug Tumblr’s grave.

They were completely unhelpful and now I will have to re-register one of the side blogs I was running.

Then, when they were forced to do so, because they were rightfully removed from the App Store, they produced an ineffective algorithm that ended up flagging its own post as inappropriate. I’ve been followed by three porn bots in the last day...."

But instead of monitoring and removing the bots, the staff went willy-nilly flagging random posts, blocking useful tags, and censoring legitimate content and human creators... but the bots are still here, still largely untouched... and it’s now easier to find Nazi-related imagery and writings, than black-positive or LGBT-friendly posts and content.

2633,Dylbirks,"December 18, 2018",1,"Useless The cool thing about Tumblr when it first launched was that it was an independent entity who cared about expression and allowed you to do so without the limitations other social media had . It used to be safe space for all kinds of content and a cool way to make post with the intricacies it’s peers lacked. This included artwork, stories, videos, self-expression post and YES; adult content. The fact that you’ve decided to censor a social media platforms that was never for kids says it all.

Under the guise of making the site a starter place, the existing problems are still there with the added annoyance of people’s SFW content being flagged. It’s incredibly misguided. As an 8 year user, I’m disappointed this site is on a really big downward spiral; hopefully they turn it around soon."

It wouldn’t be so bad if just p*rn was censored (even though that’s silly to begin with, tumblr has always allowed p*rn), but not everything is censored.

Blogs that aren’t explicit are being marked so. And like other reviews they’re still other blogs/issues that remain when they shouldn’t. So tumblr really doesn’t care like they say they do. "

It’s disgusting."

Non-NSFW posts are frequently flagged as inappropriate. Whatever you’re using to police posts isn’t working. Tumblr is not some sort of “family-friendly” website so do a better job making sure children don’t see NSFW posts than just getting rid of them all. Other than that, the app is still prone to crashing."

I met some amazing people who taught me how to love myself. Even through all the hateful comments, the few people who made me laugh, the blogs that told me my childhood was ruined, it was all fun. I loved tumblr but I can’t accept an application that decides to ban all porn and nudity but not nazi, lgbt hate groups ,and white supremacy blogs. Lemme know when you change that 💙"

They did not solve the entire issue of why they were removed from the AppStore (p***bots) and thus I do not think they should be able to reclaim their space here."
2938,LuzRegia,"December 18, 2018",1,"I am dissapointed Tumblr should hear their users concerns and do something about it, getting rid of all nsfw content instead of fixing the actual issue, like the porn bots/nazi blogs is not going to do anything but upset the commuity of tumblr.

I had two side art blogs muted/banned for Adult Content only because I marked them as Adult WHEN FIRST CREATING THEM. I’ve been on this app since before Yahoo bought it and it’s dead in a ditch at this point to me. They do not care and hate listening to their users. At least other 13+ year old sites like Deviantart have better sensitivity filters and ASKS user’s if they want to view each nsfw content. Learn from the best, please."

I’ve been on this app for about 3-4 years and it’s to the point where it’s no fun to be on now. Great job tumblr.

Instead of targeting p0rnbots, pedophillia accounts, nazis, etc. They just tried putting a bandaid on a ready to burst dam. Now users have been outed and have had to flee the site. For those who still remain the main problem is still very present. I am still being followed by bots. My artwork is still being reblogged by them which means they get filled with malicious links in the reblogs. Great job guys."

I have been with tumblr for a long time and I have watched it grow but everything that is going on has just turned tumblr into a sad shadow of the beautiful thing it really used to be... I understand blocking NSFW content but you still let the nazis rampage about and the porn bots still aren’t gone. The nipples aren’t the problem. The money grubbing people running tumbler are.
3068,FlashbackPractice,"January 1, 2019",1,"P0rn bots and nazis Staff decided to put a ban in place that made most of the artists and content creators leave, my partner’s account was deemed NSFW and censored when it had zero of that content.  Since the ban I have been followed by 5 p0rn bots in less than two weeks."
3069,DisasterL,"January 2, 2019",1,"I’ve been here too long I’ve been on tumblr and tumblr mobile for six years. Every update makes the formatting worse, loading time slower and more and more content disappears. They went through this big thing about cleaning out the content to make it more wholesome and yet the site is still over run with nazis and porn bots. The staff rarely makes an update that their user base wants or needs."
3070,PhilipF,"December 18, 2018",1,"Completely wrongheaded The methods Tumblr chose to deal with the site’s problems (nazis, child pornography, porn bots) has not done anything to alleviate those issues. Instead, it has blocked many accounts that have done nothing wrong."
3071,AppleDake,"December 18, 2018",2,No point in posting They don’t listen to any feedback from their users and when they do they mock them with it. They’ve updated their policy to where you can post something nsfw(ish) but then only you can see it. Making it impossible if your trying to gain a following and impossible for you to find any new blogs unless you know the url name by heart.
3072,nitsua5991,"December 18, 2018",1,"Horrible With a censorship that doesn’t work, the app and site is almost completely useless now. They have deleted, hidden, or absolutely messed with people’s blogs that have and have not contributed to the NSFW community.  They continue to do NOTHING about the spam bots and the the reason they were removed from the App Store originally.  They seem to absolutely love the White Supremacists and the Nazis. It’s an absolute mess and they should be ashamed of themselves."
3073,Stephanie_L_23,"December 19, 2018",1,"Staff A Disaster Rather than working to correct issues, staff would rather sweep them under the rug and blame its users for their own incompetence. Not only do staff not care about actual issues that might harm minors, minorities, or overall user experience (e.g. hate speech, porn bots with untagged material, and blatant fascism), they take amusement in the frustration and dismay of their users. The platform itself is fun and user base enjoyable, but staff continually mars it’s website reputation and quality."

When they can get over themselves and welcome back the many artists that they've pushed away and truly fix the bot and nazi problem, then it'll worth coming back to. But don't hold your breath..."
3076,xsylviao,"December 22, 2018",1,"unbelievable combo of greed and stupidity The recent decision to ban all NSFW content from the Tumblr app and platform (not to mention the embarrassingly shoddy execution of said ban) is both shortsighted and greedy. Alienating a loyal userbase in the name of further monetization under the guise of “protecting the children” (while still doing next to nothing about their massive pornbot and Nazi fetishist account problem) is, in a word, platform suicide. I’d be surprised if Tumblr lasts through 2019 with this attitude. Shame; it was such a vibrant, fun site."
3077,Nocturnallover,"December 22, 2018",1,"I wish I could give it -1 stars Tumblr literally cares nothing for its users. Has now created a punishment based system by blurring icon, taking away headers, and removing certain blogs and tags from being searchable. Regular selfies being posted are even getting flagged. The words useless algorithm and staff don’t even touch the tip of how horrendous this site is. 10/10 wouldn’t use this site to begin with if I could go back in time."
3078,idleutopia,"December 24, 2018",1,Not user friendly The new update is still pretty annoying. The content is slow to load up and sometimes it will freeze. It's frustrating. I don't understand why continue to fix it if you continue to break it. It's like they fix one leaky hole and make three more in its place. Just a very bad app. I love tumblr and I love being part of the community so this review is for the functionality of the app only.

There are still nazis and pornbots everywhere, and there is a system of harassment on this site & this app that goes entirely ignored by the staff when reported.  Really, this app has one singular thing working in its favor: posts on your dash are still displayed in chronological order.  Rampant harassment, the nature of “discourse,” irremediable bullies, and the still present pornbots has dulled the fun of interacting with other people and with communities on tumblr."

And don’t forget the neo nazi and cp blogs are continuing to thrive so again good job tumblr. Time to find a replacement. I’ve been on this site for 10 yrs and it saddens me to see what it has become.
3144,Thruve,"December 24, 2018",5,They’re recent mistake means a different company will prevail! They’re banning of NSFW content means another company will get the chance to fill in tumblrs place! I’m excited to see which new company will overtake Tumblr!! Thank you Tumblr for killing your self!
3145,theniftytable,"December 26, 2018",1,"Wack. This app blows. Like almost everything about it BLOWS. The staff doesn’t care about it’s users or anything going on and they drop buggy, broken changes into the site any chance they can. There are still spambots and tons of nasty people running around on the site and all the staff cares about is “female-presenting nipples” getting in the way of having advertisers on the site. It’s truly a shame there aren’t any proper replacements for this app."
3146,fzzynsoft,"December 27, 2018",5,"Does what I need it to.....ish. I have always loved Tumblr, I’m not super happy about the content changes but “hey” what am I going to do? NOTHING! Lol.

3148,Kujoey,"December 28, 2018",1,"Does EA own you? Another great example of not paying attention to the user base and caring only about money. I rarely used this app to begin with, when even something like Instagram is more user friendly AND family friendly. The app is supposedly a “family friendly” site, but even in the description it says it’s for 17+. Snapchat, an app famous for being used to send nudes, is more family friendly"
3149,AmethystUnarmed,"December 28, 2018",1,"The site is full of pornbots and racists The app barely functions at times, often crashing or posts don’t load. The new community guidelines have only made it worse, killing a ton of wonderful artists. And don’t even bother posting the color brown unless you want your whole blog to be flagged. Meanwhile spam and porn bots have only gotten worse. If you don’t have the app, don’t bother getting it. It’s just disappointment."
3150,Coolcatkid,"July 5, 2018",1,Horrible Update literally the app won’t even open anymore. Every time you guys update this something breaks. I opened the app on my super old phone the other day that hasn’t been updated in years and it worked so smoothly i wanted to cry—please just give us back version like 9.0 or something i’m literally begging you your app is completely unusable with this new update and it was fairly buggy before that
3151,Hartleyswimmer14,"August 2, 2018",1,"No recommended posts! I’ve been using tumblr for over a year and I’m going to have to stop using the app because of the annoying recommended posts!!!

I still don’t even get to see the post 🙃 I stopped using this app because of HOW POORLY it’s managed and they don’t fix any of the issues the users BEG to be changed. Maybe if you listened to the users, the people that kind of give you this job, people wouldn’t rate it poorly."

3159,Fitalony,"December 17, 2018",1,Wouldn’t recommend If your interests are under 18 Pinterest or Instagram are better. If your interests are over 18 they are no longer interested in providing service to you. Tumblr basically decided that cleaning itself up so it can sell out to another company to make a quick buck was worth more than serving it’s customer base. I would not recommend this and I am leaving and deactivating all of my accounts.
3160,chubbysucculent,"April 3, 2018",1,Won’t search I downloaded tumblr to follow artists I find that only have a tumblr but I’m very disappointed because for some reason searching things up doesn’t pull anything up it just gives a blank screen. I wish they could fix this as I’ve downloaded it every couple of months to see if it’ll work but it still won’t pull anything up. Definitely not worth my time.
3161,KhalilB33,"April 5, 2018",5,Interesting A very interesting app where you can express yourself with almost no limitations! Can be very entertaining and find my self spending hours on end scrolling through content. Amazing app!
3162,Derpy piggy,"April 18, 2018",2,Not that great... I don’t know if anyone already said this because I don’t read every review but I read one like meme or something and then a new one then it’s just the same memes over and over again and I have to scroll down for like 20 seconds just to find some new ones. Just fix this and all the other problems stated by the other reviews.
3163,Breanna Monique,"April 27, 2018",4,Logging in sends password recovery to email Logging back into Tumblr after logging out sends password recovery to email even though a password recovery option hasn’t been initiated. It’s annoying after the 5th time.
3164,mparks97,"May 30, 2018",1,"Layout of ads is distracting and offputting If the ad posts were quick and maybe a side scroll like the user pages used to be that’d be painless and still get the point across, but the current format is incredibly cluttered. The point of the dash is so we don’t see what we’re not subscribed to, and yet half of the dash is recommended posts. Otherwise, good app, almost unusable because of how cluttered with unwanted material it is."
3165,rosyxmaria,"June 4, 2018",5,"Amazing app. Been using Tumblr for about 7 years now and it never fails to make me laugh, smile, or cry when I need it. This app is everything and if I had to, I'd just keep this one over Insta, Twitter, and anything else."
3166,Liv10156,"June 4, 2018",2,"Need to change following Tumblr used to have it where you could view the people you were following in alphabetical order. Now it’s just a ridiculous mess. Tumblr also will not stop crashing and so if I’m trying to go through my followers and it’s crashing all the time, I get now where because I don’t know where I was. It’s just a mess"
3167,Joema81,"June 15, 2018",2,"Too many ads This used to be a great platform but after the recent update my feed has been flooded with more ads than content. The posts I’m actually interested in are buried. Not only do the ads pop up too often, they repeat, even after I say I’m not interested. Seriously considering leaving the platform if this isn’t changed."

3169,lostbound,"June 17, 2018",4,"Captions Instead of making it to where people cant remove original captions indefinitely, it should be the posters choice to make it so the caption can be deleted or can not be deleted. It could be chosen every time u post. Hope this helps."
3170,iminlalaland4ever,"January 20, 2018",1,"Pretty terrible App has a very hard time loading any content (even if my WiFi is good). It takes a lot time for posts to show up and if I try to scroll up to reload the page, it gets stuck in reload. "
3171,APennState1,"January 21, 2018",3,Could be better It’s an OK site. I dont understand why they ask you all this personal info about you and then when it’s time to search for matches / they match you with people OVER 300 miles away and further. Nothing within the mile limit you actually look for

The app freezes for a minute, unfreezes, multiple times, until it finally closes. When you try to open it, you’ll get the Tumblr blue screen and it will continue to close. The only way to (bandaid) fix this is to reinstall."
3183,dfndppnk,"October 21, 2017",4,Good! Good app but I REALLY wish there was a way to change which blog was the primary instead of having to make a whole new account if I want to switch. Even like a “once every 60 Days” type deal would be better than that!!!
3184,ilovepolyvorexxxx,"October 27, 2017",1,Not the perfect app I keep getting the pop up message saying “Hmm try again” then I got one telling me to change my password because you’ve detected something weird ? So I do that then it won’t even let me log in. I change it again thinking I misspelled something and the same thing happens. I then try to login on my browser and voila it works. Definitely need a new update because this app is lacking.
3185,Trigga 😁,"October 29, 2017",1,"Why the pointless updates? Decided to update my tumblr after a whole year in hopes that at least one of the updates would make it better. Unfortunately it made it worse! Now, my tumblr won’t load AT ALL.

3186,AnechkePie,"November 28, 2017",4,"Almost great. Mostly happy with this app, but there are a few things I would like to change. More control over the visual environment, better access to specific users or profiles, and better content suggesting."

But now tumblr allows literal nazis to say what they want but ban all nsfw content, even art or posts that might help people determine their sexuality just to protect from “child pornographers” is just too extreme. It’s sad, it had so much potential! I haven’t gone on for almost three weeks and I don’t plan to anytime soon. It’s boring and dead and just sad."

Anyway there’s still explicit bots crawling all over the site and following everyone indiscriminately, whether they are of age or not.

3204,Skittlezzz muncher,"February 21, 2019",1,"Pointless app and terrible owners I feel I can say with 100% certainty that one of tumblrs biggest edges over other platforms was its acceptance of NSFW artists and content, but since the ban I haven't opened the app once. It’s no different than Instagram now except at least Instagram isn’t full of incompetent tools screwing everything up. Only reason I kept it installed is to write this. If half a star was a valid option I’d certainly select it."

The solution to getting rid of child porn isn’t to ban all mature content and hope for the best. This is absolutely ridiculous, fix your problems and stop over correcting."
3228,Pandy Pan,"December 18, 2018",1,"nudity is bad but nazis are just fine huh I followed artists to tumblr and I’m following them as they leave. I sat through years of mismanagement, a buggy app and website, questionable update choices, the whole nine yards, but now they’re flagging and hiding content with an open-source bot and removing perfectly sfw content for no reason."
3229,,"December 18, 2018",1,"Awful management Nazis and pedophiles ran rampant on the website until apple took the app off the store. Now instead of like, directly addressing the issue, tumblr has banned all adult content and ostracized a large portion of its userbase. Consequently this has also taken away a major platform for artists trying to survive off of their creations. I guess download if you’re a Puritan and only wanna see pictures of the sky or something."

Time to start looking for an alternative."

Tumblr user of nine(?) years here. All this site has proven as it has blown up is that it no longer cares for its userbase and has not for a long time. I am disappointed and I don’t foresee myself sticking around much longer unless a major overhaul is initiated.

Banning adult content is short-sighted and wrong.  There is nothing wrong with sexuality.  It creates the spark of life from which we all originate, and affection is good for you.  Banning adult content is denying people a core part of their humanity: healthy sexuality.  If there’s some law requiring this overly broad censorship, we need to fix the laws.  Tumblr used to be great.  Now it’s just sad..."

3312,visi0naary,"June 13, 2018",3,"idk what’s going on but i’m annoyed so i made a secondary account and reblogged a post and went to the secondary’s page and it glitches out. when i try to switch to my main, itll day it can do the operation. so i logged out and logged back in and see if it fixed it and it didn’t. and i noticed when you hold down the little profile thing to select a blog, there’s a 3rd blog that has no name and that’s apparently the glitched out blog [ when i click on the actual second blog it’s non existing ] i really don’t want to delete it so please do whatever you can to fix it :/"

Now I have to spend EXTRA time starting over. This isn’t the first time that happened. It happened 5 months ago too and I ended up removing this app for it.

3342,Cici Claire,"October 8, 2017",1,"Why This app is terrible. Crashes constantly, randomly starts loading posts you've already seen(in the order you saw them ages ago) when you scroll too far and has way too many ads. Have had to uninstall and reinstall multiple times just to get it to work. The biggest flaw here is that the App Store doesn't have a 0 star rating so that I can give it to the Tumblr app."
3343,the-sun-is-green,"October 13, 2017",5,Best app to connect and share interests This app is absolutely incredible. I can share my interests and trek people how I feel and they'll all support me and share themselves with me while still being anonymous. I love it.

Somebody fix this issue ASAP."
3348,Haley2526,"November 2, 2017",5,I love this!!! Tumblr is a great app for finding weird people just like you! Everyone fits into one group or another and you all talk and share thoughts! It’s a great place to get away from reality and just relate to others!

3352,Like brown,"April 26, 2019",3,Saddening I was enthralled by tumblrs nuance: anyone could put anything up. It gave it a sense of freedom that other social sites lacked. I came back after a while and everything was gone. There are so many guidelines now and restrictions and it doesn’t even give you the option to turn it off.
3353,shekaise,"April 30, 2019",1,"Can’t believe I’m saying this... Tumblr was so much better in the glory days of the Misha apocalypse and night blogging. Too many ads about things no one is interested in, misogynistic censorship, white supremacy, and all around too many glitches and errors. I’ve been on the site since 2011 and I’ve seen the rise and fall of Tumblr as a legitimate social networking and blogging platform. RIP to the place where I fumbled through my teenage years."

3357,Kas12456789,"November 1, 2019",3,SO. MANY. BUGS I love this app but the bugs are physically killing me. If I touch anywhere even remotely near a link or an @(blog url) it takes me off the main dash! It’s been driving me NUTS.

Whatever adjustments were made need to go back to old."
3362,kickinbutler,"December 20, 2018",1,"Doesn’t listen to users and punishes artists instead of addressing problems The nsfw flagging system is completely awful and flags sfw posts, while ignoring the root of the real issues they tried to fix. I get what they were trying to do, but come on, trying to attack the bots by doing this only hurts the main audience. Why don’t they just go after the nazis and pedophiles and give everyone else and “female presenting nipples” a break"
3363,Evolagenda,"December 24, 2018",1,"Such a Disappointment I’ve been a user for over 6 years and it was progressively getting bad with all the porn bots and now there’s absolutely no way to run a blog the way you want to on the platform. Too many legitimate blogs getting flagged for nsfw content and their content is nowhere near nsfw. It was a wonderful outlet and now it’s gone downhill. Until they realize they made their worst mistake in Tumblr history, I’ll be gone."
3364,TaraBrooke16,"January 3, 2019",2,"Ridiculous Rule Change Tumblr has totally misread their audience and ever since this whole new rule change has ruined the site. A whole bunch of content has been erased and Tumblr is so blah these days. What can tumblr users even post anymore? Cats and Disney? Tumblr was a place for people to meet others with similar interests and to learn and delve into new interests. Now, it’s just ridiculous."
3365,MadHatter7373,"January 6, 2019",1,"Wish I could put zero stars. This is a PSA So, I had tumblr some time ago, before last December, and it was glorious! We could post whatever we wanted, no questions asked. And then the staff attacked. Anything and anything that even lightly resembled nsfw content was deleted, effectively creating an edgy Facebook. If you want that same freedom. Delete tumblr, don't touch it. Head on over to Reddit (we actually have our freedom)."
3366,Thedisneyprince,"January 6, 2019",1,"Horrible censorship moderation and video player The app itself is fine, but the recent censorship flagging system is terrible with may NSFW images still appearing and the system as a whole being extremely flawed. The censorship is absurd when you look at what images and posts are considered appropriate (hate speech, promotion of hate groups, porn that gets unflagged), and inappropriate (nipples)... I am very disappointed with tumblr."
3367,cherrypiexo,"January 15, 2019",1,"“Female presenting nipples” is not an excuse Tumblr had been a site where people could express themselves freely for a while, that included sexual expression. As someone who has had a Tumblr since 2013, the change to the Community Guidelines was a huge letdown. Tumblr should look more in-depth to the Neo-Nazis, pedophiles and amongst other problematic things instead of “female presenting nipples” and maybe start looking more into their adult content to regulate what can be posted or not."
3368,nikki4465,"January 16, 2019",1,"Porn Bots are ridiculous There are so many porn bots all over the place now. I haven’t been active on my blog in months and they’re still following me. Tumblr did a purge to get rid of the porn bots and they only got worse. This app needs to be taken off the App Store, not because of the NSFW content, as that was not an issue. But because these bots are trying to show CHILDREN porn and give viruses to anyone they can. Do not download."
3369,Emilybeeee,"January 23, 2019",1,"Worse and worse every day Failing to load photos, videos, sometimes even text posts. A broken censorship bot that recently censored a post about a kitten in sunglasses. I was followed by six porn bots and nazi posters in nearly as many days. This app was never perfect but it wasn’t downright toxic and BROKEN before. The creators are fleeing in droves. The app and the site is fading. Look elsewhere for art and fandom work. Stay here for nazis, hate speech, and porn bots."

3371,xxboo.bearxx,"December 12, 2018",1,"Don’t join- New guidelines literally ruin their users Now, I love tumblr- I really do- but this new rule is ridiculous. I don’t personally use the nsfw content, but removing that from 18+ users is absolutely ridiculous. They’re literally going to lose all of their users and revenue from this and I know most of my friends are moving to a new platform because their “explicit” flagging isn’t actually flagging explicit things- just RANDOM things."
3372,4aladybug,"December 13, 2018",1,"Now complete trash New censorship guidelines obliterate the communities this app once so highly encouraged. Not only are fundamental communities, relationships, and businesses negatively affected by these new “governing rules”, the free ability to create, post, and share art regardless of content is infringed upon. There was abundant room for positive improvement through the removal of pedophiles; nazi, anti-Semitic, and white-suppremiscists; and porn bots. Instead this app chose to filter, flag, and remove “sensitive content and female-presenting nipples”."
3373,Paablo,"December 18, 2018",1,"Another case of 1984 type controls. It was a good app, over the last year seems to be more about forced content and forced company agenda on what blogs are viewed and which ones are followed. "
3374,salishseaselkie,"December 18, 2018",1,"It used to be amazing. Much like the rest of Silicon Valley, Tumblr’s staff is comprised of those who believe that “female-presenting nipples” is more of an issue on their app than the presence of Nazis and pedophiles and porn bots. This app and its new update is a sham and demonstrates the staff’s lack of empathy and commitment for a healthy social media environment. Godspeed to Yahoo - it is because of your acquisition of this fine blogging site that it has taken several turns for the worst. Say goodbye to your stock value."
3375,Devvy West,"December 18, 2018",1,"Ten Years On Tumblr The site itself has always been a bit idiotic and poorly coded, but we had fixes for that. We made friends and shared posts and made a home for ourselves and then it was sold to Yahoo. Since then it’s been one terrible decision after another, alienating the entire user base and now they’re choosing to die on a hill made of bigotry backed by nazis, pedophiles, and porn bots. But don’t worry! Because they auto-banned the N word; nipples."
3376,dhsoslaoa,"December 18, 2018",1,"Seriously? Not only is putting people out of work and letting nazis and pedophiles run free, the staff continued to use “female presenting nipples” after the amount of backlash this term received due to sexism and mocked us by saying “yeah we know you hate this term”. Seriously? I’m going down with this ship because I (used to) feel safe there expressing my ideologies but now I am afraid to use it for being censored. Hypocritical. Don’t download this app until they pull it together."
3377,RiceballArtist,"December 19, 2018",1,"Problematic Their censorship bot flags all kinds of sfw content. Reasonable blogs have been hidden from view. Nazis are still posting freely and their guidelines are sexist. Don’t like nipples then just ban all nipples. Of course the bots can’t tell the difference between female, male, cartoons and frogs so probably just should have banned skin of any kind. Seems like what the bot can handle. Also porn bots are still roaming free because a blanket ban didn’t even take care of that problem."
3378,daniel-armstrong,"December 19, 2018",1,"They don’t listen to their users I run a very popular blog on this silly site and it has been an absolute nightmare. The amount of nazis and pedos on this site is despicable. Staff doesn’t care about its users and there are so many little glitches I could write a book. until its developers start to listen to its users, this site just isn’t worth using. I’m trying to move the majority of my following to twitter."
3379,schndlbck,"December 19, 2018",1,"“A better, more positive Tumblr” Tumblr wanted to make itself a safe place for users. And that’s fine and dandy, but what they truly did was lazy management. You aren’t making Tumblr a safer place by removing explicit/adult content (or even non-explicit content, that your bots thought was explicit). In order to make Tumblr a safer place, you should have focused on the rampant national-socialistic, transphobic, homophobic, racist content that hasn’t been dealt with, nor even addressed."
3380,Jenny3541,"April 22, 2018",4,"Great except... Every time I try to read a post that’s on the longer side, the app crashes and freezes which then proceeds to kick me out. I often use tumblr to read so having it crash is very frustrating."

You try to tap the little X in the upper corner and it goes away. Please God go back to the way it was. Why would you think this is an improvement?!?"

Its awful seeing actual sex workers lose their career because tumblr, a 17+ app/site, tried getting rid of all NSFW. Which didn’t even work, by the way. All 20 or so bots still following me exist, with blurred out icons. Poow tumbwr, infested with pown."

Get rid of the actual problems: bots and supremacy groups! Maybe I’ll reconsider my review after that happens."

Not to mention that they are learning to tag their “sfw”. So now the sfw tag has p0rn and racist trash in it. The tumblr mods absolutely need to get themselves together and fix this site. Its as simple as not just allowing a bot to run around and flag random creators. The way the mods have handled all of this is disgusting. Do not get on tumblr till it is fixed."

Overall, I am extremely disappointed with this app. The ways of tumblr app management are simply distasteful."

4098,lk591,"June 2, 2018",1,Hate the constant recommended posts So tired of the recommended posts!! It’s getting so irritating to see them constantly. I want to see posts from the people I actually follow! Literally no one cares or needs this in their feed. Give us the option to turn it off at least!

Now it will not let me log in, at first it said it was because the password was wrong. Now it’s saying the email is incorrect. Funny enough I can log into my laptop and it will work just fine.

4131,Kate Rickey,"May 2, 2020",5,Tumblr I love Tumblr because they don’t have drama and gossip also they are honest Tumblr is a 3000 times better then Facebook and Instagram also Twitter. Thank you for letting me be a follower on tumblr.

I tried cutting off my phone and redownloading the app but it still happens they need to fix this
4133,LynndorTruffle,"April 6, 2020",3,"Community ruined Still an amazing app with great content. They ruined the community tho by banning all NSFW content. Which might sound lame, but there was a lot of soft core, artsy nudity pictures that I and many others loved. And it was removed. It was completely unnecessary and reduced the amount of users by a lot."
4134,ileyaN04,"February 27, 2020",5,Tumblr needs to return to the good old app. You need to make it back like it used to be have porn on it . Many people came here for that.

Yahoo wants me to run outside and buy a new computer, a new iPad and a new phone to use this app? Very disappointing.

4142,softballcat,"February 12, 2019",1,Awful now. They fixed nothing. This adult content ban is really just showing how intolerant and close-minded they are. Hurts artists and writers but the porn bots are still there. They fixed nothing. Can’t gain new followers cause the algorithm hides a lot of recent posts. Tried to take the easy way out and hurt a lot of its good users along the way. The new blue and fonts are awful. There are still porn bots and nazis

4145,Gabbycat22,"May 23, 2019",2,Slow for no reason??? Your app shouldn’t fun a script to send a notification to users to tell the user to “Slow down. Give us a second and try again” when I ask you to do one simple action like open up the menu so I can change what my bio or blog title says. It’s 2019. An app that slow is disgraceful
4146,taebae32,"November 14, 2019",4,... bugs When I see my likes and comments it tends to just crash and leave the app. Please change this. It just started happening today and I’m getting nerve racked by it. Change. It. Please.

4151,Sea75,"December 29, 2018",1,"Terrible App Tumblr does not listen to their user base, and is in fact almost entirely user base-unfriendly. If you want a friendly social media app, go somewhere else. While Tumblr claims to have purged porn from their app, what actually happened is that they have flagged innocent users as Inappropriate while countless amounts of pornography bots roam free. They also allow white supremacy and racism to exist in huge numbers."
4152,dominique.gonzales97,"December 30, 2018",1,"Lost it’s draw I’ve had a tumblr for almost 8 years and I made it to see all the art that people made of the things I liked.

All we wanted was less porn"
4153,noone1315,"December 30, 2018",1,You’re okay with Nazis but not Sexuality I can’t keep up with trying to block all the porn bots that follow my blog. They can’t even follow their own guidelines about what is considered “safe” to post and what isn’t. I don’t understand why the staff couldn’t figure out how to remove the bots and I don’t think it’s right that blogs that show racist values and hate speech are allowed to stay. Do something about nazi blogs.
4154,Ashleymayes,"January 1, 2019",1,"Images get taken down for no reason I used to love this app. I could vent, and express things I couldn’t do anywhere else. Did this for around 8 years. Then all of a sudden they change their policies and pictures of my dog I lost in November are flagged, pictures of my baby boy are flagged, my header (zombie faces) and avatar (my dog I lost to cancer and me) are taken down. It basically burned my scrapbook."
4155,anniev93,"January 2, 2019",1,"An app for adults should allow adult content. This censorship has ruined tumblr. This is a platform made for adults. And adults do not need other adults to censor explicit information and media for them. By virtue of being ADULTS, we’re qualified to make our own decisions about the content we consume. If I could give 0 stars, I would. No respect for this company and the platform it manages anymore."
4156,Emcathsmith,"January 3, 2019",1,Fix this or you’re screwed These bots still exist and are still actively following and interacting with my blog and other blogs while users and content creators are being censored for sfw content. Tumblr needs to try to do their job correctly instead of finding a shortcut every single update. Care more about your users fast otherwise you won’t have any.
4157,zjasp,"January 5, 2019",1,"Overrun with Nazis and spam bots We’ve been asking for years for Tumblr to weed out Nazi and white supremacist circles and the spam bots running rampant, but instead apparently the problem is artists and “female presenting nipples...” which they decided to resolve with an ineffective and poorly designed algorithm that flagged everything but pornography, including the staff’s own posts. Wish I could rate 0 stars. Clean up your act, tumblr staff."
4158,Allialynn,"January 6, 2019",2,Been here a while I’ve been on tumblr for probably about 7 years or so and they just keep pushing a majority of what makes them money away.

4161,Kim TX,"December 18, 2018",1,"Unwilling to listen Tumblr staff haven’t fixed any of this sites problems despite the community being very vocal about it.

Also, instead of using real teams to moderate content, they use a bot so broken it FLAGS THE STAFFS POST SAYING WHATS ACCEPTABLE AS UNACCEPTABLE. They just screwed over 90% of their user base but they don’t care because Hey, at least they’re back on the App Store, right?"

COWARDS. EVERY ONE OF YOU."
4168,gary Wilcox,"December 21, 2018",1,It was good for a long time but now it’s just going downhill This is absurd. You’ve created something to get rid of a large portion of this site and it’s doing a lot more than just flagging posts it needs to and is just tearing your site apart. I prefer the app over the desktop because it’s just nicer to me but really? This is causing problems for people and it needs to be fixed
4169,Kiriell,"December 27, 2018",1,"Just bad all over Unstable, buggy, constant crashes, feels like it was coded by a bunch of chimpanzees. The automatic flagging policy isn't flagging what it's supposed to, it's instead haphazardly grabbing whatever it can get it's grubby little paws on and causing people to be banned for posting things like pics of deserts. Heaven forbid you see breasts on the site but white supremacists are still allow to post literal calls to genocide."
4170,levi perry,"October 10, 2018",5,This app is amazing and here’s why I have found somethings that I enjoy like Harry Potter and music. Also I can upload the things I enjoy. I am so grateful that this app is existing right now.

4173,Peytbass,"December 15, 2018",1,Policy Change While the site has always given a forum for ALL “artists” it’s taken a “family” approach and sadly it will start to censor artistic features that it feels may not be suitable for all.

4175,Star trekin,"December 16, 2018",1,Remember yikyak This new policy tumblr has made goes against the original reason everyone used the platform. What is probably going to happen is they will perfect the algorithm of deleting certain content and sell the algorithm for a ton of money and shut down the site. Or they learned nothing from yikyak and this will kill the website. Lose lose situation all around
4176,athena_390,"December 17, 2018",1,"Tumblr broke itself. Want to deal with a glitchy, unreliable bot that flags innocent posts as explicit?

4177,loltoriiixx,"December 17, 2018",1,"LITERALLY TERRIBLE the only reason tumblr has managed to survive this far is bc their staff sucked so much so that they didn’t care enough to compete w other big social media platforms w stories, non chronological order etc. this app has gone to hell once they decided that adult content wasn’t allowed on. that’s literally the biggest portion of tumblr users and now they’re censoring speech and art."

Staff and support are unresponsive to user-base, and the whole nsfw ban was a ban on artists. Nazis, pedophiles, and bots all still find loopholes to dodge the ban (usually by simply using the “sfw” tag, in regards to the bots. Nazis still have a tag.). So really? Crap app, crap staff, one star."
4180,Valeria Crocker,"June 14, 2018",4,Bigger I love this app always have but I really think it needs a bigger update that changes things will also keep things the same I don’t know what I’m saying but that’s just how I feel.

4183,To: Najifa Kuhrsid,"August 8, 2018",2,Don’t tell me what I like The app works great. But it recommends blogs to me that I have zero interest in. And it does so frequently. About half of the posts I see are these “recommended” blogs and it is very irritating. I give the feedback that they are missing the mark by a mile but it doesn’t seem to help. They need to get rid of these recommended blogs.
4184,Sean G Ho,"August 12, 2018",1,Too much garbage I’m not interested in with recent updates App has changed dramatically recently in that it shows you WAAAAAY too many things you are not interested in and never “followed”. Ads I can deal with some but about 35% of my feed is either ads or just random suggested posts. No thanks. Been a user for years and hate Tumblr now. No way to turn it off.

4198,Torr_________________________,"June 13, 2018",1,Dashboard keeps getting random posts? I keep seeing streams of 4-5 random posts in the feed by blogs I do not follow. These are about as common as the posts from blogs that I do follow when scrolling. I already turned off all the strange settings that give you random posts and I am not following any tags but I still see them everywhere and it is very frustrating.
4199,UHaveN0Friendz,"June 14, 2018",2,"Too many suggestions My feed is 60% who I follow and the rest is ads and suggestions.

4230,HopelessHiraeth,"December 29, 2018",1,"Absolutely horrible Do not get this app. The staff do not care. They are letting bots that show pornography stay, along with pedophiles and white supremacists and Nazis, while deleting creators that make NSFW art, that properly tag it and keep it out of reach of younger viewers. Staff does not reply, rarely does their job, and the mobile version is incredibly buggy, crashes a lot, and just doesn’t work."
4231,Bicallia,"January 5, 2019",1,"Ridiculous Not only is the NSFW ban insanely sexist and transphobic, (Female-presenting nipples? Really?) but the bots still haven't gone anywhere. In fact there's pretty much just as many. On top of that the algorithm is a nightmare and is deleting SFW content and blogs left and right. This website is a joke."
4232,kyra_is_octopus,"January 12, 2019",1,Would give zero stars The NSFW ban not only didn't work (I'm still getting porn bots) but it completely changed the ideals and culture of Tumblr. I'll always love it for what the people on the site have given me but I will also now hate it for what it symbolizes - a decaying internet culture where Nazis are given more respect than people making their living and expressing themselves.
4233,Phai26,"January 21, 2019",1,The old Tumblr was my fav this is literal trash Honestly I’m just going to delete my accounts and bid farewell to tumblr. I find it ridiculous that everyone has to suffer the consequences of one person’s lack of common sense and respect for the law. I’ve used this app for years and it’s heartbreaking for me to let it go. Guess I have to start using Twitter and I’m not even a Twitter person. Lol guess I am now.
4234,Jade Gross,"February 18, 2019",1,"Old Issues never fixed Even after the ""nsfw, dermal presenting nipples"" ban, your problems still stay. Porn bots have seemed to even increase as of late, I get followed by one almost every day. (yes I report and block each one) "

If this is what you meant by fulfilling your place in an evolving culture, that evolving culture looks pretty bleak."

Instead they demonized fan artists, sex workers, and any female skin presented in pictures. It’s good to know that being a woman on tumblr means you are wrong, but it’s fine if you’re a guy. This site ran off users who were there since it’s creation.😡"

Meanwhile, white supremacy, porn, and other such content runs rampant even as black hashtags and the LBGT community remains censored."

4373,Saucyasslili,"July 6, 2018",1,"No...just no. When refreshing pages, the images don’t load. Anons don’t disappear from the inbox when you answer them. Private messages don’t show even though you receive a notification that you have one. My blog doesn’t even reflect what I changed it to on the computer. It looks totally different. This app is terrible."
4374,nskcisnvaickwnavhs,"July 10, 2018",5,Good app Good app. Kinda hard to navigate but that might be because I’m new. I can see a lot of the things that I’m into but honestly it seems awfully familiar to Pinterest.
4375,wessany,"July 10, 2018",5,Could use a little improvement Great app but begins to skip after a while of being on the app
4376,ketykorn,"July 17, 2018",3,"Blurry pictures For some reason with the new versions, some of the pictures are blurry until you click on them. Seriously tumblr? Fix this. Y’all should have the best quality pics."
4377,mbs877,"August 8, 2018",3,"A bit laggy The app could be smoother, the notifications don’t refresh immediately, sometimes previous notifications go missing on the notifications page."
4378,Mouseymouser,"August 14, 2018",1,Save Yourself The Trouble The desktop version is the only one worth using. The app forces you to save images at a lower resolution and the mobile browser version doesn’t let you save them at all. 
4379,mishemily,"August 27, 2018",2,"Tumblr is great but this app is a mess There's constantly a problem, posts won't load, it claims there is no connection even though all other apps run smoothly and the connection is great. I'm get message notifications but the actual messages won't show up. It gets so frustrating"
4380,Emmacat120,"February 23, 2018",5,"Tumblr I love this app, I find so many post on pretty much anything I search for. Amazing content and would definitely recommend. 💙"
4381,short.stack828,"March 25, 2018",5,"Great My favorite things to look at when I’m on Instagram,Twitter, or Pinterest is quotes and photography and stuff and tumblr has all those things plus blogs which I love"
4382,Devilmaycry473,"April 8, 2018",4,This app is great but I would like to be able to edit comments or delete them I hate that you can’t edit comments you make or delete them it’s such a drag .
4383,fjfhdjdhdjjfj,"April 8, 2018",1,Terrible and filthy It’s worse than a hardcore porn site! You can’t search for normal stuff without the most vile things popping up! Absolutely horrible!! I’m afraid to use this app because my child has accidentally seen things she should never have seen! If I wanted to see porn and really gross porn at that I would go to a porn site. This app is so distasteful and disappointing.
4384,Strawberrymoon63,"April 26, 2018",5,"Tumblr...where insanity lives Great app, no problems, using latest iOS, and basically is my go to app for laughing and having a good time. Plus fandoms. So what’s not to like?"
4385,kelconna,"April 30, 2018",5,Good but.. It’s an amazing app and very well thought out. My only complaint is that I cannot change my age? I put it in wrong and now I have a safe mode.
4386,Teachmichigan,"May 1, 2018",3,What happened What the heck happened with the last update? I can’t open my profile most days and can’t switch between blogs without it crashing. It’s showing leas than half the pictures even in wi-fi. Ready to ditch it.
4387,texasamericana,"May 6, 2018",5,"More than adequate. Nothing needs be perfect.  Slow down.   Enjoy life.  Stop looking for everything, find something."
4388,Audtaki,"May 7, 2018",5,"It's really fun! I like how you can see what everyone posts, and I like how everyone supports each other for the work they have created!"
4389,U need a better edit app,"May 22, 2018",5,It’s pretty Gucci. I actually like the content on this app... Even though it’s made by other people it’s easier than most apps to find my interests.
4390,maniacdaises,"January 31, 2018",5,LOVE LOVE LOVE great app. very good for people who want to express what they are feeling and for people who relate to others. also extremely well for artists to post their art for people to see and to feel inspired.
4391,ERiiiES,"February 6, 2018",5,Love I am loving this so far! I gave up Facebook and wanted something similar but more of an expressive place to showcase my art and me where others do the same
4392,skegee1881,"February 7, 2018",5,Plethora of Information This app has been a meeting place or gathering of like minds. I’ve acquired so much knowledge about the Divine Nine and history of BGLO. I love Tumblr and really appreciate the information sharing.
4393,hydrowolf8,"February 8, 2018",4,Great app It’s still a great app. It does have annoying recommendations and ads. But other than that it’s a pretty good place that is a little more whatever you want to post without filters.
4394,Isabellaguler,"February 8, 2018",3,Messages I love tumblr but this app has a lot of issues. It constantly says I have messages and I have NONE. Or the amount is completely off. ALSO whenever I try posting a gif thru the app it says “server failed” why is this happening ?!
4395,Charnettex,"February 10, 2018",5,"Easy, UI friendly Works well, UI friendly and easy to understand, haven’t seemed to have any problems with it."
4396,Max app stinks,"February 13, 2018",1,Yahoo Didn't even realize till just now that Tumblr is yahoo. Now I see why they have made the dumbest updates. Like how for some stupid reason you can't access your likes anymore by just clicking your profile. Used to be right there in a small tab. Now you have to hit the likes button way to the right? What idiot came up with that?! Jesus...
4397,Parrisssss,"February 13, 2018",3,"Fix it I used to love love love tumblr so much , now every time I get on it’s so slow and I can’t even be on for longer than 10 minutes cause it force closes every time , it used to never do that but now it does even when updated"
4398,Wildwilson131,"February 15, 2018",5,Incredible content! I’m very new to this app and social networking period. I’m just learning how to do things but the content I’ve found up to this point is awesome!
4399,carm3litaa,"February 16, 2018",5,A+ Been using Tumblr since 2009 and after each update the app just gets better and better
4400,murdur-raven,"November 15, 2017",1,"Chronological. Order.  It’s not that hard, Tumblr The new “best stuff first” feature is beyond ridiculous.  Nobody ever wants that.  "
4401,N0n3_Hum4n,"November 20, 2017",4,"Overall good I mean if you're part of different fandoms and you yourself are pleasing people too (you don't have to) then this app is great, though it does crash on me cause it won't load my gifs sadly :("

4403,iOS 8......,"December 10, 2017",3,TUMBLR LISTEN AND PLEASE UPDATE It’s been weeks since the app has gotten an update. And for the love of GOD please just fix the loading in the photos and whatnot. ITS GLITCHING MY PHONE. Please have the issues fixed as soon as possible. We can’t do anything if the loading speed is slow. Pls and thank you.
4404,Amaya2486,"December 16, 2017",4,Issues with messages U guys wanna fix that?  Please?
4405,WokeUpBeastly,"December 24, 2017",3,"Glitch I have the iPhone SE, and since the update a couple weeks, tumblr will occasionally glitch and zoom in, cutting borders off posts an cutting off the bottom, almost as though it was meant for a larger screen. It’s really annoying."
4406,Brownpanther49r,"December 31, 2017",1,"Crappy app Every single time I watch a video with my phone upright and then flip the phone sideways to get a full screen, the app crashes. I have to restart and look for the video again. Sometimes it does 2 times and by the third time it works. They say they fix things, but I don’t think so. This has been an on going issue for a long time."
4407,Ffpm47,"January 1, 2018",2,"Keeps crashing! I have no problem with navigating through it and I generally like this app, but it keeps crashing over and over again. This is been going on for quite a few days and I’m only on the app for about 15 minutes before this happens. Fix it!"
4408,Two_owls,"January 8, 2018",2,"Images;loading It’s like it doesn’t load properly. Not ALL images load and it reads “Tap to retry”. It’s not my internet, it’s very disappointing because after “retrying” there’s still some pictures asking to try again. Would like to scroll through more peacefully and faster."
4409,Alexxxklex27,"January 13, 2018",1,"Useless- just use the browser My activity seems to update maybe once a day as it does not reflect the actual activity I see on the browser. My dash also regularly doesn’t update even after I manually pull down to refresh, the dash shows outdated content. Better off using safari or chrome on your phone."
4410,tadghcr,"October 16, 2017",1,I have to delete and reinstall every 12 hours It will crash instead of loading unless the connection is just right.
4411,S775546,"October 21, 2017",2,"Freezes a lot!! This app either has to reboot or freezes on photos or videos! You guys really need to improve this! It should not be doing this. What’s worse, it it will lock up my whole phone on a frozen pic, then I’ll have to shut off my phone. Please improve!! This really needs work!"
4412,JohneCa$h,"October 25, 2017",2,Issues issues issues What has happened to this app? I got automatically signed out and now unable to sign back in. I change my password and it still doesn’t let me sign in. Ever since the last update nothing but issues. I think it’s time for me to delete this app.
4413,KaelinaAlvara,"November 1, 2017",1,"Eternal Notifications This most recent update has messed with the app icon badges for message notifications. The little red numbers don't go away now, even if you've viewed all the messages and there are no new ones. Please fix this! It's very annoying and makes it impossible to tell if there actually ARE new message notifications."

4416,SoporificSpecter,"November 10, 2017",1,"Pointless I’be been a tumblr user for years, and I have a few problems with how the app is run but none so frustrating as today’s glitch. I have been unable to pull up the keyboard for reblog as or original posts all day. The entire premise of this site is that it is a blogging platform, and it is currently impossible for me to do that. What is the point."
4417,RainbowTigabeats,"November 11, 2017",3,"Love the app but it’s not working It won’t let me type anything. I can’t type anything when I reblog a post or when I want to create, a post and it’s getting pretty annoying. Other than that I haven’t come across any other problems."

4419,likes_good_music,"November 13, 2017",2,Conflict between video navigation/scrubbing and app switching The current version of the Tumblr app is a pain to use on an iPhone X. The navigation/scrubber interface is too low on the phone’s screen and using it is often interpreted as a bottom side swipe which switches between applications.
4420,laurcot,"September 24, 2017",3,Multitasking I would really love to be able to use Tumblr in multitasking view while on other apps and not have to have it be full screen. I would give it 5 stars if they could make it able to have multitasking on the iPad
4421,chernell,"October 1, 2017",2,"This really bugs me So, I have several issues with this app, mainly the fact that it takes forever to load anything. Not to mention it's kind of clunky and it crashes fairly often. But it's still a better alternative to using Tumblr from the safari app."
4422,XxHumanErrorxX,"October 5, 2017",5,"Amazing app 💗 Honestly I love this app I had no problems using it , everything runs smoothly , I can make great friends here & I love using it just to pass time. Love it very much!~ ❤️"
4423,kathenninger,"April 11, 2020",1,i am insane now because of your bad developing most frequently used tags should come up automatically when i go to reblog a post and tag it. why am i getting every tag that every other person who reblogged the post tagged it with/tags from years ago that i've used once coming up before tags that i use every dang day. yes i'm aware i just said tag a lot. why do 90% images refuse to load randomly when theres nothing wrong with data/wifi and there's no other app having trouble. why do you cancel my background audio from other apps every time i load a page. it is making me go insane
