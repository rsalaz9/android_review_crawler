0,PoppySeed800,"April 30, 2020",4,"just a suggestion... please, please, please make it to where people can like and comment on other peoples posts. personally, i would like to be able to have a way of sharing feed back with the people that i‚Äôm following. right now there is messaging, but the other person has to also be following you. some of the people aren‚Äôt following me back so i have no way of communicating AT ALL. like i said please put a comment section, that would give the app a 5 star rating from me if you did that because it would make it a million times better!! please take my suggestion into thought because i‚Äôve heard that my friends would love it that way too!! i‚Äôm hoping somebody sees this so that they can make a change to the app. I would love to see there being a like button and a comment section. I have been using the app for a while now and I found that if this were there, the app would be so much better. I understand that you want people to be able to express themselves and not receive any hate for doing so, but this would be a good way for others to encourage those people for being who they truly are. There doesn‚Äôt even have to be a dislike button, that way even if people didn‚Äôt like something, they don‚Äôt have to show it. That would keep the positivity rolling. Please take this into consideration because like I said, it would make the app better for me personally, but I‚Äôm sure a lot of other people tooüôÇ"
1,Nice and the best,"July 1, 2019",3,Hate update from a while ago I loved vsco but I hate the storing now because it all goes to my camera roll but that just takes up more storage I like to keep my pictures I take on vsco on vsco and the only way I can keep them if I delete it from my camera roll is if I post it but I don‚Äôt post every picture I take I like to just mess around with some of mine that I don‚Äôt want everyone to see. Please fix this so many people have complained about it and still it hasn‚Äôt been fixed I about want to use a new app but. I think you guys should also add the feature to make our vsco account private. Another thing that irritates me is that if I delete my vsco or something happens or say I got a new phone when I download vsco again all my old photos will be gone and yes I know I can save them to my camera roll to back them up but I hate having my vsco pictures on my camera roll I got vsco so my friends could see my fun pictures that I edit I don‚Äôt want to have to save my vsco pictures to my camera roll or another app it‚Äôs just better to have them on there. 
2,P. C. O.,"November 21, 2018",4,"Love it, but it could be better imo I use this to edit all my photos and I love it, I'm also a VSCO X member and I definitely recommend it for everyone. But, I would like it if you guys made the highlight option to not only take away highlights but to enhance them as well, or present an option where I can select what portions of my image I want highlighted (I‚Äôd prefer this more), and the same for shadows. Also, I‚Äôd like to be able to add presets to DSCO, not just the ones you offer as soon as I take it, because the way it functions now I‚Äôd have to save the DSCO, then re upload it to VSCO, which I find tedious. I‚Äôd also like the option to turn other videos I have into DSCO. Oh, also for DSCO, I want to be able to save it to my VSCO library, instead of only being to save it to my phone or uploading it to my VSCO feed, and make it longer, DSCOs are so short. And it would be cool if you introduced options that are fun like chromatic aberration, or vintage scratches and dust. If you guys had all these things I wouldn‚Äôt touch another app lol. The app‚Äôs dope though, keep it up."
3,zgrooms,"June 23, 2019",2,"Hate the update! I used to absolutely love this app. There wasn‚Äôt a quality I didn‚Äôt like about it. I never actually had an account, or the paid version, and still loved it! I use it to edit my photos for my blog. Recently, after updating the app I noticed a change to the way photos are stored. If I delete a photo in my camera roll, it deletes the edited version from the app. I absolutely hate this change. I use the app to edit my photos before posting, but love to be able to go back and review old photos from the past. After editing and posting on Instagram I always delete them from my camera roll because I don‚Äôt like to have a ton of food pictures on my phone. I always loved that I could go back in the VSCO app and pull up old photos to reuse on my blog if I wanted to. Now that the photos delete themselves when I remove them from my camera roll I am no longer able to store them in the VSCO app. This is super frustrating, and makes me wonder whether I want to continue using the app to edit my photos. "
4,well this is 4 stars,"August 19, 2019",2,"Frustrating Storage Due To Update I absolutely love vsco & it‚Äôs filters & I‚Äôve been using them for years. One of my favorite things was I could import photos into my vsco studio & delete them from my camera roll. Whenever I had the time, I could go back into my vsco studio & get around to editing. Sometimes I‚Äôd save it to my camera roll if I was ready to share/post somewhere, but most of the time I didn‚Äôt. Keeping it in my vsco studio until I needed it just kept everything organized and I could easily keep track of my photos and edits. However, this new update deletes photos from the studio if the original is deleted from the camera roll. This has only caused frustration and an immensely unorganized mess of photos in my camera roll. I don‚Äôt want everything there, I don‚Äôt always need everything exported from the app. And what if I accidentally delete the original? The edit I worked so hard on is gone. This update has only made me use vsco less, and other editing apps a whole lot more. The storage did not need to be fixed, it was functioning perfectly! Overall, this update was extremely upsetting."
5,dissapointedperusual101,"January 5, 2019",2,"non app owner views Because my viewers of my vsco web page without the application on their phone can only view a certain amount of my content, I have decided to no longer focus on my vsco, which was my highest prioritized platform of social media, and now only focus on my instagram and Facebook. I enjoyed having my vsco as a personal blog type app available for my viewers to look at my page even if they didn‚Äôt have the app. Now since vsco requires those to have the app to see all content I must shift my focus to a more easily accessible platform. I wanted to share my art and more personal side but don‚Äôt want to be limited because an application wants more users. I thought vsco supported everyone‚Äôs differences and sharing those with the world but now I see their focus on strictly obtaining users and making money off of them. This makes me less inclined to utilize vsco and far less inclined to ever purchase again through vsco. Your app brand was different and used to focus on the individual and now you‚Äôre just another one of the others, focusing primarily on money and less of the freedom of the user."
6,Ashton McHale,"July 18, 2018",5,"Love love love...but wait! I absolutely love VSCO and use it for all of my photography. The range of creativity, inspiration and options it provides is incredible. My only complaint is that when I‚Äôm scrolling through my feed, I always see tons of content that I like and that I want to republish. However, I always have to slow down while doing this and can‚Äôt mass-republish things without getting an error message! Maybe devs you‚Äôve heard this complaint before and refuse to change it because you want users to pay more attention to others work and not just fly through it (at least that‚Äôs why I think you haven‚Äôt changed this), but I really wish you would! Content can still be enjoyed even if one goes through it quickly. And believe me, I know that many would enjoy the content that they see much more if they were able to republish and favorite things faster without error. Thanks!"
7,Ewilson12345678üçïüé§üê≥,"July 4, 2018",5,"best app ever i am no artist. but ever since i got vsco it has made me want to be more creative and  think outside of the box. the things people can publish on vsco are always incredible and even if it is just words they are always the most relatable things. my favorite part about vsco is that you can‚Äôt comment. people that post on instagram always have the fear of getting a certain amount of likes and who‚Äôs going to comment something, but vsco isn‚Äôt like that. you can be yourself. no one knows how many followers you have. no one knows how many likes you get and rebublishes (kinda like a retweet if u don‚Äôt have the app yet... get it though!) but anyway, thank you vsco for being my favorite app and i just have one recommendation; the posts that people publish saying things like ‚Äúget this to 6 million republishes for my best friend to stop smoking or for me to do something, etc.‚Äù is it possible that the people who own there own accounts can see an actual number of the ppl who republish and like? not because any cares on vsco but because of purposes like that one. i‚Äôd like if nobody can see it but myself, just so i don‚Äôt have to count. even if this never happens, i wouldn‚Äôt be upset at all. i love the way vsco makes every person feel equal. it‚Äôs just a hastle counting when it could just tell you the numbers and only you. if you read this, thank you so much!! rock on!!"
8,osulls490,"December 12, 2017",3,"I love VSCO The app really is stellar, I use their professional film emulation presets in my photo work in Lightroom, and this app makes a lot of that same magic accessible on mobile while introducing a more art aesthetic social experience that counters Instagram. My only real complaint is that notifications are badly delayed. I can get a bunch of them but when I follow them into the app they have yet to refresh the actual activity listings on my posts. They remain that way for awhile before finally catching up. Other people will lament the somewhat obtuse UI and that‚Äôs a fair criticism that I don‚Äôt even think the devs try to sidestep, they wanted to do something unique a couple years back, but they‚Äôve walked a lot of that back because it was unintuitively unique. I‚Äôd still like to see a design change for the app navigation that makes it more intuitive, but they‚Äôve crammed so many valuable features into the main purpose of the app that I can live with it for now. It just makes introducing it to friends a little more difficult."
9,mvalencia_,"June 8, 2019",2,"I hate the recent change. I have been using this app for years now so I finally gave in and decided to purchase a membership. I have loved it....until now. I hate the recent update. Now if you delete a photo in the camera roll then it is automatically deleted in the vsco app, this is extremely frustrating. I was unaware of this recent change. Which is odd because I use this app frequently. It was only brought to my attention once I tried searching the internet to find a way to recover the photos I lost."
10,Baambiey,"January 24, 2018",4,"It‚Äôs amazing but just one thing! I love this app, I‚Äôve used it for about 4 years now and I‚Äôve come to master it! It‚Äôs really amazing and I LOVE VSCO X! I just wish the social media part of it was easier to navigate. I really love the journal part of it and it‚Äôs difficult to use, you can‚Äôt move back and forth and if you leave the paragraph I have to aggressively tap it like, 10 times just to open it! I also wish it showed on the main feed! Another thing on the social aspect, I wish there was a DM and also a a simpler lay out so I can see who I follow and I can get notified when they post. I really love this app I just wish the social aspect was a little bit tweaked ya know? My favorite part about the social part is that it‚Äôs more based on the artistic styling and it really contrasts instagram! I also feel the social side is completely under appreciated! Overall this app is amazing!"
11,D3naaa,"March 5, 2018",3,"Amazing App But Buggy Notifications Okay, so this is literally my favorite app. I love how it‚Äôs based around art and photography compared to like Instagram that‚Äôs just about whatever. Another thing that‚Äôs better about this than Instagram is with insta, you‚Äôre constantly comparing yourself to other people‚Äôs accounts. How many likes do they have? How many followers? With VSCO, you don‚Äôt have that bc it doesn‚Äôt tell you. A+ to you guys. "
12,xSarahhSmiles,"July 21, 2018",4,"ü§î I‚Äôve been using the app for years and it‚Äôs easily one of my favorites. The set up and layout is displayed nicely, and all the functions are easy to find and use. I‚Äôve always liked all the different filters but never wanted to purchase them all individually, so when the subscription rolled out last year I was very excited! That being said, I would love if there could be more in depth tools(selective, curves, text, etc.), too often I find myself having to use another app for a few little things that I think would be great to have all in one place. I also wish you could chose to have a profile or not, simple because I don‚Äôt care much for the social aspect of the app, it doesn‚Äôt seem to run smoothly and no one really seems to interact in it so it seems ultimately pointless, great concept though! Can‚Äôt wait to see what else you guys over on the VSCO team roll out in the future."
13,planet_claiire,"August 6, 2018",5,"Cool things to add! Love this app with the VSCOX membership and everything, but I would love if y‚Äôall could add a Post Notifications feature that way I could make sure to see the posts I want to see when I don‚Äôt have time to scroll through my regular feed!!"
14,alenepatel,"August 15, 2018",5,"FAVORITE APP EVER! Everything about VSCO is perfect. I use VSCO almost everyday and it‚Äôs so refreshing. I love the layout and how simplistic it is. I love how it isn‚Äôt very social unlike Instagram! Please don‚Äôt add in anything else social wise! The messages are a nice touch, but no comments please! That‚Äôs what makes it stand out in my opinion. There are a few glitches I‚Äôm sure you guys are working on, but I‚Äôd like to suggest a tiny feature that means a lot to me, and I‚Äôm sure other users as well‚Äî please add a ‚Äúflip‚Äù photo feature in the editing tools selection. I like the way VSCO takes front facing camera pictures, but hate how my phones front camera flips the end result when I take a selfie with it. Please add a flip feature where I can flip a picture from left to right in the editing selection so it can be just like how it looks when I take one in the VSCO app directly."
15,babycakes_04,"December 18, 2018",4,"VSCO i would most definitely give it five stars, except when i linked VSCO to my bio on instagram, it has a new format. "
16,crgnewcomb,"May 27, 2019",3,"Subscription Billing Without Subscription Service This app crossed over into why-pay-monthly/yearly-for-it territory the last few years with VSCO X, it‚Äôs $20 annual subscription that unlocks all the features in the app. The feature set is robust, but it doesn‚Äôt/hasn‚Äôt changed in ages, other than a few new monthly filters (how many do you really need?). I get subscription billing is the new model, but most services have a feature roadmap or similar. VSCO does not."
17,lea helena,"June 9, 2019",1,"not lovin‚Äô the update, man this new update where it makes you either save or post edited photos, and delete the ones in your library when you delete them from your camera roll, makes everything way more complicated. what if you don‚Äôt want to post something to VSCO right away and then you have to go back to your camera roll, import to VSCO again and THEN post. i really like having all my edited photos on the app because it‚Äôs accessible for posting to VSCO, and likewise saving to camera roll when i need to. "
18,Petey Urie,"June 29, 2019",4,"I love VSCO I use VSCO for all of my mobile picture editing and I've been using it for years! I'd recommend VSCO to everyone who edits pictures. My only complaint is toward a product of a recent update. You guys released an update that deletes filtered pictures off the app once the original is deleted off the phone, I guess to save storage? This just isn't ideal for me. When editing a picture, VSCO is usually the final app I use in my process. When I'm finished, I like to delete all progress pictures for storage purposes and only keep the final product. When I do this, my edited image is removed from VSCO, along with the recipe I used for it. This is an issue for me because I often use the same recipe for different pictures and it's annoying to have both an unedited image and the final product in my phone. I hope my rant made sense and I hope you guys could accommodate me. Much love otherwise ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
19,Alexxx1300,"June 15, 2019",2,"New Update is Overcomplicated!!! Really have loved this app and the editing tools it has. However, with the new update the way photos are saved is super frustrating and overcomplicated. Instead of being able to save changes to the photo and then choosing when to save the finished edited version to your camera roll, every single version you tweak is saved to your camera roll - meaning there‚Äôs multiple copies and it‚Äôs harder to manage which is the one you actually want. Also, if you delete the original photo it‚Äôll disappear from VSCO - but the edited version you saved FROM VSCO is still on your phone but not in your studio?! It makes no sense! The way they stored photos before was much more streamlined, easy to use, and intuitive, and this new update is frustratingly overly difficult and makes editing and saving photos much harder to manage. Really disappointed in this!!! There was no need to fix what wasn‚Äôt broken, and now it works worse than before. Super annoying!!"
20,Tjdyo,"November 27, 2017",3,"Absolutely fantastic app! Would be 5 stars Seriously this app is incredible!!! install it! As a videographer, I'm so used to creating luts and color grading. But this app streamlines everything for editing my DJI Mavic videos/photos and GoPro footage. It seriously bridges the gap between mobile devices and computer editing."
21,Nate175,"December 19, 2017",5,GO TO FOR ANYTHING. Check this out...I've been using VSCO for about 2/3 years. I'm giving them a 5 star rating. Let me tell you why..
22,Gilick.me,"January 9, 2018",4,"Love love love however.. I have been using VSCO for a while now and I have been obsessed with it ever since I downloaded it. However, it is a bit annoying at times. I really love finding new people through pictures that others have republished, but whenever I find someone new that I want to follow, I do. When I do follow them and try to go back to my main timeline it brings me all the way back up to the top, which is very aggravating (especially if you‚Äôre like me, and follow a bunch of people). Another problem I have is very similar to that. I also enjoy finding new people in the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù bar, however when I go to see someone‚Äôs page on there to and come back to my main timeline it brings me back up to the top as well. If these problems were fixed, the app would be perfect and have 5 stars from me!"
23,Byerkes,"January 31, 2019",3,"3 out of 5 I gave this app a 3 out of 5 because I can see the benefits of this app. It provides individuals the chance to connect with their peers while decreasing the chance of competing with others by not publicly providing the number of followers and likes given. Also, it is enjoyable to post and edit your own pictures as well as seeing other people‚Äôs images. My concerns are with the privacy policy and how much of your information is being collected by the service and given to third parties. If I had not read the policy I never would have known how much they analyze what you do on the app. I also believe that apps such as this one can have a great influence on a teen‚Äôs social identity, so it should be used with caution. I think it is better suited for older teens rather than 12 and up as the age rating suggests. Like most apps it has it negatives and positives so it all depends on how you use the app."
24,theoneandonlygypsyroselee,"April 1, 2019",4,"I loved this app up until.. I‚Äôve been using this app for about a year now, maybe a little longer? I fell in love with this app because it was the only program that would let me edit my photos to look natural but still a little cleaner and prettier than the original. I just recently discovered the camera aspect to it, and fell in love with it. I religiously used it for selfies because it wouldn‚Äôt flip the picture like my default camera does. Up until a few days ago, I had absolutely no problems with it. But now, whenever I try and take a selfie, it flips it as though I was just taking a picture with my default camera and there are no settings to fix it. I‚Äôve googled it and I can‚Äôt find any fixes for the issue, but other than that I love the app very much and I hope that I can figure out this problem eventually."
25,HollywoodJones,"June 2, 2019",5,"Not feeling the latest update Love the app, but the latest update just complicated a process that wasn‚Äôt complicated. I edit a photo and then save what I edited to my camera roll, SIMPLE! Now when I edit a photo, apparently I HAVE to post that photo to one of my social media platforms in order to be able to save that edit?! Thank you but I didn‚Äôt ask you guys to go ahead and make that decision on my behalf. I‚Äôm an adult, I can decide for myself when and if I want to add a photo that I edited to my social media, didn‚Äôt need you guys to take it upon yourselves to do what you thought was in my best interest. Right now I‚Äôm screenshotting my edits just to get them into my camera roll so that EYE (‚ÄúI‚Äù) can decide what I want to do with them and when. Hopefully I won‚Äôt have to do this much longer. Many thanks."
26,carolinejaneelizabeth,"January 4, 2020",3,"Deleted pictures I love Vsco and use it to edit pretty much all of my pictures, but a while back I noticed that when you upload a picture to Vsco and then delete the original off your camera roll it deletes it off of Vsco too. I had hoped maybe it was a glitch and obviously it was not, but I decided to just stick with it anyway because I hoped it‚Äôd become less annoying. It hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating to not be able to delete your pictures, especially because sometimes I want to go back to old pictures I‚Äôve edited and either copy the edits or mess around with a new edit, and now I can‚Äôt unless I keep everything on my camera roll. It‚Äôs an awful feature and instead of growing used to it I‚Äôm just becoming more and more irritated and closer to not using the app. Lots of people seem to have this same problem"
27,ALYSON227,"July 9, 2019",5,"VSCO ONLY CARES ABOUT MONEY I bought WELL over $35 of filter packages. And they have now been recently taken away and LOCKED. Even though I ALREADY BOUGHT THEM. I didn‚Äôt borrow them, I BOUGHT them. And they‚Äôre asking for $20 a year to simply rip off everyone, because it costs more to get the membership than to buy the packages. They don‚Äôt even offer buying the packages anymore. They simply took it away. I use those filters everyday. I even had presets. I love editing, that‚Äôs why I spent the money I did. And now? They took it from me, and I know you‚Äôre probably thinking it‚Äôs just filters... I made a passion out of it. My friends would come to me to edit their pictures, and they took that away from me to make more money. They could‚Äôve at least kept what we ALREADY had instead of TAKING IT. all because VSCO IS GREEDY"

29,Alesha Berkshire,"November 21, 2019",5,"a note of praise A year or two ago, I was struggling with sadness. I found a hobby that became a passion- photography, and especially posting the photos I took on some instagram etc. Although it might seem silly, the likes, comments, and all of the pressure began to flow in, causing me to become more depressed. I couldn‚Äôt handle it, so I stopped using the social media apps. I need a way to demonstrate my photos to some people. "
30,sp.ooder,"February 3, 2018",3,"oh i really adored this app, it really got my feed together on instagram, helped me touch up photos for my job, etcetera. the only problem i have now is that all the filters i used regularly are now moved to VSCO X. i don‚Äôt have the money to pay for it, and i believe that you should have kept the filters where they were‚Äî especially for the ones who really enjoyed them. i think we, the people who don‚Äôt really have as much money as others, deserve to keep some of the filters we enjoy. like, HB2 and HB1, and C2? i have to buy those now and it‚Äôs unfair in my opinion. you already had filter sets that we could buy, which i didn‚Äôt need because i had the filters i needed. then you started VSCO X and it still didn‚Äôt make me any difference. but now that i have to pay for the filters that i actually use makes this app rather useless at this point."
31,photographer1024,"June 21, 2018",1,"PLEASE FIX PROFILE PIC GLITCH Ok so I recently got this app because my friend said I should and I had no complaints. But then I went to add in a TEMPORARY profile picture because I wanted to have one but did not have any good pictures at the time. Now, I have a new picture that I want as my profile pic but every time I try to change it, it just goes back to my previous one. I click edit, import from camera roll, click the picture I want and then it shows up. I then make sure to click the check mark and not the ex so that it saves my changes. Then my new profile picture shows up and it looks like it has changed. But then the moment I leave the app or move to a different slide within the app, my profile pic changes back to the previous one. I have tried numerous times, and even deleted the app and redownloaded it, but even that didn‚Äôt work.

32,Dancer born as a star,"August 26, 2018",5,"I‚Äôm in love with this app but, Can you change one thing? I think it would be cool if you could still edit your photos, even after you publish them. Especially if your page has a theme, and you want to change the filter on a photo or add more highlights or something. It would be easier instead of having to delete a photo that you posted a while back, that you like but just want to edit a little more, than to delete it, edit it, and then post it again. I love everything about this app except that tiny little detail, that majority of the VSCO users would agree with me on. I know that you are always fixing bugs and adding new things so, hopefully you could look into this."
33,stlviacat,"February 24, 2019",3,"Recent paywall has me moving elsewhere I have used VSCO rabidly since I was in high school. I would constantly drool over the payed presets they offered and dreamed of being able to afford them. I was considering joining VSCO X because of the added presets and editing tools, and praised that they decided to grandfather in and keep their most popular free presets free. "
34,Sticks4Him,"May 15, 2019",5,"INCREDIBLE I am by no means a professional photographer, but photography and photo editing are absolutely hobbies of mine. VSCO has literally revolutionized the way I edit and the way I view photography. I have had so many shots that I look at and think, ‚ÄúIs it even worth it?‚Äù But then I give it a go on VSCO, and I come up with a product that I am SO so pleased with. It‚Äôs amazing! I would definitely recommend VSCO to anyone who takes photos, because there‚Äôs something for everyone with high quality, easy-to-use filters and presets and in-depth editing features for more particular editors. "
35,jordanlikeriver,"July 5, 2019",3,"love everything BUT the new update :/ VSCO as an app has always been one that I‚Äôve loved. It‚Äôs very versatile with the edits that you can make, even without a premium account and all the extra filters. It‚Äôs got many useful features, such as being able to copy edits automatically to other photos that I just haven‚Äôt seen in many other apps."
36,@dearcorrena,"March 27, 2020",5,"Older gallery photos I loooove vsco!! My favorite app that has surpassed instagram & tumblr for me! I love how private it is, you cant see likes or followers.

37,Ventures_3G,"September 22, 2019",1,"Over it! This was my go to app for social media for my clients and my private Instagram all the photos from my photo albums and more. I used to almost religiously and love the features. Now all the photos I adjust in VSCO Disappear from my camera roll when I texport. A while ago it started that all photos from the app suddenly vanished from the main photo folder in Apple photo and were somehow placed in the separate folder that was specific for the app. This was annoying because it proved a workaround when posting to social and other types of image sharing. Recently the photos have even stopped appearing in that separate folder. They just vanish. So they live in VSCO with no way of getting them out or sorting. Also when creating photo albums or calendars for my family, VSCO photos also just remain gone. And that‚Äôs a shame because the ones adjusted with the app tend to be the best ones. Sorry but I will have to take a pass and no longer support this app thank you."
38,Biancareyes99,"June 29, 2019",3,"This App ‚ù§Ô∏è Amazing filters, quality, and concept. This app took my editing and fixing up touches skills to a whole another level. I can‚Äôt imagine my photography days without this app. I hope to see more updates and new additions! I‚Äôm really looking forward to the day when you guys can include more social interactions. I‚Äôm having a hard time looking for my friends so I hope to see a change in that. Maybe even include people in my area. It would be a cool way to get people who like photography together. And also, I‚Äôm having a really hard time with the update. Removing pictures from your camera roll also erases in VSCO. It has really been hard and I wish for VSCO to not had all the access to my camera roll. I have accidentally erased so many photos from VSCO it‚Äôs driving me mad. I hope this is something that will improve over time . Thank you."
39,MiniPodcaster‚ù§Ô∏è,"January 6, 2020",5,"Great...but membership activation is weird amazing app. i enjoy editing and how it has no ads and no followers or likes or how no weirdos can contact you. but on the downside, i purchased a membership and it won‚Äôt show up. i have tried logging in to both accounts that i have, and neither of them has the membership. i am worried that i have just paid $20 for nothing. please help! EDIT: i had to renew the vsco membership to use it. slightly confusing and frustrating but the guide had pictures. the vsco x is amazing, but you should be able to post vids. also, a guide to what each tool does would be nice. (e.g. exposure does blank while simultaneously reducing the blank). in all, an AMAZING app. 10/10. better than afterlight as well."
40,SynTC,"October 7, 2017",5,I love VSCO - user: taxicxb I use it everyday and i love how it‚Äôs created for people who love taking pictures. With that said I absolutely HATE how hard it is to find people you know or would like to follow. You can‚Äôt see who someone else is following and I really don‚Äôt like that. I think it‚Äôs very hard to find people who take pretty pictures because the VSCO account only shares the best photographers. With that said I hate that it is difficult for people to find my photos as well because I have very beautiful pictures and no one is finding them.  I still love the app and would give it five stars everyday because I know they will fix this problem eventually and I will continue using the app.

One of the two, taking away something someone paid for and forcing your stupid yearly vsco X is now out of the picture for me to get because of this cheap scam that was pulled on me.

43,Game review 123,"October 24, 2018",3,"Okay but... I really enjoy using this app. It‚Äôs a great way to share your creativity and pictures. One thing I wish the app had was an easier way to look at your old pictures from years past. As of right now you have to scroll down and I‚Äôve had the app for three years, so for me to scroll down of three years of pictures it takes a very long time. Also after a while of scrolling the app will just stop letting you scroll and you have to start over. Which takes even more time. Overall I love to post my pictures the app. If there was an easier way to access your older published photos that would make the app 5/5.Maybe add something that allows you to view pictures by year. if you could create a timeline or some way to view pictures of the past that would be great for a creator."

First, the app takes forever (as in more than one minute) to start, so whatever i wanted to photograph is long gone. Then the filters are nice, but there is no good/easy way to compare them except going back and forth between thumbnails and full screen views (or may be there is but the App UI and navegation is so confusing that i couldnt find it), then there is no way to import multiple photos, and i have not been able to publish multiple photos at the same time, they become ‚Äújournals‚Äù that for some reasons remain private not public (only solution customer support could give me was to keep trying and waiting). And i am tired of clicking around little icons to get to the screen I want. Sad, because the idea behind the app was good, but the execution is lacking a bit!"

47,pag927,"June 3, 2019",1,"Can no longer save images/videos in the app VSCO‚Äôs most recent update has completely changed the way users can interact and edit their photos and videos. The app is now very restrictive. Many users typically change their edits over time and compare them with others, but that option is not longer available, since a user must either post the image to their VSCO profile or save it to their camera roll. With the many filters VSCO offers, you can no longer even compare them to see which one you like best on your photo. I also usually copy and paste edits onto other photos, but if I cannot save a photo on the app, now I can no longer do this either. I personally believe, and see that many other users agree, that this change was a poor app design choice. If VSCO does not change their saving options, I will most likely start to use a different editing app even though I prefer VSCO‚Äôs filters over most apps."

Sure, it would be fun to include film scratches and whatnot but I think we have enough apps that could help. Thank you for these filters VSCO, and thanks to my cousin who recommended this first!

Trying to do simple edits that would normally take a couple minutes takes me an obscene amount of time. For example, trying to edit the exposure of a photo should be a quick thirty seconds to a minute process.

I had to free up some space on my phone so i deleted it for a few minutes and i completely forgot that it erases all my work once deleted. I had over 200 edited pictures stored in there.

Like moving them in a different order than having to delete everything to where you want to put that picture. Just like how the journals work where you can insert an image with the little plus sign. I also wish that when you post a DSCO that you could republish. There have been many times where I accidentally delete it somehow and I couldn‚Äôt add it back. I think it would be useful.

I have used VSCO for around 6 years on numerous devices and I always use it for editing photos so as you can expect, I was ecstatic when I found out that VSCO X offers VIDEO EDITING.

I‚Äôve submitted the issue to support but have no definitive timeline of when this will be fixed. So my blog images aesthetic won‚Äôt match my social accounts.

I do not have that money to waste on anything  let alone an app I don‚Äôt even use weekly.  And they won‚Äôt refund me the money.

As everyone does, I have my own routines for storage management, backups, posting, and I don‚Äôt edit all at one time. Now all of that is disrupted since export to the camera roll is forced in order to save edits. If exports are deleted from the camera roll, they are deleted in VSCO. If you post at a later date or you‚Äôre not done editing, you need to keep those exported photos in the camera roll or store them elsewhere. Granted, other apps work like this, and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use them. I don‚Äôt like apps that make me work around them.

I see some really nice photos that have been edited with VSCO so it obviously works great for others. Not saying the program doesn‚Äôt work. It just does not do what I need to do. I wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard to edit a photo to take the slight gray out. I‚Äôm sure it is probably user error and perhaps I don‚Äôt fully understand the program.

And how many followers you have / how many people you‚Äôre following !! Like I think if that feature was there it‚Äôd be perfect. You could make that count like either private or public depending on the photo.

79,Qwedgeonline,"February 27, 2020",2,"A Shell of Its Former Self VSCO used to be my go-to app for editing photos, but about 3 years ago they began to strip features out, convolute the interface multiple times, slow down editing, import and export photos at a snails‚Äô pace, and many other small changes that have caused VSCO to fall from one of my top professional apps, to not even being installed on my devices anymore. Lately it seems VSCO has been putting style over function and it shows in many ways. The gallery interface is beautiful, but requires much scrolling once you amass a large library of photos.

I should have known that eventually the interests in building the social part of the app would usurp the focused useful tools for processing photos. I now cannot use anything I have previously purchased which is super disappointing. I hope they fix this issue, if not, I‚Äôll have to find a new solution for my photography needs."
85,Cutestuff988,"December 10, 2019",3,"This App Has Died I used to love posting and uploading to vsco. I started my account for photography in 2016. It has gotten to the point where the app has become so bad I‚Äôm at the point of looking for alternatives. I have purchased all the presets, I loved the app, but as of recent the little white girls have taken over. I no longer see photography but pictures of screenshots of ‚Äúrelatable content‚Äù from other social media apps. Not to mention, I receive tons of followers that are bots. What really concerns me is most of their profile is blank, with links in the bio to porn websites. I try to block them, but because of VSCO they can still search my account and view my content. All I can say is that maybe it‚Äôs time for a change. Do better."
86,smoke_rings,"November 14, 2019",2,"Sizing feature gone I used to use this app for all editing but I‚Äôm liking it less and less nowadays. VSCO no longer offers the option to select the sizing of the photo I choose to download. One size fits all is not helpful especially when your standard size does not fit into the instagram image standard frame size. If your sizing can‚Äôt sync with other major platform sizing expectations, you should allow users to edit or choose the image dimensions they are working with. And then the additional storage features and syncing between my phone‚Äôs photo library and my vsco library haven‚Äôt helped me at all, I don‚Äôt keep every photo I‚Äôve ever taken on my phone but I liked having it saved in VSCO knowing I could easily find it or edit it later. No longer the case."
87,Lissette Cedeno,"June 14, 2019",1,"Hate the new changes I loved VSCO and I still do enjoy the presets and all, but the changes where you delete the photos from the app when you remove them from your phone is extremely frustrating. I use google photos on my phone to help backup my pictures but when I backup my photos it removes them from vsco which is the worst because sometimes I didn‚Äôt save it and usually I‚Äôll have the photo in the app to do put on my gallery again but nope they aren‚Äôt there. This makes the app horrific to me. Please change it back to how it was before so the People who don‚Äôt store all of there photos on their gallery can still enjoy the app. This is the worst change to the app which made me completely change my point of view toward the app. I would‚Äôve given it 5 stars before the change. Please to something about this thanks."
88,Mollyclish,"July 21, 2019",3,Not a fan of the update I am a starting photographer and while I wait until I can afford adobe I use VSCO as my main editing platform. I loooooved using it until this update which I am disappointed in. I find it annoying that I now have a limit on the amount of photos that I am allowed to select for either coping/pasting or for saving to my camera roll/selecting a few to text to my phone to post on my social media. I know this is only a minor thing but it is making my editing process much slower than I‚Äôd like. It is also annoying how after you edit a photo it takes you to the top of the feed. I edit like with like and this is making me lose which photo I am on when I make small fine edits
89,All it is,"June 14, 2019",2,"New update screwed me over I took pictures and like usual put them all into my VSCO. I edited the pictures in VSCO and was very satisfied with them, like usual I went to my camera roll and deleted the original pictures off my phone. I THEN go back to VSCO and only THEN do I get the update notice that when I delete pictures in my camera roll, it also deletes it off my phone. So all my edited pictures were gone and gone for good because the original pictures in my camera roll were deleted right away due to my iCloud storage being full. So thanks sm. I want those pictures back so bad but I doubt that I'll get them back due to this update. Should've asked for the users permission to delete the pictures in VSCO when deleting original photos in our camera roll."
90,Yaaaassssbiissh,"February 8, 2018",4,"Love VSCO I love this app, I‚Äôve been using it for already 5 years now I believe. You can‚Äôt go wrong with this app, everyone always ask you what app you use because they love the edits. But sadly, they took away that Syncing option, so when you make an account and have your pictures under that account, then download the app on another device, those pictures would no longer transfer to other devices, even if you have an account and it‚Äôs under your account. Which I don‚Äôt really get why they took that away? I still use the app now, but I don‚Äôt have all of my old pictures in my account on my new phone which really. bothers me."
91,Forever and always Swifte,"September 19, 2018",5,"Best photo app ever i have never had an app like VSCO before. i have always had snapchat and instagram which revolve around how many friends/followers you have. Whenever you post a picture it‚Äôs incredibly stressful, wondering if it looks good or how many likes you will get. vsco is completely different. You are free to express yourself, no one can see how many followers and likes you have except for yourself. Want to post 5 times a day? Go ahead. vsco is a wonderful place where you can be yourself, free of stress and judgment. Vsco is a far better app then instagram, i would recommend it to anyone."
92,machineinthestudio,"October 16, 2018",2,"App is always buggy and VSCOX hardly seems worth it The VSCO app itself is great for learning about photography basics that can be manipulated on the spot while taking a picture: composition, ISO, white balance, etc. Moreover, I loved VSCO app‚Äôs option to purchase presets without a subscription - this felt like a fair exchange of money for additional features. With the advent of VSCOX, new presets are not really available to buy and I have no interest in paying for another monthly app subscription especially when the app is incredibly buggy no matter how many times an update is released. While this is a great app to learn more about photography, I would recommend buying some presets and then focus attention on learning about white balance, ISO, etc. which will help you take better photos in general."
93,kkell2468,"January 4, 2019",4,"Love it, but still needs new features VSCO is currently one of my favorite photo editing apps. I love the different filters and effects we could use, without even having to get VSCO X. However, I really wish that you could have an archive feature, where you can hide the photos that were originally on your feed, while not deleting them (kind of like instagram). I know the photo can be saved to my library before I delete, and that the edited photo does have a copy in the studio portion, however it would be a lot easier to see all the different photos I have once edited and posted in an archived folder... or something like that. Thanks!!"
94,Abby Gott,"May 29, 2019",5,"Really amazing I really love this app and how it‚Äôs almost like a social media but doesn‚Äôt have the toxic like button and commenting button.

I would like to be able to delete my journals though, im not able to do that and would love to recreate some of my old ones that I don‚Äôt love. Since own go the things that I love about the app is how easily I can delete , re edit and repost picturesz I also wish I can see how many people and who I follow. Thank you"
95,sc00kie,"April 19, 2020",3,"Used to love I have been using VSCO for years now‚Äîit was my go-to app. I had purchased all the filter packs back in the day but then was prompted with a membership fee as time went on. I purchased and it eventually ran out so I renewed it, however, I was never able to have access to the filters after the renewal, even after paying $20. I had to request a refund and now I‚Äôm upset because I can‚Äôt use the app that I‚Äôve always gone to for editing my photos. I‚Äôm also irritated that I spent so much money on this app in the past and it was all for nothing because even though I paid for the filter packs, I can‚Äôt have access unless I pay a membership fee and even still, it doesn‚Äôt work."
96,___cheer___,"March 26, 2020",5,"video editing Love this app so much I use it all the time, but the only thing I can criticize is the video editing portion. I thought it was so neat that you could now crop and trim your videos on the app, but I noticed that whenever I tried to use that feature, the app would always crash when i tried to save it! I then updated VSCO and the feature was gone. I‚Äôm assuming it was to fix the crashing of the app, but I‚Äôd love if you guys could find out a way to keep the cropping and trimming features without the crashing issue! Thank you so much for listening, i hope there is a solution."
97,Joy love Hate,"April 6, 2020",3,"Great app, major flaws i have used VSCO for a few years now and i am a VSCOx member and i really do enjoy the editing features! a major flaw about it though is that after posting an image, i get notifications about people interacting w my image, then when i go on the app to view it, their notifications disappear. it would be nice if it could be more accurate in showing me my feed and my collection, along with profiles interacting w my photos. another flaw is that when searching someone on vsco, it doesn‚Äôt base your search on who you follow/who follows you, so i often have to scroll pages upon pages to find the account i want to see. great app other than the few, frustrating flaws."

99,Mgallihellokittylover,"June 20, 2019",4,"Just one problem I love VSCO, it‚Äôs great for editing pictures, and I love that it doesn‚Äôt show follower counts, like counts, or repost counts. It is a great app, and the only problem I have is with the new update, it deletes pictures from VSCO automatically if you delete them from your camera roll. It‚Äôs inconvenient, as I sometimes want a picture to be on VSCO and not my camera roll. There should be an option to choose whether or not I want the pictures to automatically delete or not. Or at least when I open the app inform me what pictures were deleted, and give the option to save them. Other than this, I would give the app 5 stars."
100,bob222883,"December 4, 2017",3,"SUGESTIONüòÄ I love this app so much! it‚Äôs one of the many few apps where you can post and people can‚Äôt see the amount of likes or followers you have. You can just have fun and edit. however i do wish that there was a way to upload videos you have already taken to your account. like dscos or boomerangs from instagram. that would be really cool. also i wish there was an easy way to rearrange the pictures you already posted, so you can add in a new photo. I was trying to add a firework picture, but i would have to delete a ton of photos before i could post it to the correct chronological spot. So like a time line or someway where you can insert a photo with out the hassle of deleting!"
101,s.tbn84,"December 19, 2017",3,"Community is good, but meh‚Ä¶ The community is good and what the app/system is developed around. However, the embedded cam is very, very basic, the IAP's are a bit pricey and the yearly membership fee is kinda ridiculous when you consider the other systems you're likely already a member of (ie: Adobe), if you're using this system to its fullest capacity or a developer, pro photographer, etc. It all adds up and in my opinion for what you get for the prices isn't at all worth it. But again, the community atmosphere is really good aside from the other stuff. Other apps have the same or extremely similar filters and editing tools for either free or are much cheaper with no yearly membership fee. Take it for what it's worth."

I was about to purchase a subscription but I thought that I should do the 7 day free trial first to see it and because why not? I did and it didn‚Äôt register. It kept trying to make me sign up even though everything said I had except when I used the features. I did everything that it told me to. I reinstalled, logged in and out, restarted my phone, messed around in settings but nothing worked. I contacted Vsco for some help through their support. I received an email telling me that they would respond soon but they haven‚Äôt. It has been 3 days and I‚Äôve wasted 3 days of  my ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù.

I love the fact that I cannot see anyone else's followers, republishes, likes, etc. But, I do wish I could see a number count for myself. I‚Äôve had a few posts get a lot of republishes that I counted myself because I was curious, and it sure was not fun to count over 1,000 people out. It would be cool if there was a little number maybe at the bottom of the activity or somewhere that read the number of republishes and favorites, and same at the bottom of followers."

I usually post on it everyday until my mom asked me to delete most of my pictures. I was upset but it was because of the fact there is no setting to make your account private. I definitely think their should be a setting that can make your account private so that some kids with strict parents can still use it. From personal experience many more of my friends would use this app if this setting was an option. Hopefully vsco sees this review and thinks about adding this setting."

Today however, I attempted to edit some photos and the app would not allow me to edit, so I restarted my phone in an effort to reset this: it did not fix it. After many attempts I decided to reinstall the app in hopes that this would work. I was very sad to find that ALL OF THE PICTURES I HAD EDITED AND SAVED HAD BEEN COMPLETELY WIPED! A very sad moment to lose about 100 images. There should be a warning of some sort that you will not be able to recover all of your studio images. Now I‚Äôve lost precious images that I will never get back. Thanks for the heads up VSCO :,("

Now, since many of those photos aren‚Äôt in my camera roll anymore, they‚Äôre gone from my studio! I‚Äôm very upset because now all those edits and photos are lost.

Anyways I‚Äôm on the ‚Äúnot using it‚Äù trend now for awhile and just for a email saying that I requesting my password to be change. Not exactly comforting when you haven‚Äôt used the app in a good 8 months or so. Do you guys automatically send out password update emails if a person hasn‚Äôt logged on in awhile or is your account system been hacked? and this is the second time it‚Äôs happened as well. either way why also wasn‚Äôt my account fully deleted when I closed my account?...

Naturally since this a a recurring charge, any customer would want to know how to cancel if the service isn‚Äôt something they find useful at some point.

VSCO has been the best mobile photo editing platform for ages and they are always improving the tools used to make out photos look great, but have never gotten the interface quite right. Editing photos is simple enough, but the app gets confusing quick. The use of symbols instead of words is excellent for the minimalist look, and for long-time users who are familiar with the app, but downright confusing for most. The social aspect is fantastic, as soon as you learn how to find new pages to follow. Overall, fantastic app, it just needs a rework on the layout to maximize its potential."

I‚Äôve tried everything even updated my iPad and installed and uninstalled the app and nothing works. Why is this happening and when can it be fixed? I also pay for VSCO so I need it to work please and thank you
134,"Morgan, a Level 7 Artist","May 16, 2019",5,"Improvement for this Member Seeing as though I pay the annual membership for this (albeit, awesome) app, I feel warranted to ask for a few improvements. VSCO could definitely benefit from a blur effect (gaussian blur, akin to RNI films blur/sharpen tool) and a blackpoint adjusting measure found in Apple‚Äôs built-in photo editing in the Photos app, the latter comes in handy when wanting to keep photos at a low contrast without a faded, washed out look‚Äî darkens the background or hair, etc. It might be my most used. Overall, great app and awesome filters and updates rolling out. HSL for saturation sold me. Thanks."
135,Gbbhttbvrgrvgvgvrv,"June 1, 2019",4,New update With this new update about keeping a photo on VSCO and then deleting it onto your camera roll which then deletes it on your VSCO feels unnecessary. My account is usually about selfies and other random stuffs but I don‚Äôt want to keep it in my camera roll. Pls switch it back on how it used to be or have an option to save it on one of the apps. I get it like how it can save space but some photos are meant to be shown and saved on certain apps. Again please have an option to save the photo onto VSCO and happily deleting it in the camera roll or go back how it was before.
136,Logancharles,"June 9, 2019",3,"New auto-delete feature interferes with worklflow Long-time user and X subscriber here. I‚Äôve always loved this app so much, with one of my favorite aspects being how streamlined and convenient everything is. However, this new feature that automatically removes photos from your VSCO page when you delete the photo from your Apple photo roll makes it extremely difficult to make multiple edits of the same photo to fine-time. I‚Äôve accidentally deleted my photos at least 5 times a day now and it‚Äôs making it very hard to want to keep using VSCO. "
137,Artisan Guitars,"November 30, 2019",3,"Long time fan, sometimes has bugs Hi VSCO group - I‚Äôve been a happy long time user since the iPhone 5 came out.

138,yo.its.taylor,"February 4, 2020",4,great but needs some things improved i use vsco to edit ALL of my pictures. it‚Äôs my go-to app (even over instagram and snapchat!!) but i recently switched phones and my pictures on my iphone camera roll hadn‚Äôt loaded back in yet and when i went i vsco i had lost EVERY SINGLE PICTURE that was in my studio even after my pictures were loaded back into my phone. i wish you would change it back to the old way where you could delete stuff from you camera roll and it would still be in your vsco studio. other than that small issue it‚Äôs my favorite app!!
139,Jgjhhhv,"June 27, 2019",2,Please change back the way photos are stored! I love this app but I‚Äôm dissatisfied with this new update. I hate that we can no longer choose which photos to save to camera roll and it just automatically saves them all. It takes up far too much storage space in my camera roll. Also.... If we delete a photo from the camera roll... it also deletes it from the app. I don‚Äôt know who thought this was a good idea... but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a huge unconvinced. Because now I‚Äôm stuck deleting tons of pics off my phone when deciding which ones to keep and choose from. Please please change this feature back to the way it was. I see other reviewers have complained about this as well.
140,1starguy,"March 18, 2018",5,"VSCO: best photo app ever I absolutely love VSCO, to the point of where I use it multiple times a day. It's editing features are great, and when paired with VSCO X, my photos turn out beautiful. I love the interface, and the social aspect of it is helpful for my friends and me. My one caveat I've found with using VSCO is that it has a weird bug that after clicking the back button or using the back swipe gesture about ten times, the interface gets all jumpy and stretches out. I just restart the app to fix it temporarily, but it returns soon."
141,prisingh423,"May 28, 2018",2,"Getting bad.. I subscribe to VSCO, and have paid the fee. However, I‚Äôm starting to want to unsubscribe. I really do not need all the filters, as I find myself going back to same filters time and time again. Additionally, after the most recent update, the app keeps crashing. It is also more difficult to trigger the slider in the skew and rotation tool than it was before, which is a huge reason why I used to love this app. I do like how they combined the functionalities into one area, but the difficulty triggering it to move is making me think this app might not be my #1 photo editor anymore :( hopefully the kinks from this last update are fixed soon so I don‚Äôt have to start using another app."
142,yashika4452,"August 6, 2018",5,Vsco I think when lots of people ha e lots of followers on vsco they also get lots of republishes so it‚Äôs hard for them too count like 500 so maybe u should have a little button where it shows how many republishes u have. Along with that lots of people put there vsco link in their bio on instagram and when I go through mine I have to tap to see the dsco so instead just make it moving how it is in the app. One last thing maybe have like 2 new filters for free so it‚Äôs something new. Other than that tho I really love the app:)

(Mobile only, not desktop). PLEASE increase the accessibility of our art by getting rid of this pop up feature on mobile, thus enabling anyone to see our photos without having to download the app. I wanted to share my profile among relatives and friends on Facebook, some of which are older, but this pop up on mobile devices is really hindering its usability."

DSCOs are fun but they don‚Äôt upload despite many support tickets and efforts. Those are the issues currently annoying me but there are a few others as well. I won‚Äôt subscribe again, it‚Äôs really not worth it. Use the free version and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. No expectations, no disappointments."

147,glorable,"July 24, 2019",2,LOTS of BUGS!!! I used to edit all my photos here for about a few years but up until about a month ago I‚Äôve been having problems with bugs. I‚Äôve tried updating but my Apple store doesn‚Äôt show that I need an update. The app is fine up until I want to edit or save a photo to my phone. The app also picks and chooses which picture to upload on my VSCO profile. Some will upload where others will not. Also when I try to edit or download a photo to my phone the app freezes and then crashes by exiting out. If it weren‚Äôt for the bugs I would rate this app a 5-star. Let me know when IT fixes this app. Until then I‚Äôll be looking for an alternative editing app.
148,Heartbroken<\3,"July 7, 2019",4,"love, hate relationship I love the app to edit my pictures and everything, but the only issue I have is the update from a couple months ago. Every picture I take on the vsco camera, is automatically saved to my camera roll and when i delete the picture off my camera roll(to free up storage) all of the pictures i took are gone. it can be very frustrating because sometimes I edit the pictures multiple times and only want a select view that I took to stay on my vsco ‚Äúcamera roll‚Äù and my normal one."
149,mollymp06,"July 6, 2019",4,"Deleting your post are annoying I‚Äôve had vsco and its have worked wonders but the only problem I have with it is that they have recently have had this update, where has if you delete something from your camera roll, it deletes from your profile. And this update upsets me because I used to use this app for two reasons; 1. To edit and share my photos ;2. To keep them, so they won‚Äôt take up storage. So reason 2 doesn‚Äôt work anymore. This is a very big inconvenience and is annoying. But above that a very well working fun, interesting app."

For instance, this morning i went onto the app to go scroll through my feed and within 3 seconds of opening the app, my phone started to turn off and then it restarted. it has been doing this each time i go on vsco and it‚Äôs honestly annoying, please fix this issue asap."

152,Lacy Woods,"April 12, 2019",5,"GREAT APP If you are looking for a way to conveniently edit your photos, then use VSCO. It has so many great features and adds a social media touch that won‚Äôt bug you when you get on the app. Complimented with it‚Äôs totally worth it premium edition, VSCO X, it is very powerful to edit your pictures with. You can even go the extra mile and edit videos for a nice look. Some features that really stand out are: presets, adjustable filter characteristics, grain, reposting photos, and customizable color saturation. Trust me... VSCO is the way to go."
153,aparnasiv,"April 17, 2019",3,"Good for editing but needs to fix some issues I love the app for editing my pictures, I‚Äôve been using it for a long time. My only complaint is that when you go to choose a picture from your camera roll, the part that loads the albums never loads for me! I thought it might be a software update issue but even after I updated it won‚Äôt load. This makes it very hard to pick older photos because you have to manually scroll all the way down your camera roll instead of just picking them from an album or favorites. Please fix this issue!!! I can‚Äôt use the app like this."

BUT this morning, I clicked on the app and wanted to import a photo into my gallery. I clicked on my gallery and was absolutely shocked when I realized that all my photos were deleted. I have photos on VSCO that I don‚Äôt have anywhere else and because of that, all those captured memories are gone. I don‚Äôt understand why the app did this. If there is anyway I could possibly get these photos back I would do it in a heartbeat, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible ... This problem has made me very upset with the way the app works. I hope VSCO considers this issue into something they need to fix, because now, all the precious photos I have taken over the years are absolutely GONE!"
155,Cbiscool11,"June 2, 2019",4,"Great app, bad update There‚Äôs been an recent update (current date 6/2/19) and it has made it so you when you edit a photo you HAVE TO save and/or post, you can‚Äôt just have your personal album, unless you wanna save and delete pictures every time you edit them. I just wanna be able to edit multiple photos at a time without having to save each individual one. I recently had to edit around 20-30 pics at once (before the update) but after this update, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve bothered. Might delete if it gets to repetitive."

It‚Äôs overall just fun to use.. recently though the update has made it harder to enjoy the app. As I would delete edited pictures from my camera roll knowing happily that they were saved on vsco the update takes that away so now anything deleted on camera roll also deletes on vsco. This is very frustrating in the way that I edit a lot of pictures, and I feel we should be able to save them on vsco. If the update were to go back to normal this app would definitely deserve 5 stars again!"

159,PissedOff Child,"August 5, 2019",3,it‚Äôs great although.. in my opinion.. this is a great app. but there is one thing that I don‚Äôt understand why you can post pictures from your camera roll and not post videos from your camera roll. i don‚Äôt really see a reason for why a video isn‚Äôt allowed. sometimes I get better videos on my camera then the VSCO camera because my camera is better at focusing. so it's just frustrating that I can‚Äôt post videos that I take and i have to go right to VSCO if I want to take a video. i would LOVVVVVVE if we would be able to post videos. hope that changes happens soon. or at all? 
160,Mercymerce,"December 16, 2017",4,"I love VSCO, but... VSCO is my go to social media and is the only platform I really post any pictures on. I love its minimalistic feel and that there are no numbers. HOWEVER, the new update included new features such as a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù messaging system. This, unfortunately, is the start of the end. The reason people come to this social media is BECAUSE there is none of those extra additions. Although, yes, some things need to change with the times, I truthfully hope that VSCO remembers their true, original ways and recalls why they have a 4.6/5 star rating!! Please keep being the best!"
161,xoxoxmk,"December 1, 2018",3,CHANGE LINK RULES I love vsco so much and I always have. But it‚Äôs become over the pay years very popular for people to put a link to theirs in their bio so people who do not have the app or wish to have the app can look at the pictures. However vsco now changed their system so whenever you go and click on it a big thing comes up that blocks the view of the pictures and says download the app. I understand where it‚Äôs coming from but it‚Äôs so frustrating and I only use it because of that reason and idk why I would want to use it  anymore if  people can‚Äôt even view it from Instagram. Please fix
162,Cadenpjordt,"June 5, 2019",1,"Love the app, until recently. This has been my go to app for photography. I used it to import photos to my phone from my computer using the sync feature. It was nice to do some editing within the app and have a couple different versions in my camera roll (different borders and such). Now, with the new update, it is almost impossible to keep my photos straight since deleting one in VSCO, deletes it from my camera roll. I don‚Äôt want this to be a forced ‚Äúfeature‚Äù and I want to be able to choose. Every time I edit and save a photo in VSCO, it saves another to my camera roll. I don‚Äôt want to constantly be flooding my camera roll with new versions and would honestly just like to roll back to the last version."

I have tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, ending the membership and then repurchasing, changing the membership from monthly to yearly... and I still am not able to use the filters even though I bought them. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it one star is because after downloading the app to a couple different devices, I finally managed to get it to work on ONE of them which is inconvenient because the device it works on is not my cellphone.

If I could add one thing to this app right now it would be for there to be a feature where you could send pictures directly from your studio to someone‚Äôs notifications (messages), as a message. Sometimes I want to send a picture to my friend over VSCO that I‚Äôm editing to see if it‚Äôd be better with one filter over the other and it would be way easier to have this feature than to save both photos to your phone, then send them, then delete them, and then go back to the app."

I would have given you guys 5 stars but the fact that you guys programmed the app to do this, I gave you 3 stars.

I use this over computer applications such as Lightroom because it performs all the basic functions that Lightroom does, but from my phone.

Definitely would recommend this to anyone who wants to take their photos to the next level."

While I use it to edit all my photo, I‚Äôve used my VSCO profile as a very personal ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù reel of my experiences to date. Maybe a year (or less) ago the interface changed from a single column to a double column with the photos being displayed in different sizes. While I still use the app, I really hope VSCO will return to this set up as it allows you to enjoy each of your photos and doesn‚Äôt force you to have to individually open each one to see it better. If not for this, I would of rated it five stars."

But lately, it‚Äôs just going downhill. The app constantly lags and takes time to load images which is very frustrating. Whenever I attempt to import multiple images, it either says error or crashes and closes all on its own. The filters are nice but I find myself constantly avoiding VSCO these days because I can‚Äôt even seem to do anything with it anymore since importing images. I‚Äôm even thinking of cancelling my yearly premium subscription since I can barely use it these days. I mean what‚Äôs the point of getting all that filter if you can‚Äôt even really use them.

A couple days ago my feed wouldn‚Äôt load so I would just go out of the app and try again but it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I then just assumed it was and issue that would be fixed by the next day. I come back 2 days later and it‚Äôs still not loading so I completely exited out again and when I went back in it logged me out. I logged back in and then all of my pictures were gone. So I really didn‚Äôt like that. Besides this it‚Äôs a good app but they need to fix this.

But I got vsco expecting more... such as the ability to edit videos, add cool filters, and add boarders to my images. Unfortunately you have to pay to do these things. There are some free filters, but none of them are of my liking. I feel like editing videos (at least) should be free. It is in the app description... and I don‚Äôt want to have to pay just to edit a video once a month. Also, having to pay just to add a boarder to a photo is kinda just silly. Let‚Äôs be honest. But I do enjoy the other features. ;)"

I continuously have to refresh the app because of the glitches such as not being able to scroll, or certain buttons missing on the screen which make it impossible to do something different on the app. Other than that, I love how there is no follower, republishing & favorites count because it limits the amount of comparisons people tend to make on social media. However, it would be nice to have a search bar for your own followers and who you‚Äôre following, so you can find your friends/ people your follow easier."

It was the perfect editing app until recently. If you deleted a picture from your camera roll, the picture also deletes from the VSCO app. That makes absolutely no sense. I think that users should be in control of what pictures are on their app. We are capable of managing our storage space ourselves. Not everyone keeps every picture in their camera roll. It is fun to go through old pics on VSCO that you don‚Äôt have on your phone. Every change this app makes is killing the app. Nobody is happy with these changes. Go back to the way it was.

This is the first review I have ever written because it is extremely annoying to me. I love the app and all of the images I get to see but that is really frustrating.

179,CalDaManiac,"September 14, 2019",3,"Possible Aesthetic-Related Option I‚Äôve had VSCO for a long time and am, more or less, happy with it. The fact that there‚Äôs a premium version of something that is, to some degree, a form of social media with a RECURRING payment method is beyond me. But more than that, what keeps me from posting is my page aesthetic. When scrolling through any feed, it looks better when there is an overarching theme that shifts and morphs over time. If there was a way to move the order of pictures around, that would be awesome (especially because there‚Äôs no significance to the date that a picture was taken/posted)."

When I went to check it said ‚Äúyou have no activity‚Äù. Mind you I‚Äôve already received 1000s of reposts in many of my photos, and all that info stays in that spot. Miraculously, they all disappeared! Please fix this problem and get back the old favorites and likes that I got in the past, or the app is very much unappealing. Before this problem I would have given it 5/5 stars because I do believe it is a wonderful app, but now with this happening I am truly angered by it! Please fix this as soon as possible, and I will be sure to change my rating as soon as it is fixed as well. Thank you!"

187,loganhaynes,"June 11, 2019",3,Can we bring back the old version? My first time writing a review because I love VSCO so much and as a user I‚Äôm frustrated about the update. Every time finish editing my photo the app automatic let me choose publish or save to camera. But I just want to edit them all and save later. This is such a dumb update I wonder who did the user testing. And when I changed the edit a little bit the app is asking me to save it or post it again. 
188,gzd491,"February 24, 2020",1,Useless membership Renewed my membership and the app constantly shows my membership as a free which limits me. At first I thought it was an error and clicked renew to see what the options were and it informed me I was already subscribed.  Sometimes it corrects itself and gives me the member options (which requires me constantly closing and opening the app) but for the most part it resets to a free account when I navigate from one tab to the other. I‚Äôve tried restoring purchases which only works for so long. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and installing the app again but the result is the same. I can‚Äôt edit a pic without the features being blocked halfway through the process which is frustrating.

The problem with Instagram is it‚Äôs not just about photography it‚Äôs also about what you‚Äôre doing that day. I thought VSCO would be different because it is a photography based platform based on sharing what you see in the world not what you‚Äôre doing for the day or some vacation you went on or some same old selfie. VSCO is not for quotes you make up just for republishes.

I took a photo earlier today on VSCO and it saved to my camera roll. I didn‚Äôt want it on my camera roll, but I did want it in VSCO. There is no way now for me to solely have it on my VSCO app. Either I delete it from my phone‚Äôs camera roll and no longer have the photo at all or keep it stored there. I find this really agitating."

Now when I delete my original/unedited photos off of my camera roll they delete out of my vsco studio to ‚Äòsave storage‚Äô.

Basically, I paid for a subscription and only had access to the basics. I requested a refund and was denied.

The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that you cannot edit your profile picture to your liking, so if your photo isn‚Äôt perfectly in the right spot when you go to save it it‚Äôll basically show your head cut off or make your picture really distant. I just wish you could edit the profile pic, but that‚Äôs it."

This has been what it‚Äôs like everyday. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even let me on the app at all. I updated the app, because the update said it would fix app crashes that we‚Äôre going on, but the app stayed the exact same for me.

It is now enlarged and I can only see one picture and then have to scroll, very similar to Instagram‚Äôs feed. I wouldn‚Äôt consider this a problem, however, i prefer the old staggered version. My friends are still that way and was wondering if there was a way I could chnage it, as maybe I had bumped the button and messed it up. If someone takes the time reply to me, that will be greatly appreciated. "

There are so many options of what to do with your photos, and a variety of simple-to-use tools that have the potential to do some amazing things to your photos. However, there are some technical issues with this app. For as long as I‚Äôve used this software (quite a few years). I have many edits that I have saved to VSCO, and when I am trying to access them, it takes FOREVER to load. It can also be glitchy at times.

I‚Äôm used to more simple and super-straightforward photo editor apps. For example, why do you have to import photos? That‚Äôs so 5 years ago! I don‚Äôt see the point of not being able to edit photos directly from Camera Roll like most other apps. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good app once you get used to it, but it‚Äôs not for me."
204,tabui,"May 1, 2019",4,Great app overall I‚Äôve been using VSCO since it first got started. I‚Äôm happy to say I love the direction the company is taking for this app. It‚Äôs the best photo editing tool available in the App Store. My only quip is how inefficient it can be to scroll through your old imported pictures. It would be great if the app developers could allow users to create folders and drag their images in there for better organization. I think this could really streamline the editing process if users wanted to look at a subset of imported pics.

I love the app, but if it‚Äôs supposed to be a place for photography, I believe we should have the option to edit our published pictures. I like having the time stamp, but it has stopped me from posting pictures when they are taken, so that I can sit down and edit them, which usually takes me a while. Preferences and styles change.

With the new tidal wave of Subscription pay walls popping up everywhere the average consumer is forced to choose one or two apps and hope that the filters or effects are what they want or they are stuck! We can all blame Adobe for this trend but ask yourself what they are giving you in comparison to your iPhoto apps. If you need me to pay $30 for your app for you to stay in business then charge what you need but let me own it. If it is worth that then we will pay! Subscriptions are a license to nothing as in the end that is what we get when our credit card expires!

However recently the more they seemed to get fame the more they would lock their filters and charge for them. A lot of the filters I have used are now locked and I am very upset by this. My favorite filter HB2 just got locked and you have to be a member to use it.

237,heath.massey,"June 18, 2019",4,"Love it, but the new update isn‚Äôt great This app is my go to for iPhone photography editing! However, after this latest update I‚Äôm not such a fan. I always delete my originals after editing them on VSCO, so I can clear up my camera roll clutter. Now, when you delete the original pictures off your phone, they delete the edited version from the VSCO app. Not good for me! I use VSCO to keep my edited pictures easily accessible, and I don‚Äôt want them all deleted when I clear my camera roll."
238,mdmatt97,"June 12, 2019",2,New Update is Frustrating and Limiting I LOVED this app and used it for years. With the recent update (around May 28th 2019) it has been an absolute pain. Between not having the option to turn off the new storage feature and losing the option to lower the export resolution I am starting to lose confidence in the direction they‚Äôre bringing the app. I‚Äôve read the most recent reviews and realize that there are a vast majority of people who feel the same way as well. I hope the creators and staff at VSCO pride themselves in listening to their users rather than losing long time users and subscribers (like myself).
239,Lexi Vassilaros,"November 26, 2019",2,"journals crashing this app is seriously one of my favorites. i pretty much completely ditched instagram for vsco. i love love love love the journals feature so much. but recently the app will crash in the middle of me writing. it‚Äôs very frustrating because i write what comes to mind as it comes to mind and since it doesn‚Äôt save, it‚Äôs unable to be replicated. please please please fix this so the journals will work again. and my app is always up to date, i check everyday, and it‚Äôs not a problem with my phone bc it‚Äôs an XS and i just got it a couple months ago, just please fix it please. (otherwise it‚Äôd get a solid 5/5 stars)"

241,Caio.Rodolfo,"March 5, 2018",3,"Great App, Buggy right now VSCO has worked great for me in the past, and I always have enjoyed editing my high-resolution, RAW photographs from my Canon 80D with the app. Recently, it‚Äôs been running very slow. On my iPhone 7, it‚Äôs been extremely slow to import photos from my camera roll, and slow to the point where it‚Äôs impossible to even edit a photo. It‚Äôs worked in the past, but something has come up where it barely works anymore. VSCO needs to do something about this soon, or I will be losing a long-loved app that I use for photo editing."
242,illlliiiiiii,"June 21, 2018",5,"#shotsbyilli I‚Äôm a photographer and I use VSCO as a portfolio. In the next update, could there be an option in the future where we are able to have business insights the way Instagram has for their business accounts? I want to be able to track how many times people go to click on my account, how many people have viewed the individual posts you have, how many people favorited the posts, etc. Thanks!!"
243,YAS GURL SLAY,"December 5, 2018",4,"First Impressions Although I have only been using this app for a very short time, I‚Äôm finding myself considerably impressed with the wide assortment of tools that are available to work with. Overall, the features within this app are - in my opinion - decently advanced when compared to other apps such as Instagram and Snapchat. Even though I wouldn‚Äôt pay for any additional filters, settings, etc, I‚Äôm really happy with the possibilities presented to me within the free version of this app."
244,Justastudent12345,"May 3, 2019",2,"ugh... So I used to use VSCO to edit all of my pictures...ALL of them. I absolutely loved it. It was so simple and easy, and the results were amazing. However, VSCO has recently taken down many of the presets that I used on the daily. I get it, they want to make more money and push people to buy the membership. This app is a business, and the membership is a way to make more money. But, seeing as the presets were available for YEARS for free, it is so incredibly aggravating and upsetting that one day *poof*, all of those presets vanished. Loved the app, and still would if they hadn‚Äôt taken away many of the presets I used."
245,LaBelleLaVie,"May 15, 2019",4,Lay off the updates I use vsco to upload all my photography content and to edit all my photos for social media. I loved that you could edit a photo and copy and paste the edits onto new ones. This allowed me to be original with my photos and to create a theme on my social media feed by basically editing the preset to my liking and copy and pasting it to all new photos. HOWEVER the new update allows you to copy the edits but there is no paste edits feature. REALLY ANNOYED and makes me want to use the app less.
246,Sassynikkisixx,"May 25, 2019",2,"Too confusing The Interface of this app is too confusing. I want to take videos/pictures and edit them, that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt want to be a part of a community or share my images with people on this platform. I have Instagram and Facebook and other social sites for that. For $20 bucks a year I just want an app that when I open gives me an option to edit or create a picture or video. I don‚Äôt want a confusing layout of news feed or discover other stuff. It‚Äôs fine to have that but that should not be in the main layout. Have a separate tap off to the side for that."
247,Girly2234üòç,"June 9, 2019",5,"#VSCO It‚Äôs great!!!! I love that u get to share photos like on Instagram and Snapchat. My photos have been really ‚Äúextra‚Äù ever since I got VSCO and in a good way. Try VSCO, it will really change your mind in photo editing. My only recommendation is to add prism to add to your photos, and if this is developed do it for free, no premium for prism. I‚Äôve been trying to use different apps  to do that, but I need premium. I came here for a change. Please take this response to consideration...... Thanks!"
248,nkreis,"February 17, 2020",1,"Took my money I had a subscription in the past, it was fine. I cancelled it awhile ago and today I tried to subscribe again. Did the $4.99 monthly subscription, I got a confirmation email from Apple, it charged my card, I go back to VSCO and it says I still have a free account and that I need to sign up for a membership still. HOWEVER, when i try to sign up again it says I have a membership already and it gives me a dialog box with the option to hit ‚Äúok‚Äù or ‚Äúmanage‚Äù my subscriptions in the app store. "
249,Madeline.Shea,"February 3, 2020",4,"Love but needs more compatibility I‚Äôve been using this app for editing purposes for years and I love it. The issue is that I recently got a MacBook for editing purposes, and there is no version of this app available for macs. Please, please, please make a Mac version. I would love to be able to access these editing tools from my computer, not just my phone. If it were compatible with my laptop, I would even get the membership, but without that compatibility, there‚Äôs no reason for me to."
250,Charlie2427,"February 5, 2018",1,Good luck if you‚Äôve purchased presets I have used vsco for years now without a problem until recently. More than half of my purchased presets are no longer available. Thinking it was a glitch I clicked the restore purchases button to no avail. Instead what I got was some of my presets downloaded and others with the push to download butting next to it that tried to DOUBLE charge me to download something I already bought. App went from my mainstay for on the go editing to barely used. Great app but buyer beware. Nothing has solved this problem. Don‚Äôt buy the presets. Unless you‚Äôre in the business of buying them again later. So disappointing
251,Snenennenenebeb,"February 7, 2018",5,"Favorite app I love it. A place to take beautiful photos and share them with the community and people you know. Editor is great, haven‚Äôt got VSCO X but it looks great. The numbers don‚Äôt matter but the one thing I would ask for is to show the amount of republishes/and or favorites, not to the public, but only to the owner of the picture posted, I mean yes the fun of it is counting the amount but sometimes it‚Äôs too much! Overall great app. Highly recommended"
252,Mateoupinit,"March 4, 2018",4,"Option for a one-time purchase of presets?* Could you please offer a way to purchase  all of the presets instead of having to subscribe? I think most people would rather purchase the presets, than the hassle of subscribing. "
253,Izbiz1999,"March 28, 2018",5,"Great App!!! I absolutely love this app.  It‚Äôs great for amateur photography and editing.  The filters and tools are not over-the-top and they don‚Äôt wash out the true color of the picture either.  Lately, the app has been acting up/freezing, but it might just be my cell phone or a small bug.  All in all, would recommend to everyone looking to edit their photos without having to purchase computer software!"
254,Erb313,"November 7, 2018",1,"I used to love this I used to love this app. Like I recommended it to everyoneeeee. And okay- making it cost money, that's fine. But did you really have to make the ones I constantly used for FREE unavailable  to me? The only reason it makes me mad is that some people really really cannot afford to just throw $10 away to edit photos? That's just silly. VSCO should have at least let us continue to be able to use more than just 5 filters. I had a pretty solid, no budget theme I had going on, on my instagram but I can't keep it anymore but it's hard as a broke college student to think that I would spend $10 on that instead of a meal for the day... sad sad sad :("
255,Mopeacegirl,"February 15, 2019",5,"YASSSSSS I love vsco so much!!! I literally use it everyday. I love using the filters to edit for my Instagram but I also love posting on vsco, and I love the vsco community! I have a few suggestions. First, I think you should add a way to save the dsco so you can edit it later. Second, I think there should be a way to edit the dscos more like cropping, exposure, contrast, etc, and also being able to adjust the filter. That‚Äôs all I have! Thanks for making vsco, vsco!! YASSSSSS"
256,Ghostbusters1290,"February 28, 2019",4,Blocking people This is a great app! It is fun to use to express your feelings and show pictures that you aren‚Äôt comfortable with certain people seeing. But the problem for me is that I don‚Äôt want this certain person to see any of my pictures or my collection so I blocked them but I found out that they can still see my pictures and collection so in my opinion I think that an update would be a perfect to change where they can not see your profile at all.
257,That One Girl 13,"May 15, 2019",3,"What Happened, VSCO? I‚Äôve had VSCO for around half of a year, and it has worked great.  I love the filters and all of the editing tools.  But today whenever I tried to open the app it kept shutting me out.  I tried updating the app, deleting it, and re-downloading it, but nothing worked.  It finally let me onto the app, but I couldn‚Äôt see my feed, my profile, or post anything.  I tried several times to get it to work, and it only worked once for about 2 minutes.

Now it‚Äôs extremely difficult since whenever you delete the picture in your camera roll, it deletes on VSCO too. It is very inconvenient and i loved when VSCO was able to store my photos and now I‚Äôm forced to keep the photo in my camera roll just so it doesn‚Äôt delete on VSCO. Please fix this soon and revert back to the older version of the app because obviously, scrolling through the reviews, I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way."
259,RREEVVIIEEWWIINNGG,"September 29, 2019",4,love the app BUT... I have been using this app for years now and it has never failed me :) but this recent update that saves it all to your phones camera roll has taken up so much of my storage and is honestly frustrating. I can confidently say 99% of my friends/people I know who use this app HATES that it saves to your camera roll then deletes off of the app. One of the reasons I loved this app was because it could save to the app without going to your camera roll. PLEASE SWITCH IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE!!!

The only reason it doesn‚Äôt get a solid 5 is because it crashes a lot when I‚Äôm trying to go really deep down into my pictures on vsco to re-edit a pic.

I love doing the different edits and comparing them all side by side but there‚Äôs only 10 and I like to keep them all just in case I need to reuse them which is pretty often.

275,vophie,"June 5, 2019",1,"CHANGE THE NEW DELETING METHOD This new update, which deletes photos from VSCO if you delete from your camera roll, and vice versa, is the WORST update I have ever seen made to an app. It screws up the entire function of the app. Want to clear out your VSCO personal gallery? Can‚Äôt do it without deleting all your already edited, saved to galley photos. Want to clear out your camera roll after uploading your photos elsewhere?

It‚Äôs SUPER confusing as to whether photos, edits, etc are stored in VSCO or not. The instructions are not clear enough. It seems you can no longer make edits and keep them in VSCO w/o saving to your camera roll. Well what if you‚Äôre not done yet? And you want to make incremental edits not all right now in one sitting? Well to do that you will have to clutter up your camera roll with every iteration.

No refunds for any purchases, whatsoever. I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. A system should be set up where you can cancel a subscription within a certain period. I do understand this is my fault, but I just got charged $20 for a VSCO X subscription that I probably will never use again, because I wanted the free trial for one video I had.

296,Candiapple_Smith,"June 20, 2019",2,Update Has Killed VSCO I have used VSCO possibly ever since I started taking photos with my iPhone! It‚Äôs one of the best photo editing apps. I even purchased a membership subscription.
297,FAITHY$,"September 17, 2019",5,Please I want this I love how you can message other people and share with them pics you like!! If it would be possible I would love it if you can see when people are typing and when they read the message so I don‚Äôt have to check every 5 seconds I would truly enjoy that feature!! Also to send Live Photo‚Äôs to each other communication is key! Thank you so very much!
298,transgerard,"August 10, 2019",3,"Needs improvements I use this app for the majority of my photo editing, i shell out the 20-25 dollars (tax or w/e)  a year and im generally really pleased with the outcomes of my photos. However recently the vsco app itself seems to be deteriorating in a way, it crashes when i attempt to edit videos or when i try to upload images from that option in vsco and it has become normal for me to open vsco and my studio be completely blank with images still there they do not show whatsoever. Im disappointed."
299,madi bring,"July 3, 2019",1,wow. it used to be so much better before the storage update. i used to store all of my pictures in vsco. it actually takes up more storage on my phone to save the pictures in my camera roll than saving them in vsco. so how does this evensave any storage? i Recently went through my camera roll and deleted a lot of pictures. I then go back into VSCO to find all those pictures that I deleted have been deleted from VSCO as well. So now I lost tons of my favorite pictures. This app used to be my favorite but now I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use it until this The app goes back to the way it used to be.
300,Thatonedakotaguy,"June 22, 2018",4,"Improve Messaging Messaging is nice and all, but it‚Äôs kind of a pain that you can‚Äôt actually delete your messages. Leaving a convo doesn‚Äôt have much of an application because if you wanted to keep your messages, you wouldn‚Äôt delete them. And if you wanted to delete them, you wouldn‚Äôt wanna see them again. "
301,Willbro000,"August 13, 2018",3,"Monthly Please! I love VSCO, I use it to edit all my Instagram pictures and just edit my photos in general. Right now I‚Äôm on the free trial for VSCO X, and I would love to have this all year. So, I‚Äôm willing to pay for it. The problem? Well, I‚Äôm in college, so $20 at one time is a lot. It‚Äôs the difference between paying for gas or not. A subscription with a low monthly payment would work best for me! $2/mo, even though it cost more yearly, would work best. (If this option is already available or becomes available, please let me know.)"
302,ktmue,"September 3, 2018",3,"Needs a block republishes button I absolutely love vsco its a great and positive environment! However, i really wish there was a way to block republishes. I care about what my friends are posting personally, not a mass repubbed photo. I notice that if a really popular photo is posted i will end up seeing it 8+ times in my feed because too many of my friends republished it. If there was a way to block repubs or not have the same photo show up in my feed a bunch of times, that would make VSCO an even better place."
303,MAJORVSCOFAN,"November 9, 2018",3,"Frustrating glitches I have used VSCO for years and haven‚Äôt had this issue up until now. Every time I go back through my published feed to try to delete images, I will delete one and instead of returning me back to the spot I scrolled to, the app with bring me back to the beginning of my published photos making me scroll all the way back through hundreds (sometimes thousands) of photographs to delete another picture. Every picture this process repeats. Frustrating."
304,Raespresso,"December 9, 2018",1,"Video capabilities listed here are NOT IN APP Unbelievable! The options it shows here in the images on the App Store are a LIE. You won‚Äôt find out until you agree to a 7-day trial that you can‚Äôt actually skew, crop or adjust any video. You‚Äôll drive yourself crazy trying to push several buttons that don‚Äôt do anything at all. There‚Äôs no tutorial, and you have to figure out the maze to get to their support section on their website. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find out they don‚Äôt actually support any of those video adjustment features pictured here, but they‚Äôre ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù. "
305,Auddddddddddd,"December 29, 2018",4,"Love I really enjoy this app the editing is easy and one of my go to apps for editing. Along with that the sharing is different from any other social media it doesn‚Äôt allow you or anyone to see how many followers you have. Which is very calming I think, it‚Äôs like nobody cares and I like it. The only thing that I would want different is for the video Editing to be free I see them being posted and stuff but I don‚Äôt really want to pay for that."

Also, I have no idea how to change my profile picture. I don‚Äôt see an area about MY profile. When I search for a tutorial, it never comes up."

I love VSCO and have been paying for the yearly subscription to all the filters for two years now, but I‚Äôm revoking my subscription because I hate paying $20+ per year to still have a giant watermark on all my edited photos. It‚Äôs annoying to have to screenshot from the editing screen and then crop the photo in a different app to avoid ruining it with a big old white watermark, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth paying for when I could just use a different app for the same purpose."
308,sudhsndhd,"August 15, 2019",5,"VSCO Improvements!! :) I love this app!! Definitely 5 stars!! What would make it better, is if you could post like stories (similar to Instagram) for 24 hours on your profile!! I would totally share this app more if it had that!! Bc so many parents these days don‚Äôt let their kids have an Instagram, but this would be the perfect backup! I rate 5 stars, but I‚Äôll grab all my friends if they add stories!!"
309,ava12345678910112,"June 20, 2019",3,LOVE the app... but absolutely HATE the newest update I‚Äôve been using this app for about 4 years now and have always loved it. But I hate the newest update. I do not like how if I delete a picture from my camera roll it deletes in my library as well. This is sooo frustrating bc I usually edit my pictures and delete them in camera roll knowing that it is still in my vsco library in case I want to post or save it. I still love the app but I reeeeaally hope that this ‚Äústorage saving‚Äù feature is removed soon.
310,BlackDiamond-,"November 12, 2017",4,"From an amateur photographer The interface is beautiful but it often confusing and hard to navigate. The filters are all beautiful and I‚Äôd recommend getting more than they fee they give you for free. The new ability to save custom edits is also a plus. However the app is lacking some pro editing tools that keep it from being my only photo editing app. For one, this app NEEDS the ability to edit curves."
311,Nikki'sReviews93,"June 29, 2018",1,"What happened? This used to be my go to app, now I rarely open it. One of my favorite things about the app was the ability to create custom presets, copy, then paste them to multiple photos at once. This was a feature no other app allowed at the time. Over the years, each update seemed to move further away from the features that had me invested in the first place. Now, after about a month of not using the app, I decide to edit some pics by pasting some pre-made presets I created months ago. Welp, I apparently need VSCOX now to use those same adjustments/filters that I just had access to. "
312,Starfish123181,"December 17, 2018",4,"Only 1 Problem ! I love this app so much and think it is an amazing way to express yourself and get inspired by others. I also love how does not show how many followers/ favourites/ republishes a person has so that people can post what they want without the added pressure. however, I would love if there was a way for a user to see the number of favourites or republishes their own posts have gotten, instead of having to count them yourself. thanks vsco!"
313,Munty_Jones,"January 5, 2019",3,"Amazing but needs crucial features I‚Äôve used VSCO since the beginning and still think it‚Äôs the best mobile editing app. The UI has improved greatly and the presets and hands down the best. PLEASE bring back synching. I use both my phone and iPad and it‚Äôs terrible that they can‚Äôt sync up. This means I have different edits on each device. I‚Äôd also live better organization (folders). Lastly, I‚Äôm OCD with tagging/keywording my photos and hate that VSCO strips this, along with titles and descriptions, when exporting back to camera roll."
314,ssnpst,"April 13, 2019",1,Subscription I have been using VSCO for years with the free version. This past week they charged my card for the yearly subscription even though I did not once choose this plan or even subscribe. Yet when I reported the problem and requested a refund they told me that what happened was not a valid reason to receive a refund. So I said that my card was incorrectly charged and that I did not subscribe and yet again I was told that it was not a valid reason for a refund. Extremely upset with them at this point and disappointed because I used the app for so long and never had a problem.
315,Ruth105,"March 19, 2020",2,"Montage is bad I love vsco and it‚Äôs editing tools and was excited to try the montage feature. I played around with it for a while and then started editing a montage. I worked on it for nearly 40 minutes, and then the app crashed and my work was all gone. Its very demotivating as a creator to work on something and have it disappear in less than a second due to the apps glitchy faults. It‚Äôs not me either, phone is at 100% battery and storage is sufficient. I hope they can make a feature where you can draft montages or patch the app so it doesn‚Äôt crash."
316,üèó,"July 20, 2019",5,VSCO I love this app because you are able to post things without having likes or comments so people can feel confident about what they post without other people hating on them. You can also follow your friends and get inspired by influencers that post photos as well. You are able to edit photos how you want and overall it‚Äôs a great app and I highly recommend it.
317,Jazzy Shark,"July 4, 2019",5,Bread on grass I love VSCO so much I was with my friend and we both have this app and we were scrolling down the home page and we saw something we never thought we would see üòÇ we saw a picture of bread on grass üòÇ and she started dieing and laughing so hard and I was like calm down and she just kept laughing and I was laughing too and then I literally started laughing so hard that I couldn‚Äôt breath üòÇ so I love VSCO
318,EmmaCheeringüéäüéä,"April 15, 2020",3,"My Opinion! I love the app and it‚Äôs the only real ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô app I own. I don‚Äôt like how it makes you store all your photos on your camera roll and if you delete them it deletes it off the app as well. I‚Äôm constantly taking pictures so storage is important and this doesn‚Äôt help. I would also like it if they‚Äôre was a was to comment on pictures if the owner allowed it,I know that this could lead to some negativity but I really think it would make the app better. Overall the app is really amazing! üíõ"
319,Brandon Aqua,"March 2, 2020",1,"Has Worked Better There is always an issue when editing in VSCO & I think they need to be taken more seriously. Did not resubscribe & will not until core features work properly again such as reliable pop up menu during bulk edits, better organizational tools, plus not having to tap ‚Äúgot it‚Äù for each photo for the 100+ photos I just edited that i‚Äôve deleted from my camera roll while only keeping the VSCO exports.

320,kbnap,"December 16, 2018",1,"What happened? I used to love this app and would use it all of the time. I updated the app and now to use it you have to pay for a membership?! I have paid for many presets through the app and I can‚Äôt even access those without paying more money to join a membership. What the heck happened? I don‚Äôt know if I will continue to use this app. I really loved it before they did this. I‚Äôm definitely not satisfied with it now! Normally I would have given this app a 4 or maybe even 5 star rating but now, since I can‚Äôt use what I already paid for or use it all without paying more, it‚Äôs down to a 1 star."
321,Ella.Spear,"February 2, 2019",4,Cool app Yeah I like this app it has good camera effects and and I like the DSCO effect a lot and I use this with a lot of my friends and we have a good time doing photo shoots but one thing I don‚Äôt like is the organization. VSCO is kind of like a social media app and it‚Äôs rlly hard to find accounts and following them and i don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs a like button but I didn‚Äôt find it and I just wish It was more like Instagram. You know what I mean? But I like the app and it‚Äôs a cool app.
322,KILLERDANA18,"April 22, 2019",1,"Do not purchase their membership. its a fraud! I have been editing my pictures with VSCO for 4 years now (since I was in high school). As the app began to update and charge you to access exclusive filters I decided I would purchase their $20 membership so I could continue to edit my pictures with the app. However, it‚Äôs been a week now and even after purchasing the membership they have not allowed me to access any of the filters or ‚Äúperks‚Äù that come along with the membership. DO NOT PURCHASE THEIR MEMBERSHIP because even after contacting customer service they have not been able to help me or give me a refund."

324,kathrny a,"May 30, 2019",4,"Love it, just wish one thing would change I love taking Dscos, but one problem that many of my friends and I run into is that you cannot save them. So that means you have to post them to your account and you cannot just keep them private and post them later. This has been my only issue with this app. I truly love it but I wish that this one thing would be fixed. It would make VSCO a thousand times better!"
325,sarmaka,"May 31, 2019",4,"Love VSCO but.. The latest update clears any photos from your studio that you delete from your camera roll and I don‚Äôt agree with that. Part of what I loved so much about this app was that I could keep original photos in the studio to work on without having my camera roll cluttered with the unedited (then edited) photos. (I‚Äôm very OCD) I love everything else about the app and it‚Äôs my go to when editing, but I am strongly against this most recent update."
326,Superdoodledo1279,"May 31, 2019",3,"New Update This new update is really annoying. I like to keep my camera roll and vsco gallery separate. It is so annoying to add photos to my vsco then have to edit them all. Save the edits to my camera roll. Then delete the non edits from my camera roll. It is a waste a time. It might help other people save storage, but I have plenty. At least make it an option to wether we want them to automatically deleted or not. I'm sorry. I hate making complaints, but this is my favorite editing app."
327,Jaymo0046,"June 6, 2019",5,"VSCO‚Äôs only flaw okay so i love VSCO and i think it‚Äôs an awesome app but my only flaw with it is that when you block someone, it doesn‚Äôt really block them, it just doesn‚Äôt let you follow them. i think when you block someone, they shouldn‚Äôt be able to see any of your photos or DSCO‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not really fair if you think you blocked them but they can still see your photos and dscos‚Äôs."

330,hannahhutz,"June 1, 2018",4,idea I think on your feed you should be able to choose where in your feed your photos appear. I want all the photos from one event to appear together but sometimes I find ones I would like to post after I‚Äôve since posted another set of pictures from a different event.

Love the app, and I love everything it stands for and that it is spreading so much positivity for girls (and guys), however some people want to experience vsco and everything it has to offer, but they are hesitant to make an account and post on it because they can‚Äôt necessarily be sure that the people that see their posts are people that know them and\or have good intentions. If vsco had a private mode then I believe it would improve the experience."

However, I‚Äôve noticed that when selecting photos to upload to VSCO (on iPad), they just unselect them selves and I have to go back to find the image. This hinders the user experience in my opinion. Also, editing needs to be more intuitive on larger displays: I find it tedious having to slide my finger from one end of the screen to the other when adjusting filter values and preset levels."

339,kaylinda456,"September 12, 2019",5,VSCO is a great app We chose vsco for this project because it has a lot of rare features that do a lot to enhance the app and its features.

It also is used by a very large amount of people and is mainly liked.

It would be fine if this could be something that you could turn on and off if you didn‚Äôt want it, but there‚Äôs no option to change this update.  Please fix this!!!"

And there are no comments, which means no hate! üòä I love this app and if your thinking about getting it you totally should."

I would rate it five stars normally but for the past few weeks it‚Äôs been crashing soon after I launch. This happens almost every single time I launch. I figured one of the recent updates would have fixed the issue but there‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seem to have been any changes for my experience. I‚Äôve attempted to offload and re download the app. This also proves ineffective. Any suggestions?

I absolutely love vsco and it‚Äôs the only thing I use to edit my pics but this app has been going downhill for years. At first the app wouldn‚Äôt even let me get into it, it would just crash. Now it is continuously freezing and makes editing one pic hell. when I  try to pick any filter/adjust it, it takes forever to unfreeze and takes a ridiculous amount of time to edit 1 picture.

Then came out VSCO X which I did not need because my favorite filters I had bought before, to my surprise, now pretty much ALL the filters have been taken away and they‚Äôre only accessible for VSCO X members?! Come on now this is so disappointing to old users like myself who have been loyal to this app for years now. I will no longer be using VSCO and I do not recommend the app"

I like to mess around with some pics, and I upload them to my vsco studio so I don‚Äôt have to save all of them to my camera roll. I don‚Äôt want to post every single picture i edit. Fix this!

367,shdhndj,"June 26, 2019",4,LOVE THE APP!! I have some suggestions tho!! One of my favorite apps by far!!  but I‚Äôd love it if after I posted something I could go back and edit the photo and change the filter even after already posting. Also it‚Äôd be really neat if you were able to select images from your profile (that have already been posted) to create a journal!! I absolutely love the app!!! I just wanna put these suggestions out there!!

370,HeyHoesüôãüèΩ,"October 1, 2017",4,Love! But here's a few suggestions. The app is great for editing photos but I think that we should be able to copy the edits on someone else's photo. I've seen lots of photos that I love because the way it's edited and I want it for my photos but I don't know how they exactly edited it. I also think that there shouldn't be payed filters because no one wants to pay for an app just to have filters to edit a photo
371,PhotographerandReferee,"November 11, 2017",4,"iOS 11.1 issues I love VSCO and use it with every single picture. All the different filters and settings that allow you to make your picture unique are amazing and it‚Äôs the perfect app. Only with this new iOS update have I started to have issues.

372,Xxlivelaughlove735xX,"December 20, 2017",4,PLEASE ADD AN UNDO BUTTON I love VSCO but you guys really have to make an undo button.  Gotta say that it is prettyy embarrassing when you‚Äôre stalking someone and accidentally republish their image from months ago.  Then not only do they know that you were stalking them but all of your followers know too.  An undo button would have really come in handy.  Please save my fellow VSCO users from suffering the same humiliation that I have suffered. Thanks have a lovely dayüòòüòò

I hope it can be fixed because I really love this app
374,Tone1025,"July 21, 2018",1,"MISLEADING It‚Äôs misleading for a company to advertise a ‚Äúfree 7-day trial‚Äù to people who apparently have already used it. If their system knows that a consumer has used it why is this advertised to them??? I had just downloaded the app, and was unaware if I used a free trial, normally it will tell you that a you can only upgrade to premium if you‚Äôve used it before. I download and delete apps all the time and was unaware that I ever used a free trial and believed that I didn‚Äôt so I took advantage of what was advertised to me. I unsubscribed right after I did it, like I do all free-trials. If I knew that it wasn‚Äôt a free trial then I wouldn‚Äôt have used it!"

379,YuriBrown,"December 28, 2019",1,Paid $20 For Year Unable To Use No support I am not able to use this app after paying $20 I‚Äôm told that I need to pay additional $20 to unlock filters for those who have paid for the membership. Pointless. Don‚Äôt waste your money. So frustrating. Just use the trial version because they don‚Äôt honor your payments and there‚Äôs no way to get the issue corrected. This happened immediately after paying so it‚Äôs been like this for several months. So it‚Äôs a sucky app. I was stupid. I want my money back. It‚Äôs like a theft since if it doesn‚Äôt work there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it.

I have been harassed in a way on the app and I‚Äôve blocked the person, but they can still see what I put up and I can see what they put up if I search their name. Again, I absolutely LOVE this app but I strongly believe that if someone is blocked, they shouldn‚Äôt be able to see what you put up. I really hope this feature is added in the near future!"

I REALLY hope that VCSO releases a new update with a video import feature!!"

384,User062113,"April 16, 2019",2,"What happened? I had VSCO for a while on my old phone. Downloaded it on my new phone and suddenly all of the filters are locked except the basic 6 or 7. Do I really have to pay money to use the filters I used to be able to use for free? This was once my favorite photo editing app because of the unique presets, so I‚Äôm a little disappointed that money hunger has overtaken another perfectly good app, and locked most of the presets unless I pay for a membership. Le sigh, I guess I‚Äôm on the market for a new photo editing app."
385,ARandomJeni,"August 16, 2019",1,"5-year VSCO user VSCO scammed my money. I clicked ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù for the subscription and it billed me for the ENTIRE YEAR of subscriptions at once WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME (no pop-up or any kind of notification). I only found out a month later when i clicked into subscriptions in my App Store that VSCO charged my money without my consent. VSCO has tried to scam subscription money since 2017, where they intentionally design the interface and landing page where the user feels like they must buy the subscription to use the app at all. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the VSCO team‚Äôs morals by actively trying to scam users for profit."

Ever since the latest update, VSCO is no longer storing my edits to my studio in order to ‚Äúconserve space.‚Äù  And if I delete the photo in my photo album, it deletes the edited photo in the app as well.  So what is the point if I can‚Äôt even look at my edits in addition to being forced to save and keep copies in my photo album, which DOES take up space?  Terrible.  I never write reviews, but this actually ruins the app for me.  Will no longer use."

In order to do so, I have to save it to my camera roll, which is annoying, because I do not want it there so I have to go through more trouble and go to delete it from there.

If I open a super old one I can see the photo by looking at the filters when in edit mode, but otherwise the photo is just blank.

I had been using the app for years and loved how they were separate, and now they‚Äôre conjoined into essentially one large camera roll and I think me, and a lot of other people, hate that feature."

As an aspiring photographer and artist, I absolutely love this app. Oftentimes, photographers enhance their photographs with words or captions.

It was the most elegant and sophisticated photo filter and editing app and it lost its way. Convoluted navigation, bad subscription model, pointless social feature, and updates every other day that don‚Äôt update anything. I still use the filters I‚Äôve collected over time because these are the best, but everything else is pointless with this app. Too bad."

495,Cadams52,"December 3, 2019",4,"Great editing, slight hiccup. I‚Äôve been using VSCO for years now and have always loved the variety of filters it provides.

This happens after two minutes of being on the app."
496,MadSci3nce,"August 14, 2019",1,**Major SECURITY ISSUES** Never heard of this app till I started getting emails that my account was being used by another device.  Downloaded app and followed the advice of deleting the account.  The developer absolutely refuses to delete an account which is illegally using my email and name (which means they can post anything using my name).  I currently have a case with Apple iTunes and SCC for the security issues.  Be careful with this app!  It is not secure and obviously they just want your money and could care less about the concerns of the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù!

498,natalieleannsweeney,"December 20, 2019",5,NEW FEATURE SUGGESTION? Rearrange your account feed. I absolutely love VSCO but I wish I could rearrange my feed. I understand it‚Äôs supposed to be up to date but it would be cool to introduce a feature like Pinterest does where you can rearrange your photos. It would be so much easier to create an aesthetically pleasing page.
499,Flywinkee,"October 8, 2019",1,"New Update I really loved using this app. It had great filters, it saved ALL of my pictures and it was overall great. However, the key-word here is ‚ÄúWAS‚Äù.

Not everyone saves their pictures on their device and I want them to stay in my VSCO. So please remove this update. I would have to be forced to find something else."
502,ZZMH,"June 8, 2019",2,"Was good....until the update I really enjoyed this app, until it had a new update where if you deleted the picture from your camera roll it also deleted from your studio.

I feel like it would be much easier for the pictures to stay in my studio even if its deleted in my camera roll."
503,MAGGIEDODDLE,"September 16, 2019",5,"My opinion... This app is really good for photo editing, I definitely recommend it for you.

505,Ncouncil,"July 11, 2019",1,"What app? I would love to have the opportunity to review this app but I can‚Äôt. When I logged in and tried to review a submission I ran into an apparent loop which, whenever I hit the play icon, gave me a message saying I should follow some other users. I tried to cancel the action as a way to bypass it, but that didn‚Äôt work, so I selected a few other users at random-no joy. In short, I can‚Äôt actually use the app and view the work of other users because the app first wants to force me to select other users, presumably so I can view their work."

507,Hi Everybody!!,"June 13, 2019",1,"Why change it to delete my library? I've always used VSCO as my library of best shots. I constantly clear out my camera roll to save space. So now VSCO just decided to delete photos from my library once I've cleared them from my camera roll? You're not even going to give me the choice? Because, I suppose, you think you know better than I do how to manage my device? VSCO is completely worthless now, it's been a loooooong slide downhill but now there are so many better options and the one redeeming factor for VSCO is gone."
508,Tay/my mom,"June 13, 2019",3,"Storage problem!! Hi! I‚Äôm so sorry to write this but it told me that it was ‚Äúsaving my storage‚Äù and it‚Äôs making it worse.

I don‚Äôt want the photos from my vsco on my phone because of storage. "
509,puffbutt2,"June 11, 2019",1,"New update... so upset So so incredibly confused and upset over the new storage system this app has converted to.

I also have so many photos in my camera roll that I enjoy uploading them here to have a safe place for my photos, like a cloud but with endless uploads. Very confused and sad"

519,chlowu12,"July 20, 2019",1,Not worth what you pay for This app provides nice filters for your pictures. For what you pay for it is not worth what you get. While most apps are priced at 3.99 for simple camera filters. This subscription is 21 dollars!!! And they fail to notify you when your yearly subscription is up so they charge you before you can even cancel it. This app is nothing more than an off brand instagram because no ones uses the feed portion. All of the features are nothing extraordinary to any other photo app just WAY over priced.
520,NOSLEN595,"November 20, 2017",5,"Easy, accurate Like so many today I use the camera on my phone more than any other camera. Being able to edit the images directly on the camera to then share or post is great. Having VSCO to do that makes it easy and gives me all the control I need."
521,_Aela_,"December 31, 2017",2,"Why the rearranged feed?? Obviously will continue using because of the ease of the many edit capabilities, but I‚Äôm kinda annoyed that when you upload a picture, VSCO rearranges your profile for you.

Please take away whatever feature that is and let us arrange our own profile/feed like before :/"

I cannot take any photos through the app, and if I have that app open in the background on my phone, the camera on other apps do not work either, like Snapchat.

There is no reason I should have to either save each version of a photo to my Camera Roll or post it to my profile. Sounds counterproductive.

556,LJRB1,"June 30, 2019",4,"Great but HATE THE UPDATE I have been using this app for years, pay $20 for the filters, love it. But what in the world made you make the edit so that every save makes a copy to your camera roll and any deletions delete the copy in your camera roll?? And why can‚Äôt you opt out? It makes everything so cluttered and difficult. Change it back!!"

I paid for tons of filters and used it exclusively for years.   Then they rearranged the UI and made everything more complicated.  Then they tried to make it a social network.  Now they want your personal information and you can‚Äôt use the app in any way unless you login using FB, google, your phone, or email.

The discos look so awkward on the feed. It ruins the artistic flow. Honestly they should just play automatically when you scroll past them. I think it would look a lot more clean than pressing play. Please take this into consideration for the artsy appeal of VSCO!!!"

I like having them on vsco stored, but not in my camera roll. I would appreciate if you got rid of this recent update and made it back to what it was before because this makes me very upset and is annoying."

I recently got a new phone and didn‚Äôt back up my photos because I figured VSCO would keep all the photos I did have. Once I logged everything was gone. I hate that you can‚Äôt delete them off your camera and they delete off my VSCO as well. I don‚Äôt like to post everything. That‚Äôs why they are in my drafts. I don‚Äôt need duplicates of photos I‚Äôm not posting in my camera roll. It‚Äôs super frustrating. I‚Äôve now been using other apps because of this.

Just takes a while to understand everything.
591,waffels are cool,"May 25, 2018",4,Numbers Filter i think that vsco is great but it should have the filter where there are the little orange numbers on the bottom and it makes the whole pictures like warm colors and it‚Äôs super cool. everyone uses it on their photos on instagram and i think that they should add it and make it a free filter in vsco bc everyone would use it
592,SydneyBlake,"July 22, 2018",5,No hate The best part about this app is that there are no trolls. No one is competing for likes or leaving nasty comments; everyone is just sharing pictures they love. People can share or favorite other peoples photos and that‚Äôs it!! And the filters are the best in my opinion - highly recommend!!

604,NinaReviews,"August 1, 2018",4,Filters need to be free!! The filters need to be free! Most people get the app just for the filters. So almost everyone has to pay for the filters on VSCO X it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense whatsoever. You‚Äôll get more people to download the app if you made the filters free.

621,Hoihawan,"March 7, 2018",1,"Spam I used this for a short time but it was not for me - that‚Äôs okay - it works for some and I would never bash it just because it‚Äôs not useful to me. However, after deleting the app I continue to get spam emails on essentially a daily basis - I have tried many times to unsubscribe from their marketing emails but the unsubscribe link does not work - intentional? I would say yes given that it had not worked for weeks - this is sneaky and underhanded and in some jurisdictions patently illegal. Not at all impressed."

I‚Äôve had it for about 1 month and I can‚Äôt open the app it always says error connecting to server... there is absolutely nothing wrong with my server, i don‚Äôt know what is wrong with the app, I uninstalled it then installed it and that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the problem, I‚Äôm not sure what it is but I‚Äôm willing to do anything to fix it, I really like this app"
629,Saoirse Lynch,"August 10, 2019",1,"Deleting Photos Hello. I use VSCO to edit all of my pictures. I also use Google Photos to store my pictures and to help with storage. I had a bunch of photos that I edited and I really liked them, and I just removed them from Photos and put them in Google Photos, and now all of them are gone. It‚Äôs a stupid update, please fix it. I loved my edits and now I can‚Äôt get them back. Please change this, I hate VSCO now. I will use it again once this is fixed. Thank you for reading my review."
630,ÂêåÂπ≥ÂÆâ,"October 1, 2017",4,"Great but now troubling An excellent app all around. This is not a negative review, but I've just discovered that I can't access my profile, my gallery/collection, or journals, etc. I tried downloading the update to see if that would help but it didn't. Not sure what's going on but really hope all of my content isn't gone for good..."
631,MarioBros640,"February 12, 2018",4,"Could use some more features.. Hello, I only have a few suggestions and that would be such as editing photos already posted.

632,glittermonkey161,"July 1, 2018",5,"no followers...no problem in a world revolving around likes and followers, vsco offers a revolutionary social media platform. the only people that can see your followers is yourself, and it doesn‚Äôt even count them for you. i wish vsco was as popular as instagram because it is just a photo sharing website, unlike instagram or other social medias. nobody care did you post more than once a day, nobody care dog you post a pic of yourself or the view form your hotel room. it is just an app of people supporting other people. i highly recommend vsco."
633,843-801-3650,"July 8, 2018",5,I LOVEEEEE VSCO Ok so vsco is for the girls obviously but the girls boyfriends should definitely stalk there vsco collection (just sayin). This app is the best cuz u can literally post whatever you want and it‚Äôs not like Instagram where it‚Äôs all based on likes and stuff it‚Äôs just about what u like. It‚Äôs also the BEST editing ok for editing pictures too!!
634,VSCO great review,"September 13, 2018",5,VSCO VSCO is a fabulous app where you can share pictures with lots of security. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to visit places around the world with a quick scroll. Including editing techniques and a way to spread images at a quick speed! I love VSCO and I will continue to use it!!
635,funny_pics409,"November 5, 2018",4,"Recommendation One of my fav apps but you guys should make it so that when I‚Äôm scrolling through my feed I don‚Äôt see the same picture 10 times because everyone I follow republished it, just make it so I only see it once because it gets annoying somethings seeing the same 5 pics in feed"
636,duihong,"November 22, 2018",5,"just a suggestion I really love this app! I‚Äôve had it for years, and the updates have made it more and more easy to use. I only have one small suggestion, which is to allow borders on videos. I would love to have this option!"
637,ivecant,"January 13, 2019",5,Rating VSCO is a good place to express yourself and able others who you are through the pictures you take and the people who are in them. This app allows you to show the people you follow what you like/love without having to use captions.
638,jessssssayyy,"February 22, 2019",5,WE NEED NUMBERS ok this app is freaking amazing but i just ask the developers to put a number that only WE(as in ourselves) can see of how many republishes and favorites we get on each post.
639,Milllliiee,"May 16, 2019",3,bugs in new update The new update has a couple annoying bugs - after you copy edits it is unable to paste them on another picture for starters. Then the new pop up menu you would select paste edits from freezes there unless you select one of the options or close the app. Extremely frustrating. Please fix it.
640,meredith4646,"September 24, 2017",4,"Love it, Nothing loads I have had vsco for over 2 years and I use it every other day if not everyday.

641,Fish_üê†11,"February 25, 2019",5,AMAZING i love vsco it is so easy to edit picture and share them with friends.

I am a VSCO X member and as of the past few weeks my app is crashing every minute and I‚Äôm not able to edit any photos without it crashing and making me start over. I edit raw files and it is not working how it usually does. Also won‚Äôt let me save any of my photos to my camera roll. I‚Äôve been using VSCO for a few years and don‚Äôt want to find another editing app because this is what has been working for my style. Please fix this!!!
643,üòáLoveüòá,"March 16, 2020",3,Vsco Review I think vsco is a very fun app to use good for editing photos but one of my post i think went viral but i can‚Äôt even count how many republished it has i know that it‚Äôs a good way to just distract from the opinions on social media but i think that you should be able to see the amount of a activity on post especially if you are sone type of social media influencer
644,bruh how,"February 21, 2020",5,QUESTION this isnt a review but can u guys please make an update where you can select the pictures you wanna delete off of you account and delete them at the same time instead of having to delete them each one by one
645,Lilatino,"January 9, 2020",3,"Good app... This is a really good app for photo editing. But what it doesn‚Äôt show is that it‚Äôs also kind of a social media platform. It‚Äôs kind of a mix between Instagram and Twitter. You can republish pictures, kind of like sharing them and you can also post pictures for your friends to see. Some kids may be using this poorly and I think parents should know."
646,Mattrudy,"October 27, 2019",5,Love it though... I absolutely love this app
647,Hannah 231,"September 12, 2019",4,DSCO The only thing that I hate is that you can‚Äôt take a DSCO video by yourself.üò≠ So hope that in the next upgrade y‚Äôall can put an option to take it by yourself. Also I wish that you could save it to your camera roll instead of putting it on your feed. But love the app and will keep using it!üôÇ
648,itsssb,"July 18, 2019",2,"Great app but.. I love VSCO! The filters are great and it‚Äôs cool how you can decide whether to publish them or keep them private, but, I do not like the new update. I like to keep most of my photos on there because I have no space in my camera roll. I don‚Äôt like how if you delete the picture from your camera roll, it also deletes it from the app, I liked it a lot better before it changed! Hopefully it‚Äôll go back to the way it was."
649,.K.A.B.,"June 26, 2019",3,go back to the old update !!! i HATE the fact that when i delete photos from vsco off my camera roll they automatically delete off of my vsco. please take that away or make it a setting/option if you choose to do that. i just lost a bunch of pictures because i thought it‚Äôd be in my vsco but now they‚Äôre gone
650,katara0508,"December 30, 2017",4,One tiny thing I love the app and have been using it for years. The only thing I've reallly wished for many times is the ability to import a short video (a couple seconds in length) or gif to serve as dscos. Like many times I have encountered this issue but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.
651,Obbbbbytobblys,"June 9, 2018",2,Horrible It keeps crashing every time i go to edit and every F****** it does this. On top of that when you delete the stupid app everything in your ‚Äústudio‚Äù gets deleted which pisses me off bc i had some good pictures and then the app got deleted so the pictures were NEVER seen again. Overall this app has way more Cons than Pros. The only pro i can think of is that the editing tools are good but everything else is üí©
652,cfarw,"July 4, 2018",2,"They deleted my post!! I made a collage of things about post malone and it got over 8,000+ republishes and favorites and I was soo happy and then I kept getting notifications every second and I went on to see how many it was at and then it said error loading content. I love  vsco's filters and the way they made it a non hate place but it makes me so mad that they did this and they didn't even respond to my email."

654,Pearmilou,"October 27, 2018",5,"Best editing app and photography platform The interface, although it takes some time to get used to, is really nice once one is accustomed to it. The presets are fantastic too. The VSCO image and journal-publishing features are wonderfully minimalistic, letting one‚Äôs photography and written word shine."
655,French_toast_art,"December 2, 2018",5,Free??? I loved this so much! For a free app this is so high quality! I 100% recommended this app for anyone who wants to get into photography or is already doing photography and needs a good app to use! I started photography a few months ago and this app was a grate way to start! My sister showed me this app and It‚Äôs GRATE!
656,Isabel42,"December 25, 2018",1,"Deleting filters is a scam! I have been a loyal VSCO user for over 4 years, and use it to edit all my photos for my multiple instagram accounts. However, when I opened my app a few days ago, the filters I always used (A4-A6, HB1/HB2) that were FREE previously are now paid?! It‚Äôs ridiculous that filters I had previously downloaded are no longer available. The ones you can use are honestly mediocre at best, if not completely useless. I will not be paying for VSCO X. This is a scam."
657,pistlilgirl1990,"January 17, 2019",5,Love!! But.. I love this ap!! But if you click the link ... it brings you your photos and if you don‚Äôt have the ap.. it yells at you to download it and there‚Äôs no way t X out. That‚Äôs kind of a bummer.. not everyone wants to have to do something. Just sayin! Get rid of that black boxxxxx paaaalease!

Either chill on the republishing or let me unfollow"
659,Monicabob1928383,"February 3, 2020",1,The Worst I paid for one year and made sure to cancel it before the end date. I haven‚Äôt touched the app since so I removed it. I even see in my apple account that it‚Äôs there but it offers the prices IF I decide to re subscribe. So I wasn‚Äôt worried. Update my card today and there it is a charge that I did NOT authorize. I‚Äôm trying to cancel it and there is no way from apple and I just redownloaded the app and there is no way to cancel from here. Absolutely frustrated and would not recommend!
660,S3xlord,"November 15, 2018",4,App keeps malfunctioning Whenever I‚Äôm scrolling trough my page it gets stuck and doesn‚Äôt let me scroll down any further. The usually way to fix this is to close the app and open it again.
661,HolyShushCabin,"December 23, 2018",5,"Simple, quiet, and serious about photography VSCO could be the adult Instagram, in that there‚Äôs less talk and more snap. The interface is simple and minimalistic.

662,zxcvbmaosurbdbs,"April 4, 2019",4,"VSCO rating I really do love VSCO. It is my favorite platform and form of media, and I like how easy it is to access all sorts of diverse photography.

663,Steinramm,"April 26, 2019",3,You need an account to even open the app I downloaded this app at least 5 times and always forget that they force you to create account to use the app. Basically without the account you can't see nothing that sign up screen. I don't find it necessary for the photo editing app. Basic functionalities should be open and synced over iCloud.
664,Best thing created,"June 1, 2019",4,Hate the update I love VSCO so much but they just made an update where if you delete a picture from your camera roll it deletes it from your VSCO studio.

666,nowiar,"June 9, 2019",3,"Block Feature Make a block feature where no one can actually view your posts, I love vsco but I‚Äôm unfortunately being stalked like crazy by someone and it would have been so helpful to include a feature through the app that can block people and you can choose if the public can type in your URL or not to look you up."
667,boi idk they r all taken,"January 13, 2020",2,can‚Äôt make an account vsco is great app but i‚Äôm having trouble making an account. i had an account before and i deleted it because i was not happy with it. i used my phone number to sign into it. then when i tried to make a new account with my phone number again it wouldn‚Äôt let me. i‚Äôm not sure why vsco still had my phone number stored when i fully deleted the account. this is very annoying because now i cannot make an account with my phone number and have it easy for people to find me. so then i tried to make one with my email. i entered my email correctly but it wouldn‚Äôt let me verify it. so now i‚Äôm sure vsco has my email and phone number stored and i can‚Äôt even make an account.

670,Jshridhysjwnshidmsn,"February 22, 2018",4,Love it but... I wish when you are on discover or when you are looking at your friends pictures you could not only see the filter they used but the settings and how much the adjusted each tool they used. But otherwise it my absolute favorite editing app.
671,Kjb9302,"July 25, 2018",5,ü§© Vsco is an amazing app where you can be yourself without getting judged and hurt on. There are no likes or comments so you don‚Äôt have to worry how many likes you get. Vsco is a place where all girls support each other and build a family.
672,TeD2D,"August 29, 2018",1,"$20 a year for this? No thank you. Seriously, what a ripoff. These reoccurring ‚ÄúApp subscriptions‚Äù for access are scams. Sure, I can see a sub for a MMO game or tangible thing like home delivered razors or food, but for photo filters? No.  "

682,Smoove Sailor,"January 27, 2019",5,"Great App! The app is amazing, the only thing I would recommend is adding more options for border colors. Possibly something like content aware borders that will recognize the colors in your photo and make border color options based off those colors."

There‚Äôs absolutely no customer service to help me fix this and now this app is just a waste for me.
686,cara lynne,"April 13, 2020",1,Auto deletion Almost a year later and STILL they haven‚Äôt fixed their auto-deletion ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. The app is so difficult to use when they will automatically delete your photos!! It makes zero sense for the customer to keep using this app!

696,r.m//,"August 12, 2019",5,Great app I‚Äôm not saying this because of the whole trend or whatever but VSCO is a great app. It doesn‚Äôt show the amount of followers you have or likes so you don‚Äôt have to compare yourself to others. It also it a great place for editing photos.

I don't understand why. This has completely limited me to so little filters, but just know that I will no longer be using this app because I refuse to pay money monthly for my photos to have an extra filter on them. Good job VSCO, you've lost a once loyal user."

You all should be ashamed of yourselves. How do you sleep at night knowing you have designed something so terrible? Who decides how to make updates to your app? I can only imagine the meetings where these effed up design decisions are being made. I‚Äôm also salty af that your filters and editing capabilities are amazing.

704,Its ya gurl,"June 21, 2019",3,"love it, but needs an update i‚Äôm not sure why but for users are unable to post videos from their camera roll onto vsco, i saw somewhere that you used to be able to download an entirely different app for dsco so that users could make their pre-recorded videos into dscos enabling them to post the videos onto vsco. i‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true but if it was then i‚Äôm upset it‚Äôs no longer an option. i would love to turn my videos into dscos and put them on my vsco profile!! especially with all the snapchat gifs you can add to short videos it‚Äôs not the same when it‚Äôs just a screenshot of the video :/ would really love to see and update on this."

I love the edits but hate this new update.

723,alamosaomsstudent,"April 25, 2020",4,I like it... I wish more of my friends had it! You guys should make ads!!! The reason I docked a point is because I honestly think this app can go above and beyond and maybe get a wider reach if it didn‚Äôt cost money to unlock filters and make videos... nobody‚Äôs going to want to pay for that!

Now I can‚Äôt even import my pictures because it won‚Äôt respond to import them it deselects the pictures I choose and glitches out. Please do your best to fix this. This app is crucial for a ton of on the go photographers. Not to mention I pay for my membership. How is a paid app not being updated more frequently?
725,lolhjhjkjk,"April 15, 2020",1,unhappy when I got a new phone vsco wouldn‚Äôt give me the option to sign in. it forced me to create a new account no matter what I did. websites for assistance weren‚Äôt helpful either and no one got back to me when I tried to contact them. I‚Äôve used this app for years and never had problems before but their reputation in my eyes was ruined once this happened. update your app or something to allow people to get into their accounts.
726,Joooooooooa,"February 7, 2020",5,"Enjoy this + feature request I like that the photos on this app has a different feel. Not having comments, likes or follow counts makes it more focused on the photo than the numbers. All the edit and filter options are also really nice. "

I lost all the data on my phone and was hoping to do some damage control by retrieving my favorite pictures from my VSCO studio, but no they had disappeared. I strongly suggest that a new update is put into place where this is an OPTION."
728,raaachelmaine,"July 21, 2019",1,Hate the updates I‚Äôve been a VSCO user for years and the new updates are horrible. Why does the photo delete from VSCO when I delete it from my camera roll?  PLEASE change this. I want them in my VSCO for a reason. Also why does the photo automatically save to my camera roll once I‚Äôm done editing it? I usually go back and edit it multiple times.

733,fakeliampayne,"May 7, 2018",2,"Disappointed, but I get it. I know VSCO needed to gain money from somewhere, which is why they introduced the new X series, HOWEVER , there is so little filters left to use by the non-buyers that i almost always find myself switching from VSCO to other editing apps. I think it‚Äôs unfair for us to not enjoy the app fully like we used to back in the day. Personally, I am on the lookout for another editing app that fills the void VSCO left in me ."

It‚Äôs no longer possible to work on a photo in multiple app sessions. Example: I make a few edits of my photo, if I come back to work on it the next day it‚Äôs gone. This seems like a terrible decision by the product owner. Is VSCO trying to push me to a competitor product? I guess I‚Äôll have to look elsewhere for my image editing now. üòû"

There may be people who enjoy so much pressure to become a yearly member that they do so, but to make it nearly unrecognizable from its primary reason for existing for everyone else will not do them any favors. Now there is a ‚Äúbranding‚Äù of all my photos I edit with VSCO? I don‚Äôt want your watermark on my photos. Thanks, but no thanks."

751,perfect change,"April 15, 2018",4,VSCO Review VSCO has great filters to edit a picture and is the only editing app I use to get the ‚Äúperfect picture‚Äù I am hoping for. The only thing I would change in this app is the filter downloads witch cost money and in some scenarios make you pay a certain amount per month.
752,mr. meaties,"June 12, 2018",5,Ugh I love this app but I absolutely abhor the update!! I liked the shadows and highlights option!

753,photgrapher-b,"April 22, 2020",2,Went down hill after update Once VSCO no longer allowed you to delete photos of your camera roll without deleting it off the actual app it went down hill.

It was good while it lasted.

I don‚Äôt like when I delete the photos on my phone it also deletes them off the app!! please change this so if I delete them off my phone they stay on the app. I don‚Äôt edit on VSCO as much any more because it this.

This update doesn‚Äôt help me save storage at all, and at times I like going back and copying edits from old pictures to use on my new ones and now I can‚Äôt. All my friends hate this new feature as well and I wish it would be changed back because I find it very frustrating."

781,margymnast98,"March 17, 2018",4,My thoughts about VSCO I recently got VSCO and I already love it. VSCO has a whole bunch of things you can do to your pics to make them however u want!

786,SuperRatr 12345,"December 16, 2019",4,"Awesome app It‚Äôs a great app to edit everyday photos and share with a community of like minded individuals, the only thing that would be nice is if there was an easier way of going back to see older photos rather than have to scroll for a long time to find them."

Some photos are just not meant to be on my camera roll. They need to stay in VSCO where they belong! Sometimes a girl just wants to edit a photo and not do anything with it.

806,Sydney_cathleen,"January 22, 2019",4,A little tip I love the VSCO app but my only problem is that simple things like boarders are locked unless you buy them.

807,HappyJesusLover162,"April 17, 2019",4,"Followers I love vsco quite a lot, and my only complaint is about the social media aspect of the app. I wish there was a way to see how many followers you had or how many republishes you get.

809,yungbaegod,"May 21, 2019",2,Latest update The latest update where VSCO deletes photos from the app if you delete them from your camera roll is really unfortunate and quite annoying. Often times I save EDITED photos in my vsco for reference of photos I‚Äôll edit later but now if I wish to do that I must hoard every photo in my camera roll and cause clutter (and a headache) VSCO really took 3 steps back with this update.

942,Dancing_Ballerina229,"July 25, 2018",5,Amazing App! I love VSCO so much! You can make super fun and customizable filters to upload to your media‚Äôs. I was so stoked when they added filters to videos so I can post videos to my Instagram and not ruin my theme!
943,Lalypop242,"January 6, 2019",3,"Not the same I‚Äôve used VSCO for years, and suddenly they‚Äôve changed what used to be free and added it to the VSCO X. I get that everyone has to make money but leave what was free, free. I can‚Äôt even re-edit old pictures because now those filters need to be paid for. Onto finding the next app.."
944,lhousekey,"March 4, 2019",1,VSCO has become shady I have purchased many individual presets and preset packs over the last 5-6 years and I logged in today and noticed they have ALL been removed and I am told I have to buy the yearly subscription to get all the presets now. How can you take away presets people have already purchased?! That is extremely shady and I will not be giving a cent to VSCO anymore due to their new deceptive business model.
945,KK4x,"March 26, 2019",1,"Just a photo filter, don‚Äôt bank on it. What‚Äôs community? Just a word people throw around these days. I saw the review and it was too late. Why would you delete the photos uploaded; if so this is just a nice filter app and quite expensive at it. Mind you, I deleted the app because it was not working yet they don‚Äôt disclose all your data will be lost. Negative 10 stars. This is pretty lame considering others have expressed this."

947,Sydney6342,"June 7, 2019",1,New VSCO update I‚Äôve always loved using VSCO but I don‚Äôt see the point of this new update. I like to keep all my uploaded photos in my vsco library without deleting them so I can go back in the future and tweak them. My friends do the same! It‚Äôs annoying because in my regular camera roll I keep the photos that I like the most and in VSCO I keep everything. You should do everyone a favor and bring that back
948,bbschmide,"July 26, 2019",2,"Picture Folders? Love the app, however just wanted to suggest that they make folders (kind of like boards on Pinterest). I like the idea of sorting the pictures that I favorite & republish into categories & that way it would be easier to find certain ones rather than scrolling through all my favorites. Hope you guys see this!"
949,mad_hizzle,"June 24, 2019",4,new update üëéüèº I would have rated VSCO 5 stars however they changed the way they store photos and I highly dislike it. A way I look back on my memories without taking so much space on my camera roll is thru my VSCO studio. üòï

1614,a r t i s t i c,"May 28, 2019",5,I  l o v e  t h i s  a p p This app is so much fun you can post photos and look at your friends and the editing software it rly amazing!!! üëçüèºüëçüèº I spend all my time on this app.
1615,Smartsister01 ( add me on ow ),"December 25, 2019",2,Deleting photos I loved the app so much before the update (5/5) but since the new update..I have to keep every photo on my camera roll to be able to edit on the app which is annoying and stupid!! I‚Äôd rate the app a 1/5 but I do enjoy the editing features still..I just wish they would go back to allowing all photos to be saved in VSCO without letting the camera roll interfere.
1616,Keepsha,"December 7, 2019",1,Have to have an account now?! Okay I love this app. I‚Äôve been using it for years. But the new update requires you to create an account and sign in! You can‚Äôt exit the sign up options to edit your photos!! Super frustrated and annoyed by this. Guess I‚Äôll be moving over to Lightroom.

1618,Ohitsmayya,"August 2, 2019",4,Suggestions I think that vsco should have a timer for DSCO‚Äôs. Maybe a 10 or 5 seconds timer then starts recording would be a great idea!
1619,tinysheeplovrr,"July 19, 2019",1,"Bring back the old feature I loved vsco but ever since they added the feature where when you delete and item from your photo library it deletes the photo that is also uploaded on the app, Ive been hating the app. Bring back the old feature!!!"
1620,IrritatedASF,"February 25, 2018",4,Very useful This app is really good and I do enjoy it. I just don‚Äôt like the fact that you have to join VSCO and it charges I believe. Why can‚Äôt it just be free? Anyways it‚Äôs good.
1621,hisoin,"March 20, 2018",4,important! pros:
1622,2disapointed1,"March 29, 2018",5,love love vsco but i think that you should have a spot where you can look at who‚Äôs all following you just for you to see. also when your activity gets to a certain number it should show you the number of favorites and republished so you don‚Äôt have to count if you‚Äôre curious
1623,paintamovie,"June 4, 2018",2,"It‚Äôs okay but I‚Äôm gonna look elsewhere Their photo editing software is okay however their camera captures very blurry images on both raw and normal shooting modes. Also, you are not able to export raw photos to your computer."

1776,Emma Matrixa,"December 26, 2019",5,"Awesome and fast editing tool. Even worth writing a review about it. When I was 10 in 1972 I got my first camera, it was called Kodak Pocket Instamatic. There was nothing insta- about it, you still needed a film roll, take it to the next photo store (which in my town sold vinyl records too and played rock and pop music on it‚Äôs speakers) and have it developed. You got all the pictures the good ones and the bad ones. Nothing was deleted in those days. The pictures were fuzzy, but it was pretty awesome, because the camera fit in your pocket and it was easy to reach for it and snap a moment to turn it into a memory on a paper. It was convenient, which leads me to VSCO. I really, really like it. "

2188,Tiyler Perrie,"August 9, 2019",4,"Great app but they made a wrong statement.. Okay I just got this app and I immediately fell in love with it. I love posting pictures of me and nature and I love looking at other picture and even better I get to look at my friends post and chat with her on the app also but... I found that in the title of this app it states that it‚Äôs a photo AND video editor but you don‚Äôt get to edit videos unless you have a paid membership to this app. Now the app stated that you would be able to edit some of your videos but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to edit them without paying money to do it and that is unfair to people who don‚Äôt have enough money to pay for editing videos. Although a lot of video editing apps have that paid membership option, there are many apps that don‚Äôt. People can just delete this app and find one that is actually true to their words. It‚Äôs like lying to the viewers. You say one thing but then there is always a catch. My parents get mad when I order a $2.00 movie on tv so imagine their anger when they see I have a paid membership on an app they have never heard of in their life!! Again it‚Äôs totally unfair in how the word things in the title and description but then you get the app it‚Äôs nothing how they have described it. I downloaded this app to edit not only pictures but videos but I can‚Äôt because of this paid membership rule. I am going to keep the app but also look for one that lets me edit videos for free. Don‚Äôt download this app if you are looking to edit your vids, unless you wanna pay for it."

2855,#livinglife<3,"September 16, 2019",3,"Reinforces societies view of a perfect adolescent This app itself is not a bad concept and is very similar to Instagram, however the aspects of the app that are concerning is that there is a constant link with other social media accounts, adolescent‚Äôs wanting to use this app to say that they use it and to also ‚Äòfit in‚Äô in the sense that they can edit their photos to portray an ideal version of themselves that they perceive through this app and through the hashtag VSCOgirl. An article that discusses the relationship between social media use and adolescent‚Äôs feelings and perceptions, found that ‚Äúsocial media activity (i.e., the number of accounts adolescents have and their self-reported frequency of checking social media) was moderately, positively related to FoMO[fear of missing out] and loneliness, as well as with parent-reported hyperactivity/impulsivity, anxiety, and depression‚Äù (Barry, Sidoti, Briggs, Reiter & Lindsey, 2017). While this app is not solely to blame for these emotions, I think that it does contribute to a societal perspective of a perfect person that does not in reality exist. Once again, adolescents are attempting to fit in using their access to social media to do so, and with this app being known for its hashtag and the idealization of girls in adolescents, it is not helping ‚Äúan adolescent's perception that he/she does not compare favorably to others as seen on social media or does not have the types of affiliations with others that he/she perceives on social media may heighten internalizing symptoms‚Äù (Barry et al., 2017). However, I do appreciate that on the app itself, there is no option to comment on others pictures, so whether the comments would be positive or negative, the adolescent is not posting on this app to seek feedback in that way. They would be more likely to use the app to edit their photos and then share those on websites such as Instagram or Facebook."

When I went to open the app it appeared to be opening because it quickly flashed the ‚Äúhome screen‚Äù (or at least that‚Äôs what I think it was) and then went white. I figured maybe it just takes a min so I let it sit there. After about 2 mins I closed the app and closed and tried again, and the same thing happened. After about 39 secs I again closed the app, made sure it would be the only thing my phone was trying to run when I re open it, even clear the RAM quick on my phone before attempting again and when I saw that white screen I decided to delete the app. I guess I‚Äôm glad in a way that I wasn‚Äôt able to edit any photos with the app. While reading through comments I saw once one deletes the app all edits done with it disappear.... I will say I am a tiny bit bummed I didn‚Äôt get to explore the app at all, it seemed very interesting!

3039,l;fkj asl;fjasl;fj as[ovnuaeop,"January 5, 2020",1,"Hands off stored VSCO library Terrible, terrible, terrible move to automatically delete photos from VSCO library when I delete them from my phone‚Äôs main camera roll. This makes no sense. It is wildly counterintuitive in the first place, but the fact that it‚Äôs just there now and I have no option to turn off or go around this feature is appalling. WHY would that ever be a good idea? Let users at least opt in or out of it. But to force this fascist dictate on every user at all times is mindblowingly jaw droppingly myopic, atavistic, regressive, and naive. You guys have built a massively strong and respectable app that I‚Äôve used for many years now, not only do your presets have integrity (and almost no other photo app has any), but you have built a structure with so much sincerity and possibility and freedom to move inside the app that I can barely believe it. With Apple products, for example, users get to move with ease inside a thoughtfully constructed and beautifully designed framework, but their freedom to tweak and customize is greatly restricted. What you have made at VSCO goes beyond that. You have made--for photo editing on a human level, minus all the airbrushing and dissecting garbage that no one needs to be doing in the first place‚Äîsomething that has far surpassed Photoshop, the cheap quick fling of Instagram, and the infinite crappy other flash in the pan fake tilt shift apps. God VSCO is amazing. It should be the industry standard. I even paid an exorbitant amount for a Lr preset pack back in the day, before this app worked. But the point is that what you‚Äôve created is both old school Microsoft‚Äîeverything is customizable and you can actually build something of your own‚ÄîAND current sleek sexy Apple design. Freedom and beauty, plus integrity. Jesus. However, adding a feature to delete my stored VSCO photos behind my back was like reaching in and snipping the power cord. You knocked over all my dominoes, and I was right in the middle of something good. I can‚Äôt describe the system of stored presets, ideas, colors, tones, moods, tiny subtle important variations that I had stored and organized and carefully built there, in that simple app library. I have NEVER used any other app that has given me the power and tools and freedom to work and create as fast as my mind can think, like VSCO has."

3350,LittleDrummerGirl9,"March 23, 2014",4,"Best This app is absolutely fabulous. Best editing app I've ever found. A lot of editing apps have filters that ruin the image and make it look gaudy, but these filters can make it look more professional. The fine tune editing is great, and I can yield many things out of it. I give it 4 stars for two things- one that's really been hindering me lately is that it says there's no room to import pictures. My phone has some sort of bug/problem where my messages take up over 7GB of my data (on a 16GB phone). I've deleted all my messages and only gotten about 10 megabytes back. (My only other option to get rid of the 7GB is to wipe my phone completely, and I don't want to do that.) So now, I can't edit the photos I have because VSCO Cam says I have no room to import. I understand that, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but it didn't used to do that? Didn't the app before some updates import any and all photos regardless of space? If that's something that could be fixed, that would be absolutely amazing. Such a great app, and I can't even use it. "

I really love the vsco grid. a lot. and the advanced camera options but I do find myself preferring the native iPhone camera app. I would give this app 5 stars if you could see who is following you and like photos. I really would at least like comments so that I can let other photographers know I like their work without having to share it to some random other site! that's the only place where instagram is better than vscocam. I use this app almost exclusively as a photo sharing app rather than an editing app, so maybe that's my fault. but I think this app has the best potential as a more advanced photographers Instagram. sometimes crashes, especially on iPad. sometimes I get stuck with the lack of arrow or closing buttons but you get the hang of just tapping a couple times or once to close or open things. especially weird when looking at my own grid. "
3352,Horsepeeps,"March 11, 2015",5,"AMAZING APP I got this app because I was looking for a special edit that I've seen on a lot of pictures recently and I was hoping that this would be the one. When I opened it up it asked me some questions, but I ignored them and went straight to the editing section. I found the exact edit I was looking for and SO much more. They have tons of different filters that you can use and you can adjust how much of each filter you want on your pictures. They have so many different ways to edit your pictures and I was able to learn so much in a matter of hours and now I'm obsessed. I told my friend about it and she downloaded it right away. She actually read the questions that I mentioned before and it turns out this app was also a way to share and view other photographers pictures! This made it SO much better and the thing I like about it is that you have a way to share all your pictures and you can follow other people, like instagram, but you don't know your followers or the number of followers and theres no likes or no comments. I have an instagram too which I love, but it's super nice to have an app that is not only amazing for editing, but also to look at some of the best pictures I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the customer service is amazing. There's not one bad thing I can say about this app but somehow they keep managing to make it better and better with each upgrade. Keep up the good work!!"
3353,krisabakin,"July 26, 2015",4,"Needs some organization I love VSCO's app. However, it definitely needs some improvement. Get ready for some comparisons: VSCOcam is basically blogging app meets photography app. Instagram without the need for attention and ""likes.""  Wordpress without the complex UI. Also similar to tumblr's concept, but without the diverse-outspoken-sort-of-immature community and anonymity of its users. This means less cyber bullying and perhaps less time stuck in the social media world on your phone. The actual purpose of a photo app is to post pictures, not to get as many followers as possible (I've recently deleted my Instagram because of the power it has over my self-esteem). I do love the journal feature, because writing a quick blog on your phone is not easy, but VSCO makes it the opposite. Quick and to the point (unlike this review). My major concern is the UI and how unorganized it is. It takes a long time to figure anything out, turning you off of the app at first. I do agree we should be able to see who is following us, but I don't think that the number of people following you should be displayed on profile. Minimalism is always a plus in terms of design, but not when it comes to actual functions and features of the application. Just make it easier to figure out for everyone."
3354,Christianmunoz,"July 29, 2015",5,*UPDATED REVIEW* I absolutely love this app and the team behind it!
3355,Bluefire911,"June 10, 2016",2,"update is disappointing I love the simplicity of vsco, but the update has got me second guessing the whole product. it used to be all about the photography, and it still is, just in a weird way. I don't get the gray button on the button, like what is its purpose. if it was just in the demo then it'd be fine, but now it's just like a cat sitting in the corner. the thing I hate about the gray circle is that we HAVE to use to get to the other page, why can't we just use our finger and not the gray thing. it's useless, we don't need it. the second thing that's brought me down is that we can't just swipe from photo to photo if we want, we have to click on a picture, exit out of it and then click another one. I miss the old version where we could just look from one picture to the next. another aspect of vsco that I don't like is the fact that there's not a third page for our profile. I know I spend a lot of time on my profile making sure it's A+ material, but that way to get to it is through the photos page and it makes absolutely no sense to me at all. ""why?"" is my question. why has the app diminished so much from what it used to be. it was great, then it was okay, and now it's unacceptable. it was sufficient and it would get the job done, but now there's so many extra gadgets that we don't need and gadgets that are missing. I am severely unhappy with the update and I wish with my heart and sole that they will change it back."
3356,Happy Horsie 2,"June 11, 2016",2,"Not my favorite This update is not my favorite (hence the title). It's ecstatically not pleasing for me (I'm very detailed-oriented).  The rainbow refresh does not match the app's design (I would change it to black or that olive green used for sales and updates). The logo used for swiping and bringing up the camera is a good idea, however it does not fit, it's also very distracting when scrolling. I notice that the symbols are the thicker and the typefaces are different, again I prefer the original. The placement of the notifications seem out of place, why is not with the one's account instead of having it in their following feed? Navigation is easier with the swipe, but I prefer how it was before (where's own account at the top of their following feed displaying their profile photo)."
3357,AspirationalB,"June 13, 2016",5,"Gorgeous interface but not as popular as Insta, though it should be! I downloaded the app for the first time several days ago, which coincided with the release of the new update that apparently was an overhaul of the app interface. So the new update is all I've known. While it look a little bit of time to figure out, there were prompts that helped me get the hang of it. While I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of the new update, I can see where these people are coming from: they've been used to the old interface and such a drastic change may seem to come across as change for changes' sake from the creators of the app. Personally I have no major complaints. The interface is absolutely *gorgeous* and I keep wanting to post pictures even though it takes longer to edit photos on here than on Instagram (more options on here that make your photos look better). I like posting even though I haven't made made many connections on here. I do wish more people I know were using VSCO. But I love to get on and just look at my photos which the app helps to make them look so professional."

I love this app. It previously once turned my phone off if I would save more than 5 photos to my camera roll at a time. Now that the bug is fixed, I use this app for all my photos as it doesn't mess with the time stamp on the EXIF data & the customization is incredible. :)"
3362,Ojijay,"September 11, 2015",4,"Great App, but a couple tips... VSCOcam is an amazing app. Overall design, aesthetic, and program is just spectacular. Maybe even the greatest app of all time. But if there's one thing  that I would like to see, is the ability to share multiple photos to the GRID at once. It's just a pain having to individually upload single photos. And one more thing....after buying and downloading so many presets, is really hard to find which ones I want to go to first and which ones I don't want at all. It would be nice if instead of having to go through the laborious process of going through preferences to organize presets, it would be nice to have easy access to editing the order right inside a photo. Maybe if at the far right end(where you can go to the store) there was a little icon where you could rearrange presets. Instagram does a good just with this (although it's a little too easy to rearrange) , but I think adding easy access to the preset order would be superb. Great app. Continue the great work, VSCO."
3363,AimeeBrooke1,"June 12, 2016",4,"I Miss The White Background Although it took some time, and a lot of rewatching the update walk-through video, I finally figured out how to use all of the features on this app. I've used VSCOcam for about 3 years now, and I've always LOVE LOVE LOVED it! However, this new app does have me a little contradicted. My main concern: the background color, and the way photos are now arranged. The black behind people's posts is too distracting. If anything, it takes away from user contend because all black does nothing to flatter beautiful pictures. It dulls them. Also, I prefer VSCO when my library was arranged in perfect squared. It helped me to arrange pictures, and easily compare them next to each other. It also helped me to arrange my Instagram themes. I still love the app regardless, I am just disappointed that there were so many changed made. If anything, you downgraded. You made something so amazing and beautiful, and in attempts to make it better, you did the opposite. Sometimes if something is doing great on its own, you should just leave it be."
3364,MIKE_KOV,"June 12, 2016",1,"Developers Don't Value Our Input Often times when an app gets updated to the dismay of its users, I believe the developers figure the initial reactions will just blow over.  Recently many apps that are people's favorites have undergone drastic changes in the UI.  But, when have you once heard or seen a developer retract an update or go back to a previously beloved design?  With this update to VSCO, the same thing will apply.  I'm amazed that developers are so stubborn or egotistical that they can't admit that they took a wrong turn.  I get it when an app is updated to improve its function or when users demand a change.  But, to update something for the mere sake of changing it to me is a waste.  We'll all get used to this incarnation of VSCO.  Some people will stop using it, or use it less, but ultimately developers will have their way, and it's their product, so be it.  I loved the previous version of this app, and can't understand when SO many people feel the same that some concession isn't made.  Even allowing the option of a classic UI.  Ugh, it seems that it's too unpredictable to get too attached to any app these days. I like change, but seriously this update was a poor one."
3365,tingkoko,"June 23, 2016",5,"Different but I love it! VSCO really change things up a whole lot in the new update The UI is very different than the older version. It's even more minimalistic now. Instead of relying on menus to go from a place to another, you now navigate through the app in 4 directions. Personally, I find this very innovative and did not have a problem with it. It did take me about a day or 2 to fully get used to the new UI, but once you get a hang of it, it's actually really fun to use. "
3366,vaninadh,"August 29, 2016",2,"Interface is a confusing nightmare I love love love love VSCO ... or at least I did. However this new interface update makes the app almost completely unusable. The team is trying to jam to many functions into one app ‚Äì journals, collections, public sharing, streams, and, oh wait yeah, photo editing. The editing (and VSCO's wonderful filters) has always been the primary draw of this app, and now that functionality is totally buried and nearly as hard to use as it is to find. NOTHING is intuitive about the new app design, and by pushing some sort of unnecessary and redundant ""sharing first"" agenda (which ‚Äì news flash - makes VSCO about the 4,948,492,562,345th photo app to force down users throats) at the expense of its core competency (editing! filters!), the VSCO team has made their app nearly useless."

3368,dustininsf,"November 29, 2016",1,Great image tools but awful interface I really like the image editing tools in VSCO. They offer a nice blend of power and appropriateness for use on a phone (Filters and adjustment controls have a nice granularity - they allow a nice range of adjustments without being too finicky). Interacting with VSCO outside of the actual image edits is an exercise in extreme frustration and confusion.

3370,acslater017,"February 5, 2015",4,"Beautiful Filters, Unintuitive Navigation VSCO Cam's huge range of filters, subtle and overt, are its main strength. Some are free, some are paid - I spent $6 and got more filters than I could ever use. You can also adjust the intensity to your liking. I imported some wedding photos from my micro four-thirds camera, and they look like semi-professional fashion shoots thanks to this app - the kind of thing you'd see in an Urban Outfitters catalog. "
3371,mathism,"November 8, 2015",3,"This app is still my favorite, but Things have only seemed to decline. Everything was beautiful initially. The filters always had this chill aesthetic tone about them, the interface was seamless, and the social platform was neat. All of that, aside from the filters, have been tarnished. Whoever is developing the new stuff must STOP. It is not new or innovative or chic. It is ruining what made this app great. Even the icon changed. It's like you guys are forcing minimalism and plummeting at a fast rate because of it, instead of going with what was already good. The grids were nice. I liked using them and devising a profile...but now the layout is some odd, try-hard spacious collage that makes me too uncomfortable. I literally thought the grids were broken after seeing how we only had this one new layout theme. Please revert back before you start stepping on your own toes. The new interface is ugly. Only good thing is being able to copy and past edits. Unfortunately, I am bringing my rating down because I can't take it anymore."
3372,idkvictoria,"November 28, 2015",3,"good? :/ Idk but the grid look is really annoying me that i dont even use the explore... I miss it being full screen, and how you can see someones grid in an actual grid view, and not just scrolling and scrolling. The new grid look is ANNOYING. And also PLEASE don't listen to the people saying that being able to see your followers is bad. Being able to see followers is good because I would really want to see who follows me, it would honestly be really creepy if I couldn't. Someone could be stealing your pictures on VSCO and without seeing who follows you, you would never know it. But whatever you do, do NOT add the ability to like or comment on pictures. Don't make this app like any other social media! Other than that i love this app for editing my pictures. Love the filters and all the different tools. Also just a suggestion: make it possible so that we can sign in and see our vsco library on all our devices :) It'd be horrible to have all your pictures deleted from VSCO cam not being able to get them back. Thanks :)"
3373,Cook325,"January 2, 2016",5,"Your vsco website As some people do they advertise their vsco grid through a website link and put the link in various social media apps. I put my vsco link in my Instagram bio so people can view my photos. However, it would be really really cool to see who has viewed your website. It's helpful to know that people are viewing your photos. Even if it just says how many people have viewed it. Or even better work with Instagram to see if you can show what accounts or profiles have viewed the photos. Although I can understand wanting to be your own app with no other apps combined but your both photo apps so maybe. But vsco is my absolute very app on my phone every picture I take I pretty much edit on vsco and it helps your creative talent for photography show through the grid which I absolutely love!

First of all, I'm not sure if the point of the update was to create a more user friendly interface, but it surely did not do that. It's still pretty confusing. I have had VSCO for a while and knew how to use it after much fiddling around - I was comfortable with it and loved it, even though I knew it was not built for user friendliness and instead for aesthetics. Guess it's time for round two of tapping everywhere in an effort to get back to my grid. Second of all, I used VSCO for two things: to see what my images would look like together on a grid before uploading to Instagram (checking to make sure my ""theme"" was on point), and for the cool filters and editing tools. WELL, NOW I CAN'T DO THAT FIRST THING CAN I VSCO? I know I am not alone in using the app for seeing the images together in a grid. It is incredibly frustrating that I will now have to search for some other app that shows the images in a grid, and ALSO has VSCO's awesome editing tools. PLEASE VSCO PLEEEEASSSSEEE GO BACK TO THE OLD INTERFACE - or update it with more user friendliness but keep the Instagram-like grid view. I'm begging you!"

So w h a t t h e h e c k i s t h i s u p d a t e? Sorry to anyone who found this difficult to read, BECAUSE THAT'S THE VSCO EXPERIENCE NOW. Replacing the check mark, a universal symbol for yes, with...a circle? This random circle with stripes is supposed to help me swipe? Do you hate lines and corners VSCO? Or are you purposely taking what was supposed to be a user-friendly accessible-to-all app into an inane mishmash of symbols that are supposed to be ""aesthetic?"" My photos should have an ""aesthetic"" not the app I use to edit them for goodness sake's. I actually quite like this app and will most likely to continue to use the filters but I MUCH prefer the old version! This new way has a button to import photos where A PHOTO SHOULD GO and all the photos look much smaller now which makes it very difficult to organize photos, plan out feeds, etc. I recommend getting this for the filters more than anything else."
3377,-sara--,"July 3, 2016",1,"Update is Terrible Do the developers even listen to their audience? The overall ratings from all versions is near 5 stars and this update turned it to 1 star. JUST CHANGE IT BACK. To have spent so much money on an app and have it destroyed by a new interface is just devastating. This is honestly the worst update of any app I've ever downloaded. I used to love VSCO for its simplicity and functionality, VSCO provided the best filters and overall editing experience. But now, This new update introduces confusing features and makes it incredibly hard to navigate the app. The new color scheme/layout is absolutely hideous in my opinion. I often use VSCO to layout my Instagram feed, so the square pictures that lie side by side on a white background was ideal. The black background takes away from the photos, the various display sizes makes everything look plain messy, and the spacing makes it obnoxiously hard to compare photos for filtering. I'm utterly disappointed in the developers, you just took a perfectly amazing app (one of which I would use almost every day) and turned it into a disgrace of which I haven't opened since the update."

But 4 different times in just 3 weeks it has crashed!! When I go to edit my photo, I select a filter but it doesn't even apply to my photo. Therefor I can't edit my photos and wasted all my money on the presets. Also, whenever this bug happens it removes all the filters and editing off of the photos I had already edited! IT DESTROYED ALL MY HARD WORK. Now I have to re edit every single photo once they fix this. I contacted VSCO several times but all they tell me to do is update the app (which I tell them I already have in the email..) They clearly have no idea how to even fix this glitch themselves and won't even take the time to patch it. My friend is having the same issue too. BRING OUT A NEW UPDATE THAT PATCHES THIS GLITCH ONCE AND FOR ALL VSCO!! The only way to fix it as of now is to save your photos to your camera roll before you delete the app, then re download it. But shortly after I fixed it this way it went back to not working. Every time there is a new VSCO update it doesn't patch this issue either. Sigh."
3379,Noah Eiler,"July 13, 2017",5,"I like it Lots of people complain about the new interfaces and design choices that VSCO has taken in recent months, but I really believe that if they took the time to learn the navigation and simplistic minimalism of the designs they'd find them to be helpful. That's what I've thought of every change they've created and every choice they make is thought out and meticulously  planned to let the user get the most out of their app. People dislike change and that'll always be a reality, but if you're reading these reviews looking to see if this app is worth it, give it a chance and keep and open mind. Their editing features are top of the line and are sure to make any picture you edit into a real keeper, and the film emulated presets are beautifully minimal in the best of ways. All in all, I find this to be a brilliant app in the realm of mobile photography."

This could be beneficial who takes a liking in photography or photo editing with a strong concentration for teen and young adults who use VSCOcam for editing photos for social media sites. It has very clean with a simple design and a black and white color scheme. One of the great perks of VSCOcam is that it allows users to save photos on the APP itself through a personal photo library. It‚Äôs a very creative APP because it has plenty of filters and editing tools.

I use VSCO all the time and it's such a great creative tool for taking ordinary raw photos and transforming them into something a bit more painterly or poetic. Basically, it degrades photos in a beautiful way if you want. High dynamic range and raw digital images can look harsh, but VSCO is perfect for flattening and softening via fades and desaturation."
3384,adeline.ho,"March 31, 2016",3,"Confused but beautiful I think overall, the layout of the app is extremely beautiful and monochromatic with a chic interface. However, I really do believe that the app is extremely hard to usebecause there is no tutorial of how the app works, the different features of the app, what different editing tools are available and what they do, etc. I find it really frustrating that finding new creators to follow is difficult because there seems to be no option in which I can see if my friends or contacts have made accounts on this app. Also, I cannot see the followers of other people (you can on Instagram). Writing journals is a struggle because words are hard to select and edit. Editing things as a whole to be as you wish is a process in which you have to figure out on your own, since there is no tutorial. Over all, I feel a lot of confusion with the app but I still like it because that is that is beautiful and sophisticated."
3385,¬°El Guapo!,"May 20, 2016",3,"Please label the buttons The UI values form over function. The buttons are mostly cryptic symbols that have little or no relation to their functions, which is a big deterrent to a new user like me. Even after playing with the app for an extended time, I find myself struggling to remember what the square button does as opposed to the circle or the square with a diagonal line, or the circle of dots, and end up closing the app in frustration. That's not to mention the fact that some features are hidden from sight altogether unless you accidentally stumble on them, like swiping up on a photo to view metadata. How about a button for that? Maybe a triangle with a squiggly line above it? "

They are a fantastic company that has always stood behind their product and cares about its customers. Their app has always been my go-to for editing photos. I remember when it first came out a few years ago, I was super excited and bought it the day it came out! It has always been a simple, clean, app and the presets are generally tasteful and not overbearing. With this new update that part of the app, hasn't change. you still get to use some of the best presets for mobile and it's still easy to edit. the rest of the app, however, has changed and it's not for the better. the layout is confusing and unintuitive. there is a lot of blank black space around my photos and it's hard to see them, even on my 6S Plus. the gestures don't make sense and do not feel natural. Once you import a photo and start editing, it's not too bad but the first impression is a negative, confusing one. VSCO is known for the minimalism but I think this update has taken that one step too far.  I truly hope they change it back to the old way. this update is horrible."

With many of my pictures I usually make several separate edits of the same image to figure out what I like best, and it would be much nicer process if there was an option to simply copy the original image multiple times into the library. the current way to do this is to just import a bunch of whatever picture you are going to edit, but you can't really do that if you have deleted the original picture and only have edited ones in the library. I guess an additional option to ""pull"" the original, unedited image out of an edited one would be nice so that we could see the original without tampering with out edits. just a suggestion"

When I heard that a renovated VSCO was coming out, I was nervous, but I knew they would carry through and create something even more fantastic than what they already have. This VSCO is a more customizable version of the last one, with even more speed, features, and simplistic design. If you are used to the old VSCO, you will quickly learn to love the new one. If you are new and hesitant to VSCO, it welcomes you with open arms for you will be drawn in quickly, especially if you are a lover of clean and simple beauty in photos. "

I know there is a display option that shows a box of the Instagram size photo but I wish it was like the camera option on your iphone where if you select the ""square"" option it takes the picture an saves it to the Instagram size. In Vsco cam it takes a whole photo but doesn't save it to a smaller size display for Instagram. Hope that makes sense.

3394,Bring Back CUSTOM locations!!!,"November 26, 2015",2,"No Followers! The beauty of VSCO was always that it allowed you to post pictures for yourself and nobody else- not for likes, not for popularity, not for followers. It makes sense to allow following- there are certain accounts/photographers that one wishes to see more often than others. That's fine. But there's no need to see these numbers, and that is (correction: was) the beauty of VSCO and what drew me to the app in the first place. If VSCO keeps the ""Followers"" tab, it is only inevitable that amounts of views or likes on pictures will start being recorded, and eventually VSCO will become just like all the other social media sites: a place to boost popularity and prestige for material societal purposes. VSCO was once a place of solace, where the tired few escaped to edit and post art for themselves and only themselves, free of the societal confines of ""amount of views "" or ""follow ratios."" VSCO, if you want to retain your image as a safe haven for all those desperate to escape the pressures of typical social media, then do better: eliminate Followers, return to the old ways."
3395,Lindsay Haag,"June 10, 2016",2,I regret updating to the newest version Oh nooo!!! I really regret updating the app (especially before reading the reviews of other people warning). It no longer has the Instagram-like grid that SO many people use (all squares so you can see what your feed will look like). It's doesn't feel as organized or aesthetic as it was before and I'm even more confused. Will most likely turn away newbie VSCO users which is a shame because it's really SUCH A GREAT APP!!! It's the one app I use the most which is why I care enough to write something about it.
3396,Janowski,"June 21, 2016",1,"Awful usability to put it mildly I have to echo other reviewers in that I never thought I'd be writing an awful review for this app but... it is awful. New update breaks the usability of this app. I understand what you're trying to do but you're going about it in the wrong way. To me - and to most of your users I presume - your app is about your amazing photo filters. You want this app to be something else and you're willing to burn all your users/clients. Yes, I can say that because I've purchased all of your filters so to me that's the app. That's what I've paid for. With your updates you've made it an awful experience. You're not a social network. Stop using design tricks to drive me to your network. I can honestly say that most scammy, in-app driven apps are easier to use. I love your filters and I want to use your app but I'm close to asking for my money back. I hope you see the light soon and stick to your app's true identity, your users and their photos. If you're changing course then let your users know so we don't have to waste more time. Good luck and thank you."
3397,karls a lou,"June 24, 2016",4,"Not perfect but I am in the process of pursuing a career in photography and have been photographing and editing on this app for years now. I don't use too many of the filters, and if I do I don't use them at their fullest power but I've gotten very comfortable navigating through the editing features and grown to appreciate them a lot. I also recently started using the social media side of it and I highly recommend exploring the app and finding accounts to follow and utilizing the Collection feature because it gives you an opportunity to be inspired by other photographs and expand on your own creativity. I really love vsco, like I said I don't use every single filter, I only use a select 5-10 or so and I've actually purchased a few packages and only used some but like I said I do appreciate this app a lot and I think I may stick with editing on it for years to come."

VSCO was and I still want it to be my favorite app, but this update is beyond frustrating. The layouts confusing and I can't look through my profile without being forced to edit a picture and I miss the older version where you could swipe from left to right to view your pictures and others profiles, without exiting out of the picture you're looking at to click on a new one. The circle on the bottom of the screen is creative and goes with your new more modern and up to date feel, but that's super frustrating too bc no longer can I slide anywhere on the page to click library or explore but it has to slide across specifically at the bottom of the screen and it's just frustrating when you're used to an easier way. Please please change how you can view profiles etc and see the caption to photos without getting annoyed and please help this become mine along with many others favorite app again !"

I'll give them an extra star because their customer support is stellar, but seriously... This update is a few small improvements, and a few steps back. Overall it's still horrid. It's like they are trying to be non-intuitive. Change for the sake of change, regardless of what they break. And... the adjustment sliders are kind of sticky, and you can no longer arrange filters in the order you like. You can't put the ugly distortia or red Nike in the back. I actually know a few people who tried it (at my recommendation) but found it too clunky to continue with. Honestly, I rarely say things like this, but they should fire the team responsible for the interface. It is as far from easy to use and intuitive as you can get. The iPad version is still the old easy to use interface. I hope they don't change it. I'd actually like to see that come back to the iPhone. Currently, this is a great app that has really lost its way."

You can make some really subtle, beautiful effects with this app. The bad? Well, the UI leaves a lot to be desired, basically, and using VSCO can be clunky and counter intuitive at best. Cumbersome at worst. I feel like I need to take too many steps to access my phone's camera roll, and the journey isn't a particularly pretty one either. Once I've linked up with my roll I then need to ""import"" the pictures I want in to the app, apply my filters, and then SAVE the edited photos back on to my roll. Not exactly the smoothest process. You can also choose to upload your edited pictures to Instagram, though even this is annoying as the Instagram app isn't integrated directly in to VSCO. Oh well. That said this is still a great piece of software, and i'm looking forward to watching it improve with time."

The majority of reviews given regarding their older versions are 5 stars but their new updates fail to impress. The whole new concept that they are going for is just tedious to use.

It has great filters (presets) that really enhance your photos & the tools are super helpful for making photos look better overall. BUT recently I had to delete the app and re download it later because I had low storage on my phone & the problem I have is 1 every time u delete the app any photos u had been working on disappear & 2nd (I think more importantly) WHERE HAS THE EXPOSURE FEATURE GONE???? that has always always been the first thing I would change about a photo to make it look better on vsco cam and now it's gone!!

3412,LoopertonJr,"August 23, 2013",4,"Great, but I have suggestions. I really like this app, but I think there has to be a better way to navigate. While the app looks GREAT, but from a navigational stand point, it needs work. The minimalism is great looking, but it's so hard to navigate unless you've mastered the use of this app. Having text boxes at the bottom of icons (perhaps as an option in settings?) would be great.. Also, when you have many packs of filters purchased, scrolling/navigating through all of them to find the one you like slowly becomes a grind. Another suggestion perhaps is a grid on photo cropping, not unlike Camera+ and/or Instagram does. I'd like to stick with one app for all my photo editing needs, but the navigational aspect of this app still needs work, despite it being one of the best looking apps I've used."

Better than the native iPhone camera app, in my opinion, and more thorough photo editing and filter options than things like Instagram. Yet I give it three stars, because getting around the app is an absolute pain. Entering certain areas can cause buttons to disappear, with no explanation of how to get back to where you were. Maybe I'm just dumb or these things were glitches, but I don't think that's the case. It feels like the developers wanted the app to feel edgy and artistic. While they succeeded in creating that effect, basic functionality suffers tremendously as a result. I'm a huge fan of minimalism in UI, but this app takes it way too far. I really want to like it, but the developers need to learn the difference between visual simplicity and functional simplicity."

Why do I need to see the info of the picture once expanded from the grid? Why doesn't double tap zoom in and out? Why is the typography tiny and barely readable? Why does the navigation disappear? What kind of icon is supposed to represent the ""store""? I'm honestly just clicking buttons to find out what they mean.

If I work on an old image, and I come back to my library it always loads to the top. Then I have to scroll through and find my work. Second, tapping at the status bar used to be a universal way to reach the top of an app. Hate to break it to UI devastated everywhere, but minimizing the status bar adds absolutely no meaningful visual information. It just makes accessing useful information more difficult. Third, there needs to be image organization. Everywhere in iOS already has this.

If I can't, that is ridiculous. This app should be able to save photos whether you get your phone repaired or not. I have everything saved on my phone before my phone was repaired and now everything is gone on my VSCO. Not only my photos are gone, but the filters I used are gone. This is really ridiculous.

I'm on iPhone 4S. 1.) The app crashes upon save, crashes after save, crashes everywhere in the store, and crashes just because. 2.) The save function either crashes, freezes, or times out (phone locks, upon unlock the app is closed); when it is ""successful"" in saving the image... 3.) It simply will not apply edits to the saved image...once I save the image (always after several failed attempts), the image that appears in my Camera Roll is the original version - no matter what I try I cannot get the edited version of any photo to save to my Camera Roll or the VSCO Cam roll.

I'm loving the new update for iOS 8, with the manual focus and shutter speed and all that, a feature I've wanted for a long time, but the interface is a little ambiguous and confusing. For example, the icon they chose to use for shutter speed is the aperture symbol. Kinda confusing. Also I can't even tell what the ""exposure compensation"" does. Some of the sliders seem backwards to me, coming from using a DSLR. The shutter speed slider has slower shutter speeds on the right side, and faster ones on the right. That makes sense if you were just thinking in terms of brightness, but it feels backwards if you actually know what's shutter speed is, or if you've shot manual on a DSLR before. These are all just slight issues though, and in general I'm very happy about the new features."

The removal of the flagging feature is a huge loss for photo management and workflow process. It seems oddly arbitrary to remove it, though I'd assume it has to do with syncing and removing flagging made that feature simpler. Unfortunately, it greatly reduces the usefulness of the app for overall photo triage and management."

I've switched to only using VSCO to edit all of my photos because it's simpler--fewer amazing effects is better than a wide variety of mediocre ones. Additionally, I love the VSCO library. It allows me to view my photos all in one place, edit them again, and save them to my camera roll without having to re-upload the image every time.

It's uncomfortable. It's beyond disorganized. Why are photos thrown to the left and then thrown to the right on the feed? Who's idea was that? Why not keep the photos in the squares? IT DOESNT EVEN TELL YOU WHATS EDITED. Unless you filter the photos separately. Why? The filter would be great if I could still have my editing area showing me non edited photos and the symbol showing me what's been edited as well. It took forever to figure out how to find it. Once again it's a mess. It's total chaos. Even the icons for editing to a cheap nose dive. Why? It went from looking professional to looking like a child's toy.

I have two feature requests. 1) I'd like to be able to ""frame"" a picture in such a way that it can be posted to Instagram without being cropped into a square. 2) being able to select a batch of photos and have the same filter applied to them all at the same time would be AMAZING.

As I'm switching from a page I tend to scroll, so with my thumb still on the circle, I move it up and then the camera will pop up. I know that this happens, but if the circle is used to swipe left/right shouldn't it be used to scroll up/down as well? I suggest to get rid of it.

I find myself using a filter that I enjoy but just has an awful blue cast in the shadows or a beautiful picture of trees and the filter just doesn't fit my idea of the tonal contrast and saturation in the greens. I believe this would be a major asset and would make VSCO more competitive with other iPhone photo editing apps. It could possibly get me to delete a few since that's the major feature that makes me go to other apps."
3438,asheywilson5,"April 6, 2017",5,"Glitching ? But i love vsco I've been using vsco for about 4 years and I don't why this keeps happening but the photos that are downloaded onto the app so that I can edit them don't always load and just keeps a white screen as if the picture is still loading, and then if I keep scrolling the screen will suddenly freeze and won't allow me to do anything else unless I refresh the app. I've been wondering if this would go away but it's been happening for about a month and a half. I have a vsco x membership and an iPhone 6 so idk if those are factors that should be included. I love vsco and wish to use it but I haven't been able to use it bc of these problems."
3439,Shayan0,"July 9, 2017",4,"Minimal? I like VSCO. I also like minimalism. However, minimalism (design, in general) is not just about form. It is also about function. There are issues with iconography, navigation and interface in VSCO."
3440,Denann yu,"October 19, 2014",5,"Seriously an amazingly good app for pictures! I had originally downloaded this app a long time ago, but I didn't have a chance to go through it as I would have liked. Then a couple months later I decided to open it up, and I seriously love it. I did purchase some of the filters, they had a special that was $5.99. And being the nerd I am, I thought why not? Best investment ever! Not only does this app allow you to put filters on your pictures there are a lot of other good things like sharpen, and contrast. Which I found can help with making a picture just perfect. If I lost all of the apps on my phone this is one I would probably want to just have."
3441,Tillman7,"June 12, 2016",1,"What did you do? wow... is all I can say. I have never written an app review, you're not lucky to be the first. The most recent update to vsco is the most disappointing update I have ever downloaded for any app. I don't understand why you needed to change something that didn't need to be fixed. I preferred the old grid much better because the all the extra black surface makes it harder to focus on my photos. I feel that is was unnecessary because the company did this so you can look at the whole photo, but all the excess makes it even harder. "
3442,biakku,"June 19, 2016",1,"new update is a pain i miss the square grid because it was much easier to look at than the original crop of the photos and it showed how the instagram feed would look like. the navigation is so confusing because there are no labels for anything. you basically have to memorize how to swipe. the biggest disappointment is the journal. i can't add pictures to the top of my journal feed because the plus sign only shows up if i drag the current top picture to the bottom & hold it which doesn't let me actually press the button to add the picture. when putting two photos side by side, the original crop is used which makes for a sloppy feed. AND it always freezes. literally, this app is nearly useless now. i have to find another app to store my memories in a clean design. i keep it for the filters but even that is a pain to use so i dread it. vscocam, don't fix what isn't broken."
3443,LizzieDaniel333333,"June 22, 2016",1,"new update has ruined the app vscocam used to be my favorite editing app. not only are the filters and effects nice, but the layout in the library was extremely similar to instagrams, therefore you could construct a feed where your photos all looked nice together, or at least just have a layout to experiment with. now I don't know what to do, because not only is the app extremely difficult to navigate, but the library no longer is similar to the layout of Instagram. this is extremely upsetting. now it's going to be difficult for me to post on Instagram, and this makes me sad. so vsco: please PLEASE change the layout back to what it was before. I don't really care if you keep everything else how it is now, the weird dots and confusing setup, but just please change back the library layout. that's the only reason I use your app so if you don't change it back I will be deleting it. thanks"
3444,Kaiileee,"June 28, 2016",3,"Very disappointed First off let me start by saying VSCO was my absolute most favorite app. I always have believed in a well organized Instagram with a collective theme. This app allowed me to create a beautiful canvas for Instagram and share quality pictures with the public. Before the update, VSCO was very easy to use, very easy to discover and overall simple yet exactly what I needed. After the update, the app has become complicated and unorganized. The setup is no longer like Instagram, but instead displays full size pictures. I am very unhappy about this feature. Although the app still works great, the extra features added and the new style is NOT favorable, at all. Please change the way pictures are displayed, as I and so many others can no longer organize our Instagram feed with this app."
3445,PurpleNinjaQueen:),"August 26, 2016",1,"what is this mess I've been using vsco for a pretty long time now and have been through a few updates and have had an account since the day I started editing my photos on the app. I've deleted the app before a bunch of times on the old version when I need storage on my phone and when I download again and log in, all my photos in my library have always been there. This time when I deleted after updating and re downloaded my pictures were all gone even when I logged on. My pubic space is still the same but all the pictures I hadn't posted and just kept in my library on vsco are gone. On top of this, the new update is so confusing to navigate and believe me, I tried. This app was honestly the only one I used for editing photos and I'm so disappointed with it now. Maybe the lost pictures are a glitch or something I don't know but this stinks. App needs to be user friendly again."
3446,FU app store,"September 21, 2016",2,"Disappointing. This was my go-to camera app. To be honest I know I wasn't using VSCO to its full advantage and there have been changes over time that I didn't mind. However this last big update has made this app very confusing and less streamlined. The focusing alone is incredibly frustrating. You used to be able to hold down on the shutter, focus in on what you wanted to focus on, release your finger and it would capture the image exactly how you left it. Now you hold down the shutter button, the lens focuses on what you want, and you release your finger, and nothing! You then have to tap the shutter again to capture the image. That is so annoying!! How am I supposed to focus on some tiny detail and press the button twice?! I know it can be done, but now it takes twice the effort and more often the shot is not what I was intending. Really bummed on this app now."
3447,sabaidk,"December 9, 2016",2,"Stop with the complicated updates! If you all are going to constantly update the app, a tutorial on how to navigate would be useful and NICE. My concerns for this app update - 1) Why is my camera immediately open when I start VSCO? Why do I need to be seeing what my phone sees when I'm just trying to edit a photo? It's creepy and I only want to see my camera when I click on my camera, so removing that feature would be nice. 2) Publishing to collections is weird now and I prefer the smaller pictures on the saved images page because now it's harder to tell what I have and haven't published. 3) when I publish a photo, don't take time to my profile and show me. Let me stay where I am so I can continue publishing more. 4) Tell me what the new buttons mean! Ugh it's simple courtesy to tell people what you've changed when you change it and how to use it. Do better."
3448,TXBzean‚Ñ¢,"December 17, 2016",2,"App Formerly Called VSCO I've been a VSCO user since it was formerly known as VSCO Cam...a handful of years ago. It used to be a terrific app. And although the editing functions and capabilities should still be lauded, the UI of the app has become atrocious and frustrating. Heaven only knows what the VSCO brass has been thinking lately, but they seem to have traded simplicity for complexity and still hoping for mass adoption. I hope they went back to a simple and user friendly interface, allowing users to be able to find menu options easily. I still don't know what they did with the Preferences feature that allowed me to satiate my OCD tendencies by having my filters and my editing tools organized in a very specific way. Get with it VSCO, or I may remove the app from my iPhone and go exclusively with Filmborn...which is already proving to be a substantially better app."
3449,techfall15,"September 6, 2017",5,"Profile Change? I love VSCO it is up there with one of my most frequently used apps. However I'm not a fan of the new set up when you click onto your, or someone else's profile, how it shows all the pictures kind of at once. I like it better when you saw one picture at a time, then scroll to the next because with this, it's hard to look at just one photo and it's also hard not to miss any pictures on the profile because they are all kind of out there in your face. That would be my only critique, everything else is awesome!!!! I hope you get a chance to look at my review and maybe consider going back to the old way? ü§ó"
3450,JHP Guy,"June 9, 2013",5,"Excellent. Finally. iPhone photography has been a frustrating experience for me. On one hand the camera is very capable, but the software side has been very limiting.

3451,hellzajoan,"December 31, 2013",5,"AMAZING! I don't know what the hell everyone is complaining about but this app is hands down the best photo editing app EVER! Makes my photos look even better! All the tools that we need are there, all the simple yet amazing presets are there, no needed for any other options such as borders and textures. Vignette and Grain is great as is! If you want all those extra things then go download another app, leave the hate out of here. "
3452,_kimberli,"September 14, 2014",4,"GREAT, missing... I love VSCO Cam, I have every in-app purchase. However, I'd like to mention that it needs three things. It needs a better cropping tool; one that doesn't ask you for measurements, one that you can crop freely without restrictions. Secondly, it needs the ability to stack presets on top of other presets. So if I want to use M6 and A9, I won't have to save the image and then reload it into my library before applying the second preset. And lastly, the ability to make your own preset. If I click on H6 and then sharpen it, then apply F2 - I want the ability to be able to recreate this with a simple click."
3453,Alex Falk,"December 10, 2015",5,"No complaints, complete photo app VSCO has everything you need in a photo app. First off the editing options are perfect most everyday photographers. It has all the basic features plus more, and if your into filters there are plenty to choose from (actually good ones too)! The part I like the most is there version of social media. VSCO keeps it simple and clean, you just post the photos you want on your grid and bang it's there. "
3454,VLogsWithLouis,"April 11, 2016",3,"Awesome Don't get me wrong the app it self is a 5 stars it's literally the best app right now in the market and would pay to have it! But if it gives you an option to follow our friends it should give you an option to comment, like and look other hastags sorta like Instagram instead of just follow and edit our own pictures otherwise VSCO has such a clean interface it's incredible how people don't even take advantage of this awesome tools! It has so much potential it's sad that they haven't made this app fully competitive with others because in all honestly this would make Instagram, Vine,Snapchat,Phhoto and others look bad so for anyone who is into editing and trying new stuff including a clean interface this app is for you! If you looking for a social  app looks else where"

The filters are beautiful, and there are many awesome adjustment options! I use vsco as a photo journal for my life. I love love love it. The only change I would really wish to see, would be the option to set a date/time to each post. I don't post on vsco while I am at events, but later when I have a moment to. I feel the need to post my photos in chronological order for my journal purposes. It's tedious and then the dates are wrong on the actual post. I wish I could just adjust the dates and it would rearrange my photos accordingly. Either way, I seriously adore this app! Thank you!"

Instagram, snapchat, and now my one favorite picture editing app? it was fine the way it was, now it's ruined completely. I used it also to layout how I wanted my pictures to look on Instagram, now it's so difficult to picture what it would look like!! it's like the people that decided this update was a great idea was on something. it's SERIOUSLY that bad. maybe you should listen to the costumers complaints for once unlike the other companies. take this as an oppurtunity to actually make something better ):"

Change is a good think I think, but this change felt drastic and unnecessary, and the result is less intuitive and, quite honestly, less visually appealing. What's with the navigation circle? Why doesn't it disappear when you're looking at photos?! The old sidebar navigation was nice I thought. "
3458,SteezD Out,"December 12, 2016",3,"Quality of Life It goes without saying I love VSCO. If you love something you want the best for it. I remember when VSCO first started and after a few updates in my opinion it was perfect. The UI looked great and made sense, then it got too edgy and navigation suffered with very vague icons. It's too ""cool"". I think VSCO can improve by making the UI make more sense like it used to, try not to be trendy and want to fit in. Just be the app that got it popular. It's becoming socially superseded by the photo editor foundation which is fine and I guess a component of VSCO however, I feel as if it's losing some of that ""oomf"". I've seen too many updates in the last few weeks which is so aggravating visually. I want the best for this app because I care about it a bunch. I love you guys and the team who built it. Thanks"
3459,Fitfiouy57873,"January 25, 2017",5,"Great! VSCO as a company is filled with amazingly talented and hard working individuals, growing every day. As a result of this, they have produced a solid photo editing mobile app. Refining the app weekly, they lend an ear to what their users are saying and an open mind on ideas to execute. Unlike other photo editing apps, VSCO is not a trimmed down version of their desktop offering, but a compact application that uses its platform intuitively and to their ability. Even without a subscription to their new VSCO X service, you will still find a ridiculous amount of options/controls to still fine tune your photos and share them across various social media platforms."
3460,trafficsounds,"June 15, 2013",3,"overly complicated UI nice filters but despite its minimal design, the UI is too much of a hindrance if you want to be able to snap and edit photos in the moment. the user flow has you tapping too many times just to add a picture into the library, it should be easy as 1. select camera roll and 2. select the picture and up comes the filters. instead you go have to go the library window, hit the + sign, add picture, tap okay, tap into the picture again and then apply filters. then you have to tap the arrow button to bring up the option to save. you don't need all this! minimal design shouldn't sacrifice functionality or hinder the moment you want to capture. in a pinch, when I am looking to edit a photo, it's unlikely this would be the first app I'd go to."

3462,Abbeynh,"February 28, 2016",3,"angry about layout problems really love this app and the simplicity of it and the filters but have been really upset recently about the fact that we are no longer allowed to change the format of our layout. the app redid mine and it is now ugly and has awkward gaps and spacing between the pictures. I emailed the company thinking it was just a glitch but they replied to inform me it was not, and I'd have to stay with the way it is right now. I'm really angry due to the fact that when I look at other accounts they have a pretty single column format that fits pictures kind of like an Instagram layout or they have a double column collage and I have some ugly awkwardly gapped and spaced pictures. it frustrates me that I'm not allowed to change it but others do not have this problem."
3463,Katikiki,"June 9, 2016",5,"Love the new design! I don't understand why so many people have such a problem with change. I have so far only watched the very first teaser promotional video VSCO released and that alone has answered most of the questions and confusion that most of these people are complaining about. Come on people, it isn't THAT hard to figure out. Definitely a huge step in the right direction. The last version of the app was getting way too hard to navigate as it was bogged down by all the new features they were adding. This redesign makes it so much easier. Take longer than five minutes to figure it out and I bet you'll like it too :-)"
3464,Whyvscowhy,"June 28, 2016",1,This update is heartbreaking I've been using vsco since the beginning when legacy filters were the only option. Not only has this been my favorite app it's often my go to for editing professional photos. When vsco started to evolve and add new filters the app just kept getting better and better. Over the years I've been a huge supporter and advocate for vsco. After this current update I've been searching the Internet to find a way to download the previous version so I never have to see this update again and simply pretend that it never happened. I really hope that vsco takes these reviews into consideration and gets back on track with being the leader in photo editing. Ive never written a review before until now because I feel so strongly about this. I'm not sure how long I've got it in me to use this version. I'm days away from searching for a replacement.
3465,eriksawaya,"July 4, 2016",1,"Terrible. Absolutely terrible. VSCO app and filters used to be top on my list of must-haves apps. Being a pro-photographer I loved it.

What is going on and who approved this update? Not only is the interface the worst thing I've seen since uhmm, well never seen anything quite this bad, it's also sluggish on my iPhone 6s and about 7 photos load out of my 150 imgs library. Great. I'm keeping this app on my phone only in the hopes that the next update restores its former glory. Guys and gals, this is a disaster you need to attend to ASAP. I feel so strongly about this, the App Store wouldn't let me post a review because it thought I hadn't purchased the app, kind of a common glitch, so I created a new account just to leave this review!! This needs your attention now!"

It's easy to just open up the app and make pictures look prettier. Well done. However, I've had one issue. I have had this for a little over a month and the controls are still SO CONFUSING! I'm still pressing random buttons until I get the right one. I might just be stupid, but I wish there was a simple ""plus"" button then you could choose to take a photo or upload one, a ""browse"" button so you could look at other's pictures, and a ""profile"" button to view your profile. That's it. Why does it have to be so complicated? Other than that, great app."

Also a teeth whitener should be added so I don't need to turn up my exposer all the way. I use flash in some of my photos so I wish that there were a feature to get rid of red eye.

I really enjoy the social aspect of VSCOcam because it enables me to view other people's photography and get ideas for my own. Whether you are an amateur or a professional photographer, this app is useful and accessible. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt that this deserved one. It's truly amazing and I highly recommend it. In fact, I already recommended it to my photography teacher. It's just that good."

My impression is VSCO Cam is excellent, it has many beautiful filters and vast options for editing a photo. And I was happy to pay $6.99 to buy a limited collection. However, there are two things that I think you guys need to improve on: 1. The UI is confused. I've used the VSCO Cam for months so I know how to use it properly. However, it took weeks for me to get use to the UI. I'm confidence that a lot of people have that same bad experience with the UI. 2. I love The Grid. But it need more social networking features such as follow/comment/like."

The icons are sleek and aesthetic, but not very descriptive. Importing photos is tough, and the social aspect of the app is not great. But in my eyes the photo editing component makes up for it all 110%. The original filters are amazing and there are two free packs for download from the store. The editing tools make up for the lack of manual settings on the iPhone's camera, and then some. I think the app would be much easier to navigate with a name under each button, as well as a series of tutorial videos. Otherwise a 10/10 app that I love to use."

I loved how the old layout was exactly like Instagram so I could preview what my feed would look like and curate my photos ahead of time before posting. Now the layout is horrendous and shows the full size of your photos instead of cropping them into squares, has a ""Collected Photos"" icon in the beginning, which throws everything off, and is now super spaced out. My main reason for using this app, minus the editing, was for curation and now that that's gone I'm very disappointed. I also don't understand the point of the navigation button. It seems like VSCO is trying to make this app less user friendly for no reason. I'm very sad I updated this app as it used to be my favorite and now is just completely frustrating.

I was very skeptical of their new app since the day it launched because they keep implementing new ""improvements"". I like the new layout of the app, but what I really liked the most was the syncing that was the best part because I have multiple devices that has VSCO, being able to sync between multiple devices was the best because I can take a picture with the other one then edit it in another phone. Now, I recently upgraded my phone and a worth of 5 months of pictures and edited for the GODS are now gone forever! I think the auto-sync was one of the best feauture they put in VSCO."

The I PT thing I would change would be the ability, when sharing to Instagram, to be able to share without cropping and posing with black or white borders. Unless I'm missing a step, it would be awesome to not have to share to my camera roll then take it into another app before Instagram just for the shape. Overall, well worth the cost of presets!

But just as I was ready to give it another try I see how unhappy the long time loyal users are with all the disappointing changes that were made to this app in its last update and I'll have to leave it on the back shelf for now. As I've written so many times about other apps..developers need to pay attention to their user base and not feel the need to go in and re-do the app to the point that it's no longer workable or pleasing to its loyal followers. It's a sure way to upset the flow of happy users and hopefully the developers are paying close attention to these negative reviews and are quickly working on replacing the things that loyal users loved the most about the app.
3484,Kmacccccccccc,"November 6, 2015",4,"Great editing, worsening UI I have used vsco cam for many years and love it's editing tools. I do agree with other reviewers that it can be hard to decipher what the icons mean, but once you figure it out everything worked great. "
3485,TO fan56,"December 6, 2015",4,"Awesome! But..... I absolutely adore this app. A little confusing at first, but easy enough to learn. Only two reasons I gave this a four star; first, for some unknown reason that safari could not even help me with, this app sometimes won't load my grid, explore, etc except for my library, and at the same time, I can't publish anything because it tells me that there was an 'error.' I had to delete the app & re-download it, but then all of my library pictures were cleared. I tried everything & that seemed to help it for now. Second, I heard that the old version didn't allow you to see your followers, so I definitely think they should bring that back. I know I'm not the only one!"
3486,Kelly from la,"May 19, 2016",4,"Great! But needs improvements! VSCO is a great app and i prefer it over Instagram because it's encouraged to post many pictures daily of what ever you want! including but not limited to: the sky, food, your friend, a cute snap chat that the saved, and so much more."
3487,Zannrael,"June 21, 2016",1,"Update made it unintuitive, annoying to use This was by far my favorite camera + photo editing app for a long time. But the current version is so unintuitive. The weird circle handle that you're supposed to use to navigate between screens is cumbersome and doesn't always work. When I initially tried to use VSCO after updating, the circle wasn't distinguishable from the content that was showing on my news feed- so I kept scrolling around, unable to leave the current screen. The friends/followers feed doesn't make sense either. It's minimal to the point of frustration- and there's no apparent rhyme or reason for why some images are aligned to the left side of the screen and others to the right. Overall - really disappointing, especially for a user who used to use this app almost daily. I find myself defaulting back to Instagram instead."
3488,KatxWatson,"July 12, 2016",5,"VIDEOS TOO PLEASE!? I'm absolutely in love with this app and I use it for my Instagram theme. But, I strictly only stay in my theme (otherwise I delete it pretty fast). But when I have a video that I wanna share, it won't match obviously. And I was wondering if you could make a feature that you could edit a video with the same features you get with a photo. (And keep the quality of the video.) that would be amazing.  "
3489,mmmsci,"August 17, 2016",2,"Not Intuitive I used to regularly use VSCO cam, but the change to the interface has left the program almost impossible to navigate efficiently and seamlessly. You must perform a series of swiping, clicking, and double clicking just to do simple tasks. Different features of the app are not easy to find and navigating between your public profile, photo library, and feed is not exactly intuitive. Another reviewer commented on the inability to save posted photos from you profile. This would be a helpful, user friendly feature, as would being able to sort edited vs non edited photos in your library as in previous versions. Editing photos on the app is still wonderful, but until the app is user friendly and intuitive again, this review will stay at 2 stars."
3490,boyonabike,"June 8, 2013",3,"Good start This app is off to a good start. Has nice filters and a good level of refinements built in. However, it's still a bit crashy and not super intuitive. Depending on where you leave off in the app, the next time you open it you could get a completely black screen. I thought there was a glitch, but I just had to get out of that screen (which was left over from a precious session). Some of the controls are confusing and hard to get to, requiring you to go pretty deep into the menus. I also like the simple design, but sometimes it is a disadvantage. For example, there are some buttons in the settings that I have no idea what they are there for. The big black dot is one of them. "
3491,Delilah0819,"June 13, 2013",5,"My favorite app! UPDATE: The picture quality issue was resolved in the recent update, which happened very quickly. I LOVE THIS APP! As promised, 5 stars!"
3492,Flayden,"August 2, 2013",4,"Unique, but poor interaction design A unique and hip camera/editing app with wonderful filters. The quality of the edits is amazing with great fine tuning control on each option and filter. Unfortunately there are major usability flaws. Elements that should be easily accessible when editing (like the camera) are buried; sometimes many levels deep. Backing out 4 levels to get a shot off stings a bit. Some icons are confusing, and other important functionality (such as importing a photo) is not immediately apparent without stumbling upon it or watching a tutorial. Visually the app is beautiful... and from the UX side there is much to be desired. Looking forward to future improvements."
3493,TobyRyan,"February 18, 2014",5,"Fading = Great Pictures Everytime What makes this app worth having is the fact that you can take a bunch pictures and not have to worry too much about how they will turn out. A grainy picture can easily be fixed with the fade tool or a decent preset from VSCO. That being said, when you know what you're doing with a camera + having the VSCO tools at your disposal, it makes for some pretty great artistic opportunities and appealing digital photography. I've bought every preset and each one is very unique and editable, unlike most other apps that try to mimic the VSCO stylized tools and enhancements. Absolutely worth getting"
3494,Smitty2333,"January 18, 2015",4,"Favorite phone app but crashes too much on iPad!! I just started using vsco for editing my photos on my iPad mini. First, it won't let me download my limited collection presets! It always crashes when it gets to 28-33 and it is frustrating because I would like to use them! Second, when I try to save my pictures to my camera roll it'll sometimes crash and keeps crashing on that same picture if I try again but will work on others...till it crashes on a different pic then it won't let me save that one either. I love this app so much on my phone and enjoy it on my iPad mini also but wish it would just run smoothly like it does on my phone."

I have the new 6S plus and I have upgraded this app. All functions smoothly and it is as good as ever. I'm not quite sure what the recent negative reviews were all about. Perhaps there were some glitches that have now been ironed out. It was disappointing to see long time users giving such negative feedback on the update without waiting for glitches to be rectified. Thank you VSCO for producing such a high-quality product at such an affordable price. FYI, I was not asked to leave this review. It is of my own volition."
3496,ri_chris,"October 25, 2015",3,"Disappointed Let me start by saying that not only is VSCO my favorite photography app, it's my favorite iPhone app hands down. I love everything about it... The filters, the grid, the simplicity.  With that said, this new update has made the app so slow it's almost unusable. On top of that, the Explore tab (one of the best things about the app) is supposed to be upgraded but it's now so confusing it has become something I don't even use anymore.  They tried to consolidate their curated feed, my feed, and Journal all into one feed.  It's not usable. You can only cram so much functionality into one screen.  I go to the VSCO website to see the pictures on the VSCOGrid now.  They haven't ""upgraded"" that thankfully.  Guys, I love ya, but please... Leave well enough alone."
3497,wolvang,"March 27, 2016",5,"4 years with this app, STILL my #1 app. From the day I first purchased it when I was barely out of middle school, to today, the year I turn 18 and graduate from high school, I've always loved this app. The filters have always amazed me and I've always called this my number one and favorite app for photo editing. With the new update, it does crash every once in a while, but nothing ever gets deleted or anything so it's really not a big deal. Everything else is perfect. Please don't change this app too much as the years go by.. Keep it the way it's always been because I've always loved it the way it was/is today."
3498,Mandy Lake,"June 12, 2016",2,Update is disappointing and confusing I love vsco so much and it's literally my life but this new update has me really fustrated. I don't understand how to use it anymore and there is many features that are no longer there such as searching for un-edited photos and stuff. I really dislike how everything is on two different pages I liked it better when it was all separate. Also making a journal is realty annoying now because it's completely different than before I know I will eventually get used to this update but I prefer it so much better before it was updated. Also that little dot thing to move from one side to the other doesn't work well and is confusing. I hope that things will change and the app will go back to somewhat the way it was before.
3499,Missodessa,"November 14, 2016",2,"No longer user friendly This app used To be wonderful, easy and straight forward to use. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. You've over simplified the app so much it's actually harder to use. The icons are terrible because they don't have a defined look that lets you know what you're clicking. And the bright blue ""new to collection ""  bar looks very out of place I clicked it and couldn't figure out how to get back to my pictures so I could edit I had to close out the app to start over which is frusting. Apps always have a downfall when they change their designs ever update so much it's like a new app just because they're trying to keep up with competing apps this is how you ensure you lose. VSCO was my go to app but these last few updates have really been awful"
3500,jrhustler,"November 14, 2014",2,"4.0 Needs Fixes New update has been quite a disappointment, it's VERY slow and buggy, it's hung numerous times, and after several hours is still ""syncing.""  As for privacy, it's force-syncing all of my pictures to their ""cloud"" storage where previously I was happy to have my images stored on device only."
3501,Beatrice5678,"December 30, 2014",3,"It's a great idea; however, The general idea of this app is great. I love being able to post as many pictures as I want at one time and I love the advanced editing features that are included, but the new updated version is driving me crazy. Although the initial version was difficult to operate, I figured it out eventually. You would think that the new one would be easier, but that is not the case. Every time I go on the app I get confused on where I am and where to find certain things. I like how they are trying to make it modern and futuristic, but to sacrifice that for simplicity is not worth it. In their next update, instead of adding new features, they really should simplify the functionality of their app."
3502,Greencoconut77,"May 25, 2015",4,"Irreplaceable Simple, sophisticated and straightforward. Being an avid iPhoneographer who enjoys taking artsy pictures of nature, random objects and the occasional morning latte, VSCO cam is the only photo app I use. Unlike other photo-editing apps, VSCO cam doesn't include immature stickers and tacky frames. Instead, it offers simple operations like exposure, tint, sharpen, etc. as well as a limited selection of quality filters that is still different enough to provide something for everyone. The results are subtle and not overly-processed. Many professional photographers prefer to use this app when taking pictures on iPhone. The VSCO grid is also fun to look at/play with. Highly recommend."
3503,tttrrriiinnniiitttyyy,"October 21, 2015",4,"Amazing App!! But a little confusing... I really like this app. It has lots of photo editing essentials and I love apps with a minimalistic interface. However, I wish that when you first got the app that something told you what that square or that arrow or that triangle means. I am often caught just pressing buttons when I want to know how to do something. If I were to make a recommendation, it would be to add some sort of tutorial or tip mode that could be adjusted with a switch so that people knew what all of those symbols mean. I primarily learn based off of imaging, and that is hard to do without titles to associate with the symbol so that I'm not just clicking buttons wondering what they do."
3504,valedesmadre,"June 12, 2016",2,"I love it, but I hate it.. I've been using VSCO for a couple of years now. It's such an amazing app and I definitely recommend it to everyone. It's the number one go to app for editing photos and just about everything photography. Although, this new update makes it seem so weird. I hate the way I can barely see my photos before they were displayed nicely and next to each other such as on Instagram. It was great like a little preview. And all these buttons and the way the app is used now makes me wish I had a time machine so I wouldn't have updated. VSCO used to be so simple and I loved it. It was what VSCO stood for and now there's this not so fond design on it and it's hard to use and the yes and no buttons are  like either a filled in circle or not. I'm sorry VSCO BUT PLRASE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION!"

I'm with everyone else when I say I absolutely hate it. Everything about it. It's hard to use, hard to look at, and I'm finding myself trying to figure out how to use it and navigate t all over again. It's horrible!!!! Who decided it'd be a good idea to completely change it? This used to be an app I checked regularly- multiple times a day. Since updating, I can't stand to be on it at all. I really loved this app and I loved it's simple look and feel, and I'm sad to say I just can't use it anymore. Not with the way it is now. I want the old VSCO back and I'm not the only one that wishes for that. Come on guys, change is good....but not like this. I'll find a new app to use if this is how it's going to be."
3506,Anonymous üí≠,"July 4, 2016",1,"Change it back I used to enjoy using VSCO Cam, because the filters were amazing, the design was simple, and the layout out of the photos were perfect for visualizing my Instagram feed. But with the latest big update, everything has been messed up. The layout is completely different, which is the part I hate the most. I think the use of black is excessive and the different shape photos are messy. The change in symbols were unnecessary and are not appreciated. I'm currently on the lookout for another app that provides good filters and editing tools. The money I spent on this app will now be considered wasted. I, as well as many others, will not use this app until it is changed back to it's previous design. I hope you choose to listen to your audience. Maybe you should pay attention to the major decrease in your ratings, too."

3509,Lulutomcat,"August 8, 2017",1,"The free trial is a scam to get your money. First off, the photo editing on this app is sub par at best.  I am not sure why a subscription costs money in the first place.  But I was curious, so I signed up for a free trial.  They don't tell you when you sign up for a free trial that you will have to jump through hoops to cancel.  In my opinion, this is its own scamming art form.  I realized the app really wasn't even as good as the free editing apps and decided to cancel my free trial.  Only to find out that you have to contact apple and go through a whole process with them.  Tried to cancel over 24 hours before my free trial ended, and while I was in contact with apple they charged me anyway.  If their app is so great they wouldn't feel the need to trap you after you start a free trial. This is a disingenuous way of doing business, it is slimy, and a scam.  BEWARE OF THEIR FREE TRIAL."

VSCOcam is a must have if you enjoy editing your photos in the highest quality, most detailed, clean, and bug free way possible. Really enjoying this update, the darker colors make for a more professional look and I'm not the only person, OR APP MAKER, to think this. Even the app, commonly known to Instagram users, Whitagram has just released on update after SO LONG and guess who they decide to copy? If you guessed VSCOcam then you're right! Whitagram copied the interface, how it look when you open the app and even the COLORS! Some may argue that the new design is a copycat one too!"
3512,Murphy355,"November 12, 2015",4,Most Recent Update I'm a big fan of vsco and all the cool pictures people post and seeing all these artistic viewpoints but I'm not a fan of the latest update. I don't like how they feed is laid out where pictures are smaller and placed at random places on the page. and I don't like how it keeps interrupting the feed of people I follow to show me collection updates of things I don't follow. I think a page specifically of pictures and collections I don't follow so I can see them without them interrupting my usual feed would be nice. I use vsco everyday and really love the app and the editing options it gives but the latest layout just isn't working for me at all.
3513,xderiwx,"February 8, 2016",3,"Manual Controls Need Work As always the VSCO filters and editing tools are great. But what I would really love to see is more work on the manual camera controls. Currently it takes way too many taps to get to settings that other manual camera apps have available right in the UI. Maybe the best thing to do would be to design a manual camera UI like one of the others, but have a setting to choose whether that UI or the regular minimal camera UI is shown to you. "
3514,jonathanu,"March 18, 2016",2,"new updates made it worse This review and rating is for the recent update, which makes me want to stop using vsco. Now, instead of displaying the time the photo was actually taken, the app only displays the time it was posted to vsco (more like a social media app instead of focusing on the picture). When viewing photos on anyone's profile, it's awkward (especially for some vertical photos), hard to see information like the filter that was used, and impossible to see a specific location or to scroll sideways from picture to picture without going back to the profile page. Please change these things back to the way they were or at least display the same information and allow the same accessibility to photos."

The new gestures are certainly weird but I would've been able to get over them if it wasn't for the new layout as well. I simply cannot fathom why on earth you thought taking away the square grid would be a good idea when it's a well known fact people use it to preview their grids. Honestly, whoever pioneered this update clearly has zero understanding of their market, OR they've intentionally attempted to sabotage it for who knows what. I just can't imagine anyone possibly thinking this could ever be an improvement. Your filters have always been great, but please VSCO, bring back the grid or you risk losing many customers to any competitor who may pop up to fill this void you've just created. Very very disappointed and immediately turned off from you after 2 loyal years."

I really love this app but it can be confusing at times. Over all this app is one of the best in my opinion and going ""old fashioned"" would be an improvement. Also as a suggestion I think it would be really cool if you added folders for feeds."

The VSCO team time and time again proves that they're all about adding great new features to an already essential app, however I must warn fellow VSCO cam users to proceed with caution before updating to this version if they use the flag feature. I rely heavily on the flag feature in my workflow, however, it seems the flag option has been removed in this update without warning. A simple heads up in the update notes would have sufficed. Now I'm stuck with an upgraded library without any of the strategic flags I had previously added. This hurts my workflow and will take some time to find a workaround."

I've honestly been looking for photo apps that'll give my pictures my own sense of taste by adjusting and fixing them up and this app definitely does it all. It's amazing how you guys finally added the perspective tool, which of course helps in so many ways, as well as, the clarity tool to give more detail to my photos. Can't wait for more filters to be accessible later down the road too, especially since most of your filters are always on point. :]! Thanks VSCO"

There are so many filters to choose from, and I LOVE how in the shop section you can download some extras for free and buy more if you'd like. I usually pick my filter first under the paintbrush tab and then switch to the wrench tab to up the saturation, brightness, temperature or any other little details I want to change. VSCO is easy to use, helps you to edit your photos beautifully, and is so much fun to have your own little photo website. 5 stars all the way!"
3525,adddaniel,"January 16, 2016",5,"Beautiful. Functional. Feature-rich. Honestly, completely bewildered this app is free. It is as minimalist and beautiful an interface as I've seen in app lately, and it can have a tendency to be a bit esoteric, once you learn the layout it is actually rather intuitive. The preset brushes are often great starting points for photos and the editing tools available give your photos just the right amount of adjustment without being over the top and agressive. Also, fully manual camera setting are accessible as well. This is the best photo editing / camera app around, download it."
3526,emhheals,"June 9, 2016",3,"The new update is interesting Firstly -- it's easily time VSCO got an update. The old version was slow and not smooth. Now, I feel like the app is definitely more chic and ascetically pleasing. However, I don't understand the need for the big white bar above the photos that have been edited. It's ugly and unnecessary. The photos are also a lot smaller, too. Also, I really dislike the large, awkward, white space between photos on 'my profile'. About a year ago, there was the ability to enlarge your photos so that they fit together, and didn't leave so much extra space between pictures. Now, the photos are difficult to view, and the whole setup looks weird on the iPhone. Otherwise, good update!"
3527,AvinashC,"June 22, 2016",1,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED I never write reviews. Ever. But the recent update seems to give me no choice but to share my extreme discontent, and I'm sure many other users can vouch for me on this as well. Although the purpose of the update was to make VSCO more modern and simplistic, I think it's become the opposite. The new layout and functions are so confusing & not appealing at all. My biggest concern is the new layout of how the pictures are shown in the picture library. While the original square grid layout was very easy, simple and especially convenient because of the similar layout to pictures on Instagram, the layout in the new update feels so complicated when you're used to using an app that was so easy and simple. The new layout's smaller pictures make everything harder & seemingly more complex than necessary. The whole update in general is just, as I stated before, flat out the opposite of appealing. Let me add in that prior to the update the app had about 5 stars, & now it has a meager 1.6 stars. Just goes to show how many other people are discontented as well, and it's also clear to see while scrolling through the reviews. "
3528,adamapple10,"September 4, 2016",2,"Yawn Still not enjoyable to use following the new UI update. I understand that things need to grow & evolve but VSCO has been particularly annoying this past year. I feel like they're trying to be something they're not, at the end of the day I don't care to be apart of some ""cool kid community"" nor do I have interest in taking selfies with a Disclosure-rip filter. Actually the camera feature is pointless overall, IMO. I find it funny they took away the sync option because that was one of the few things that people still liked. I'm not surprised though, they're investment backed and have to please their higher ups now. It's not about the consumer anymore, we just have to put up with what they're dishing out now, which apparently is a Luke warm photo editing app."

There's no liking to worry about or hate because it's and open and excepting social media. Also there are so many great filters and editing tools, though I do wish more of the filters are free (but I still bought them because it's worth it.) Also the app has had technical difficulties very often where you won't be able to use it for a day or two which is inconvenient but they manage to get it up and running right away."
3530,Vpbaker,"June 7, 2013",5,"Re-rate Woohoo! Left a review earlier mentioning how I was having an issue with the app crashing when I launches the in-app store, but this issue seems to be resolved.

The new filters are beautiful and you have a lot more control than with the original VSCO app, which is helpful in photos with different exposure and color schemes. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this app, as it stands, it's my favorite photo editing app. Also love that I was able to keeps old version while I dip my feet in the update and learn all the features."

I could spend ours tweaking to my hearts desire or simply choose a gorgeous filter and be done. "

It is such a different, creative experience than all the other social media apps. It has a better appreciation for art and the making of if it through a simple camera lens. However, I would like to see who follows me when others follow my grid so I know who is viewing my pictures. It would be extremely helpful and expose those to even more personal creativity of others. Totally reccommend if you are bored with the everyday social media and appreciate some good editing!"
3536,Abcdegjail,"June 1, 2016",5,"More Layout Options? Well first off, I love vsco and I use it often. In an updated version maybe we could be able to pick from a few layout options. For example, on tumblr you can customize your profile with one of many different layouts. That way you won't have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and view pictures page after page. It would also be nice to be able to upload a video that has already been taken and saved on your phone. I love this app! But improvements would be nice :)"

I'm supremely disappointed in the most recent update. The layout for my image feed looks awful and it's hard to navigate the app at all now. I've been using this app for years and now I can't find anything. Nothing is easy access anymore. I can't even find the curated grid. I used to feel like part of a greater community but now I feel isolated. I have found my app usage has gone down significantly since the most recent update because it's just frustrating to try and use now. I really hope they get back on track because I really feel like the VSCO peeps are missing something. üò•"

I still have the old update on my iPad (thank god I doüò≠) bc if I didn't, I wouldn't even be using vsco to this day. however, I want to use vsco on my phone, but I'm probably not even gonna use it bc it's mad complicated now (compared to before, mind you) and it's just really disappointed bc it went from a really great app to downhill.

I used to be able to sync. Man this App used to be the ideal app on my iPhone to edit...now I am just weary of what is coming up next.  Please bring back the older interface. Some updates are great! Like fixing bugs and just optimizing performance. I would have loved to ultimately get the presets for Lightroom and have my work on my phone sync with my desktop but how I am not sure if that will ever happen. I am still loyal but I am sad with the direction. It's frustrating and disappointing. I invested money into the presets but now it's seems like the app has taken major steps back for nonsense. Nothing makes sense anymore.
3540,WesterlyWandering,"September 29, 2013",1,"Not for iPhone 4 If you have anything but iPhone 5... you'll be left high and dry with this app. vsco cam's own website acknowledges that some features were only designed to work for 5s - that's pretty lame, if you ask me. Then there's a whole bunch of other issues that seem to be common to the app loaded on 4s and 3s... I downloaded and deleted it multiple times on my iphone 4, and I consistently get all kinds of different problems - crashing, slow loading, really slow processing and saving, low storage warning no matter how much space my phone has, freaks out when other apps are also open, and doesn't load all the presets ...ever. I'd love to change those stars to five, there's a lot if potential here, but since it's ""optimized"" for 5 users, I'm afraid nothing will change for us ""lesser"" users."

I use VSCO Cam all the time, I bought the presets and am looking forward to buy more. Photography is a hobby for me, well, specially for teens (sorry folks 20+). It's the main photography app that I use besides afterlight. What I notice is that ""big update"" mimics the ""parallax"" of IOS 8. For some, it's quite neat, for me? Not so much. The app is way slower when you're trying to edit a picture. Is there anyway you can turn off this ""parallax"" mode thing that's going on? A little disappointed although I like the new UI but I wouldn't trade anything for the old VSCO Cam before this update. "

Most of them are pretty varied and add a nice touch to one's photos. This is the sole app that I use to edit all of my photos taken on my 6+. There are a few bugs I've noticed, like trying to save panoramic photos taken on the camera. The app acts as if it's saving the photo, and then will crash after 10 seconds. There are also subtle vertical lines going through certain photos, and it makes them look absolutely horrible when posted anywhere. Other than that, highly recommend this app for anyone looking for an editor."

I have loved VSCO and have been using it to edit my photos for years, but the last couple of updates have made me question whether or not it's worth keeping on my phone. It's always freezing on me, not letting me click or view anything, so I have to exit the app and restart it. Also, the new grid format/display looks messy and I just really hate it.  One other thing is that because I hate the new grid, I look at pictures (mine and those I follow) by clicking the picture and swiping left or right. This function doesn't even work correctly! It crops the pictures differently than they were posted and makes them pixelated. The newest updates have completely ruined my user experience. Please please please bring the old version back!!!!!"

I use it for arranging my photos so I can see what my feed would look like before posting on Instagram. The only problem I have is not being able to arrange the photos. It would make my life so much easier if I could just click and drag the photo to another spot if I change my mind, instead having to delete that photo and all the other photos after it and post them again just so I can move that photo to a different spot. Also if you could add blurring and whitening to the editing options that would be amazing so I wouldn't have to switch between 3 apps just to edit one photo. Other than that I love this app so much!!"

Upon reading reviews I became skeptical due to this new update everyone has been hating on. I decided since I didn't know the old design how could I be upset about the changes right? Oh my god. Never have I seen a more difficult, vague editing app to navigate. Nothing is labeled. What is with that circle that we are supposed to assume is a confirmation? It feels so weird. I also hate the fact that you can't see what the changes you've made look like compared to the original. After about 15min of really frustrating attempts to edit and understand I closed it and uninstalled. "

When I upload a picture, it changes whatever I load to fit a size that the original picture is not, making them look either stretched or squished. When I try to flip the picture to match it with the way the app is squishing it, the same thing happens. The same thing happens when I save a picture to my camera roll that I've edited, or share it to a social media site."

But, the app takes up soooo much space. They have no form of ""cloud"" so all the images are stored in full on your phone. Also, because they have no cloud, you can't partially edit an image on your phone then pick it up on your iPad and finish there because you can see the little details better. And, because there's no cloud, you can't clear the local cache to free up space. I'm pretty sure VSCO used to have some sort of cloud, and if they did then they really need to bring it back!!!"

I love that the old filters were made available to users of the previous app, but I have a few newfound favorites throughout the new bundle pack as well. Good job VSCO! Only changes I would prefer is to add more cropping options and to be able to add the borders and such, as in afterlight. When I do my editing in VSCOcam I move to afterlight solely to add the border so that I can upload to Instagram without cropping to a square."

I could never get solid photos out of any camera app (not even the native app) and all of the editing apps took either far too long to edit a single photo (Pixlromatic) or were limited to overused generic look and feel (Instagram).  With this app, I get good, clean pics and an editor with presets AND/OR manual adjustments.  I splurged and bought the Launch Bundle and love all of the options.  Love this app.  My go to app for photos...which is pretty much all I do now with my phone."

Recently I have found myself pleasantly surprised by viewing dozens of beautiful images that have come out of this app. I re downloaded it and was truly impressed. For the most part I think this app is perfect. Aside from me having a 4s and am limited to being able to sharpen my images or use a grain, I would really love to see a new tool for darkening shadows. I also think it may be pretty cool to add some film-esq filters if say one wanted to create a film-inspired image. I must also add that I wish that I could layer filters. Cheers."

But I get annoyed every time I make edits to my photos with this app because it automatically resizes large photos. I would very much like to keep the quality of my photos as high as possible, so please make this app to NOT resize photos. Also, I think this app could get so much better if it changes the sliders to move in smaller increments like the ones used in Photoshop Express App. Since it is not possible to fine tune my photos using only the VSCO Cam (because of the sliders), I have to use other apps additionally afterwards :( Love this app so hope it to get better in the near future."

I'd love it if there was a way to see who is following me because it's crazy that I have no idea! The number could stay private to all other users but I feel like the individual him/herself should be able to know! If that could be included in a future update, VSCO cam would be absolutely flawless!"
3556,Disappointed 36,"June 29, 2016",1,"Trying to be something it's not It seems like the new VSCO update is more about trying to compete with other socially-focused photo apps (Instagram, Snap Chat) without a clear understanding of what set them apart (the emphasis on high quality pics and photo editing). Moreover, the new UI puts in default features like selfie ""monsters"" (that a support staff called ""fun, like snap chat"") that no other app would make a default. Plus, they look more like an editing tool than something you would want on a photo and can't be removed. (For me, it ended in ruined post engagement selfies since they provided no warning about how the new interface worked.) My guess is they're looking to monetize and following a one fits all model of social.... too bad I have two social photo apps that do that way, way better."
3557,acidicrin,"July 1, 2016",1,"Won't be using as much Vsco was already complicated for me in the beginning and I finally got use to it. Then they update the app and the layout looks really bad. You use to be able to see how your photos would look like in a theme. Honestly this app downgraded. The changes that were made weren't really necessary and it's just fancy for no reason. You come to edit a photo, see how it looks like for your Instagram theme and leave or post it on your Vsco account. Now you gotta relearn everything. Stick to what you had for years instead of making drastic changes. There was no transitioning whatsoever. To make a long story short Vsco is complicated of you've gotten use to using the older version. Its still great fit editing but because of the change I just won't be using it as much."
3558,meeperpark,"August 11, 2016",3,"Summer 2016 update ruined a good thing I've used VSCOCAM exclusively for years and used it so often that I've moved its icon to the bottom of the screen. But this updated version makes me unhappy. The new interface is baffling. It's no longer clear how to switch between camera mode and my saved images. I kept winding up in my VSCO portfolio instead. What does the circle with horizontal lines mean? What is the face mode for? Why did all the text in menus get microscopic? Good design does more than look cool, it improves function and makes things easier for the user. You don't notice  design when it works, but when it doesn't, it's frustrating. I don't need a counterintuitive camera app."

Definitely my go to camera App. I would really like to see some border options added specifically for Instagram. Reason being is Instagram crops your photos once you pull it over...so I've been shooting and editing in VSCOcam, then exporting to camera roll, importing to Afterlight to add a border and finally then exporting to Instagram. Thanks for making such a clean photography App, I look forward to seeing the changes that come."

For example, I arrange it to go with my feed on Instagram and I dislike the fact that I have to delete all the pictures in order to insert a picture where I think it looks best. Also I think an added feature would be folders like in camera roll so that u could edit pictures and leave them there AND set up a feed, at the same time, in library. Recommend 10/10 for editing 5/10 for arranging for feeds. Thank you"
3563,switchmama,"June 10, 2016",2,"A little Disappointing This new update has me very disappointed. Only because of the new format. I loved the old one because I was able to preview what my instagram feed would look like, and this app was basically where I put it all together with filters and editing. But now it's just hard since the pics are all separated differently & I feel that the simple, original format was better. Now it seems like way too much when really it didn't need to be over-done this way. It's as if Vsco is trying to look just like other apps. I am really hoping they change it back to the original setup because it pretty much messed up my whole process on the app and basically my one main use for it."

It is NOT user friendly, I do not get the weird button on the bottom, it hard to navigate, I hate the fact that my photos look smaller. It's just wrong all throughout. I really hope they read all of these reviews and go back to the previous VSCO cam. What a disappointment. Currently looking for a similar app because I just hate everything about the new update.

I would've recommended the old VSCO cam, but to users reading this I wouldn't even bother downloading the app now do to this new cruddy design.

Now when i updated it its very complicated to move around the app. Theres always a stupid random circle at the bottom and i didnt understand any of the button and there wasnt many options in the app. I couldnt find the settings.

It's a little confusing when you first get the app when it comes to navigating around so my only suggestions are making the app more simple and being able to edit the filters and such on already uploaded pictures rather than having to remove the pictures from the account and re-uploading them. Either way everyone needs this app immediately!!!!!!

I do also have too say it's a bit confusing, maybe add a walk through or something simple too explain.

I had to close the app just to leave that option, which is quite a disappointment :( Then I tried to add my friend (ig: lukewilson) and he popped up, but when I came to click it, there was nothing but a blank canvas.

That's one of the reasons why I haven't really bought any other filters. Also, when ""straightening"", you can't move the crop up or down which is kind of annoying, it just stays in the center.

The entire layout of the app is now terrible; nearly impossible to use or enjoy.  Whoever created this must have been completely obsessed with circles, as everything is now circles for literally NO REASON.  WHOEVER DESIGNED THE NEW UPDATE SHOULD BE FIRED.  It's truly sad to see something like this disgrace ruining what used to be an amazing app.  It seems like Vsco is more concerned with the aesthetics of the app, rather than its users and the function of it.

The actual photo editing interface is basically the same as the old version, however all of the icons for sharpen, contrast, temperature, etc. have a new look, so it took me a second to figure out which was which. Also, the app brought up all kinds of old photos that I thought I had deleted off of the app a long time ago, not sure what that's about, but it's pretty annoying since that takes up a lot of space on my phone.

I have tried everything that would have to do with the device and at this point I am sure it is a problem with the app itslef.

Please go back to the way it was before where we had the option to choose how we wanted to see our grid. I miss seeing my grid in a one image at a time format and will probably stop posting because of this update. And please keep follower information private, it is the one thing that makes VSCO Cam unique."
3583,Minnie400,"October 14, 2015",2,"Love VSCO but hate the update!!! I absolutely love this app but I hate how the new update made my feed look. I can't even see the pictures they are so zoomed out and they are completely random laid out on the screen. Please bring back the old style of looking through the feeds or at least an option. Also, I liked the way you could choose how big to look at your profile and now there is only one option for viewing your pictures. I didn't see an issue with being able to change the size of how your grid or someone else's could look and it was very convenient. Me and all of my friends who use this app miss this feature and would ask that you consider bringing it back."

3586,JacobG08,"August 2, 2016",2,"Great Editing Features, Very Poor Interface I love the way VSCO makes my photos look. The edited features are robust and the filters are very easy to use and high-quality. The editing features are too-notch. "
3587,Pissedoffusersincejaywastaken,"November 24, 2016",5,I love manual features of the camera but! as a word of advice. You can't keep drastically changing the way the app works. It's a camera app that people need to be able to get used to and navigate quickly to capture images well. I just recently got use to the gesture controls and now the whole thing is new and different with completely different controls. Also the dark background was less distracting when viewing my images especially worse now with the active camera open above my gallery.
3588,Em_Seabones,"December 6, 2016",3,"The most recent update is meh. Please please please put collections back to what they were before (or something similar). Collections are now extremely hard to navigate. I have several saved pictures I haven't published yet, and it's so much harder to publish them on at a time instead of all at once. Additionally, every time I publish an image to my collection from my saved photos, it automatically refreshes the page, making it very difficult to publish more than one photo. I've had your app for years and I trust you all, I just wanted to let you know that the new update (for collections) seems like regression rather than progress."
3589,Ian in Mexico,"February 17, 2017",2,"Not so good I have both versions iPad and iPhone, in neither of them there is a way to zoom in an image while editing it. What is even worse is that when an image shot in landscape mode is viewed to be edited it is soooo small especially on an iPhone but also on the iPad, that it's nearly impossible to see what I'm editing. And because the app does not allow neither devise to adjust after I rotate the device there is no way around to make a landscape image fit the screen size. The rest of the screen is bright white and it really blind your eyes while editing. Terrible ! I have spent so much money buying filters from your store, they are great, but the interface is not there . What's the point?"
3590,chrisdpratt,"August 30, 2013",2,"Mass Hysteria? Tried this app because it was practically being hailed as the second coming, but I can't for the life of me figure out why. The filters are limited and honestly not very interesting. There's no fine grain adjustments available; you just get steps of +/-6. The kicker though is the UI is *terrible*. Like really, really bad. They went with the flat look, which is fine, but they paid no attention to actual usability. Many icons make no sense. It's difficult to figure out where to go. I often found myself accidentally canceling my changes instead of applying, etc."

The app is pure gold and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Ask anybody, it's all I talk about and I love to show people! Wonderful job!

I don't know if it was an update or what, but the smooth and user-friendly experience, has become frustrating. It keeps telling me low-storage and to delete photos. I deleted most photos and even some on my phone for fear of running out of memory, still it flashes the same warning. Also, ghost photos were part of my library. I'd delete and make room, but a shaded square would exist in place making it look as if photos were lagging to load. I deleted the app to see if it would fix things, which has not only gotten rid of my small library, but now I can't redownload the bundle and it just isn't working. I paid for the bundle and now feel like I'm getting screwed. Fix it PLEASE."

Those are two bold statements, and two true statements. The one, and only, problem with the newest release is that the editing sliders, adjusting fade, sharpening, etc. is not sensitive enough. It makes the app harder to use, and was never a problem in previous versions. I hope they fix it. Otherwise I highly recommend it. I own all of the preset bundles and would honesty say all of them are worth owning."

I selected it and then go back to screen for photo but the photo is not in my camera roll and then check preferences again and what do you know!? It's not selected. I've tried numerous things and troubleshooting with VSCO but they are unable to recreate the problem. In the meantime I cannot roll back to previous update and all my photos from vacation were duplicated! Some were in vsco made it to the library and others didn't. I had to manually import and still ended with duplicates. What a mess! Hopefully vsco can rectify soon."
3595,Annarborcrazy17,"November 1, 2015",2,"Horrible update I really love this app, but there are a few things about the update that ruined it a lot. When you go to your grid there are now random images that vsco puts on in the middle of people who you are actually following. And you can't make this go away because you can't unfollow vsco...they just made everyone follow them and it's annoying. I don't care about seeing random peoples I just want to see my friends and other people I follow. Also the fact that the grid is so disorganized and pictures are randomly placed on one side or another is awful, don't know why they can't go back to how it used to look. Hope they take this into consideration because it's just annoying now"
3596,Creative otter,"June 13, 2016",1,"Terrible terrible update This new update is a complete disaster. I wish with all my heart that it would go back to the old VSCO. this isn't like when Instagram changed their logo and color scheme. This is a completely different product now. It feels forced too. Like trying to change something just to change something. Just to get some press. The interface is terrible. The design is terrible. It's not user friendly or intuitive at all. I've been using VSCO for years and it's held a special place in my heart. But now, I cannot recommend it to anyone. I'm trying to hold off on deleting the app in hopes that the VSCO team will listen to these complaints, look past their pride, and revert to the older version. Please just give us back the VSCO we know and love. Thanks."

I would edit my photos, use it to plan out my Instagram feed, and occasionally post on the VSCO social thing. Now I'm DELETING this app. I don't edit my photos anymore (going for a more natural look) and I don't see a point in uploading to their social thing so the only point was to adjust brightness/contrast and plan out my Instagram feed. The new update is leaps and bounds backwards and I refuse to use a software who's only focus is to be more competitive with already established apps. There's a point where you're bettering yourself and a point where you're frustrating and abandoning the niche we loved. Bye VSCO let me know when you've reconciled your mortal flaws."

Now with refinement and unification across all platforms VSCO has returned. The last update was great in bringing the power of VSCOX to iPad Pro! Now I have a complete work flow shooting with any camera I  own in raw format, importing to my iPad Pro, editing as I please and finishing in VSCO... a little more can be done with importing from any other app in raw formats. I am sure this will be updated... Great work VSCO team! ... now only if VSCOX included the old sync üòâ"

BUT I wish vsco allowed you to make your account private. Like on Instagram if someone is private you have to request to see there photos. Because some people's vsco pages are personal, and when anyone can see what they post, it kinda holds them back from posting what they want. I love this app so much, but I wish they gave you the option to have a private account:)"
3600,gubblebum33,"June 6, 2013",2,"Problems on iPhone 4 I have an iPhone 4. When I opened my new VSCO Cam app for the first time, there were no presets or tools in it. Then I bought a preset pack. The purchased pack works, but the preset thumbnails don't show up properly and I still don't have any tools. I know 4s's and below wont be able to use grain or sharpening with this app, but surely there are some tools that should be showing up that aren't. In addition to that, when I set up my profile and added my name, it never notified me that my changes were saved. Weird little things like that keep happening. I hope these problems are fixed soon because I really want to be able to use this amazing app to it's full potential."
3601,dustin fuchtman,"June 12, 2013",5,"My Favorite Photo App Simply stated, this app is amazing. The camera on the app is very well thought out, I can select my exposure as well as my focus, I can leave the flash on to give a constant light on my subject. The filters are better than any app I've ever used, I can get the look of anything from Portra to Tri-X to Polaroid instant film, from there I can even make further adjustments, I can create a totally unique image. I have all of VSCO's Lightroom presets as well, and this app is even easier to use, while maintaining a very large amount of editing power."

One thing that would be really cool would be if when you look at your library with three pictures across, you could swap pictures around. Like grab the picture somehow and swap it into another position without having to delete all these other pictures. It would make it really helpful as it is quite frustrating when I want to move a picture somewhere else and am forced to delete all the pictures before it :( !"

I would love to be able to have the option to purchase an individual filter/preset without the whole package. I really only use 2 of my filters regularly, but I have my eye on one in the shop that I know that I would use, IF i didn't have to pay $7 to get 15 others Im not interested in at the moment. If I were to have the option to choose the package or just the individual filter, I would personally purchase more filters. Just a tip and request! Thanks and Great work so far!"
3605,tjanae7,"June 10, 2016",5,"BY FAR THE BEST Hi, I'd like to request something. I'm in LOVE with this editing app. I use it to edit EVERY picture I take. I've had it for 3 years now. I've begun a theme on my Instagram (tarynjphillips) using VSCO's C1 filter. I love it! BUT I can't post videos :( because they won't have the same ""theme"" look as my other images. If you create a *video editing app* that'd be amazing. OR add video editing to the current app. PLEASE CONSIDER. The filter C1 is hard to find on any video editing apps, then again, there really are none. So it'd be AMAZING if you could consider adding *video editing*!!!"
3606,AndroidUsingPerson,"July 2, 2016",1,"Does VSCO even listen? 90% of these reviews are telling VSCO to change back to the square layout. I guess y'all just wanted to see if this would be better for the users of VSCO, but frankly, we aren't enjoying it as much as y'all intended us to. It's cool that we can see the full picture now, BUT it was EVEN BETTER that we could arrange our photos in VSCO before posting them to Instagram in order to get a feel on how our feed would look like. Honestly, this was the main reason why VSCOcam was so popular. Don't get me wrong, the filters are great but the square layout was everythinggggg. BRING IT BACK. We don't ask for much. We just want the square layout and for the app to be functioning(no constant crashing). None of that extra ""upgrading"" the feed layout is necessary."
3607,Makahhh,"July 28, 2016",3,"New updates make useful app hard to use I had a great time using these filters to mobile edit photos from the phone. However the latest update has tried to push their ""community"" into your face. This update gives the community feed ultimately 50% of major space; not a huge problem as I love this feed of high quality images. However to app overall has gained an incredible amount of clunkiness  and an aura of difficulty in its use. For an app that is supposed to be about editing photos and looking for inspiration...they seem to go way out of their way to make both those things difficult to do."
3608,Gwen321,"August 7, 2016",3,Don't like new update :( So this app has always been great to be able to compare/see what my Instagram feed will look like with all my photos next to each other. So basically before posting my picture on Instagram I will see how it (and the edit) looks next to the rest of my photos. But with this new update it has a black gap/space in between each photo so it makes it hard to be able to tell what will go with my feed...also it's really confusing to figure out how to work everything. I mainly use the app just for editing though. Please change it back!! Also make the background white like Instagram does!
3609,Katelynn.R.,"June 22, 2017",1,"Money Hungry Idiots I used this app for four years of m photography career. I fell in love with it's easy to use program and how high quality each feature appeared. I became a national award winning photographer using these presets, and they completely screwed me over. They now expect me to pay almost 10x(I purchased each package for less than 2$, now they charge 19$)more YEARLY for presets I already purchased. Not to mention the membership does literally nothing other than throw in a small group of filters to what I already owned. After being loyal to this app for so long, I am beyond hurt that they have chosen this path. I will be taking my work elsewhere to be edited from now on. Cannot believe you guys would do something so stupid and rude to your customers.."

3611,Ekghugrow,"August 8, 2013",3,"Great app with big flaws On the whole, this is the best mobile photography app out there. Amazing control over absolutely beautiful presets, and a good toolkit. VSCO Grid isn't too shabby either (at all). The big downsides though, are these: difficult navigation when buying in the in-app store (I bought the original preset pack, but in the process nearly accidentally bought it about 5 times over), still some freezing and crashing issues, and the lack of vignette, grain, and sharpen for the iPhone 4/iPod Touch 4. I suppose these are just regular complaints with any app, but it would be nice if companies didn't treat 4th gen owners as second-class citizens."
3612,iRobDawg,"December 27, 2013",3,"ok From an amateur/hobbyist's perspective, i had high hopes based on app description and reviews. i used an iphone 5 and tested various distances and lighting conditions. IMHO‚Ä¶i much prefer camera +. it's the best all in one (shoot, edit and share) and user friendly app. primary shoot functions (exposure, WB, focus, zoom) are easily accessible and adjustable via touch-screen. it has great practical editing features. the photo and low light quality are awesome. low light results are even better than night cap. VSCO and pro cam weren't as user-friendly and picture quality was not very good/grainy. it was hard to and I gave up trying to ""fix"" the pictures."
3613,Minnonikki,"February 25, 2014",4,"So close to absolute perfection... One downside. The filters are absolutely amazing. I love this app, and I'm totally addicted. However, why isn't there the ability to like people's pictures? Or comment on them? I really feel like that would just make the app completely perfect. I mean, I can't even see how many people, let alone WHO is following me. I never know who likes to see my pictures, or what anybody thinks about them. It would be so nice to have that, and have the ability to make friends with people who have the same taste in pictures. Please take this into consideration, app people! :)"
3614,ashpaisea94,"September 23, 2014",5,"All time favorite app I use this app for absolutely every picture I take. The live camera with adjustable white balance is so helpful. Then I have the option to make basic adjustments like cropping, straightening, exposure and contrast. And then there is the filters. If you get tired of the ones you have the store has many many more you can download or purchase. And last but not least, the app itself saves the pictures you edit, and you can create a profile and upload your own there."
3615,dprezzz,"February 8, 2015",2,"Filters are good, but the UI is terrible The UI is oversimplified to an extent that it is hard to use. Do yourself a favour and purchase Camera+ rather. I am so sick of developers who think that implementing filters used by professional photographers are the way to go in a digital world. I think customizable basic image setting will do the job. Just as useless as the built in filters in the Camera App. This is not a professional camera and never will be, don't try to make it to be. My opinion is to stay away from VSCO. for some reason Apple hired a professional to shoot some great photos and display it the Apple Stores..well that photographer probably could have done it with an iphone 3g camera as well."
3616,utterlyflowerly,"June 9, 2016",3,"its alright, really. I don't usually write reviews, but for VSCO I'm making an exception after this recent update.

3617,Jennyeatworld,"June 10, 2016",1,"Bad UI update VSCO is one of my most used photo apps as well as apps in general. This new update made things more confusing and more of an eye sore. I liked the minimal look of the previous version. It made it easier to look at your photos and it didn't have a bunch of colors competing for attention. Now there a big blue rectangle on top asking me to sign in or sign up for an account so I can share my VSCO photos. If I wanted another platform to share photos, I'd sign up for it on my own. I use this app to edit, I don't want to sign up for anything. I've always been a big fan of dark/ night themes with a black background, but I just don't think it's a good fit here. The circle in the middle is confusing and figuring out which way to scroll. Wish I didn't update."
3618,Sapphire a,"January 29, 2017",1,Was good until this update >:( I really enjoyed vsco and its a great concept but this update made my all of my pictures repeat a bunch of times and put pictures on my feed that I deleted a long time ago or didn't want posted. I tried deleting the pictures but after I refreshed the page there were ALOT more that showed up and I'm not about to waste two hours deleting the ones I don't want. Then I deleted the app and redownloaded it to see if that would help and it ended up deleting all my pictures in the editing section and now I can't even see the pictures on my feed because it just says server error? Like everyone else I'm really frustrated and vsco should just go back to its old version because this update is terrible.

It's a fantastic hobby to have and this is clearly a fantastic app. I love all the tools that are provided and the presents are each unique in their own way.

3623,MatthiasIam,"November 15, 2015",2,"Confusing as hell Seriously fantastic presets, but the app they reside in is incredibly confusing. Why did they not stick to Apples standard design format. They've got buttons that literally mean nothing to the user, circles with dots? Squares with slashes? No idea what these mean so you have to test out every button on the app until you figure it out. It's like learning how to use a new phone. Not only that, you can't sign in even where it says ""sign in"" you can only create a new account, then have to delete the app to reset it if you want to sign out. "

The black borders around the photos look tacky and not in line with the minimalistic feel the app has always gone for. The layout is confusing and just all around frustrating. I liked being able to preview what my Instagram pictures will look like side by side, and this update makes that a lot harder to get a good feel for that. I truly hope the creators of VSCO revert it back to the old version!"
3626,Lover of Monograms!,"June 14, 2016",3,"Update is Confusing Don't get me wrong, I'm obsessed with the filters on VSCO. However, I strongly dislike the new update for many reasons. First of all, the creators need to make it more user friendly. The update is very confusing a takes time to learn. Also, I hate the way it doesn't square your pictures anymore. I used it to match with my Instagram feed but it doesn't work as well anymore. My advice to the creators is to go back to a menu page to help users know where they are going and to go back to squared photos. I know I'm not the only one who used it to match their pictures. Sorry but not a fan of the update! ;("

Aside from that, the app is just harder to use and the pictures become harder to see after you edit them. It was 10x better visually with a square layout and I hate how the pictures show up in different sizes on your editing page. Extremely disappointed in this ""update"". It's like VSCO backtracked instead of making the app better because they felt that they HAD to make a change."

The only thing I wish there would still be an icon in the corner of the pictures you have edited in your library, or bring back the feature where you can sort your library to be only pictures you have edited, because sometimes I edit a picture to come back to later and it used to be so much easier to find."

You can then edit so many other elements of the photo to make it what you need or want it to be.

Like I said, the app is great, but since it won't allow me to save photos on my mini (which is the device I use the app on the most), I have to give it 3 stars. I'm really hoping this issue can be fixed in the next update."

So much, in all of your company's endeavors, but like, right now I have to the be the dude complaining about 'planned obsolescence'. From time to time, as I break my fancy newer phones, being a photog, I have to resort to this 4s, and there was a time when this app performed as advertised on this phone. Exporting mega-processed mega-sized pics to the roll, but nope, no longer, consistent crashes, and I know what a crash is. You guys know exactly what I'm talking about. It's really frustrating, I kind of want to stop advertising your company's products. Fix this please, I've given you money."

The filters, the editing tools are good, and it's a very unique app. Thanks for this experience! VSCO you guys are awesome! I'm not writing this review for hype, it's honestly a really great app. You guys did a great job, and I can't wait to see what's next in updates. This app should be popular, but it's new."

VSCO is focused solely on creativity and expression, not notoriety, and I heavily respect that. It's nice to have a platform on which I am free to create without the drama and gross extra stuff that comes with an typical social media site, but rather one that is clean cut and beautiful, and appreciates life as art. Not to mention, the VSCO support team is phenomenal, and very on top of things. They're so prompt and friendly, it's wonderful"

Now it won't download the free filters, and I don't know what to do. My feed also won't load and it just says like error loading content. When I try to download the free filters it says it was a success but then it says error downloading content.

However, I still use the built-in camera most of the time --because it is still the fastest way-- and you can only import the picture from camera roll one at a time. That could be lot of work after a long trip. Also it is always easier to edit a photo on a bigger screen. The details are different under each filter."

I've been taking photos as a hobby since I was younger, and with no time on my hands to take as many photos as I wanted, well, I guess I can say I'm definitely glad I was introduced to this tool. I wanted something more than filters, hashtags, and VSCO allowed me to do that. It's been a great artistic outlet, not to mention the tools are very strong and precise, so I have control over how I want my image to look. I'm very excited for VSCOjournal!"

Both offer a smooth, easy to navigate interface in which to share life's everyday moments to big announcements."
3643,Soccer 3,"October 19, 2015",1,"horrible update Let me start by saying this used to be my favorite go-to app for editing. Since the recent update it has been horrible. I lost all of my pictures that were edited, my filter packs that I bought won't restore, and the ease of this app is gone. What was one a app well worth the money has become trash. My pictures were professional quality and now I don't even enjoy editing them since the crappy update. This app NEEDS to go back to its old ways, fix the cliches, and try to recover the images lost (I read other reviews and know I'm not the only one experiencing these horrible effects) before it gets deleted and forgot about. Please Please fix!!!! Once a happy user, now an extremely disappointed one."
3644,Pinkmonstahh,"June 21, 2016",1,"Bring back the square grid! I used to really like VSCO until the new update. I regret updating it. The square grid helped me plan out my Instagram feed as well as the filters and things you can do to the photo. But now, the new update where it puts the picture in as the actual size just bothers me. I do not like how the format is. And I do not like how there's an extra block,so it's not three pictures in a row. Bring back the old VSCO. Simple and easy to use. I get the modern look, but as I can see from the comments nobody likes it. Sometimes things are meant to be left alone and not changed, just like the old version of VSCO. Please bring back square grids, checkmarks and easier navigation and basically the old version of VSCO!!!!"
3645,clarative,"June 23, 2016",1,"VSCO: The New Update As a long time user, the new update is disappointing. It has created more difficultly than ever. The circle concept to the update is quite confusing and the layout is what made people like the app. The previous was similar to the Instagram's layout with the auto squaring to the photos to get a preview of your feed before people post it. Now, it's very hard to see the layout/feed when the application doesn't do that anymore. "
3646,Anna Western,"July 17, 2016",2,"Frustrating and Unattractive UI I don't normally write app reviews, but this app was recently redesigned and it is really unfortunate. It used to be just on the verge of difficult to use, with cryptic icons that make you guess their meaning, but now it's downright impossible. I tried to explore and tapped the Collections prompt but once there I couldn't see how to get back to the edit mode. If it was there it was completely hidden. I had to refresh the app to go back eventually. I'm all for minimalism but not at the expense of functionality. I guess it annoys me because I'm a product designer. Plus, the app feels visually completely clunky now. Why did you ruin a good, or at least decent, thing??"

When I cleared out the photos from my studio in VSCO, I did not realize that I couldn't just save the photos from my profile feed. I am so upset that I can't save my own photos from my feed, please add this feature and I will re-review 5 stars!

I love this app, it gives me the chance to post pictures that I wouldn't post to my Instagram but still want to share with the world, I think it's a great way to connect and see other people's creativity as well. however with the recent update it seems when ever you click on a photo for a closer look it zooms into a random part of the photo and you don't even see the whole picture. I hope that with the next update they change it back to its normal view, otherwise I think the app is absolutely great!"
3649,waternebulous,"March 2, 2017",2,"Soupy The help center seems to have lack of communication within which to me gives the app bad quality. I would say the filters are 2/5 at best, instasize has better cheaper filters. Social media? No. I use it as an online portfolio for my editorial stylist photography and art. Simple to understand? 3/5 it would be nice if it had a little tutorial instead you definitely have to look up what's what with the journal and collection, images are self explanatory. It has a minimalistic interface but is similar to Instagram without the following popularity. Personally I've had a negative experience with the help center which is why this app in my book has a low rating."
3650,The Striped Man,"June 8, 2013",5,"Excellent! Very impressed by the overall feel and usability of this app. My only complaint is that it seemingly scales down imported images (ie: images shot with my DSLR) to fit the native resolution of my iPhone. I'm almost certain that the original version of this app did not do this, and I'm hoping the developers put some thought into addressing this issue. Lots of photographers use wi-fi SD/CF cards to tether wirelessly to their phones and I'd really like to be able to edit on the fly using this app without any loss of image quality."
3651,plumrotn,"February 25, 2014",4,"Love it .. but it could be better. I love using this app to edit pictures .. but the ease of use could be improved by 100% if you were able to swipe between film looks .. instead of having to click on the icon at the bottom to switch between the films. It would also be really nice to be able to save multiple edit steps as actions. These two features are available in the ""Faded"" App from Vintage Noir and it makes it much easier and quicker to browse the ""looks"" and apply similar edits to multiple pictures. Thanks!"

Take that with a grain of salt. I noticed that the effect sliders only work if your thumb is directly over the small bubble. Before, I feel that if your finger was placed relatively close to the slider you could use it. Would it be possible to update the sliders to accept user feedback from the square that the circle is located versus just the circle itself?"

3655,Benshack1,"June 9, 2016",5,"Simplistic and efficient This app is amazing!!! I was surprised to see it averaged at about 2 stars because this app is the best when it comes to photo editing apps. The simplicity of the app allows the photo to have all the attention and occupy the majority of the screen while you edit.

I highly recommend this app to all iPhone photographers both amateur and professional!"
3656,jFalcon,"June 19, 2016",1,Design and usability fail on so many levels Note to the app designer: this is purely ego driven design. You're clearly trying to push some ideology on your users which can work but it clearly doesn't here. There's absolutely no good reason to have that stupid big navigation button. It's not useful. If you're going to have screens that you can slide between to switch to then just let the user slide anywhere instead of limiting your hit area to a dot. What purpose does the button serve? Bad designer! Bad!

I know I speak for many others when I say I'm disappointed and now have to seek for another editing app because you guys decided to screw up a good thing.

So difficult to navigate compared to the previous version. I hate that the photo library is wonky with landscape and portrait images. It was so much cleaner when they were squares. I absolutely loved this app before and recommended it to all my Instagram followers who asked how I edited my images. I would not recommend it now unless you reverted back. Also, the edit buttons look so much clunkier and less refined now that they're a thicker white stroke. Looks way less professional. Please change back, I know it's unlikely since you probably spent a lot of time changing it. But it's really bad üëéüèª"

The only thing worth it on the app now is the filters and now those are pretty impossible to get to. VSCO used to look modern and beautiful and very easy to navigate. Now it's such an ugly mess that isn't flattering and doesn't showcase anyone's photos in a beautiful light (even though the app designers keep insisting that's what they're doing. They've failed miserably). I've used this app constantly since day one looking at other's pics, but now I open it, edit a pic and close it immediately because it's too ugly and clunky to use for anything. I'm hoping the next update bring back the classic version or I'm just going to have to delete it."

You also get your own website. The only suggestions I make is that for you to have an ability to group your filters for example a group for b&w filters, your favorite filters, color filters. That's my only criticism I only wish there was a way to group your filters"

The reason that I liked that better is because I use this app for my Instagram feed. It's hard to check out which pictures would look good for each other on Instagram if I can't see them all together in the square form. I suggest switching back to the old setup because it would be much easier for everyone that I know that uses this app to improve their Instagram feed. Also o think that you should allow videos to be edited as well.
3688,Lil_Amber_Liz,"June 29, 2016",1,Hate the Update I have been using this app for a long time and enjoyed it before the new update. The new update has ruined the purpose of this app for me. The new layout is not square where the pictures are displayed right next to one another making for a good feed. The new background is also black and drowns out the pictures and makes the pictures smaller to where they can't be seen very well. Before the update I recommended this app to many of my friends who also loved and downloaded it but now have deleted the app due to the update. Although I am but one user and my not using the app anymore is insignificant I was happy to delete the app after the update and free more storage in my phone.

I can't edit photos late at night anymore because that white background is so freaking bright. The all black interface was way better than what we got now. I get that it's #aesthetic #minimalistic to use lots of white in design but seriously, it's annoying to feel blinded when I open the app after sunset. And having the camera alway open and always on like that is just a drain on battery life. It doesn't even look nice with the interface :/"
3690,DrieStone,"February 6, 2014",1,"Nope! As cool as the feature set of this app may be, the UX is horrible. I found myself trying to figure out how to do basic things. VSCO is trying to be too clever for its own good."
3691,GPL.1620,"May 3, 2014",4,Love using this app for my mobile photography! I use Lightroom Vsco Film filters for my professional portrait photography. It's great that Vsco is on the iPhone because it allows me to use similar filters to those of the professional program whenever I take photos with my iPhone. I love the Journal tab and I'm really into the Grid. The Grid reminds me of the early days of Instagram when it was an app for professional and serious amateur photographers. My only wish is that likes would be allowed on the Grid so that it is more useful for social networking.
3692,FluxOtter,"June 6, 2014",5,"For eye catching photography. While a professional Camera  is best when it comes to taking photos, Vscocam comes second. It exposure, and focus control  allow more flexibility than the iPhones default camera, its editing tools and filters provide a further enhancement, keeping track of where you took the photo has been shown useful.  The only problem I have is there is no zoom, when shooting or viewing photos. Definitely my favorite photo app."
3693,llornn,"August 7, 2014",4,"Quality App As a professional photographer I can definitely say that this app is fantastic. I've purchased most of the filters, & I use them for every photo if I'm not using Lightroom or Photoshop. "
3694,Dougydu,"October 15, 2014",5,Best photo app.. But.. Although the app is amazing I would love to have the filters on the iOS   photos app. 
3695,SopGabDur,"August 28, 2015",5,Amazing app but This app is what I do 90% of the time. I loveeee the new collection feature. I also really like the fact that you can't see who's following you or who's like it or anything because it makes it more about the picture and not as much a competition to see who can get the most likes and most followers. I do think it would be cool if there was a comment section though so you could get feedback on your pictures and get tips from other photographers.
3696,Fredmuslim,"November 11, 2015",2,New update? I used to love vsco and would encourage my friends and family to try it out but soon enough they had a new update which ruined my favorite part of the app which was your profile and how you could see the pictures in the size they are cropped now they are scattered and I don't really like it that much I think it wasn't the best idea I also think you should have something where you can see who follows you but I love this app also I use it to edit all my pictures and use it so much I just think if you could fix these 2 small issues I have it would make a huge difference to a lot of people! x thank you for you time
3697,annmsoria,"March 22, 2016",4,"Absolutely great! Works like a charm üíñ I don't get why the ratings are low like 3/5. The only problem I have is syncing the pictures and starting over. I wish I wouldn't need to delete the app. First, you need to sync the pictures if you want to keep all of them. So if you ever want to delete, start over VSCO, or make a new account, sync your pictures first before deleting the app! My old pictures are gone, it happened a long time ago :( I'm just here reading the reviews üòÅ"
3698,kevinrajaram,"June 11, 2016",2,"Great tools and filters but bad update imo Hello team VSCO! I just have to say regarding the new UI update that it's not that great! Abstract good, yes, but using it the first couple times had me lost more than anything. The point of a great UI is to not have your user try and guess what's what. The old design was perfect as is! I could navigate with ease. The one thing that irks me is that you used a circle for the confirmation instead of the check. What was y'all smoking? I understand why you chose that but why break convention and choose something probably the entire human race regards as a confirmation 'check'? I hope you see all these reviews and come to some decision on what to do."
3699,Gymnasticskid10850,"January 29, 2017",5,"VSCO, my point of view:) I absolutely love this app; it has outstanding editing tools and following and feed portion is so much fun! Although, right now I am having trouble loading my content. I have deleted the app, and redownloaded. I have logged out. Restarted my phone. None that have worked. If it's not fixed soon, I might have to delete it officially. Which would break my heart since it's one of my favorite apps to use. And has basically replaced Instagram in my life."
3700,Sofamonkeyz,"June 7, 2013",2,"UI JUST GOT MORE HIDEOUS I'm convinced all the other reviews are from VSCO fans who know very little about what other apps are out there. This is not the best app. I do really like the handful of filters that are offered, they look really good. But that's about it. Everything is designed in a disastrously illogical disorder. Importing photos? This isn't Lightroom, its just another step that takes time, and its bulking the little space I have on my phone. The tools are way behind the standard now. Clunky and awkward. Please learn a lesson from Afterlight on how build UI and update regularly. I'd be happy to spend a few $ on a VSCOCAM that had a fast ingenious design and the beautiful filters VSCO is known for."
3701,imjus_,"August 15, 2013",4,"One feature I really want! The filters are great (I bought the bundle), the editing is pretty quick and smooth, and its overall a great photo app! The only things I want you to add are the abilities to flip photos (from how they're taken and saved once you take them) and the ability to layer filters. That would make this app a 5 star app! "
3702,Faccio,"October 13, 2014",3,"great tools, bad interface, and nobody cares about ""journal"" and ""grid"" section Please, for the love of god remove the stupid huge white text that overlays directly in the center of the image when you are adjusting the settings on a photo... do I really need to see a huge ""B6"" or ""+5"" when I'm adjusting the photo? what help does that provide me? redundant info. For a photo editing app It's pretty horrible design to have huge letters BLOCKING the photo while you make adjustments. How has no one mentioned this? Instagram's design is 10 times better. Also, NAME the filters. Filter names like A6 have absolutely no meaning to anyone whatsoever"
3703,PLLetscher,"April 11, 2016",4,almost perfect I've had this app forever and it's a perfect way to share lots of pictures that you don't want to spam on your Instagram. filters are amazing
3704,Baileyobear,"April 15, 2016",5,NEW UPDATE i would much rather have the black and white icon. it doesnt seem like it would affect so many people but it has and i am one of those people. as many of the other reviews have said i would love to have the horizontal swiping back onto the explore page it was much much much easier to view. also i personally loved when all the pictures on your account and other were all side by side fitting together like a puzzle rather then spaced out.
3705,Acesroxz,"June 13, 2016",1,"whats the point now the update completely ruins the main point of the app that i, among many others, used it for. the old update showed all pictures in your library, the way instagram did; in rows of three. it helped me to see if a picture would match my theme and to view everything simply and easily. in this update, everything looks confusing and out of order. many features that were added by taking out the old ones which were helpful, are pointless and irrelevant. theres so much waste of space. i DEFINITELY do not see myself using this app much anymore or recommending it even though it used to be a favorite. vsco, PLEASE change it back to how it used to be!!!"
3706,katmandm,"December 10, 2016",1,Why??? Why did you update the app AGAIN? Didn't you just update it recently? It seems like I'm having to relearn how to use VSCO over and over. 
3707,I'm le tired,"February 12, 2017",2,"Love this app but these days.... The app doesn't open, AT ALL! This is the second time it has happened and I had to delete the app and reinstall again (which meant that all of the older photos and settings had to be deleted). I started all over again recently and I have to do it AGAIN! Of course I have tried restarting my phone and looking for a newer version (the current one is the latest one) but it still won't let me open :( The logo at the beginning appears but crashes seconds later. Please fix this bug; this was not fixed in the last few versions, thus still experiencing the same issue."
3708,Christopher4620,"March 19, 2017",1,"Love the app, but... I'm the type of person that do not like subscriptions. I like buying what I like when I like it. I opened my app today and decided that it was time to see if there was any new presets I could buy and indeed, there were, so I was excited, but then I saw that new ""monthly subscription"" tab which said, those who got that plan would get things the other users could not. See, that's what turned me off. I like a preset, I buy it and I'm done with that, it gives me peace of mind. Now, for the smarty pants that would always say ""it's just 20"" yeah, I don't care if it's $1. I want to buy it and be done. Do not like this direction of the app and pretty much hate the alienation of user that don't do monthly."
3709,la colinas,"June 22, 2017",3,"Love it but frustrating I love using this app but it is so frustrating. Because of my phone contract, I have to upgrade to a newer iPhone and I'm scared that I'm going to lose all the pictures in my library, as every time I have deleted the app for storage reasons in the past, it wipes my library. Issue needs to be fixed. Also, when I try to share a picture to my Tumblr, it transfers over but when I click publish on my Tumblr, it does not share. So problems with the sharing to other platforms too. Apart from this, I use VSCO to edit all of my pictures and I love it."
3710,Ana Pyper,"January 8, 2015",4,"love this app! vsco is definitely my favorite photo app with the best feautures. it is a great sharing app and provides filters that enhance the photos the user takes, without distracting from the actual photo. my only issue is with the most recent update, I can't upload my photos directly into afterlight like on the last version. having this option takes out the middle step of saving it to my camera roll just to put a frame on it in AL. would love to see this changed in the next update!"
3711,Carbon Nerve,"May 13, 2015",5,"Has to be my favorite editing app So I have both after light and VSCO, but ever since I downloaded VSCO, I see myself using it more than afterlight.  Afterlight is an amazing app that has great filters, but the filters on VSCO in my opinion are superior.  I don't use filters actually since I edit all my photos with manual settings on the app.  I usually seem to get better results with VSCO cause of its simplicity.  Totally recommend this to anyone that's into editing their pictures."
3712,zenianasevich,"August 6, 2015",5,"love it!!! but one small annoyance... i have been using this app since the very first version came out and i have to say that there isn't any other app that compares (even afterlight). however, when scrolling through a pack of filters to potentially buy, i wish that they would apply the filter to the same photo as opposed to a different one every time. it's hard for me to see what the filter actually does for the photo since i don't have anything to compare it to. i also don‚Äôt like how when you hit the explore tab, it shows you a feed of photos from people you don‚Äôt even know, and it‚Äôs a hassle to get to your actual feed. i don‚Äôt really care about the professional photographers‚Äô photos; i just want to see what my friends are sharing. other than that, best editing app hands down!!"
3713,14744166,"November 4, 2015",3,"Fix I loved this app before the update but ever since O think a few things have to change. First, I felt that one of the greatest things abou the app was theystery of not knowing who follows you; now it just defeats the whole purpose. The app was a way to express yourself without feeling judged and know every time someone post all they can think about it is who will see it. Second, the app has become too complex and sort of a mess. Before. It was all about minimalism and now you put the my feed with your photographers...?! Please fix this! Also when you press on a picture it crops in..."
3714,Lublubs,"March 12, 2016",3,"Updates are horrible I have been using VSCO for more than a year, and loved it when I first used it. But however, with every update the app seems harder to use. Besides the explore page being set up as one now, I am not able to see all the pictures of people I follow on my feed. Often it shows 1 photo and I must go to their page to see the rest. Overall, I love VSCO as a creative photo sharing platform that is unique, making art from photos, but I do miss the old, better versions, and dearly wish that VSCO would realize updates don't always mean better."
3715,Sally123123123,"June 9, 2016",2,"THE UPDATEüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ so I absolutely love this app, it was my favorite app ever because I could give GREAT filters to my photos and plan out feeds for Instagram ect. however, this new update is making this VERY difficult! because the library is no long squares and the app itself is VERY confusing! I know  after putting all this dedication and hard work into this new update you most likely will not want to change it, but I really think you should. I really think you should change it back because it was SO much better. this is just my opinion but I sure there are many. but I still love the app and I will stick by whatever you guys do."
3716,Saamm.,"June 20, 2016",2,"Update The old vsco was perfect. The only thing that has improved with this update is the quality of the picture after editing. The effects and filters are sharper; better. However, the way to import and simply maneuver in the app is very annoying. After editing the photo or going back and forth between the filtering and editing, hitting the check mark is hard. Often times, the X gets hit instead, even if you don't touch it. And this isn't just my phone. Many others have experienced it too. The entire setup is horrible and unsatisfactory. Please change it back. Also, CHANGE IT BACK TO A SQUARE GRID/FEED. THANKS."
3717,tyra üíÄüíÄüíÄ,"July 8, 2016",5,"Wow! A review on the app's actual purpose I can't believe this app's ratings are so low based on a supposedly ""confusing and ugly"" interface. In reality the layout is simple, aesthetically pleasing, and unique. I guess users are upset because it doesn't look like your Instagram feed anymore, which isn't what this app was made for. VSCO has great editing features and filters. It's easy to use and perfect for it's intentional purpose: to edit and share photography. Seriously, stop complaining. :-)"
3718,ndmlosi,"February 12, 2017",5,"Best Editing App Thoughtful, subtle filters. Wonderfully clean and well designed interface. Powerful, intelligent editing tools that aren't complex enough for you to bury your time in adjusting but yield really lovely and atmospheric results.  VSCO really outshines every other attempt for a photo editing app that doesn't try and mimic computer software and effects. If you're looking for a photoshop substitute, this is not for you. If you're looking to create beautiful photos, look no further."
3719,"Father of Many, Master of None","September 1, 2017",4,"Adequate and streamlined I like this app as it allows me to shoot in RAW, the controls are simple and functional but at the same time feel sluggish. Perhaps not using a slide rule for fine adjustments would help refine this. Above all the powerful features this app offers one thing sticks out as unnecessary, why have my photos stored separately from my phones photo album? Requiring me to upload photos from VSCO to my photo album if I want to use a different editor seems redundant. Overall a useful tool within its limits."
3720,oukays,"August 25, 2013",4,"Great app, keeps crashing! I am IN LOVE with the filters provided and the option to adjust the filters after! Love it! I use it with ALL of my Instagram photos since I've found it. But the problem is, saving photos can sometimes freeze the screen and force my phone to become inoperable. Legally dead for a few minutes before it smartens up and resets it for me. VSCO blames customers for using corrupted images, but they should consider looking into the issue and updating the program if this is affecting a number of people."
3721,MasqueradeDiva3,"September 18, 2013",5,"Best Photo App EVER! This is seriously the best photo app there! If you want your photos to look professional, this is the app you need. The filters are amazing. There are so many adjustments options, it's incredible. If you purchase their bundle pack you get a whole bunch of filters that add on to the already amazing filters that come standard in the app. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to take their iPhone photos to the next level, the professional level."
3722,Haantiexo,"June 5, 2014",5,The best photo editing app ive ever used. I use this to edit my photos and upload on instagram since instagram itself ruins the quality of the photos but this app doesnt. 
3723,Beocorgi,"September 8, 2015",5,Amazing customer service!!! I just recently got this app and was very surprised by the easy intuitive interface. However I made a typo while entering my url... I know stupid. I wanted to change it so I sent an email to their customer service. Even though it was after hours they still got back to me in less than 45 minutes and even went out of their way to change my url. This is an amazing app and I would encourage you to get it.
3724,waterhouse23,"October 11, 2015",2,"Love hate relationship Vsco, I love this app. I love the edits I can do to enhance my pictures. However there are some things I dislike. In a recent update I can no longer search for anything, people, pictures... And I also dislike the fact that I can't change the size of my pictures when viewing them. Sometimes I'd like to look at each one individually and scroll through them like Instagram and sometimes I'd like to go through all of them at once like my iPhone's camera roll. Now I can only see them in rows of 2, neither big nor small. Over all I love the app, I just hope these things will be changed soon. Thank!"
3725,austinhatesme,"June 12, 2016",1,"What happened? I used to really like VSCO, but this update ruined it for me. The new design is confusing and unnecessary, but the biggest problem is the issue with the filters. Probably about half of the photo filters do not show up when I click on them. I have tried on various photos and closed the app numerous times, but I still have this problem. I also tried posting an image, got a pop up saying ""image failed to post,"" and then went to my feed and the image was there. I'm glad it posted, but the pop up was misleading and should not have been sent. Please fix these issues!! I'd be bummed to delete this app but that may happen if it continues to work poorly."
3726,LemmaLemma44,"June 14, 2016",2,"Very confusing to use I love the concept of the app itself and I was very excited to use it. But, once on the app I was incredibly confused on how to navigate it. I am still not 100% sure how to get back to my profile. Maybe a new update with an easier navigation?? It also took me awhile to find some of my friends on the app, maybe figure out a way to connect people through different forms of social media? Anyway I love the idea, hate the actual app. Needs a lot of improvement. It's very frustrating... "
3727,Evelyn colon,"June 28, 2016",1,"Frustrated okay the app isnt bad, but I just dont like it bc the new update makes it very hard to use & its so confusing. a main problem i have is that theres this box that says ""find friends to follow or pull down to search for a person or keyword"" & when i pull it down it takes me to the same place where a button at the top takes me so i cant even search for people. its small but i wanna see my friends pictures! also like i said its just confusing, hard to use, messy, & kind of hard to navigate through it now that only this circle thing is the only way we can move back & forth. before the update this would've never happened. very disappointed.."
3728,TaShyon La'neigh,"December 23, 2016",4,"Change the ""sharpen"" tool back, please! I've never had any complaints, this is honestly my favorite editing app; but the sharpen tool has changed. i loved the way it was before, now the image gets really bold black lines around the edges and it'll look like i'm trying to use the ""clarify"" tool. I know that you can choose the magnitude at which to sharpen but i used to be able to go to a 7 and still love the image but now i can barely go past a 1 without it looking over edited. fix soon! thank you"
3729,dancergirlnat,"January 28, 2017",5,"Absolutely fantastic My favorite app ever. Thank you SO much, VSCO, for your incredible design and UI. My advice to VSCO for the future -- keep doing what you're doing, but refrain from turning this into a social media app. I actually deleted all of my social media (Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat) and only use VSCO now because of the fact that I can totally be myself on this app and I don't have to deal with the superficiality of ""likes"" and comments, etc. This app is gold. Thank you, thank you, VSCO!"
3730,j a r r o d,"June 12, 2013",5,"This is a game changer There are a ton of camera apps. This outshines everything in simplicity and complexity. If your a beginner, the presets are a simple screen tap and your photo gets a professional treatment. On the flips use if your a professional, the adjustability in every facet is extraordinary. Not to mention the ease of sharing the photos and the VSCO grid which becomes a mobile phone portfolio, in my opinion is a shift in not only mobile photography but photography photography haha. Game changer."
3731,Davidanthony86,"November 25, 2013",3,"I want an Ipad version already!!! VSCO cam is probably the most amazing photo(filters) app on the store. But hey where is the version for the Ipad. It's been long enough now I want to experience the full power of creating beautiful pictures, taking full advantage of what the ipad has to offer. Mainly I want it for editing and the ability to use full size pictures. The iphone version on the Ipad is glitchy (Saves blank images to my camera roll). The Ipad air is crazy fast and it can take the pressure so lets get some VSCO editing goodness on the IPAD already. If only for editing."
3732,squaredcheese,"March 21, 2014",4,"Amazing, but could use improvements I love using this app and the filters are amazing, but it could see to a few things to make it even better. Sometimes when I add photos I can't see them in the library and it's just black. It also needs a flip option so you can flip your photos and turn them too. I think you should be able to add more than one filter at once, and you can control how many you have and stuff. Definitely one of my favorites overall though"
3733,shannondoll_,"July 12, 2014",5,"LOVE IT BUT... PLEASE change how the filter names show up on the picture you're editing, it gets annoying when your trying to decide what filter to pick and a giant ""F2"" or ""+3"" keeps showing up right on top of it. "
3734,@jawshalfa,"September 26, 2014",4,"Annoyed I find it really annoying how the new update doesn't let you get photos from your Camera Roll or shall I say Recently Added? Whatever crap Apple has changed to the perfectly fine Camera Roll. Most of my photos in my iCloud, I don't even actually use. They're photos from a while back! I don't understand why I can't access something when logically I'm gonna generally get my photos from? The newest update is supposed to fix bugs yet I still see these useless improvements made."
3735,Quibex,"October 5, 2014",5,"Amazing App, Could Use a Save Option. By far amazing app. My favorite for picture editing. Alongside Afterlight, VSCO cam has alot more advantages. However, Afterlight has one little option that overules this app, and it's the option to 'save' your filter creation. (e.g; You use and tweak a filter, and you have an option to save it for later photos if desired.) Afterlight uses this and it's called 'Fusion'. Great feature, i love this app, but i would love it even more if it had that feature."
3736,Josh.Nolan,"October 13, 2015",5,"Solid update. VSCO has been my go-to editing software on both desktop and mobile, and I can say with honesty that I always get amazing results. I have watched VSCOcam grow from the very beginning, and I am proud of how far it has come. The latest features are just awesome, and I am still in love with how fluent and smooth the UI feels. I haven't seen a single bug since the app's early days. It's just well-crafted."
3737,Yonnniiii0513,"April 29, 2016",5,"Great app, but.... I really love this app and the only thing I have a problem with (well not really a problem, just my own personal needs) is that I wish there was some way to create your own preset with all the editing, such as exposure, contrast, etc. and then save it so you don't have to manually add effects and such things to every photo. (Such as Afterlight's 'fusion') For people like me who mostly use the same presets for all photos. It would just be nice. Much love!"
3738,BelleOEl,"August 4, 2016",2,". I use vsco a TON. I love the filters and all the editing options! I use this app to figure out my Instagram feed, but with the new setup I feel like it's harder. The way vsco looks now is just genuinely awful. I don't understand why they would change it when the setup for your pictures before referenced an Instagram feed, which is why people use it. With the way it is now, I find it harder to tell is my pictures match or not. I'll if course continue to use it since the filters and such haven't changed, I just wish you had a choice on how the setup can look. I would definitely use the previous one."

It makes no sense that when you make an account all photos on the app wont be kept to that account, so in case something like this happens youre in comfort knowing the photos you had on the app will still exist if you sign into your account some other time. You should work on that. But for now, thanks for making me lose really important photos and memories I'll never get back."

But now, I'm not so sure if I can use this app again if the new layout is like this. Don't get me wrong, it is efficient. But I just don't like the way it looks. We should be able to change the layout to how we feel like, or go back to the old one. Because now that this happened, I might not use VSCO anymore.."
3747,DiodeGamerMode,"November 25, 2016",3,"It's great, but.. Its okay. I like instagram beater, but what I like about VSCO is that when you see another picture, you can upload it to your stream. I find it a little annoying to take pictures on it, though. If you could make the VSCO camera better that would be great, such as making it clearer, or fixing the glitches I get. Glitches, as in as soon as I open the camera, it freezes, and crashes. It doesn't let me take a lot of pictures, and when it does, it's pretty blurry. Fix this and it would turn my 3 star rating into 5!"
3748,Cool kid 8888888888,"February 12, 2017",3,So annoying the app itself and the editing tools are great the only thing that annoying is saving. i lost all my memory on my phone so my backup didn't have some of the images i edited in my editing space. but i did publish them. however you can't save your own pictures from YOUR profile without screen shotting it which is annoying because you lose the quality within the picture. so now i have no way of getting that edited image into my camera roll without losing its quality even though ITS MY PICTURE
3749,Mommy3fam5,"July 11, 2017",3,"Editing I love vsco and editing photos as much as everyone that uses this app, but lately I've been encountering problems. I will edit a photo the way I like it and save the changes and then publish it. Once I publish it I notice that it is edited differently than I had done. I'm wondering if it's a glitch of some sort because I've been trying to see if I accidentally caused the change in look by adding a filter at the last second but that's not the case. Please fix this so I can have my page looking the way I'd like it to again."
3750,TyraJM93,"February 23, 2014",5,"Uhh what's going on here.. VSCO is a great app, in fact, the greatest photo editing app I've ever had. But just now when I tried to edit some photos, none of them are coming out correct. They all come out in a weird black and white tone with a hint of a random color. I don't know if this is a weird bug or something but this needs to be looked into! I just updated the app so I don't understand why this is happening. Is this happening to anyone else?"
3751,Juliee~,"August 25, 2014",5,"Favorite This is absolutely one of my favorite apps. I used to think that there wasn't much to it so it wasn't used for like ever. Then I started to explore the app and wow. Literally the only editing app I use now. I now like to make videos here and there and am desperate to find an app to edit videos with and thought how amazing it would be if vsco cam also edited videos. Please give that a thought, I love this app and thank you for working ever so hard on it!"
3752,Wonton4,"November 17, 2014",5,"Yes Fantastic. Love this app and all its features. Allows for so much creativity and expression of originality and you can do it with you iphone! Best part is, people can follow you and you never know, people can like your stuff but you'll never know. It is awesome to have a place to display my photography abilities but not have to worry about what everyone thinks of it, compare it against others, or stress it be embarrassed by the amount of favorites or likes I get. Wonderful aop"
3753,Amberleyyy,"November 21, 2014",2,"Frustrating-Crashes & doesn't work I use to absolutely LOVE VSCO cam. I used it for every single picture on Instagram. Well once I updated it now I can't even open it. The app just crashes. I thought it may have just been the previous update so I was excited to see a new update today. Well I was wrong, it still doesn't work after this update even though it claims to ""fix crashing of app"" (not sure exact wording). I just am upset because I don't want to delete the app and re download because then I will lose all of the pictures I had on the app. I'm just disappointed and frustrated. Please fix this!!!"
3754,Saintadelic,"November 18, 2015",5,Love this app.... At first was a little intimidated by all the symbols and roadways. Within an hour I was skating around this app. having a blast. Photos look better than the original and love the mobility and compatibility with my 6S. Especially love the perspective feature. Quick and Quality in no time. I like that I can compare original side by side then save edited version back to my photo library and share on social media in no time at all.

It was my go-to for filters, and for seeing how my Instagram profile/theme would look before committing to a post; I loved it! It was legit perfect, but now the layout is very choppy and abrupt. It does not flow very nicely anymore and it's not as appealing to the eye as before. The app is not very helpful to me now. I used it for a short 3 weeks, but I really loved it the way it was! Given the layout it has now, I would not recommend to N E one. The simplest of things have stood the test of time. Newer does not always mean it is better."
3757,hanme18,"July 7, 2016",1,"terrible update this new update is confusing, annoying, not working, and frustrating. I hope you are reading all of these reviews vsco because all of your current app users want the same thing: THE OLD VSCO!!! I can no longer double tap images to save them to my collection. it just doesn't work and it thinks I want to edit them. I don't like how you have to go through a bunch of things to just get to your profile. bring back the old vsco!!!! I am so done with this app it's way to confusing and not user friendly. please please change because if you don't I will not be using this app:/ I hope you read these and realize what your users want."
3758,Govshic,"January 28, 2017",2,"Awful The updated version of VSCO is just awful. The rotation of the screen does not work any more in the app. So, it's not convenient to edit horizontal photos. What's more, when editing, there are no scale divisions like +1,+2 or -1 anymore, which makes the app so much like Snapseed. Actually I liked the previous version cause you could compare the photo before adding some filters and after, and to what extent it changed. Now the photo changes instantly and gradually while you're moving the button. Wouldn't have updated it if I knew it was gonna be this way. Return the better version of VSCO!!!"
3759,1Dloverüí•‚úã,"April 16, 2017",5,"Love the app! VSCO is for sure my go-to app when editing my pictures! Anytime i'm looking to post on apps such as Instagram, I always edit my picture through VSCO first. Great variety of features and different filters. Love this app. Also, a great way to express ones self is posting to VSCO. It's a place where people don't really judge what you post and not to many guys are around so girls can post whatever. It's a great app that I for sure use daily."
3760,thatsomeone,"August 23, 2013",5,Exceptional! This is by far the best app for photography on any platform. The filters are so clean and beautifully mimicking film exactly like their computer version if filters for DSLR cameras. VSCO cam really does not disappoint. There is not a picture that edit without it. The filters are not overdone and there are so many to choose from if you buy the packaged. Beautifully designed app and totally recommend it above anything else for both iphoneography and DSLR photography.
3761,infamousRIOT,"March 15, 2014",5,"Makes my flaws... FLAWLESS! Ummm.. Any person into good, quality photos whether you are a novice or an expert needs this app as their companion on their iPhone. Sometimes I look at the finished products I create and simply forget that fact that I took and edited it on a phone. Addicted to Instagram and wanna make those selfies pop? This app is for you.

I have other filter apps but I usually resort to VSCOcam naturally, the brilliance of VSCO is you can just ad a simple filter and that's it... however for the pro's there are numerous ways to perfect your look with an in depth editing tool.

3763,jlhuggins,"October 13, 2015",1,"UGG! I had seen so many people using this and hearing raves about it, so I thought I would try it after having seen so many posts to Instagram sharing their VSCO's. I am a typically techy person, and know what to tap and where to tap to get where I need to go without having to be taught. And this app I got so lost! It was such a bizarre feeling! I was looking at photos others posted and I didn't know how to go back to get to my page!!! I had to close the app and reopen it. It apparently is for ""artsy"" people, which isn't me anyways. So if you want to keep posting photos of your, your friends, and your food...stick with Instagram. Goodbye VSCO! Maybe try making sense of your UI! üò±"

Simple editing, beautiful presets, and a creative, easy and non-competitive photo sharing grid. But the so called ""new vsco"" is just excessively fancy. It's confusing and overly complicated, eliminating many of the aspects that I once loved about vsco. PLEASE bring back the old version! Now when I look at my own grid, the background is an unattractive black and I can't read my captions or see which preset I used unless I go to edit the photo. I also miss being able to swipe through photos on the explore grid, rather than having to click on each individual picture to see it full screen. I miss the old vsco :("
3766,Alienxpizza,"July 4, 2016",5,It's aight This app is one of my favorites for editing. After the update not so much. I really miss when it was in a layout where you it would look like instagrams so I can have that decided more easily without the images being so small and far apart. I really wish that they brought back the old version as the other reviews before me had as well. Hope whoever is in charge of this app update stuff fixes this

Only this time, I just can't do it. When adjusting filters and trying to get to the saturation, contrast, exposure, etc. settings, I always manage to somehow exit my photo I was editing even though I'm just trying to swipe to the other settings. I really don't understand it. There's no need to update the interface this often... I'm almost considering deleting the app because it's just impossible to use. Switch it back.

I'm using a iPod touch 5 which could very well be my problem but I've been using this app with the iPod for many years and didn't have a problem until now.

It really does take the iPhone camera to the next level, but my problem is that it is not allowing me to publish me anything into my journal. I tap the button to change from draft to publish and it just changes back. Other reviews make it sound as if the updates it receives don't adequately solve your problem and I have yet to find a forum thread or another review with the same complaint.

Vsco chopped the file size down! Then I did some research and discovered Vsco is the worst when it comes to compressing files. :-( I am bummed.

3776,joelgoodman,"June 18, 2016",1,"Terrible UX model, worse UI. Ruined a great app. VSCO made their occasionally annoying yet normally solid app something nearly unusable. After using VSCO Cam for years, buying every filter, and tagging countless photos with #vscocam I've been rewarded with a redesigned interface that obviously never went through usability testing outside of VSCO's own devs. "
3777,YeseniaTheLoaf on Vsco,"July 8, 2016",2,"Could Be Better. I just got vsco recently so I don't know how the old vsco was but by the reviews it seems as if the old one was better. And to be honest I think the vsco that it is right now isn't the best it can be. I feel like there should be a more interaction with followers and also people should be able to edit their profile like maybe have different profile layouts or something that we can customize our own profile and not have it look like everyone else's. I mean don't get me wrong I love the concept, but I wish y'all would have us make our profile look the way it best fits us."
3778,vladizhuko,"October 8, 2016",1,"Used to be really good VSCO used to be really good, but then they tried to be really different. They still have the best presets and tools in my opinion, although they could use a few more like gradients (which they could charge for). Instead, we get some silly little button in the middle of the screen, and a social network nobody asked for. Meanwhile, the fundamentals are lacking. There's no more cloud integration so if you log in on a different phone, you'll lose all your photos. When you import photos for editing, they are low res so it's hard to see what the final is going to look like, which is silly. VSCO is a really great app that lost its way, please go back"

Like any new app there's always little bugs here and there. The only thing I've experienced so far is VSCO Cam sometimes quits during photo importing. I've only uploaded 1 photo successfully at a time, it quits anywhere from 6 to 47 photos at a time are trying to import, aside from this everything is great value and quality. Bought all the presets already too!"

I love this app so much and it is aggravating that it has randomly started to mis function in this way...please do something about this problem because the app is absolutely useless at this point."

Also the ability to adjust saturation, contrast, exposure, shadows, and many more help to create the perfect mood for any picture. I also love the interaction between vsco and its user community. They really are innovators and care about feedback. I use this app religiously and it is hands down the best of its kind."

I recently got my phone stolen and all the picture that were in my library were lost because when i logged onto VSCO on my older phone they didnt save in the library. This was upsetting and it would be great if you could access the pictures in your library from anywhere you log into VSCO.

This app was one of the most well designed apps I had ever seen from functionality, fonts, layout, and logo. Now all that is gone and it makes for an awful app experience. Honestly this new update makes me consider throwing my iPhone in a river and getting an early 2000s Nokia phone with snake on it. Terrible update. Huge step backwards. Honestly don't know what the motivation is at vsco. If you think you can make GIFs cool you can't. No good filter makes something so stupid actually good. Waste of an update. Waste of time. Bad job vsco. Bad job."

I do think that some feature are hard to access and that should be changed. With a great photo you can make it even that much more stunning with a little tweaking using this app. The camera feature is not all that great. I rarely use it. The feed is not what I would expect either."

Overall, this update is a very good update; the ability to ""favorite"" an image is a great opportunity to let others know your personal favorite photos from their published studio. However, why did you remove the private ""saved images"" album from the app? Was for privacy reasons, or was it to free up space on the phone? Because if it was the latter option, it didn't do anything to clear up space on my phone. Good overall, but disappointed at the removal of this feature."

Besides that issue, this app is amazing."

First off I'd like to preface this whole thing with the fact that I usually adore this app. I've used it for a little over a year now and It's my go-to for iOS editing. The filters are spot on and editing is easy and intuitive. However, this whole app hasn't been running effectively, crashes for days, little lags, I lost all my photos from the previous versions, I lost all my filters, and now I can't even download a filter pack after I purchase it. All I get is a giant ""Error"" message. This app is an easy 4 stars but right now I'll leave it at 1 until an update happens and I can at least download some filter packs."

I cant even scroll down the grid anymore without being confused. I can not view my own account properly and the fact that you can save other people's pictures and post them to your own collection blows my mind. I hate every thing about the new update. I hate it so much that I am honestly considering deleting VSCO as a whole. For everyone's sake, please bring back the old version and stop trying to create a high tech new and ""improved"" app."

Now when I'm looking through my timeline I have to press on every single persons photo to see their caption and see the picture big. It's really annoying so please bring the old feed thing back. I've also talked to so many people and they also agree that they liked the old version way better."

Nothing makes since and it's hard to navigate around. 
3797,mimispring,"December 17, 2016",2,"A few things I'm not happy with Okay, I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but as soon as I updated the app, I lost a few of my presets. Was that supposed to happen? I looked around the app to see if I can bring them back, but couldn't. This whole new layout isn't working for me and I think the old layout was a lot easier and better to navigate. Also, I can't seem to log into my account. I typed in my usual email and password, but for some reason it didn't recognize it. I miss the old version of this app, it was much simpler and easier to navigate around."

The UI has gotten unbelievably confusing and horrible to use as a photo editor. It used to be so simple and clean but yet they keep getting more complicated. I feel like I need an Egyptian hieroglyphics dictionary to use this app. I guess that  happens when a company is run by very young people. Surprisingly as a middle-aged adult I have asked the same questions to a much younger demographic everyone seems to feel the same as I do and people have deleted it from their phone after paying for a lot of filters.

I'd like to see what the filter does before purchasing"

There are so many updates that I had been waiting for, such as more presets, the ability to apply a preset or edit gradually, importing more than one photo at a time, exporting faster, and better performance overall.

I kinda feel sad because i cannot use this updated app , i'm still using it but i use the last compatible version.

It's always slightly annoying when an app changes it's look but I always get over it quickly. Even Instagram's big update didn't bother me for that long. However, VSCO's latest update is awful. I don't know why they made such weird drastic changes. The navigation in the app is awkward & confusing, I can't even find half the stuff that's in the app anymore. They also changed how you can see what your IG feed will look like when you post a photo. That was my favorite feature & they destroyed it. Please VSCO, please fix this terrible update."
3804,Lorina Daiana,"June 13, 2016",1,"So frustrating ! What is going on with this update?! It's so confusing, it feels like you went back to a beta version...."
3805,Msduvall,"September 6, 2016",5,"Thank you for the fix...MUCH better!! This is the third time I have written a review. First, I wrote a scathing review because--as many others have stated--the updates left the interface almost impossible to use. "
3806,Shelby328,"November 20, 2016",5,Love it! Hands down my favorite photo editing app! I do a lot of amateur photography and honestly prefer the filters on vsco over any computer programs or similar apps. I can't help but buy every package they come out with!
3807,Sammx03,"December 2, 2016",4,VSCO The app is overall great however I don't like the new update it's very confusing I was literally just getting the hang of the old one and now I can't even figure it out. Also I upgraded my phone and I wasn't aware that the sync didn't exist anymore and I lost all my pictures now I have no way of gaining access to them I'm very disappointed because I really liked those pictures I need them back please if there is any way I can get them back please let me know.
3808,Carly12345CarlySam,"April 21, 2017",4,"2DIover I hope VSCO Cam works with Instasize app in the future. I hope VSCO adds more free filters because people are going to get tired of using the same thing and would want more. I pray that VSCO cam has a tool when they can make the picture or selfie better exposed like a the iphone 7 plus. I pray that VSCO gives more free filters around Christmas time or whenever. God bless this app and the created, I hope you guys continue to bless us in the future. God bless and have a wonderful day."
3809,EzFix,"July 19, 2017",5,"Favorite Photo Editing App This is definitely my favorite app for editing pictures. There's a nice selection of filters, and the other features are useful too. One suggestion I have pertains to the studio. I like to use the studio to plan out what my Instagram layout will look like. It would be helpful if you could move the photos around without having to delete any. Thanks for the great app!"
3810,Mmbenson,"June 25, 2013",5,"This app is the future of mobile photography I absolutely love this new format,"
3811,Hoofhammer,"February 5, 2014",3,"Great Filters, but kind of disappointing The filters this app offers are better than everything else I've tried, and there's plenty of room for expansion if you want to buy more. What I don't understand is why I have to add each photo from my library individually rather than just being able to browse everything on my phone as soon as I open the app (like Instagram). A way of resizing the images so that the whole image shows up on Instagram (a tool like the Instasize app) would also be nice."
3812,Charles darkley,"May 15, 2014",5,"Must-have for photographers. I'm just a casual photographer/instagrammer, but this app has the best overall interface and results of the ones I've used. I also use Afterlight, and I still love that app, but I use this more frequently now. Only thing missing is a 16:9 crop ratio and the ability to put the square borders around photos for Instagram (I still have to use Afterlight for both of those). But overall this app is flawless."
3813,CE360,"December 17, 2014",4,"Finally! I love to shoot photos with my iPhone, but I usually prefer to edit those photos on my iPad (or desktop). I always thought VSCO was a cool app, but because the iPhone app wasn't optimized for the iPad, and images would save at a lower resolution on the iPad, I would only use it occasionally on my phone. Now that we finally have a proper iPad app I feel like I can finally dive in! I'm already using VSCO Cam to edit more often. I hope someday we'll be able to create & save our own presets."
3814,zumruts,"April 28, 2015",5,"Great app, love everything about it. What I love about vsco is that first of all, how there are so many adjustments you can make. It's not as easy as all the other photo edit apps that we come across and having many features, that's really really good. And also I love the fact that it's not about so many things like in other apps, like how people dont try to post their food and nails and stuff. It's just about awesome photography!"
3815,kolbydenham,"October 5, 2015",5,"Great app! I've been using VSCO Cam for years, and it gets better with every update. However, I would like to be able to export full-sized photos to Instagram, rather than having VSCO Cam automating export it in 1:1 format. We're all excited that Instagram supports full-sized photos, and I would like to upload my photos directly, rather than have to save to my camera roll then upload. Otherwise, awesome app!"
3816,Mika bee,"June 16, 2016",1,If you're reading this DO NOT UPDATE I have never written a review but this update is so horrible I feel compelled to review it. I wish I could give it negative stars. The navigation is ok considering I don't use the app for anything but editing. I guess they are trying to promote the app as more of a social media platform which is fine. But why take away the grid thumbnails? It's much harder to see the pictures since they are so much smaller with too much empty space between them. I understand that apps usually don't revert but please at least make how we view our personal photo collection a option in settings (which I also can't seem to find)
3817,Gperson4,"July 19, 2016",4,"Needs Some Simple New Features I wish I would get notified when I'm uploading a duplicate photo, whether it be to my library or to my social platform. I have a large library, and it's hard to keep track of these things. And now I can't really clean it out effectively. I would like to see an option similar to Camera Roll and Moments where you can see your library in the order you uploaded AND in the order you actually took the photos. Thanks."
3818,Apesanne,"December 14, 2016",1,"Please go back to old UI! App used to be 5 star worthy, but with the new UI introduced a few months ago, it's become crap. Really sad because as soon as I started using it to post pictures and not just edit them (and feeling like I found the perfect photo sharing app for my taste) it changed!! You were perfect 6 months ago VSCO, please pleaaaaseeeeee go back to how things were! I don't even use you as a photo editor anymore because I am so so sooo disappointed over the changes you made :( Please go back, I'm begging and so are all my friends that have used this app! Don't fix what isn't broken, you were so perfect before! Holding out hope :/"
3819,josue.d.p,"February 4, 2017",2,Love it but Hate it I've been using this app for a long time now and I've bought all the filters and don't regret my decision at all.
3820,Fizzy we,"June 7, 2013",5,Wonderful app Ok I have an iPhone 5 and this app is amazing. You can do so much more than Instagram. This app looks more professional and clean. I love to take pictures with my iPhone and by far this is in my collection. Thank nice job. Oh it also helps if you buy all the filters. It's not a bad price considering what you are able to achieve. And that would be great photos and professional. Look forward to more filters.
3821,rayburnc,"June 7, 2013",4,"Really good update This is a great update to the original VSCO Cam. Great control over editing is still there along with the filters. Speed improvements are very substantial. Finally, I'm really looking forward to the roll out of VSCO Grid. "
3822,djoliverm,"August 24, 2013",5,"Excellent, same quality as their presets on the computer First of all, what an amazing layout. It'll take a few minutes to get used to it, but the flat design, excellent typography and overall clean look make it a beauty to interact with. The filters are top notch, and there are plenty of things to tinker with, and it's ""dumbed"" down to the iPhone in a very intelligent way. If you're serious about iPhone photography, this is the best app yet."
3823,GC handle: Marriedtomyself,"July 14, 2014",4,"Almost perfect ...and completely perfect for the standard user. I have been a diehard fan of VSCO for a long time, and was delighted by the app- it's only gone up in the last few years. It's one of the few things I have no issue paying for, and may I say, the decision to allow people to restore purchases across platforms was classy and unprecedented. "
3824,Niall/Louis Girl,"November 16, 2014",4,"Overall, it's a great app. I like this app a lot. The only problem I'm having is the email verification. I tried to make an account and almost succeeded, but then came the email verification. I'm usually a patient person, but this is irritating me quite a lot. I've tried to resend the email, unfortunately it would not send and I would not receive a single email that mentions Vscocam. It's quite irritating, and I would very much appreciate it if you fixed this problem."
3825,Sure blah slit$$,"July 16, 2015",3,"eh I have been using VSCOcam for quite awhile now and it truly has been one of the best filtering apps. I have made multiple purchases in their filter options and it was worth it;however, whenever I try to upload my pictures through the app to Instagram, the image quality deteriorates giving it a grain effect. Overall, the outcome from uploading through the app makes it seem as I have bad quality photos whereas in the app, the pictures are clear. Please do fix this, other than that, I really do enjoy!"
3826,24/7 Plaaayerrrr,"June 9, 2016",3,"Do not update The new update (6/9/16) is really disappointing. I used this app everyday to edit my pictures and see how they would look on my Instagram feed using the library section in vsco but now that I updated this app, the pictures are not as they are like on Instagram anymore and i really depended and loved this app for that reason. Sadly, I feel like I won't be using this app much anymore. Please, please, please update vsco so that the library (where you view your edited pictures) will go back to the way it used to be!!!"
3827,Ashtayash0813,"June 16, 2016",1,"The new interface. I've been using VSCO for a long time and it has been a big part of my photo editing and was my favorite app to edit out there, but until now. I honestly dislike the new interface, it's a big no from me and other people, it's messy and takes a lot of the screen space and I liked the old design WAY better. The square picture design was simple and amazing on so many levels and I would do anything to get it back, It was one of the reason why I loved VSCO. Updates are all about making a better user experience which makes me very disappointed at the new one. Please go back. Thank you. :)"
3828,Em Pag,"July 8, 2016",1,"Feel like an idiot Stupidly updated this app without reading any of the VASTLY negative reviews regarding the update. I was so close to keeping the old VSCO! Disappointed in myself and with VSCO. Don't they read their own customers reviews? I honestly still can't even find where the hell the editing part is. I spent a lot of money on all my presets! Where are they? People don't use this app for social media, they use it as a base to edit their photos. It used to be aesthetically pleasing, user friendly, and easy to use. NOW it's like a freaking maze!!! Where is everything. Trying to work this app makes me feel like I am tripping. This update must be some kind of joke."
3829,Bynio.alex,"May 1, 2017",3,HAS VSCOCAM FORGOTTEN IPOD USERS??? I've used VSCO for few years and I think this is a great app. I used this app to edit for most of my picture. But recently I feel it's a bit slower than usual which I think the always-on camera is the reason. It really annoys me. And when I download a picture the app always close and lag. I can't even save a single picture since the last two updates. I'm using ipod 5 and I hope you will fix these problems and make the app run faster for the convenient of all kind users
3830,Annaeeee,"December 25, 2015",5,"Best camera app I've come across! This is my go to camera app now. It is clean and simple, yet it has many manual controls that you can play around with without making the app look busy. I love the filters and other editing tools it has built in as well. I still use the default camera, but only when I want to occasionally take a live photo or take video. You have to try this app out."
3831,Hayleyywright,"February 20, 2016",5,Really love this app. I really love the app. I just started using it today and keep wanting to explore what else it has to offer. I really hope to see a future update where people are able to comment and give their opinions on the journal area. I want to start writing and feel this app would be perfect for what I'm going to start. Would love to see a more community feel to it as well. But other than that LOVE IT üòç
3832,toriiadams,"April 3, 2016",2,"What happened?? I loved this app and it worked great up until the most recent update. My explore page as well as my own profile weren't working so I tried deleting it and re-downloading it. But, when I went back in to my photo library on the app ALL of my pictures were gone. I had put a lot of pictures in there that I had edited and then deleted off of my phone's library which means that if the app isn't fixed or my vsco doesn't start working again, I'll probably never get those pictures back. Very disappointed in how this app went so downhill."
3833,SysC11,"May 19, 2016",4,posting a photo to edit should be easier I love this app. I feel like it gives me the freedom to post my artistic photos and express myself but I feel like there should be a tab in the main bar area to post a photo to edit. going to the library to find this was confusing at first when trying out the app. I also feel like you should be able to see who other people follow to get more vscos known. great app overall highly recommend!
3834,Boopabelle,"June 12, 2016",1,"Great app, TERRIBLE update VSCO has been my go-to camera and photo editing app for a few years now. It easily has the best filters and some of the most customizable and easy-to-use camera controls. "
3835,Tdrosed555678,"June 23, 2016",1,"Sloppy I understand that you guys wanted a fresh new look for VSCOcam but this is in the wrong direction. I found the update to be highly confusing. It took me a solid 5 minutes just to navigate out of the camera. The icons are no longer as descriptive as they used to be and I find the new camera roll to be extremely sloppy looking. I love using VSCO for its editing tools & features (not into the whole social aspect of it) and have been 100% loyal to VSCO since it first came out in beta but frankly this new update is having me on the lookout for a new photo app. Please fix your mess VSCO! I miss how everything used to be separated, organized, and easily navigated!"
3836,TeRe1972,"June 24, 2016",3,"Great filters.  Horrible app. I'm a professional photographer by trade. I use VSCO for my color client photos. I used to use these filters on all my personal iphone photos.  They are the best in the app store.  However, very VSCO update makes the app less and less intuitive.  It's difficult to navigate and things once simple like importing are now impossible.  They're pushing their focus on their community albums which I have no interest in.   The most recent update has me wanting to delete it altogether.  Lame.  Don't fix what isn't broken."
3837,Jswizzle1234,"June 29, 2016",4,"Change the way published images look on profile!! It was a little difficult at first to understand how to switch between your personal vsco to the feed, but other than that all around great app! It would be cool if the published images we have on our page were set up like the studio for others to see (3 side by side instead of just 1), or to at least have that option to change to our personal preference"
3838,Medcaat,"July 24, 2016",4,"VSCO is great This is my number one app, However, we should start about complaining about something that actually matters. We are to worried about the interface and how it looks. Are you there to stare at the interface, or edit your pictures? Now, about editing pictures. When i put a certain filter like HB1 and increase the clarity, it gives me some small noticable boxes. Its not sharp, if you guys could fix this that would be AWESOME. Thanks for creating such a great app."
3839,Harrison Wieland,"December 6, 2016",5,"Another update but... I'm not always a fan of the always evolving UI, when there's too many changes to warrant the new interface - but this one warrants it. The updated controls make editing a lot more precise, which I appreciate immensely. I had to learn how to rearrange my presets (touch and hold) - but after that I'm set. Thank you for more control over our pictures, and a more consistent UI. Amazing as always."
3840,Daniel Mendoza,"August 8, 2013",5,"By photographers, for photographers Yes there have been issues in the past with the app crashing but they have been fixed. The preloaded filters are great and the ability to expand is very useful. Overall the design is easy to use with clever ways to access the menus. The new social media integration is something that was lacking in the previous 99 cent version which has been resolved."
3841,Plantersofpeace.org,"September 13, 2013",5,"It just keeps getting better! VSCOcam had already become my ""go-to-cam"" and my editing app of choice, and the refinements just keep making it better! For one it is easy to make my pictures look great! Secondly, this is the easiest camera app to teach anyone how to take great pictures! I love being able to talk to someone who wants to take great pictures with their phone, and in a handful of steps that are easy to remember with the intuitive controls in the app, they are a budding iPhoneographer! "
3842,tylerlovesapples,"May 5, 2014",4,"Quite top notch, but missing a couple things The filters are excellent however I wish we had a little more fine control over some of the tones... Perhaps a histogram is in order. Having an iPad app would actually make this app my primary photo editor. I have purchased all the filter packs and I want a combination of the brilliant tones in the C category with the muted blacks in the F category."

3844,Megrenee55,"October 1, 2015",2,"Unusable for Me This was my favorite app, used it daily for all my photos. I'm a photographer and I import my RAW images through it because Adobe doesn't support importing raw images yet. I'd edit in VSCO then export wherever needed. Well, thanks to the new update, images that are a size larger than whatever device you're using VSCO on, if it's larger than what that camera is capable of taking, it won't upload due to size constraints. Now, this app that I've used religiously for a year is worthless to me. Disappointed in VSCO. Let me know when an update happens where I can upload RAW images again. Thanks"
3845,Random user #123456789,"July 2, 2016",1,"This new update is terrible The new VSCO up date is impossible to use, the only thing I figured out since updating a month ago was how to scroll down my news feed. This app was good in the beginning, confusing, yes but it was tolerable and I was able to figure it out within a few days. This new update has made it nearly impossible to upload photos to my profile. I personally won't be using this app anymore, and I can tell the users that I follow don't use it anymore either because I haven't seen updated photos from them since the update. Hope VSCO changes things around and makes this app better."

I've been a VERY faithful custom since 2013 and I've gotten so many people into downloading your app. Trust me I'm team VSCO, but come on guys. This new update is killing me. I can't figure out how to do this. Is there directions maybe we can have? Because I don't understand how to use it and maybe I am just bad with this kind of stuff, but I'm usually not this incompetent. However, this app makes me feel a little bit like a failure because I can't figure out this stupid update. I miss the old VSCO."
3847,IreniRB,"September 4, 2016",3,"Good app but not good enough I would have given this app 5 stars but I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a frames section and it would make me download a different app just to put a frame I mean i would rate this app if this app had more filters and frames instead of making us download a new app and I would also like if this app had like editing face features like teeth whitener, hides blemishes and any other sort of thing then I think people would like this app way more"

Until recently, the past month, I haven't been able to edit, delete, or even view more than half of the pictures in my vsco library. I thought the pictures were not loading because it was just my phone running out of memory but after a month of dealing with this situation and the app constantly freezing, I'm done trying. Goodbye vsco until this fixes itself and thankfully I saved most of my pictures on Google drive beforehand."
3849,Jfjdidisjsbshsi,"February 6, 2017",5,"Had to write this I never like to write reviews but I honestly had to support VSCO. VSCO is probably the best photo editor I've ever had. It doesn't just add a filter to the photo but, makes it real, alive, and have more meaning. The edits are clean and doesn't make the photo look like it's trying to hard. Sure, some filter packs cost money but they are totally worth it. I can easily say that I love VSCO and wouldn't want any other app."

Last night I uploaded a picture already saved on my iPhone 5c. I tried to uploaded another, and I could not find the option anywhere again. If it's a setting problem, I made sure I allow the app to see my photos and use my camera, but it's still giving me no option. Anything I can do on that?"
3851,sdotbailey,"March 19, 2015",5,"Stunning and wonderful to use I absolutely love this app. I've got it on my phone as well and it lives on the dock for the phone and iPad. The tools provided are solid for editing and really do give you a lot of control. The only knock I have is that the app grows in size ridiculously. It'd be great to have some kind of cache killer or way to keep the app a manageable size. Regardless of that, you need this app on your devices immediately."
3852,Bow Madera,"May 17, 2015",3,"Adding more features, but beginning to be unstable I‚Äôve been using VSCO Cam since the first version. I have an iPhone 4s, and refuse to upgrade until it stops working. VSCO Cam used to be rock-solid stable, never had an issue or crash. Now it crashes frequently. If I don‚Äôt give it long enough to process between pictures, CRASH (plus the last two photos will be lost). If I try to send too many photos to my camera roll, CRASH. It‚Äôs quite frustrating. If it didn‚Äôt have stability issues I‚Äôd give it 5 stars."
3853,Fix pyro please!,"October 29, 2015",3,"Don't like the new update! I really enjoy this app and love that it takes away public followers that let people get judged. However, I liked the old format of the grid when the photos were closer together. Now the photos are too far apart and the entire format makes me upset. Go back to the old aesthetic!!!! I would also kind of like to have the option of connecting to contacts to maybe get in touch with my friend's accounts and still have a small amount of social media aspect in this."
3854,sebjamin,"December 6, 2015",5,"truly a wonder I adore this app and all the features it has to offer, including the lovely layout of your own personal grid, though I do miss the old layout. The new one is nice, just less aesthetically pleasing than the last one where pictures are sidled up next to each other. This app practically runs on aesthetics, so maybe there could be an option as to the layout of the personal grids."
3855,Batman1357,"June 9, 2016",1,"Not a fan of the new update I really enjoy using the VSCO platform, but the ecosystem in the new update is just frustrating and not very ergonomic. It looks decently good, but using it is just a pain. The slotted button at the bottom of the screen would be interesting as an additional form of navigation, but not the primary form. The app is hard to navigate and can easily be confusing. All I want is to be able to share photos and to view photos in a clean, smooth way, which this update doesn't allow. Overall, the VSCO team has changed the app in a way that ultimately just makes the user experience less enjoyable."
3856,BabySJC8,"June 10, 2016",2,"New Updateüëéüèª The reason I use VSCO is for my Instagram feed. I picked VSCO because it gave me a good idea of how my feed would look once on Instagram. This new update doesn't size them the right way, and isn't as comfortable to use. I find that the other way, navigation is simple and quick. Learning this new way is a lot more uncomfortable. I loved the old design and really want it back. I also wish that a feature would be included to rearrange photos into the desired order. I kindly ask to reconsider the old design. I would be much happier and so would countless other VSCO users."
3857,ianknows,"June 10, 2016",5,"Disappointing. How do I access my photos? This is literally my favorite app on my phone, but this new UI has made it almost impossible to navigate within the app. Furthermore, the inability to access my saved photos is EXTREMELY disconcerting. I have over three years' worth of photos saved in my Library on this app. Can someone provide me with some information on how to navigate to my Library? Thanks."
3858,Pantelisak,"June 11, 2016",4,"Great Update I'm a big fan of how the app has evolved. VSCOs interface has always been a bit cryptic, and sometimes a bit hard to learn as a result‚Äîthough in ways it is what makes the app endearing. The new interface seems to streamline the product concept to make the idea of making/discovering a lot easier to grasp and use, while not losing any of the minimalist UI that makes VSCO great. Looking forward to them streamlining some of the editing interactions in future releases!"
3859,bring back custom locations,"June 16, 2016",1,"Go back to the good old days! VSCO used to be my favorite photo editing app! It was minimal but still user friendly and visually appealing. However, in the past year the updates have gradually made this into an ugly, difficult to use app. VSCO, please listen to your users and stop the horrible redesign! Go back to how you were in 2014 before you switched to this weird version with tiny pictures, bad backgrounds, and odd layouts. I stopped looking at the grid when you changed the layout and stuck solely to my own library, but now that you have destroyed the library layout as well, I can't even get myself to use this app anymore."
3860,Phaedralabh,"August 12, 2013",4,"So far it's cool... I just downloaded the app and upgraded with the bundle of filters. I like the filters and the ways to edit but I really wish I could see the filters as I'm taking the picture. The photo could get a different angle, lighting, etc if I knew what it was going to look like with certain filters. That's one thing that will make a difference for me, I really hope my big purchase was worth it and that's a feature that will come soon."
3861,lovexlee,"September 11, 2013",3,"Good but I was a huge fan of the old app, and while I was upset they removed the vignette option, I was still pleased that I got the new presets and was able to keep my old ones. My only issue that brings this to a 3 star rating is that I cannot use certain presets, new and old, without it freezing my phone an requiring a hard reset. It's disappointing every time I use C1 and just recently P6 which in my opinion is somewhat similar, has caused my phone to lock up. Hopefully I'm not the only one with this issue?"

Tons of features, but missing the mark for being outstanding because for some reason they didn't include a zoom option in camera mode. You would think this option would be default by now so I'm not quite sure why they left it out. Also, the user interface is a bit tedious and confusing at times. Fix these two things and the app would be stellar!"

I have multiple journals at this point and I love being able to post picture on them that I wouldn't post on Instagram. HOWEVER, there is a problem with posting edited photos to your journals. I try to crop my photos and post the cropped picture on my journal, but it just goes back to the original! All of the editing is still there, but it isn't cropped. This is extremely annoying. Please fix this!"

Also the fact that you have to go all the way to the vsco account's collection to see the photos published to vsco makes me not want to take the time to look at the photos. It should be easier and more convenient to access these photos or people will stop looking at them.
3866,Pixelpushaaaa,"June 9, 2016",1,Used to be good Everyone hates change. I really considered that before writing this review of version 5.
3867,pgrace!!!!,"June 9, 2016",2,"Complex and Confusing I use VSCO all the time and I don't think that this recent update is up to par with what the app was before. Instead of having a side panel to get to your library it's the home screen and to get anywhere else you have to slide this circle, which makes me confused on which way to slide. I obviously prefer the sidebar. Also when you take a selfie with the app, it puts a weird abstract face on your face, which could be cool but I think it's kinda weird... I like the old set up better; it was simpler and user friendly which I hope VSCO can put back into their app."
3868,Anahfucj,"December 19, 2016",5,Love this app but... I absolutely love this app. I use it to edit all my pictures for Instagram and making my own theme and I've loved it up till now. The issue is that when I use a filter or try to turn up the saturation or any other feature it makes it hard setting the number of it too exactly 7 or 8 because of the 7.1-7.9 it should return to only numbers not decimals.
3869,TenaciousTP,"August 28, 2017",4,"Brilliant, yet flawed app Though, in essence, it's perhaps the best app on the market for pure, unadulterated digital photography IMO, it seems to be lacking an innately intuitive UI. It gets a little annoying to navigate through all of its features via ""aesthetic,"" yet somewhat ambiguous buttons. The organization of the features themselves could also be further streamlined. Nonetheless, it serves as a great medium for personal portfolios of pictures, video, and journals. It's great but it could be better."

3872,number1instagramfan,"November 23, 2014",4,"What happened to my filters ): Don't get me wrong, VSCO cam is literally the app I use every time i'am about to post a picture up on Instagram. However, I just got a new phone and I have to download the VSCO cam. When I did, my filters that I've brought for $6.99 weren't there anymore. I tried restoring my purchases but it just wouldn't give me back the filters I've brought. Please fix this problem, I really don't want to have to buy a new pack again."
3873,15krotty,"July 17, 2015",4,"Love but... I absolutely love this app and probably spend way too much time on it... But one of the things I loved was the image quality and after the latest update where they added resolution options during export, my in-app quality of my pictures went down. I used to be able to zoom in on my pictures and it would sharpen and you could still see amazing detail but now it just stays grainy like its a screenshot. Please fix!"
3874,Meghan Taylor,"March 10, 2016",5,"Superb. Filters are amazing and set the mood for each individual photo. They further enhance the beauty and help bring out the prominent physical feature in the picture. There's a variety of filters that create a plethora of moods from soft and airy to bright and vibrant. All pictures, ranging from soft hues of whites and pale plants, to the rainforest of Hawaii can be captured through VSCO. I love having the ability to capture my life through these pictures."
3875,_Music-Lover_,"May 4, 2016",3,Okay... The app is pretty good. It has a lot of editing features and plenty of filters. 
3876,BlakesVogue,"June 10, 2016",1,"VSCO WHY? I honestly feel like this is the worst user ""friendly"" update ever. It feels like the focus on the photo editing was taken away to bring the social media aspect of the app to the forefront. While I think you could of kept the same interface but made better improvements to the social media aspect of the app. Instead of a whole new re-design I wish there was a way to undo the update on my phone because the photos are hard to view and not easy to see on the iPhone they look so small and the space between them is unnecessary. No option to change the sizes like the last interface."
3877,Hannahcayeaa,"June 12, 2016",1,"awful The new update is horrendous. We can't filter out edited and unedited pictures anymore and it all looks messy, complicated and disorganized. I am so disappointed with this update. Bring back grids for the profiles and for the love of god please separate the my vsco and the camera library!!!!!! This is so so bad. The black background and all the crowded icons is the complete opposite of the vsco simplistic white. I hate that my collected images are now an icon in my library and I can no longer filter unedited and edited pictures. So disappointing! I have no idea how to even view my feed anymore. this used to be my favorite photo app and now its so bad."
3878,Christmas435,"March 28, 2017",5,"I LOVE IT!! It's a very easy to use editing app that allows you to share your photos with others.  If you like taking pictures, you don't even have to be good, VSCO is perfect for you. I didn't buy any of the other extensions, and I'm happy with it just the same. VSCO makes it very easy to edit simple photos-and make them look professional. I defiantly think you should give this app a try!!"

3882,Jonlarsen,"February 28, 2014",5,Best photo editing app on iTunes. So far the best photo editing app I've come across. It has every essential tool for dialing in your photos without going overboard with too many advanced controls. The picture styles / filters are very tasteful and can be adjusted to be very subtle or extreme. I rarely write reviews. But I feel like this one deserves it. Thanks for the constant development of this app. It gets better every update.
3883,Nitmandiro,"June 8, 2014",5,This is by far the best filter app I tried a lot photo editing bit this one is my favourite one. It gives you so much opportunities for editing. You can apply heaps of filters and afterwards you can even adjust the filters which gives so many different editing possibilities. A must have for hobby photographer. There is just one point: the design of the main menu could be better

When im gonna add filters from the store, it only loads zoomed things and i cant click the ""free"" or those cents that you should click in order to go to another page and add the filter. But if i press the filter it shows a bunch of text and theres no option for me to add the filter there. PLEASE HELP. Im using an ipad 2. Look i really LOOOOVE vsco but my filters are just the basics thats why i use rookie when i wanted a little more filters so please help me."
3885,Someone who likes whitening,"June 27, 2016",1,"PLEASE GET RID OF THIS UPDATE I really hate this update. I used to love this app but now I have mixed feelings. I feel like when you put up this update you made a wrong turn. I don't like now how you can see all the different sizes of the photos and how the photos are more spaced out. I also feel like it's harder to navigate to places then it was before. So basically I hate everything about this update. You can always make a u-turn and go back to the way things used to be, or you can make a button that lets us go back to before the update. When ever I open the app now I get disappointed and close it out. Please, PLEASE GET RID OF THE UPDATE!!!!!!!!"
3886,Blake1098765432,"March 6, 2017",3,"Mixed feelings This app has an awesome picture editing studio... but that's about it. The social aspect is severely lacking. It's more like posting into the dark. None of my friends have the app, and only popular pages appear on the recommended area. So I have one follower, so far, after a month. Maybe the app just needs more time to mature and I realize they don't want to be like IG, but figure out another way to be more social within the app. I'm not giving up hope, and will continue to use it. Give it a try!"
3887,mmmarissy,"May 24, 2017",3,"Love app, but can be confusing sometimes Have ALWAYS loved this app & the editing you could do with it. But honestly, the overall set up is confusing and not easy to function. Wish things like deleting pictures or journals ere easier & having access to all the photos on my camera roll instead of downloading them into the app and then editing. To many in between steps! I'd use the app more for journaling if it was more easier to use and figure out."

3889,MommaUnicorn,"August 30, 2017",2,Says NOTHING about in app or memberships in the description So I read this is a great photo app so I downloaded it to see how well it works. Than I get this right after I download and open it.  Start your free trail membership.  Also seem to like to takeover your camera even though you told it not to. That's a problem people. It was still going in the background in this app after I change to their studio setting. You also might want to check the like 5 page agreement. Not really sure it also seem very confusing to try to use.
3890,LWC_Photo,"July 2, 2013",5,Great app - one small fixable problem I just live this app- it has quickly become my favorite mobile photo app. The only issue I have is that when I delete and image from my library in the app it leaves behind a black empty image that I cannot edit or delete. Right now I have 5 images and 15 black empty dead squares. Makes navigation in library a small but hopefully fixable issue
3891,SergCaballero,"February 18, 2014",5,"Cutting Edge Camera for the iPhone Honestly, I have not had any issues with VSCOcam. Since I installed it, last year, the app has delivered its claim of being the standard of mobile photography. This app is simply not a photoshop app or editing app. There are apps for those things available. This app is about cutting edge photography on the iPhone and creating, not just capturing, moments that inspire and encourage others. That is the power of VSCOcam."
3892,Sashaiserezha,"December 16, 2014",4,"Tap zones! Hey! UX not the best, but the main problem is tap zones. Compare instagram app and vsco. When you try to customize some effect controls are don't respond. Sometimes you need to tap few times to catch control icon. Look at insta app and you'll see that there is much easier to put effects and control them. Me and my friend use vsco for editing photo. We use controls very often. So please, do something to improve this. "
3893,deejaydrew,"June 4, 2015",3,"Love it, but lacking information.. I absolutely love this app. The filters are fantastic, the structure, the purpose, great! Only thing left that I would like to know are the dimensions of uploading photos that have been taken with a DSLR camera to contain the photographs true quality. I tried uploading a really hi-res photo through my iMac that was taken with my Canon, but the quality was diminished. It looked very obvious. Please hand out information for max photo dimension upload! Would be useful and would change my review to 5 stars!"

3897,Alxmrtnz,"June 21, 2016",1,"Great Filters, Absolutely Terrible Design This app was pretty frustrating to use before the latest update, but this newest version takes its UI design to a terribly bad new level. It's so difficult to use due to design choices that were surely made for aesthetic reasons over usability. It was already difficult enough to memorize every icon with a lack of accompanying text, but now the team at VSCO is replacing simple submit action icons (like a check mark) with circles, making it even less intuitive than it already was. "
3898,Sswim4life,"June 24, 2016",2,"Extremely hard to use and confusing The app has nice filters and displays pictures in a modern fashion but the format of the app is absolutely horrible. I was stalking people and accidentally saving them to my library or something and when the new app updated I posted it on accident and deleted it right after.

Takes up storage but it's worth the space.

3905,Haileeym,"October 26, 2015",3,"Updates are terrible Starting to wonder if the developers ever read or care about the reviews, or even use their own app. Surely they themselves would have trouble navigating vsco after the recent updates. To clarify, I LOVE vsco. It is by far the best photography app out there. However, the recent updates have been downright awful. So confusing to the point of not being able to use the app. I'm still loyal, but they need to make some changes. Hoping they will considering all the negative feedback."
3906,tiffanythere,"October 26, 2015",3,"Used to be better I used to really enjoy going on vsco because viewing pictures was so much easier. I still enjoy the filters and scrolling down my feed or looking through my own profile, but now it's all over the place. I miss viewing photos taking up most of the screen instead of a smaller picture on the left or right corner. Same goes for looking at my own account. Now I have to click the picture to see the whole picture."

But VSCO is my absolute favorite app for my photo editing app, I have it on all of my iPhones and iPads. I edited all of my photos taken from Sony a6000 for quick showing and share on social media. Now, the app was already simplicity enough, the new update ruined all. It's un-usable. The gesture isn't not user friendly, not intuitive. You're not Instagram and please don't try to be one. Be what you good at! Bring back the old interface or develop something similar to what we had before. Until then. I'm going to use Lightroom and Snapseed. Sorry not sorry."

I just had to redownload the app today and when I signed back into my account it did not save any of my photos. Even though they were in my account.

3909,nique110,"January 13, 2017",5,Back again! After I thought this app couldn't get any better the update just proved me wrong..the added RAW feature makes the need of DSLR quality in the palm of your hands and with the added enhancements to the user interface it makes the experience that much better..if I could give 10 stars I would..Sincerely satisfied customer(again lol)
3910,Sadaton,"March 23, 2014",4,"Great photography app A social photography app that puts more focus on good visual aesthetics and the art of photography. The filters are high quality and with some good design and photo editing knowledge they have the potential to create some gorgeous images. The layout is slick, but could be a bit more intuitive.

3912,ekawsek,"September 30, 2015",3,"New design is not intuitive or user friendly Whoever designed the UI of the app needs lessons in user experience. In an effort to be minimalist, VSCO lost its user-friendliness. I used to be able to copy paste edits with a two clicks, now it takes three and a scroll-down. I don't even know what the minimalist icons mean. They don't symbolize anything. I don't want the 'upload to grid' icon to be in the middle. Who uses that anyway? VSCO, Please fix the interface. Giving this three stars only because the filters are still ok."
3913,Emwhen,"November 20, 2015",5,"Yes I love this app. I love the way keeps the quality of the photos. I love that all of the editing tools and filters add weight and feeling to my images rather than take away from them. I love the idea of being able to share your work and be recognized for it while not allowing the ""social"" part to get in the way. I only edit photos with this because it meets all my needs."
3914,MNKOMODEE,"April 2, 2016",4,"Well designed minimalism. Fresh feeling. Absorbs quickly and easily. Good editing workflow. Filters cover the desired spectrum of 2016. Tweaking is limited to a smart stopping place. Eyes can't accurately rate further subtleties. Takes about an hour to figure out the different upload streams to grid, journal and collections. Porous social media externally and internally. Really like this app in an honest way. Would give 5* but I feel there should be more layout choices for presentation or journal."
3915,sydawesome2000,"June 10, 2016",1,"Disappointed I've been a user of VSCO for years, and I can see why people who are new to vsco say that the app is confusing, and hard to get used to, but this new update is just horrendous. When I think of VSCO, I think of a giant grid in my library, and I enjoy looking at the collection of other people's work as well, but when you minimize it to just one photo that you have to click on, it takes away the point of VSCO that I love. The old version was perfect, easy to understand, and easy to edit. Now, the up, down, right, left, is more confusing than any of the previous updates. BRING BACK THE OLD VSCO THAT WE ALL LOVE."

To me, VSCOcam has two purposes: to supply awesome presets and tools to edit photos (which is still great), and to present the square homepage to arrange photos so they look their best when I upload them to Instagram. The fact that the new version of the app did away with the square feed is a huge disappointment to me, and if I could find an alternative application to use, I would. In conclusion: still love the filters and tools, hate the new homepage."
3917,tayyluhhx,"June 27, 2016",1,"Confusing update, incredibly difficult to navigate I have absolutely loved VSCO since I downloaded it and have used it since as my go-to iPhone photography app. However, this new update is incredibly confusing and difficult to navigate. While I understand that change is good, this is not the case. A layout can be both seamless and easy to use, and this layout falls so far from that. I hope VSCO keeps to their theme of sleek design, however, they must also remember user intuition and go forward with that in mind. Kudos to those who can understand the app from first glance, because I sure am not one of them."

It was easy to use, and looked great. This new update is horrible! I find that it makes the app more confusing, and not as enjoyable. I feel like I don't know where anything is, and it's just not the same. I will still continue to use the app, because it still is one of the best photo apps out there (in my opinion). The new update is just annoying, and would prefer the old one back, or an easier set-up."

It is just clunky. Once I'm editing the photo, it is ok, but going to share the photo as a Flickr user upsets me to no end. They are steering users to use the camera within the app and share photos on VSCO site. The icons are not self explanatory. There isn't any Flickr integration-- I have to save to camera roll first or email.  Please re think and reengineer the interface."
3920,Gurrmon,"June 10, 2013",2,"I love the app not the bugs I finally got the Editing tools to show up (there was only a black bar at first) after downloading it a second time. It still does not show me the previews of the filters like my friends and it also completely washes out my pictures when I export them? If I make any slight change to brightness or fade, it seems to completely fade it out once it finishes exporting, but it shows the normal non-washed out image in the VSCO library. If you can fix that, I'll be using this app like crazy, but until then... Not worth the aggravation."
3921,SuperSpumoni,"May 19, 2014",1,"Update: too buggy, color unpredictable Update: whatever last update seems to have broken the app. Colors act up really randomly when editing. There's no pattern to it, just random glitch when using detailed edit functions. It's practically unusable.. Fix soon please.

That is all I have for now!!"

When my account is there, my photos are in my library, but not my grid (when I had previously uploaded them to the grid).

(In feed view) And I really don't mind the new way the features are laid out, I just really want the images to go back to the original size and I want a settings option where instead of a black ground I can choose white or some other color.

They have many useful filters to choose from, of course you can buy more. The only issue I have with this app is the layout. When I upload images I am to edit I was  able to see if either images go well together, side by side. I upload my pictures to Instagram and I have a feed to maintain so this whole layout isn't working for me and I enjoyed the previous one. So Vsco Cam, please bring it back."

3931,Jennalvs2dance,"December 11, 2015",2,"Good concept Love the concept of the app and the ability to create gifs with DSCO. But there are definitely some major flaws. First, the app is not user friendly whatsoever. It's extremely hard to figure out to get from one part of the app to another. Second, I would recommend combining the two apps so you can easily create and post gifs in one app. Lastly, it's hard to find friends. It would be easier if you could also search by email/phone number/nearby. I hope VSCO fixes these major issues in order to create a better app."
3932,SofiaSilv,"June 9, 2016",4,"Great but needs change I love VSCO, it's a great place to share your artsy side with your friends who also enjoy artsy photos. Not only is it good for sharing, but it's also good for editing. I use to have several editing apps but this one is all I need now. However, the display of your photos is very awkward to people viewing them. I wish it had a better layout when viewing other people photos, other than that this app is great!"

I've had vsco for a few years now and I love the filters and settings you can use to change your photos. Although, I was disappointed when the format was changed a few days ago. The old format was perfect for making sure your photos matched for Instagram. It was "
3934,aetherlux,"June 16, 2016",1,"I love VSCO, hate this update. I have used VSCO for quite some time and I appreciate that they are trying to innovate, but I believe that this was too much of a change too quickly. I wish they would have rolled out these updates as iteration and built a user knowledge of how it functioned. I am finding it very difficult to navigate and I am very frustrated that VSCO continues to try to push me into using it in a social capacity. I am so frustrated in fact that I have found myself using this app less and less. The same can be said for their DSCO app, I would love to use it but I don't want to be forced into sharing my content."

It looks normal in the editing mode but I'm dissatisfied with the way the picture ends up being viewed when posted. Please fix this problem asap. I deleted the app not knowing I'd loose all my photos with it to try and correct the stretched photo problem. Made me very frustrated! Please fix as soon as possible because I love this app!

With this app all of those flaws are gone and what is left is the essence of the PERFECT editing app! The filters and, what's more, various advanced parameters of the pictures that can be changed with this app are very easy to apply. This is the one app that will stay on my phone FOREVER!"

I have loved thus app and has been my favourite editing photo app. However I was editing a photo and then when I tried saving it it just hangs an no it doesn't crash like other apps that brings you back to the home screen but it just stays it doesn't save at all it just freezes and basically you can't do anything about it. You have to wait for almost 10 mins for your iPhone to restart by itself and goes into normal but PLEASE don't try saving it again as it just does the same thing. This app should definitely have an update!!!
3943,Teresa Harding,"November 13, 2014",5,"Love it For the longest time I couldn't change my profile picture and even contacted you for help and even tried a different device but nothing. Now that this just got a new update I can finally change my profile picture again üòÉ it would be nice however to see who follows you and comment on other people's posts and stuff, just an idea."
3944,Cindyers,"December 30, 2014",5,Best App Ever! I Tried many editing apps over the years for my photos but this is the first time I actually liked how it turned out to be! I love how it gives an effect that you feel like a professional photographer. Also i would like if there would have a reflection button to flip the picture the opposite. But overall I like to recommend this app to everyone.
3945,hydratedheaux,"January 17, 2015",5,"Professional looking photos VSCO Cam made me love photography. Before, I would put my pictures into terrible editing apps and they would look so childlike no matter how hard I try. But with VSCO, it's easy and effortless to have amazing looking photos. Expert tools to make my somewhat bad photos look like amazing. Now I take photos all the time and they look so good. I always get compliments on them"
3946,Netslacker,"October 14, 2015",2,Bassackwards UI make it nearly unusable. I've been reading about VSCO for a while so I decided to give it a try tonight. After two hours of fighting with the app I can say that it's the most backwards and confusing UI I've ever used on my phone. It's not intuitive at all and for this reason alone I will not be returning to it. 
3947,SandyRose14,"December 13, 2016",5,"Why the new layout?!? What happened to the layout? Why'd it have to change? I loved this app because of it and how simple it was to change the setting of tools by 1's but now you had to ruin that by being able to put with decimal points after, its now as basic as every other photography app! Please bring back the old simple black VSCO!"
3948,DLP1987,"June 25, 2017",5,Did you buy presets before this update? Well congrats! They are unusable now without joining VSCO X! Did you happen to buy all of the presets to use? Well now you can't go back to your work on a photo later without being asked to join VSCO X. If you start to edit again you have to do everything all over again. Money down the drain apparently!

VSCO is the app for that ! I adore this app . It seems complicated to use at first but once I got the hang of it , I started editing my whole camera roll, LOL . After 2 days of using this app, I've already chosen my favorite filter ( P5 ) !!"

I use an iPhone 4, and I love the app I use it to edit all my photos and I'm never let down until recently when it has been crashing and giving me unknown errors. My phone is completely updated to iOS 7.0.6, it's not compatibility it's something within the app. I hope that vsco will update it so I can can continue to use this freaking awesome app!"
3951,Wylie I,"December 24, 2014",5,Best Camera App Around This is my favorite app to use because the features are endless! You can make portraits look stunning and landscape shots look absolutely beautiful. It's very easy to navigate through and it doesn't push a ton of ads on you like most apps. This is a 10/10 product and I recommend it to every who likes to take good pictures. Happy holidays.
3952,capedape,"January 29, 2015",3,"Filters are good but navigation is terrible The way the filters are labeled and laid out, it makes them more time than it's worth to use them. I have been a photo and app nut for years, out of thousands of apps this has some of the better filters while at the same time one of the worst interfaces. "
3953,Lbenford3,"July 10, 2015",3,Nice app but I like the app but it would great if you could see who follow you and see how many people follow. Also be able to receive feedback from followers. The number of followers and feedback does not have to be seen by others. I love that it isn't like Instagram where popularity rule. You  just post for likes and followers not the art. Here you find great photographers but can't give them praise for their work or interact with them. I will definitely like to compliment work and interact with followers.
3954,Claire514,"September 19, 2015",4,"So far I love it... BUT I have a request/tip I think if you're going to make us pay for preset packs, we should be able to see the ORIGINAL photo to compare to the preset filter example. This would really allow me to get an idea of the true filter ability vs just showing me this beautiful image. How do I know how much is the filter without knowing what the original looked like?! Would probably purchase more filters if I could!!"

I have an iPhone 6s, and it looks as if the clarity is about the same as an iPhone 4 camera after I'm done applying any VSCO filter. I started using Pomelo Cam instead, because the clarity of the photos stayed the same even with intense filters and edits. but even with one simple filter on VSCO, my photos looked blurrier and less clear, less high-quality. it's pretty disappointing considering I've paid for several filter packs and they literally ruin my photos."
3956,The blue crew,"June 9, 2016",2,"I hate the new update I love this app! So easy to edit photos in the most beautiful way, and love sharing with my friends. It was quick, easy, and fun, now not so much. That circle at the bottom which makes its the only way between pages is absolutely annoying. And it's hard to view my library. It was easy to see you page and your feed and your own photos all with one quick swipe left. Now is a bunch of clicking and sliding. I'm hate to see this happen to something I loved ... Hopefully a new (older) change will come"
3957,naaatcook,"June 16, 2016",1,"BRING BACK THE OLD VSCO Pleaseeee bring back the old VSCO. I don't know if the people behind this update wanted to change the layout because they thought it was better or if they did it because they don't like the idea that people are using their app to help them layout their Instagram (it's unintended purpose?). Either way the new update is TERRIBLE. Besides the fact that you can't lay your pictures out side by side (like a preview of your Instagram feed), it is also INCREDIBLY HARD TO USE! I have no idea how to navigate my way around and it's reallllyyyy confusing. Editors please change it back to the previous version! Thanks"
3958,meglie7,"July 2, 2016",1,"Not user friendly Downloaded the app to see what all the hype was about but couldn't figure out what was going on. The controls were hard to use and I was constantly stuck in an editing queue or something. It was hard to find my actual profile, even harder to find my feed, and I couldn't get back to my page once I DID find my feed. Very confusing. Won't be downloading again unless I hear that there's a big change. From the reviews, it seems as though vosco hasn't been listening to their costumers which will certainly come back to haunt them if they aren't careful."
3959,SwagCashYmcmb666,"July 3, 2016",1,"Terrible. Update is extremely strenuous, navigating through the app has never been more impractical, the separation and plane of grey space between the photos in your library is awful. I (and many others) used VSCO to apply presets and preview how a photo would look on my Instagram feed before it was actually uploaded, now the whole idea behind that has completely went right out the window. Can't believe this entire design and interface actually got approved. Thanks VSCO, the old design was great, now it's actually horrendous. Won't be using anymore. Maybe I'll try again next big update."
3960,2ndServings,"June 17, 2013",2,"Needs a serious stability update The updated app itself is one of the best photo processing apps available. Unfortunately it's currently hampered by serious stability issues, most notably constant crashing while accessing or saving to the photo library. Also applying certain image editing options cause hard crashes, which VSCO cannot recover from (requires reinstall). I've had uninstall and reinstall this app over 12x now since purchasing the full filter pack, with hopes an updater fulfills the potential more than hinted between crashes."
3961,bobbynormcore,"August 23, 2013",5,"Best filters out there I have tried pretty much every photo editing app and I have paid for a bunch of them. In terms of filters, this is BY FAR the best editing app. This app doesn't have as many features as others but if you can take a good picture, these filters will make it even better without going over the top like all other editing apps."
3962,Celina Hidajat,"February 15, 2014",4,"Great but... I love vscocam but for some reason, I'm now unable to upload pictures from my camera roll into the app to edit. It pops up a message on how I do not have enough memory on my phone, which I checked and is not the case. I redownloaded the app but the same pop up came up. I've been using it for more than 8 months, and have been satisfied with its service thus far, but I really hope they fix this bug soon!"
3963,AinhoaPH,"June 11, 2016",1,"Hate the new update I've never written a review on the App Store before because I've never had a reason to but with this update, I do. I hate it so much. It's confusing and hard to navigate. What I dislike the most is that I can no longer use the app for my Instagram feed. I used to have my entire Instagram feed synced and I would sync pictures that I wanted to post to see how they looked. I can no longer do this because there is no longer a synced/edited/unedited/all feature and the pictures aren't in a square anymore. I love this app so I really hope they change it back to the way it was."
3964,McKenzie.Carlile,"June 12, 2016",1,"Really bizarre and pretentious update VSCO cam has always had a bit of a learning curve, but this latest update completely stumped me. It's hard for me to imagine what problem the designers of this product were trying to solve by introducing a completely new interaction pattern. Even after going through the first-run tutorial experience, I have no idea where my content is located and how I can interact with it. I'd like to see an update that addresses these very large pain points and hope that VSCO will take a more human-centered approach to building their product. Until then, I'm out."
3965,Misguided ambition,"June 13, 2016",1,"Best filter app on iOS l, terrible interface iPad version, syncing, able to copy workflows to other photos, non destructive within the app, and decent amount of tools. The filters are the best I found and I tried faded, enlight, afterlight, polarr, ps express, rookie, and so many others. The only reason I gave 1 star is The interface makes navigating the app so difficult I stopped using it. They are trying to be Instagram, and I get that. But make a separate app for your social media platform and make vsco cam just a photo editing app. Stop forcing your social media platform on paying users that bought a filter/ editing app."
3966,Anaba1030,"June 6, 2017",1,"Dissapointed I love this app when it comes to design, presets, editing, etc. It's amazing. Recently however my iphone was acting up and they had to do a factory reset at T-mobile when I took it there. Thinking that all my photos were going to be saved in my account I wasn't worried at all, only to find that I had lost years of memories. I had no photos in my camera roll because all were here and now they're gone. Fix this. If I have an account with you why isn't my library backed up when I login???? Useless. What do I want to make an account for then??? Thanks for nothing."
3967,Drewd29,"June 17, 2017",4,"More powerful editing tools! VSCO is my main photo editing app and my biggest wish for it right now is for more powerful editing tools. They seem limited such as the inability to darken shadows or increase highlights. They only work in to decrease each one. Custom curves would be very useful. Please also add rotation support when viewing images in the discovery page, this is especially useful for landscape orientation photos."

I have been using lightroom as an alternative even though i like vsco better but I can't live with always having to free the ram every time i need to save a photo and even that doesn't always work. It's just useless this way. Are u guys this indifferent to fix such an issue?

With the focus and exposure handles I can get  better shots than with the regular iPhone camera app. I payed for the extra filters and am glad I did. They are all amazing and great foundations before you get into really editing your photo with the other tools vsco offers.

One thing I would really really like to see in this app is a rearranging tool. A lot of people use this app to store their pictures they're going to upload to Instagram, and they might want to rearrange the pictures to make their feed look better. This will definitely make the app a lot better."
3972,Matthew:Vogel,"November 19, 2015",5,"I never write reviews. But this app is absolutely deserving of one. Beautiful, subtle, elegant filters. It's an app that you must get to know, as with a new camera, or any photo editing software. There are options for nearly all of your photo-editing needs, and the subtle nuances of the app may take getting used to. Once you're a pro at this app, your photos can be stylized flawlessly."

Can this please be moved to a different location."
3974,Rata tat tat,"June 10, 2016",1,"Awful update Never written a review before because I've never felt this strongly against an update. The UI went from good to awful in one fell swoop. The icons are clumsy and not memorable, the front pages with the blue sign up thing is ugly and annoying. I've been using this product for years if I haven't signed up yet I'm not going to please make it go away. The swiping and sliding gets in the way of using the dashboard and the collection image spot interferes with the flow of the design. Vsco team please seriously consider your design. To potential users don't download this app in its current state, it is a disappointment."
3975,Jewnniferabrown31,"June 12, 2016",1,"Update is absolute bull. Not only is this update hyper confusing and nearly impossible to navigate, they do weird and unnecessary crap. For instance: when you hit the button on the top right to take a selfie, the first tap turns on the front facing camera + a selfie icon that goes over your face. Assuming it was just a facial recognition stamp, I took the picture. Ends up it can't be removed and the pictures of me and my one year old son during his first time at the pool are absolutely ruined. For anyone wondering how to get rid of that icon, you must double tap the front facing camera button. Thanks for ruining a memory VSCO"

Not to mention that every once in a while when I try to import photos, it continuously make my whole phone turn off. This is so sub-far from an app that I used to use maybe 12 times a day.

3977,Some guy with a iPhone,"June 28, 2016",3,üò™ Getting used to the new look and navigation I just feel like the new design set out to be different and simple ended up being confusing and complex for some. It cool to see the aperture and ISO used on my and other photos in the app other than having to be on the website. I don't know why I have to go to my public profile to view my journals but it would be nice to view them in my personal one. Overall it just need some minor tweaks to make things smoother
3978,Jaiwnskspskns,"November 23, 2016",2,"Subpar This app is ok, but they layout is totally counterintuitive and generally frustrating to use. The pre-set filters are mostly trash if you're trying to edit a photo, not change it drastically and obviously. Honestly, I would suggest paying the 1.99 for Afterlight, a far superior app that is easy to use and can change any element of the photo as much or little as you want and has a wide array of filters that can be changed in intensity and created yourself, as well as camera flares and lighting options not available on this app."

When editing a photo I am pretty sure that I've been able to pinch to zoom on a picture to see fine details like when I'm adjusting the sharpness or adding grain. It may be a feature and just a bug that preventing me from doing this but until it is fixed it's not a perfect app...

None of the buttons have any bearing on their actual function, and it's extremely hard to navigate the app. In short, stop doing so much, VSCO. I've been using this app for years, and with each update it just gets harder and harder to navigate.

The check mark for saving changes has been replaced by a circle which messes with my brain and makes me have to think about what I want to do.  The swiper ""button"" at the bottom is counter-intuitive. The fonts are smaller.  I could go on.  This is a terrible update!"

3992,ELONgrOBEY,"June 30, 2014",5,"The best photo editing app out there. I have tried many other photo editing apps, but VSCO Cam is definitely the best one. It offers the most filters/presets, and has some very good black and white filters. Also, I love the grain and fade features. It gives your photo that old fashioned look. Besides those, there are many more pros to this app; you should not hesitate to download!"
3993,susy~*,"October 5, 2014",5,"I personally love this app! I would love it even more if they had an option to ""instasize"" pictures, so I can just automatically add them straight to Instagram. Right now, I edit my pictures on this app, save it to my camera roll, then go to the ""instasize"" app, do it there, save it AGAIN, then post it on Instagram. Overall, however, this app is great and incredibly useful."

3995,Zombiipokemon,"February 2, 2015",4,"In love with this app, however... Amazing. Beautiful professional tools and filters with a easy to use interface. I've been using this app for about two years now and have always been pleased but recently I am unable to save any photos on to my camera roll without the app crashing. Five stars if not for this unfortunate bug. Hope to see a update on this issue soon!!! Looking forward to more."
3996,Jayden S.,"March 5, 2015",4,I love it! - although theres a small issue I love this app it's fantastic! I agree with others it gives your photos certain moods and the filters are phenomenal.
3997,Tristen üòÑ,"May 5, 2015",4,"Filters on mulitiple photos I use vsco cam daily, for every photo I edit. I've been using this app for awhile, one thing that it would make things sooo much easier were if you could put a certain filter on multiple photos. You see if you do a photoshoot the colors in a photo will be similar to each so it would save time to be able to put a selected filter on all the photos in mass amounts, thanks."
3998,Kittykat677,"July 28, 2015",5,Love it but I love VSCO Cam and I use the app everyday but one suggestion I have is to be able to insert photos in between previous photos one has already posted. You're able to do this on the Journal but this would be super helpful with the Grid because there are photos I want to add in between ones I already put up. Other than that I absolutely love this app!!!

4000,Matty__Westside,"June 8, 2013",2,"New Version Still Crashes!! I loved the original VSCO Cam app and have been using it since release. I downloaded the new version as soon as it was available, but it constantly crashed on my iPhone 5. Most commonly, it would crash every time I attempted to save a photo. I downloaded the new version and it still crashes. I have plenty of storage left on my phone, have closed out all other apps, and it still crashes. So while it may look good, the app is utterly useless since I can't actually save what I'm doing in it! PLEASE VSCO, MAKE A STABLE VERSION OF THIS APP!!!"
4001,Zippig,"June 9, 2013",3,"Major problems I am very excited to use the app once the bugs have been worked out, which I am confident will happen, however as it stands the app is almost unusable. The tools settings do not appear in the app so multiple apps must be used to achieve the proper effect. Also, many of the presets (I bought them all) appear much more faded when viewed outside of the app. When I pay $6 for an app I really expect it to be usable! Looking forward to the next update..."
4002,Shel1235,"June 24, 2016",2,Can we atleast go back ? I Love the update it cool but when you messed up the way to figure out if my instagram theme looked right it made me confused and want to delete the app but i kept it !! Just change to the instagram layout because everybody is not liking the new design and i'm not hating i love VSCO it has amazing filters and makes me filled organized but now that you changed the design I just feel all over the place it's just to hard... I understand you have to change every once in awhile but the new is just not cool üòî
4003,rswaters,"July 8, 2016",1,"DONT GET ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE So I downloaded Vsco because all my friends had it and I thought it was a cool concept. I was unpleasantly surprised when I started using the app. It is unnecessarily complicated to use. It is nearly impossible just to publish one picture. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING!!! The company should just with a simple design that is easy to use instead of trying to be cool and make complicated. NOBODY DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Trust me, it will save you a lot of frustration. I have seen other bad reviews for this app which proves that Vsco is a terrible app. I despise this app with a burning passion and I hope anyone who is reading this review does not download the app."

There's a fine line between minimalist design and confusing design, and unfortunately much of this app delves into the latter (even for someone who has been using it heavily since near-creation). "
4005,sjkvksk,"December 8, 2016",4,"SLIDING UP FROM THE BOTTOM?!! This is such a good app it is my favorite editing app I have used it for a long time. The only problem with the new update is that when I finish picking a filter, I try to scroll up from the bottom of the screen to get into more detailed editing but I can't do it for some reason and my iPhone opens the slide up menu from the bottom of the screen. Fix this please. I cant even edit my photos"

Please fix this aggravating problem. Thank you!"
4007,Ugh..idk,"February 22, 2017",4,I have always loved vsco but.. Ive always loved vsco but today i had my apps transferred over to my new phone and vsco was still logged on. I went to edit a photo i wanted to post and i noticed that a majority of the filters i had were gone even the ones i have purchased. Im not happy with this because i dont want to have to purchase them again when i should still have them. Please fix
4008,Kimcheela,"June 15, 2017",4,Where are my Notifications? Okay so recently I've had problems with my in-app notifications..: I see people have republished and favorited my pics and if I go to my followers I see new people but these aren't showing up in my notifications in the top right corner of my profile. Please fix this! I would like to be notified when action is taking place involving my pictures and profile!
4009,Tallflip77,"August 26, 2017",5,My favorite filtering app Had problems with functionality with it in the past but it seems like all is well now. Although some of the adjustment sliders are a bit laggy it still does the job. I recommend this to all of my friends. And now I have a happy photo place to go to since Instagram has evolved into an abbreviated Facebook.
4010,sugarponykisses,"August 27, 2013",4,"Slick and nice, but slow. I like the design of the app, and it has lots of nice filters. I like the whole Grid thing too. However the focusing/exposure when in camera mode is a bit slow, especially when compared to an app like Camera Sharp. Part of the slowness could be my iPhone 4, but I don't think it should be that slow. Can't wait to see how it evolves over time."
4011,AdrianaG1992,"November 16, 2013",5,"Great app Love the app. The only problem I have with it, is that I just purchased the bundle app and it will not download. It keeps telling me can't connect to iTunes Store. Already visited the app support website and it told me to do what I already did, but of course it keeps saying the same thing. It's getting really frustrating. Does anyone know how I can get what I purchased for?"
4012,Pauline Caroline,"December 3, 2013",5,"Phenomenal I love this app so much, hands down this is my main photo editing app. I don't even use Instagram filters anymore, I just share my edited photos from vsco to my Instagram. I love how vsco is so convenient, simple, and minimal. The filters are beautiful, and it's so easy to use. I think the one thing that would make this app even more perfect is the tool to flip photos."
4013,nbf98,"March 9, 2015",2,Good app but one of the worst interfaces ever I am a avid photographer and use photoshop cc on a regular basis as well as other applications on my Mac. This app has great potential. I have managed to edit a few photos on it and they came out great... However... As the title says this app has one of the worst interfaces of all time. Nothing is labeled and its not clear how to do anything. They need to come back and redo how the app looks as well. It tries to be too minimalistic and it just ends up confusing. I do recommend the app if you are willing to fight through the ironic clutter and chaos.
4014,MeggieRyanDee,"June 7, 2015",4,"Lacking Social Function This app is AMAZING, the filters and editing options are amazing and it's hand down my favorite photo editing app. However recently I've seen a lot of people linking their ""grids"" and I've been following some of my friends. But, once you follow them there's no ""newsfeed"" to see what they post, or even a ""following/followers"" list to go back and find them. Change this, and you've got 5 stars!"
4015,Acase1,"August 19, 2015",4,"It's great... But there's a problem I adore this app to death, but I really don't like this new arrangement of pictures when you try to upload a picture to your vsco cam library. It starts with the new picture you've taken and then it goes to the beginning of your pictures. Could you maybe change that??  It's really hard to find photos. Can you please please please please please change it?!?!"
4016,B0C12,"June 12, 2016",5,"Ignore the haters This is a good update despite what so many are saying. I find the navigation easier than before. The layout is very focused; the minimalism takes a little getting used to, but the app is stupendous. The very specific way of navigating is very helpful since the gestures are so few. No more confusion in what does what. Everything is a simple swipe. It's much more fluid."
4017,Belle123456123456,"June 18, 2016",1,"BRING BACK OLD VSCO I honesty love VSCO, don't get me wrong. I use it for all my photos and I'm so thankful it's an app. However, after the newest update (with all the circles), I honestly find it ugly and irritating. The pictures are very small on the grid, and it just looks unattractive. In my library, there is just to much of this black gap between each photo. I don't understand why there is now some rainbow colors every time I update. Now, i find it very challenging to update, add, remove, or share photos anymore. I really liked the old vsco, and hopefully the editors will change it back soon. Hope this is helpful."
4018,Caarssynn,"June 20, 2016",1,"Please change the current version on this app The main reason why I really do not like this app at all anymore is because u have changed it where it's not set up as Instagrams post, where there are 3 pictures then another set and then another set. And it keeps going but now i can't see if it will look good on my Instagram because u change the set up of how the pictures go. So please change this update back to the last version before this one. Because I'm in LOVE with the filters just I can't stand the set up of where the pictures go after ur done editing them"
4019,Fnaf brothers,"February 7, 2017",5,"VSCO I have never written a review but anything for VSCO. VSCO has made editing so much easier. At first I thought it was those really annoying apps that have stickers and all those ""filters"" but VSCO actually brings your photos to life and gives them meaning.

I also wish you could layer some of the filters as well. But this is just what I suggest :P"

I use it to edit all of my Instagram posts, tumblr posts, Facebook etc.. it's great. GET IT!"
4022,Kanacshakwbsjzia,"September 11, 2015",4,"A Great Idea ! (please see) it would be really great if every time we wanted a filter on a photo, we wouldn't have to do everything all over like adjust the exposure and lighten and set a specific temperature to it, that it could save as a filter in your library so you wouldn't have to waste so much time adjusting it to make a perfect photo so rather in seconds just make your own filter and use it on any photo of yours."
4023,Want grid back,"September 15, 2015",1,Grid view I love this app but I am so disappointed the grid view doesn't have 3 pictures in a row anymore. Pretty sure we ALL want it back. I barley use the grid now with the new upload. I know Myself and many others used it as a preview for Instagram uploads. Please give this back! Also another suggestion in grid view would be the ability to move pictures in the grid in different orders instead of deleting the pic then uploading different ones then re-uploading the pic so it's in a different order. So we can adjust the theme and arrangement of our pictures easily :)
4024,tricianguyenn,"April 16, 2016",5,"Great cause & app If people could simply read the update description they would realize the app icon is only  going to be blue for a short duration of time in order to raise attention for the WWF, but apparently that's too difficult.

4025,Meekfrost,"June 9, 2016",1,"THIS UPDATE BLOWS I've always loved using VSCO for editing and filtering my images, even though I never really used the social aspect. I learned a tip for helping to develop a good Instagram feed, and when I went to upload another image to see if it flows I see that the whole app has changed! The side bar is gone, the images are tinier and weirder to access, and overall it's more confusing to understand. As soon as I saw there were changes made I was so upset! Now I don't know if I want to use this anymore. "
4026,ShawnZzzzzzzz,"June 22, 2016",2,"There are better alternatives The interface doesn't lend itself to quick editing. It's hard to understand the icons for the edits (no idea what each one is until you tap on it), they are not in a logical order, and it takes multiple taps to get in and out of each one. On top of that you don't see the changes to the image until you take your finger off the slider."

Can we have another update, perhaps allowing us to switch the unterface to the old one?"

I have had vsco since before this version existed, back when it was a different app. Since then I have bought and amassed a lot more photo-editing apps, but frankly, vscocam is my favorite app of the type and the only one I consider as a 'must have'. Other apps I own are after light, faded, landcam, mextures, etc. (great apps, but still vscocam remains my personal favorite)"
4033,Ceolsigehl,"May 21, 2014",4,"Soon to be a great app. The filters, though I wish they had names to more easily differentiate, are beautiful and the camera works well. The app itself has a very stylish aesthetic which I love. I do see some minor features lacking; I cannot see who is following me, nor is there a way to ""find friends."" Not sure yet if there is a function for tagging. I love what the app offers thus far and hope to see updates soon!"

However, the update took away the ability to change your grid layout/view your pictures one at a time. I don't like the look of the side by side pictures and I'm upset the update took away our ability to change our layout. This makes it hard to know how your grid really looks. Please change it as soon as possible."

Like when I edit a picture on the app from a long time ago and I had to scroll a long time to get to that specific picture and start editing it and click out of it to look through my Instagram and when I click back on VSCO where I wasn't done editing, it just goes all the way back to the beginning of my pictures then I would have to scroll all the way back down to get to the same picture. It's just really frustrating."

Now, it doesn't. I had over 700 photos imported and now they won't load. I've tried everything, deleting and reinstalling but it doesn't work! I want my photos back! Please fix!"

VSCO has managed to make a serious app, and the Grid platform is simple and effective. If you've got minimalist taste and are looking for a serious creative tool, this is the best so far. I'd love to see a focus lock feature in the future."

I really think the creator should add a Refund/Exchange option.

4051,shamiatiffany,"November 16, 2014",1,iOS and purchasing I cannot update because i don't have the latest iOS but that's not what's upsetting me. It's that I cant purchase any new filters without having to have the newest iOS and I don't have the space on my phone to do that. Please change the app so I will be able to purchase new filters? It makes no sense. You have to be considerate of everyone; not a lot of people can download iOS8 because it requires a lot of space and deleting and reinstalling items is just a waste. That's money lost for you right here... I was really excited about buying new filters.

Also the quality of editing I can do to a picture is amazing, this is the best editing app ever. I go on this app everyday:)"
4053,Thats_so_joe,"June 9, 2016",1,"I hate the update. I hate this update. The old version allowed users to see how the photos looked together. The layout mimicked instagrams, and that made the app stand above all the others. This layout that is in current affect, is sloppy and annoying. We can't see the pictures and how they clash, and compare. Not to mention the app is now really hard and annoying to navigate through. I really loved the 3x3 layout because of how useful it was. This scattered 3x3 layout is annoying. Please fix. Also please get rid of the circle at the bottom. It is always in the way. Thanks."
4054,Jeskqnsjjebsknw,"June 10, 2016",1,"Some of this really needs to change. I understand VSCO's need to update in order to be edgy and cool as well as to encourage community engagement. That stuff is rad and I dig it, but the primary concern I have is for the absence of the ""mock ig grid"" that has assisted me in planning out my feed for years now. Also, the camera metadata (i.e. aperture and iso), a feature that really impressed me before, has also disappeared with the update. VSCO, if you're reading this, I hope that you realize that many people use your app to lay out their feeds before posting. Removing the ability to do so only makes the app worse."
4055,sierra_alex.s,"June 10, 2016",1,Sad Update I've been a fan of VSCO ever since downloading it. I loved the way your photos were laid out in the pattern of rows of 3. I liked the simplicity of it and how clean it looked.

I rely solely on VSCO for all my photo editing needs and love every part of it, from the sleek, modern interface to the social platform. EXCEPT. I wish I could edit multiple photos at once!

But again, no other photo editing app compares to this one"
4058,Mahi_________,"March 5, 2017",4,"Great but... This is my main editing app. The filters and tools are clean and authentic. I miss the old photos format though. The grid format with squares made it really easy to compare photos, and it nicely mimicked instagram's format. Could you add an option in settings for users to change the format back to the grid preview? VSCO would be a lot more useful, and I'd give it 5 stars if you added that back."

Also, when I try to save a picture to my camera roll it tells me it saved but the image is no where to be found in my camera roll. Fix this please!  Otherwise the editing options are exquisite compared to the old options."
4061,arghhh.,"June 24, 2013",5,"Best photo editing App ever. I had the paid vsco cam before they released this one, I loved it. Now it is even better! I had problems with the new app but I contacted the VSCO team on their website and they were really lovely with me and solved my problem right away. I am really glad to have this app, it's unique. I don't always write reviews but this app deserves it. Go download it!"
4062,Emmagymnast123456789,"June 21, 2016",1,Hate the update The update is very confusing and they layout is awful. Very disappointed in the update. I used to love love Vsco but now it's just annoying to use. Please bring back the old version because I regret updating the app. Also you now don't know which photos are edited and which ones aren't. This makes it very very confusing. Please bring back the old version. Please also bring back the option to see only the unedited ones and see all the photos. I'm very disappointed and hoping you fix it. Everyone hates it so you should fix it. Thanks
4063,Fudjecicle,"June 22, 2016",1,"Huge mistake There are plenty of reviews on here about how horrible the update is but I figured I'd add mine to maybe try and get the creators to change it. Not necessarily back to what it used to be, but something more user friendly. This is awful. Like everyone else I loved VSCO but this is honestly unacceptable. This app has really been going downhill for some time now, I think starting with the decision to put the photos in the feed in non uniform placements and sizes. Anyway, hopefully this additional negative review helps change something. Maybe rethink who you have on your design team."
4064,MollyW8,"June 24, 2016",1,"Frustrating App I downloaded this app because my kids raved about it and I wanted an easy way to journal about our family road trip. Overall I found vsco to be a not user friendly app, but I was managing and able to journal as I had hoped but then the new update came along and it has been nothing but frustration for me. Each time I make a new journal entry I first have to do a google search to remember HOW to create a new entry. Not intuitive. I can't figure out how to download my pictures to create entries. It's just a terribly cumbersome app. Please go back to the last version, vsco."
4065,Garnette1601,"June 28, 2016",1,"Why, Update, why. VSCO used to be the perfect app to plan out an Instagram feed. Its UI was clean, simple, sophisticated, and aesthetic. Now, with this new update, this app is completely obsolete to me. "

Since I download it again, I can not figure out how it works and there are only 7 filters that are free. This app just wants your money since they give you the worst filters to choose from. I am not paying a total of 30 dollars just for filters! Don't fix something that is not broken!"
4068,Travie_Loks,"January 28, 2017",5,"Can't purchase presets!! This app is hands down the best there is in the App Store for editing photos and now with RAW support it's even better! I'm not sure what's going on since the last update, but I can't purchase presets. I hit purchase and the loading bar comes up and stays there. I've tried everything to fix this PLEASE fix this bug!!"
4069,Wumph,"March 14, 2017",5,"Great app, horrible image search I know, it's a pretty small nitpick, but it's so infuriatingly annoying. For example, I'll be searching for an image with the search term, ""lazy dog"" it will either bring up words that have the word ""lazy"" in the description or the word ""dog"" but never ""lazy dog"". Again, this is my only gripe but it still bugs me every time I use the search engine."
4070,TJSass,"August 29, 2013",5,"Great photo app After years of different iPhones and the many photo apps that have come with them, this is my favorite app. It is intuitive and really lets you create beautiful photos. The fact that it isn't a social media platform helps you focus on creating beautiful photos rather than just trying for likes or followers."
4071,mattydee217,"October 1, 2013",5,"So close to perfect. Missing two things. On this version, +1 temperature does nothing. "
4072,KGrall,"April 19, 2014",4,"The best gets better This is one of my favorite photo editing apps on the go. It let's me take my phone pictures and instantly process them into the look I want. It gives you such creative control over exposure, shadows, highlights, etc. My only bit of complaint is that you have no control over shadows and highlights within the same curves line. VSCO could definitely add that."
4073,StephCorl,"April 27, 2014",5,"The absolute best! I used to adhere pretty strongly to a few Instagram filters before I came across the greatness that is VSCO. Now, I cringe at the idea of using an Instagram filter on my photos and exclusively edit via this app. My photos have way more depth and come out looking far more professional now than they ever did before. You won't be disappointed!"
4074,Breeoxd,"November 13, 2014",2,"Used to adore this I've sunk some cash into this app. Loved it, but it never works anymore. Says it saves to camera roll, but doesn't, shrinks images, can't use most of the editing features on iPad( what happened to the vignette come on guys. And no sharpening?ugh) also having issues importing anything from albums besides basic camera roll. These guys are so established that this stuff is just a bunch of rookie moves. Disappointed"

4077,Heeellll,"November 29, 2015",4,"Love/hate Was the best app until the way the feed layout changed. It just looks messy and doesn't go with the app theme at all! Needs to be changed to something more aesthetically pleasing. Other than that, it's a beautiful way to show your ""tumblr"" side and just take a million pictures. Nobody's feed will ever look bad with any of these filters! Love!! Would be 5 stars but again, I'm not a fan of the layout."
4078,avidphototaker96,"December 24, 2015",5,"Simple, Clean, Functional Very easy to use and array of editing options provide a good way to enhance your photos. Doesn't altar the quality of your pictures unless of course the picture was originally poorly taken. Ability to purchase in app filters is a great way to add to the complexity of this app. Haven't found anything else like VSCO."
4079,juliaespo,"March 16, 2016",3,"Bad Update vsco is amazing, my favorite app to edit pictures on, follow my friends, and post pictures. I don't like the new update at all. the ability to swipe through photos is gone, making you have to open a picture individually and close out of it to see the next photo on your feed, which is a pain. also, the size of the filter that is used on the picture is way too small. liked the way it used to be."

I use it to store my pictures and use the filters to edit them. I would like to put a password on the app because I want to sync pictures from my iPad but don't want anyone else to see them. Other then that this app is great.
4081,......Ash.......,"July 9, 2015",5,"Great, but just one little problem I absolutely love this app, it literally has the best filters for an app that's free. The only problem I have is that I can't move my pictures around (like how you can on an iPhone camera roll). But other than that this app is amazing and this is basically the only app I use to ready photos for Instagram ."

4083,bcal3,"August 28, 2015",5,"Love it ! I love this app ! it's my go-to editing app and I highly recommend it ! I have one small suggestion though.

4085,Kellyry,"June 11, 2016",1,"Update disappointment Like other negative reviewers about the latest update, I use VSCO for editing photos I take using the phone's camera. I have long loved the filters and the creativity they allowed me to add to iPhone photos. However, with the latest update I cannot even FIND my own grid let alone where I can upload and then edit (and then export) a photo. I usually consider myself fairly tech savvy but this update has me stumped. Unless this is changed (or my support email replied to promptly with instructions), this app will no longer be utilized, unfortunately."
4086,):Former user of vsco:(,"July 1, 2016",1,"Strongly dislike update I was asked to write a review by vsco themselves because I received customer support. However, the support was not helpful to me and left me even more angry with the update. I strongly dislike the new version of vsco. I can see in the reviews that many people agree. I used to like the old layout of pictures in version 4.6 I think it was. Anyways, I strongly advise vsco to bring back the old version, or at least make the old version available on the App Store, because they are now losing business. They have gone from an average 4 star review to 1-2 stars."

Ever since they updated, I can't figure out where anything is on the app, and it's very NON-user friendly. I can't even figure out how to view my own photo feed on it, and ended up having to restart the app to get to my profile. I understand wanting a simplistic design, but this is just not the way. Missing the old version and wishing I'd never upgraded!"
4088,@itstyleryang,"January 13, 2017",5,"Comprehensive, Intuitive, and Aesthetically Stellar. This app is so comprehensive and covers the basics and even a little more when it comes to photo editing. I highly recommend checking it out; even for a novice mobile photographer it's very intuitive. Lastly, but certainly not least it completes the aesthetic for photos and pairs them wonderfully together in a common theme."
4089,verymuchme,"August 9, 2017",4,"I stand corrected... Past couple revisions were good, this last one is excellent and comparatively, even the Pro membership ain't too expensive. One question though: why, in order to enjoy uncompressed images I have to AirDrop them to myself? Saving directly from VSCO and having compressed images has been one of my grievances since 2012 and if it ever gets fixed, that'll be 5* review on my side."
4090,Veryyberryy,"February 17, 2015",2,"What's the point. Loved this app so much before. After the update, I accidentally ended up deleting the app but reinstalled only to find out I had a clear page. Was a bit annoyed but oh well. I tend found out ALL my filters I previously bought were gone. Fine. I go to the store only to find I COULD NOT access it UNLESS I updated the app which I cannot do because I have an iPhone 4. Honestly, what's the point of having that function if you're not going to cater to the masses. Not everyone can get the newest iPhone."

Every time I want to edit a picture I use it, but recently I haven't been able to use it because everything I click on it it resets my phone, and I don't want to delete it because I do have a lot of pictures on there. I just wish they would fix that so I can start using it again"

4093,tianaaaaaaaaaaaa,"June 9, 2016",1,"This update is hideous in more than a ""we'll get used to it"" way. This update completely destroyed the app. It was perfect for curating beautiful Instagram posts and was supremely easy to navigate. Now, the whole thing is an utter eyesore - your images, no longer compressed to square shapes, look disorganized, and the app overall is difficult to control. VSCO won't overtake Instagram as a place to showcase photos, sorry to say, so it's time to stop forcing the Journal on users. I loved this app - it's helped me to produce so many gorgeous photos - but I honestly may start the search for something else."
4094,Sara 13984$987,"June 12, 2016",1,"All time favorite photo app but the new update.... I'm not a fan of the new layout of the library. The photos are too spaced, and that ""collected images"" box is unnecessary. VSCO was already confusing enough before the update, but at least we were able to get the hang of it after some time. Now that you've redesigned it, we have to go through a whole new learning curve just to understand the motions.  But really, the library layout is what bugs me the most. I never regret updating my apps because I'm open to change, but I really regret updating this."
4095,Jessica09241234,"June 16, 2016",3,dislike the new update. (PLEASE FIX) I'm not really find of the new update mainly because I'm not able to plan out my Instagram theme which was very helpful before. The layout used to mimic the Instagram layout which made it easy to what a picture would look like it you posted it. Also it's very confusing for me to use so I hope they'll bring back the old features for a more enjoyable experience. Other than that I like the filters.

Have been using it for years. But with the new update I feel kinda betrayed.. My favorite feature of this app was being able to see the layout of my photos before uploading them on to Instagram. Now the way the photos are laid out all jumbled up almost makes my eyes but out a little. I can barely see the detail of the colors between the pictures altogether. Will change my review if an update fixes this.."

I love editing my photos but this app is impossible to navigate through whether or not you trying to look dear Journal and then once you view your journal as public it's impossible to go back. They need a more simplistic design that you can easily go from your photos to your library etc. like the old update. This update makes the app extremely hard to use and honestly if I could give it less than one star I would

This app is just a mobile version of the curves adjustment tool in any photo editing software. I guess if you wanted to convenience of having that on your phone then maybe the presets are worth it? Or you could just shoot real film and stop letting computers and apps kill photography..."

Honestly just buy the filters. They make the app like 100x better and that add so much. Also like the sharing feature when u can see other people's posts. It's like Insta but more photography based. And this is almost like a backup

Please can you fix this problem, it would be really appreciated. Thank you."

I used to love being able to go through my grid and have it be 3 photos a row. The bigger pictures and the 2 photos per row just makes it tedious and difficult. I love to see my grid as a whole and see all my pictures. Bring this back please! Thank you!

""It doesn't match the theme of my phone"" is about the dumbest thing I've ever read in a iTunes review. If you want an app that works and works well then this is a great app. If you want your apps to match your theme and are sensitive to what colors the icons are then you should only use a LeapPad."

First, the new look is awesome, they just made it usable, because the old UX (not visual) was really ugly. I really like design of VSCO, one of the most beautiful app at App Store. Second, everything became much more faster, no any freezes when you are choosing a filter, super fast, i like it."

I NEVER would have purchased multiple packages for this app had I known they would do an updated that is nearly impossible to use. It is much more difficult to figure out how to even take a picture in the app. Do not buy this app until they figure out all these issues. I can also not update settings as I am taking a picture like I used to be able to. The cursor on the line doesn't move, but looks like it is supposed to. VSCO please update back to what the app used to be based on all these new bad reviews."

Also before it was just very simple to go to your journal or collections but now i don't even know how to navigate . It took me 30 minutes to realize where everything was and yet I'm still confused .

4119,Jennifer Laurence #1 fan,"February 20, 2017",5,Incredible app! Vsco allows you to express yourself and your interests in a way no other app does.

Fisrt off I want to say that I love the editing aspect of this app the social media aspect ain't my thing but i think it is one of if not the best editing photos app off all time! With that said the interface changes are killing it for me the new camera Botton is weird there is no instructions on how to pull it up I spend at least 5 to 10 min trying to figure the camera out and the rest of the interface is just on easy for me...
4124,Xfactor1980,"June 11, 2016",1,Disappointed with latest update Vsco has been my first choice when it comes to image filtering. But the latest design is so bad that I no long want to go to the app. It causes frustration due to the bad experience. I know you guys are trying to be innovative but you don't need to reinventing the wheel. The navigation system just don't work. You need to make the circle dragging interaction more fluid. Maybe make the circle move towards the direction that the user is dragging. Right now I have to accurately drag right in the middle of the circle in order for it to work.
4125,Evilbun1,"June 23, 2016",1,"Very Unsatisfied This update ruined the whole app for me. Before I would've given it three stars more but now it's lucky I can't give it zero. The layout of the pictures is no longer orderly looking and completely ruined the preview for Instagram. Also not part of the update, but you should be able to buy single filters rather than needing to buy a whole pack, it's ridiculous. Overall this app went from a solid four stars to barely a one and I'm very discontent with this horrible display. Will be deleting soon if nothing changes."
4126,mr.blue.sky,"August 28, 2016",1,Evolve or parish This app never adopted the non destructive photo editing of iOS 8. Instead it forces you to create another copy of your photo in a library only this app can access. Over time the app becomes too large. There are better options if you're looking for filters. My favorite is Darkroom. It's basically Lightroom for your phone. Very detailed color editing options plus RGB curve adjustments. If you're looking for a free option try the Google backed Snapseed. It does a lot and more. Same non destructive editing of darkroom. Won't make needless duplicates that take up space.
4127,Gaby_09,"September 21, 2016",1,"Bring back my photos ! This app was my go to when it came to editing photos; Because I stopped using this app for a while ,  It wasn't until now that I realized they updated a few things. I find the whole layout to be confusing and to be frank, unnecessary. It was better when it was simpler and easier to maneuver. Also when I logged back in to my account, all of my pictures are gone. super annoying to find my photos missing, especially when it never did that before. "
4128,Deadfuk,"March 19, 2017",2,"This is wack? I've been a longtime user with VSCO, mainly as a way to filter pictures before I publish them on my other social media. However, this seems to be the only way I can use VSCO. It is so inconvenient and so irritating that every single time I try to make a journal post, or any post in general on VSCO I get errors. It's either always publishing errors, or my posts are made private even when I try to make them public. Very disappointed that my works can't even be published on the app itself"

I love the way the filters look on my pictures. And if I could use the same filter on my DSLR photos that would make my day!!! I really hope the VSCO team takes a desktop version into consideration."
4131,C4t3r1na,"November 27, 2014",2,"Lags and awkward user interface On iPhone 4S every process is slow, like photos in the gallery, the leveling feature in camera mode, and changing tabs; all were much quicker in the previous version when the app icon had colors. The icon links to camera mode, settings, and other pathways are too ""minimalist"" to recognize right away. The large photos get cropped out when viewing individually by the options panel at the bottom of the screen. Very disappointed."
4132,emi.rox,"January 5, 2015",4,"Love it, except for navi I LOVE the idea of this app- that likes and followers don't matter, and the controls and filters really are beautiful and top notch. however, like many other people seem to be complaining about, getting around the app is confusing and hard-moving from one screen to another requires more steps than it should. other than that a great app"

I mean I rarely use the ones I bought, but I just hate that I don't have it anymore. I do like the app and all but this was very disappointing. plus some of my photos come out blurry in my grid and some day it's the Internet connection but my internet is fine. idk, but I'll stay hopeful with the app."

But the way you view images now is so terrible that everyone I know including myself thought it was a bug with the UI. So I messaged support some screenshots and explained this ""bug"" I am experiencing, only to be confirmed that the tiny image thumbnails with weird arbitrary margins is part of the new update. What I and surely everyone else misses is scrolling through big, beautiful full screen images. What happened to that?"
4137,Emily56612,"March 3, 2016",5,why doesn't this app have more reviews?!?! I LOVE this app. I bought a 5$ photo editing app recently yet I still come back to this app. it's my go to and makes it so easy to keep a theme on Instagram allowing you to lay out photos to see if they match. I don't know a single person who doesn't use this app. weird how there's hardly any reviews
4138,Edit Switch,"April 1, 2016",5,Update Idea I like the app other than the fact that I sometimes edit pictures and want to switch the order of them. I end up having to reload the pictures and copy and paste the edits. It's kind of time consuming and annoying. I hope that this is possible in a new update.
4139,michellejazzy,"June 8, 2016",3,"new feature (maybe?) there should be a rearranging option so we can move the pictures around when we're in the mode that lets us see all of the pictures in a grid. I know a lot of people, including myself, have themes on Instagram. some pictures look good next to another, and some don't. I feel like just by adding that feature, this app would be a lot more useful and easier to use. thank you."
4140,shiftercars,"June 11, 2013",2,Image Quality Lower than original Some of the best features from the original app are missing. I miss being able to save images in various dpi. I also feel like my images aren't nearly as crisp as the original app. I appreciate the white balance but greatly miss the ability to set the focus within the frame. Also the original filters are slightly off in the new version. Please resolve this! VSCO has been my go to app for high quality photos and the new app is so disappointing!
4141,dtheory_ng,"July 11, 2013",5,"Quality After trying several photo Apps including Mextures and Phototoaster et. al, this wins hands down. The quality of the filters, the minimalism and beautiful UI of the Menus combined with the extensive editing options packed in make this fantastic. There is also a lot less distortion after editing than other Apps I've tried."
4142,Jesusgonza,"August 1, 2013",5,"Superb Honestly my favorite application I own. The editing tools and filters allow you to find the right balance of the exact effects you want, without overdoing it like Instagram and making you look like a 14 year old girl. The slick UI is just icing on the cake. Take the leap of faith and install it before installing Landcam or some other costly alternative."

I'm one of the users who paid for this app in its early days AND the filter pack. I love vsco, but I'm very disappointed with the amount of bugs and problems that it's been giving me lately."

Because the designers have run amok to deliver a sleek, ultra-modern gorgeous interface that blows up every navigation convention you've ever learned. I can only assume someone designed this a portfolio piece for their application to work at Apple. It is so minimalist you can't use it. This editor has some nice filters and a few cool features I haven't seen elsewhere. But it's not so much better than any other half-decent photo editor to justify figuring it out. I'm moving on."

Its was dedicated button for this. Now Im lost. With every single update VSco its even more frustration. Use to give it 5 stars. Now 1. And using another app for editing photos. P.S.

But silly me forgot about that and without thinking updated all my apps. I'm so sorry that I did. Everything about the new look is terrible. It's unintuitive and unattractive. It seems like they changed everything just for the sake of change. Like when I view my published photos, the background is black, even though the public view is still white. Why? I don't understand. I'm wish there was a way to go back."

4164,brownvolvo,"March 26, 2014",3,"Great App; Not Very User-Friendly Interface I just started using this app and I really love the functions and results but I must admit that this 30-something was pretty stumped with how to use the interface. Sleek icons and minimalist design has beautiful form but it can lack in the function dept. I had to Google, ""How to access my pictures on VSCOcam"" when I first opened the app. Maybe there should be a simple and quick tutorial when one first opens the app?"

4167,Esppresso,"June 3, 2015",5,Astonishingly Amazing Incredible. I would recommend this to everyone who loves editing photos as much as taking them. VSCO Cam is the best photo app one could ask for.

4168,neeno,"July 5, 2015",5,"Great app! This app has been my go to photo editing app for on the fly shots since they released it, but my only feedback on this is if you could have the option to add a watermark to your photos.

I had nearly all the sets of filters, now they took ALL of them and are asking for $20 EVERY year to get them back. Ripped off. I used this app for every Instagram acc I had, including my public vsco feed. So disappointed, the premium version should be optional and allow you your already payed for filters because now, spent full iTunes cards for absolutely nothing. If you plan on getting this app, you are paying $20 just to use it."

I have to tap every icon one by one to find what I'm looking for. I have no idea what the current screen is when I swipe left and right, up and down. PLEASE redesign your interface from scratch.

4198,JulieMooooooos,"July 28, 2015",5,Highly Recommended Best editing app whether you plan on sharing via Instagram of VSCO's own worldwide grid of photographs. Very creative and simplistic style without being complicated. The editing is very straight-forward yet wide-ranged that even the most inexperienced photographers are able to dive right in. I love it. Not sure why it isn't rated higher
4199,Hkhskzj,"September 4, 2015",3,"Don't know how I feel about the update. I loved vsco, but now after the update I'm not sure. I loved seeing the grid layout on my vsco with my pictures, and now it's only side by side. Plus I hope you decide to keep it to not be able to see who follows you, that shows that you can be as creative as possible without the knowledge of who's following you to judge. Your vsco is for yourself, not for others. Bring the grid back!"
4200,foozer52,"June 12, 2013",5,"Dang fine work on this app VSCO is just hands down the best photo editing app out there. All the people complaining are having minor issues that I am sure are being worked on in updates, the app just released. To argue there is another app better for quality mobile photography is absurd."
4201,MarcO406,"June 12, 2013",5,"Works great I've had nothing but great experience using this app. No crashes. Tools are easy to use after initial learning curve. I tend to like adjusting pics using the tools more than the presets, but maybe do to taking mostly landscape shots thus far. Exposure, focus & white balance all are easy and useful. Liking forward to Grids."
4202,Stylewitches,"June 13, 2013",2,"Eh I really like the old version so much better. I don't like the filters here; maybe some are the same, but they don't have the same quality as the former app did. Also, my favorite tool in the old one was the fill light, and the only equivalent to that is the add highlights or something, and it doesn't have the same effect whatsoever. Only cool feature is you can import more than one at a time and export faster. Now there are just too many buttons/features I'll never use."
4203,LarsVon,"July 15, 2013",2,"Potential I like the minimalism of the UI, but it's definitely not as intuitive as a lot of other apps, even confusing.  Also, the fact that I cannot find an option to immediately export to my 4s's camera roll is a big strike against this app.  Don't know if I'm missing something or not.  I've allowed the app to access my photos, but it appears you have to save manually.  If app gets better with next update I'll re-rate, but right now two stars for potential greatness."
4204,Natelian,"September 23, 2013",5,I love it! I only use this app to edit my photos. I've tried other apps but I just didn't find it high quality. The in-app purchases for filters tend to stack up if you want them all but they just had a discount on their whole filters as a bundle for only 6 bucks instead of 16. I don't regret it and I love this app. It's a keeper!
4205,MMS55,"September 18, 2015",4,Bugs and issues. My app on my iPad has been failing to load the photos completely. It either crashes and doesn't load the photo at all or it doesn't crash but it still doesn't load the photo. The thumbnails are gray and when I save them they are just plain photos. (A gray/black photo) I've tried to give it time but nothing's changed. Help??
4206,supercheney17,"November 10, 2015",5,"Love this app!! I use this app for all of my pictures! It's perfect for adding cool tones to any picture, and I really love how subtle you can make the editing. It's really cool! The one thing I would LOVE is if you could somehow add like a video editing area, like I would love to add some effects to my videos! Just something to think about! :P "
4207,miranda475,"June 10, 2016",5,"Improved Navigation Once you get used to the new navigation it's much quicker and easier to move around the app using the swipe up, down, and right motions. I like being able to both edit my photos and find content from other users more naturally."
4208,A noble circle,"June 19, 2016",3,Best before update I love vsco best filters out there makes pictures even more gorgeous than they already are - in the new update everything seems for complicated with the sorting and organization - besides the update the only thing I would fix is better quality because after you use a filter on a picture and save it the quality is worse than the original
4209,KhunSing,"August 15, 2016",1,"Version 5 broke everything I love the company and have purchased numerous packs for both Lightroom and mobile, but alas the version 5 update corrupted all of my preset packs and they no longer work. In addition the new interface updates added more confusion to the interface, to the point where it wasn't usable anymore. Unfortunately I had to delete this app in an effort to restore the presets, making me lose all of my photos. Once deleted though, I simply didn't reinstall it because of aforementioned issues. Really a shame."
4210,LCC2345678,"June 12, 2013",5,Love it!!! This is my absolutely favorite app to edit photos and I have tried many... Luckily I didn't get any problems with it like many others. I have bought the entire editing kit and all the filters. Very easy to use and doesn't require a lot of adjustments after a filter has been applied.
4211,Nehalp,"August 6, 2013",5,"Black Effect only? I tried deleting & re-installing this app , but why is it that every time I do so , I only tend to get black effects ? I don't get the rest . & also whenever I go on this app , it doesn't load the rest , I can only use the black effect which I don't want . Please try fixing this issue . Thank you !"
4212,AparTall,"March 1, 2014",5,"AMAZING, BUT This app is amazing! But you should make a VSCO FILM app for people with no computer. So you can put filters of the videos you take. I don't have a laptop so I would  love to make beautiful videos with these filters. Allowing you to import from camera roll or take it from the app, that would be such a great app if you made it!"
4213,Camilla Keon,"March 7, 2014",5,"Update Suggestion Love this app. Had it for over a year, and I use it on every photo I post. I just wish you could export multiple photos to your grid at once. It is a pain having to go through my library and do each photo individually. Also, I wish there was an option to rotate a photo."
4214,Logan Andrew95,"May 17, 2014",5,"cant buy filters Whenever i try to purchase a filter, in this case the bunddle it says ""purchasing"" then says ""cannot connect to iTunes"" even tho i have wifi and im connected to my computer. I really want to buy these filters for my summer break. Going to be traveling and taking  bunch of pics. HELP."
4215,Rachheeeel,"July 6, 2014",4,"FIX THIS !!! It's a great app , I use it for all my pictures but sometimes when I go on the app the effects change color & when I click them to filter my pictures they come out in this weird black & white color & I can't tell how the pictures really look until I save it into my camera roll & it's a struggle üò´ can you please fix it ! I still love the app !"
4216,jsfullr,"October 2, 2014",5,Crashes when exporting on iOS 8! (iPhone 6) Just like the title says. Obviously the filters in this app are on a whole other level than apps like Instagram and snapseed however there's a bug in iOS 8 on iPhone 6 where it crashes when saving an edited image to the camera roll. Please fix!
4217,Dent De Leon,"October 21, 2014",4,"Good app w/ a caveat Excellent camera app with very good control over the IOS 8 functions. And while the app can be set to default to des play the camera at launch, there is no way to set the advanced camera functions as the default. I prefer to shoot in Shutter Priority mode, it takes me 6 taps to get to this in VSCO, whereas Shutter Priority is the default for Camera+ and 645 Pro can will default to that, if previously selected."
4218,bneilly,"November 12, 2014",2,"Good filters, lacking features. I love the filters in this app, I‚Äôve purchased a lot of them, sadly I did so before I realized VSCO did not have an extension for the photos app in iOS8.  They also don‚Äôt have a proper version for the iPad, it‚Äôs an ugly magnified version of the iPhone app and you can‚Äôt even use it in landscape.  Until extensions and iPad support come to VSCO I‚Äôm afraid I just wasted my money.  I don‚Äôt want duplicate versions of all my pictures I edit and I don‚Äôt want to have to go to a different app to do the editing."
4219,Stratum1,"January 5, 2015",5,"Fantastic app, although confusing. I love the app. I've been looking for a while for a camera app that lets you manually adjust everything. That includes focus, exposure, and white balance. The app's interface takes a bit getting used to though. All in all though this app deserves 5 stars."
4220,Chrisss_123,"June 6, 2013",5,"amazing but slight glitch. I'm not sure if I'm the only one having this problem, but the tools settings won't load even after I re-downloaded it twice. Other than this personal problem this new version is spectacular. I'm in complete awe with all the presets and the new features as well. Swell job Vsco!"
4221,Dragon slayer 427,"June 11, 2016",1,"Disappointment: The Reality Hello, I am a long term user of this app and have a few opinions on this new update. Spiritually and emotionally my heart was shattered as I opened the app. As I examined the new layout, I looked out my window as tears fell down my cheeks. This update caused me so much emotional stress I called my Health teacher to make sure it was healthy to feel this way. You need to change it back to the way it was, and if you don't think my opinion is reliable, look at what my homies the Beatles said, ""Take these words of wisdom, let it be.."". I ENJOY THIS APP BUT IF YOU DON'T CHANGE IT BACK I'M GONNA CRY."
4222,Jordan0202028644,"June 11, 2016",1,"ugh it didn't need to be changed in the first place ... I never use the search and discover things so that's not a problem , but I hate the layout of my edited pictures. I loved the original grid because I would plan out my theme for Instagram and I would see if the pictures went together , but now it's confusing and the pictures are far apart and not square. It's way more confusing than before because it is very easy to accidentally swipe and get confused as to where you are. please change it back!"
4223,Raelyy,"July 14, 2016",3,"Nothing loads Really miss the old layout and look of the app. The discover page was so much easier to find, I can't even find it now. And I miss the option of how you want your page to look like. Also, when I click on my journal it doesn't even open? I can't even view my journal, only edit it. I think you guys are doing too much with this app now. really miss the simplicity of what it once was"
4224,Tristan Armstrong,"October 31, 2016",5,"Love this app!! I don't know why people are complaining about this app it is amazing!! Yes people might not understand how to use it at first, but it is really not that challenging at figuring out how exactly to use VSCO! Hands down the best photo filter app I have ever used. All of my pics go through VSCO now and I get great resultsüëåüèºKeep up the good work VSCOüëçüèºüëçüèº"

I have never had to complain about vsco before, but when I try to look at other people's posts, it says ""error loading content"" and I love looking at other people's posts. It has been doing this for about a week now, VSCO please fix this!"
4227,Bries743,"March 16, 2017",4,Update idea The fact that I can hold down on a picture and then slide my finger down and save or repost a picture is a horrible idea. This feature is ending lives and relationships. It is so troublesome and I end up reposting or saving pictures that should never be reposted. Remove or edit this feature please it is not good and is just causing issues
4228,Dragonüê≤üêâ,"May 6, 2017",5,"the source of a gr8 instagram feed personally, i feel that yes, although the filters are amazing, the best part about this app is all the editing tools. not only is it very easy to navigate, it also makes anyone with a phone feel like an actual photographer just by slightly turning down the exposure on a picture. "
4229,_affinity,"May 30, 2017",2,"use to love vsco, but now.... i admit, i use to love this app. at least until it started crashing the moment i tried to do any actual editing. "

4231,Jesskbooze,"September 28, 2014",4,"Won't let me download purchased filters I LOVE this app. I even use it to edit pictures I take with my professional camera. But when I got my IPhone 6, I lost all contact, apps, etc. and now when I go to download more filters, it just says ""Purchasing"" but never downloads them. I'm hoping this is just due to the new IOS 8, because I REALLY want to use this app again!!"
4232,Riiich987,"November 11, 2014",5,Awesome app... But not yet ready for the iPhone 6/6+ I'm a professional photographer and therefore am very picky about even my iPhone editing software - I've tried many. Have had this app since it came out and it's absolutely my favorite one. One complaint now is that we just need to get it optimized for my iPhone 6+!!!!
4233,Blossom.Was.Here,"April 12, 2015",5,"Classy and concise If you're like me, more into the photo instead of the gazillion sticker sets strewn with a sundry of hats, hairstyles, and hearts, this is the photo app for you. I like the filters- slightly different and (to me) seemingly better quality than the norm. Not too many options, yet I don't feel as though I'm bereft anything. Def give it a try. :)"
4234,Kylersagan,"April 16, 2015",5,One of my daily used apps I use this app daily. I was first skeptical about this one but once I learned how to use it I love it. It has the right filters. Sure you have to pay for some but I think it's worth it. Editing is fun in this app and the filters are spot on. I look forward to maybe some more free filters.
4235,5litro,"May 9, 2015",3,Great app but has problems I would love to rate this app a 5 stars but I can't.
4236,I ‚ù§Ô∏è books,"July 27, 2015",5,Vsco cam! Filters The best editing app! I love the filters and different ways to edit your photos. Once you have already edited you photo you can share it to the social side of vsco cam! You have a link for your page of pictures that you edited and you can always access it! Great app!

I had a great vsco that I had worked on since December, I depended on it to show some of my favorite pictures with other people. Then, today I realized that my account was deactivated and all photos deleted. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  This is unbelievably unacceptable for a supposedly high functioning app, and a huge let down on your part, vsco cam. I will not be re downloading vsco, and if it did cost right now I would be demanding a refund. Very unimpressed and disappointed, if I could give negative stars I would."
4238,Sara here BOOM in here,"November 6, 2015",4,"It glitches. Okay so I love this app A LOT. But, whenever I delete a photo it comes back. Yeah. It's really annoying it's been doing this for a while,also when I make changes to the photo,sometimes it goes back to the original!

4239,RB3Photography,"May 21, 2016",4,"No complains, except one major thing... Many of your adjustments aren't fine enough. I find one click's worth of exposure over or under exposes an image. This means I have to go back to Photoshop and make the adjustments that way. It's disappointing that you have such a wonderful product and can't refine it just this little bit, to make it a more powerful tool."
4240,Stegiand10,"June 15, 2013",5,"Outstanding Great app, stylish design, intuitive interface. This app has class. I haven't experienced any crash/bug so far. I bought the presets package on sales, they are all of great quality. My wish list: more options in cropping. Also let us zoom in when viewing a photo outside of editing."
4241,Austin Stanley,"July 1, 2013",3,"No grid? It's a great app for filters and photo corrections. Hard to share a photo without putting it through vsco cam first. But I wish they could invite people to grid already. I registered on the app launch date and still haven't gotten invited. I understand they are pushing it out to big users. Being a photographer with multiple 1000s of followers, I wish I could use that service and recommend it to my subscribers."
4242,Laceybee2222222,"December 28, 2013",5,"Awesome! It is great to have VSCO on my phone when I'm not editing on my laptop. It looks great still and offers just the filters I love. (Couple more filter options and it's even better) if you're looking go glam, glitter, border and sticker your photos... Wrong app. There's plenty of those out there but VSCO is for professional editing."
4243,"The White Tiger, Leb","June 10, 2016",1,"Irritants great and small Gesture based navigation is great, if you give obvious cues as to where you're navigating. VSCO uses various, often esoteric icons to explain where a swipe or a tap will take you. This has been bothering me for some time now."

I loved how simple it used to be. with the update I feel like I don't know how to use VSCO anymore. I would love from them to go back to the original VSCO.
4245,cdubelu,"June 25, 2016",5,"Best photography app ever. Period. If you are looking for a professional photo editor with gorgeous filters and powerful tools then this is the app for you. Ignore the comments where people rant about how different the app is now. It still works, it's still powerful, it's still fantastic. VSCO is one of the best photography companies out there."
4246,Ken78911,"November 9, 2016",4,Make it so you can view older pictures easier! I never write reviews but you really need to make it so you can view your vsco profile like instagram where you can easily find a picture you posted from a while back instead of scrolling and scrolling all the way down to find it... very time consuming
4247,TheOfficial94,"November 11, 2016",5,Stretched/wide photos Tho I really love this app it has recently had this bug where my photos when I try to save them to my camera roll it will be either wide or stretched out please fix this! - also this is just a suggestion to make the app even better add VIDEO with filters and all. Thanks!
4248,sk8tracy,"November 21, 2016",3,"Less intuitive now I still love the photo editing functions on VSCO, but the app has become less intuitive as the versions go along! Mind you, it's a beautiful app to look at, and the filters and manual settings are my go-to ways of improving images I took on my phone. I just think they have made the icons too simple, using shapes that have no obvious relation to the actual functionality of the buttons."

I know the cost of a collection of filters isn't even that bad but now that a lot of people take photos and use their Instagrams to express themselves, I think there should be more free filters. That's all. Love the app! Hope to see more FREE filters!"

4254,Chloe:*,"August 20, 2015",5,Love this app! Have a suggestion though This app is great I love using it for editing photos and exploring cool photography concepts. What would improve this app even better would be to have the ability to have multiple photo library's so out uploads to VSCO and other social media platforms can be more organized.
4255,Jscott491,"October 2, 2015",2,"a slow confusing mess What used to be my favorite and go-to photo editing app has become much of an afterthought. After countless updates the ""new"" app is slow, clunky and a bit unresponsive. The controls that were once so simple have been replaced with terrible icons and layers of confusion.

4256,Danwakeem,"November 29, 2015",4,Love the filters. Takes up too much space. This app is amazing and I really like the filters but if you use it a lot it takes up way to much space one your phone.

Being able to move one in front of the other without having to delete everything and reposting in order?
4260,Camille Francis,"March 9, 2014",5,"Rad. Freaking love this app, despite having a pretty nice camera I often find myself longing for some neat picture ideas and this provides some cool, minimalistic filters that are great for making things look just a bit more dramatic.

I've purchased every preset package launched on iOS and even purchased a collection for Lightroom 5. My only complaints are the disappearance of LV 1 and LV 2 and the ""reemergence"" of the original presets, now being offered for a limited time purchase. I just think that is kind of shabby and a little disappointing."
4262,mitzib123,"October 14, 2015",1,awful update so disappointed with the new update. my explore feed is way too small and it is very difficult to see the pictures from the people I follow. you need to fix this update asap and change it back to the way it used to be. I hate the white borders. I also do not like how I can't switch between the different sizes on my grid. I used to be able to see my pictures bigger one at a time and smaller with a bunch of them showing up. not impressed with the latest updates at all!!
4263,Rusty Edwards,"October 18, 2015",1,"Update is awful As a software developer I'm absolutely shocked by this update. A) Can't even upload pictures into the library anymore, I'm guessing because something was changed in the app and it no longer has access to Photos. B) Awful UI, I shouldn't have to click every icon to find out what it does. Settings should be a gear, it's a standard for a reason. Dots in a circle doesn't tell me anything. I've used you guys for a long time, but for now I'm going to switch back to Afterlight until you get it right again."

Please make an option to be able to show the time posted or not."

Honestly it's so difficult to navigate and create- very disappointing from the simple sharing space that it formerly was. If you can avoid updating it I would highly recommend doing so, it will ruin it for you. As for those responsible for the update I beg you to return it to its former glory. I hate the new version and find myself barely using my past favorite app. Vsco was on the up and coming and now it's awful."

I open up the app on my 4S and it crashes within a couple seconds. Hopefully there will be a fix as I've already made purchases in the new version! Fantastic job besides this current issue.
4272,BluePotato1,"June 22, 2013",5,"Beautiful UI, subtle animations My go to camera app. I wish I could access it from the lock screen! The presets are rich and organic without being gimmicky. I bought the $5.99 pack and I don't think I've ever spent that much on an app in the App Store, but it is worth it to me, especially considering the $80-$120 price tag of the VSCO Film packs."
4273,Unchallenged Player,"July 28, 2013",5,Great controls I've had dubious feelings about iPhonography for quite some time. This app changed my feelings a lot. Makes adjustments available at a far deeper and more varied level than other apps I've tried. The files look quite good off the phone too. Will be using this much more to come.
4274,Cakekat,"February 4, 2014",5,"Easy, beautiful, worth it. I use VSCOcam for all my iPhone photo processing. It has the best b&w feature I've ever seen in an app. Since I use it most days, I splurged on the big filter pack... And it was so worth it. Best filter app. Hands down. I use it in conjunction with some others if I need features outside of filtering, but I always start here."
4275,SheenaYoung,"March 1, 2014",5,"So beautiful and easy to use! This has become the only photo editing tool I use now and I have tried countless apps in the past. I am an avid photo editing user.

4277,yvonnieee,"April 20, 2017",3,"Stop updating the layout I enjoy using the app to edit photos but I despise how every time we get a large update, your icons gets larger and the layout gets darker + bland. There are too much space between each tool buttons and having black everywhere is not pleasing to the eyes for some."
4278,AllieCakesz,"June 21, 2017",5,Getting better This app just has it's good and bad days. Some days it doesn't want to open and some it lets me edit what ever I want.

Cool update and good features; I love the creativity of it, and how you can express yourself and put your photography / life out there safely. All I would really think about for the app is probably more cool filters; Maybe some vintage scratchy textures, too. I also would like to be able to rearrange the pics on the grid. That's about it. Thx, vsco."
4281,Pocket Frogs #1 Fan,"April 29, 2016",4,Love it but... I use this app all the time! It's great for editing and stuff like that. I only have one concern: I would like for there to be an option to make your account private so only people you allow can see my pictures. I'm surprised that this isn't already an option since this is a very popular photo editing/sharing app.
4282,mblight0430,"June 2, 2016",5,"Love VSCO I use vsco to filter all my pictures. The app has a great selection of free filters and there are many sales where you can get new filters for free.

It's auto cropping feature also helped immensely. Super stoked to see that the update completely destroyed every cool thing about this app. I feel like I'm just staring at a bunch of black space and since there's no auto crop the pictures are shrunken down and small as hell - good one! Now I have to squint to see my tiny pictures, they are awkwardly spaced and visually unpleasant to look at AND I can no longer plan my Instagram feed. Neat."
4284,kyd22222,"June 16, 2016",1,"Terrible horrible no good very bad update Seriously don't understand anything with the new layout. It's impossible to get it to take a picture on the first swipe (or the 30th, and thats after spending five minutes trying to figure out how to get it to take a picture at all) So much time wasted trying to do the simplest things, swiping back and forth between screens and wondering, what the hell is all of this stuff? I just want to take and edit my pictures! and the circle as yes is THE WORST IDEA EVER. least intuitive app I've ever used."
4285,Cruze'mom,"June 22, 2016",1,"Huge disappointment This update has been the worst. I really hope you guys see how much everyone hates it and go back to some of your older features. Such as, the square grid! That's the main reason why so many of us used this app - to plan out our Instagram feeds. I'm searching for a new app fulfill this need and I'm assuming if there isn't one, there will be one very very soon. Please go back to that feature or at least give an option for us to use whatever layout we choose. This was a huge disappointment"
4286,cs_lovelace,"June 28, 2016",1,"""Understated interface"" is furiously confusing Innovation in technology and design is important to move forward and make things more efficient, but this new version of VSCO is a step backward. This UI is not at all intuitive. The symbols as buttons are confusing (such as the circle that you are meant to swipe up to get to the camera - what?). I accidentally navigated to the ""following"" page and couldn't get back to my imported images - spent a few minutes idiotically tapping and swiping things until I gave up and force quit the app."
4287,AllysonClayton,"July 3, 2016",1,"Angry I have never been angry at an app before but frankly VSCO you messed up a great thing. I used you because of the square layout homepage which was simple to use with a simple display that I could use to plan for Instagram. Instagram is what made you such a great app, and now you're trying to do your own thing. Please please please listen to all the reviews and change it back. It is kind of a crappy thing to disregard all of the opinions of your users and focus on your own arena and trying to make your hipster version of Instagram famous."
4288,738728anonymous1535,"September 7, 2016",1,"CHANGE IT BACK The recent updates have made VSCO a lot worse. The most annoying thing is the new layout; before, my photos were displayed in a uniform, square crop, so I could tell how a photo would look on my Instagram feed. Now, photos are displayed in their actual dimensions, which looks extremely cluttered and unorganized and makes it difficult for me to predict what a pic will look like on Instagram. "
4289,Kaneevolution,"January 13, 2017",3,"I love this app, please update! I would gladly pay for a better version of this app. It has become a part of my photo process. "

4291,‚òªs‚òØfia‚òπ,"March 11, 2014",5,"By far the best editing app in the AppStore. this app is probably one of the greatest and most smoothly running app out there. the design is pretty rad and the filters are really soft and not too corny, and they don't completely ruin the photo or look overdone. I also love that you can edit your own photos from scratch."
4292,Scott Thornburg,"November 15, 2014",4,"GREAT Photography app! This is my favorite app for editing & filtering my photos. I use it on nearly every picture I take! My only complaints are that there is no iOS 8 extension (yet?) and I'm not a fan of the the new black & white logo... Aside from those 2 small things, I give the functionality of this app 4 stars and if an extension is added, it'll be a 5 star app in my opinion!"
4293,_danilou,"November 20, 2014",2,Improve adjustments! I love everything about this new update except for one critical thing ‚Äî the UI is terrible when attempting to do fine adjustments to photographs! Sliding the editing bar is only possible if your finger is directly on top of the small dot that shows your adjustments. This was not an issue in version 3 and I really ask that you fix this; I have no desire to edit photos with VSCO until then because it's so irritating and difficult to work with.
4294,BouZint,"January 7, 2015",3,"Great editing but I really like VSCOcam, it's a great editing tool. However about a week ago it started crashing whenever I would try to download photos to my phone. Basically all I can do is Instagram them. I tried to email them to myself and even though I set up an account it says there's no email attached to it and I can't figure out how to set up my email. It's a very confusing app to navigate."

4298,Alliewisdom,"October 30, 2015",2,"Updates are crap The fact that this app has the best photo filters is a fact that continues to be true regardless of updates. But whereas it used to have a smooth, awesome interface, it is now confusing and a huge downgrade from what it once was. Additionally, the app continuously crashes when uploading more than about 2 photos at a time for me, and it never used to do that before these past few updates. I will mourn the loss of a once-phenomenal app."
4299,sadgucci,"January 10, 2016",5,"My favorite editing app, However The ability to create and use custom filters we create would be amazing. To add effects such as a filter at a certain degree, with a temperature at another, and be able to save it to use and apply to other photos quickly."

4301,Serghey,"June 9, 2013",5,"Astounding At first I didn't like it but then realized there is a store where more filters can be bought.

If the problem was limited to one image, I would have thought taking pictures with this app was gamble: maybe you'd get an image, maybe you'd get a crash.  But as it turns out, the problem is worse.  Whenever I open the browse view to view all the pics I've taken, the app crashes the moment it tries to display a thumbnail of of the image it corrupted - thus makes all my images inaccessible."

White is a classic and pure color and they ruined it by making the background black): Its not pretty to look at anymore. And the update is all awkward now why cant they just leave it be"
4318,Bobby beefkins,"June 11, 2016",5,"Update Even though the new update may seem overwhelming at first, I believe that it is a huge improvement to the design.

In my opinion, having the preview pictures for your images the same ratio as the picture, rather than a square, is not practical. The square previews for were so much easier to work with when trying edit pictures for Instagram. With the old layout, you could almost exactly see how your pictures would look like on your Instagram feed. The old version was much more simple and more effective."

In addition to not being able to even save my pictures once edited on the app, the new design is conflicting. I understand wanting to get more people to use the app as a social aspect, rather than just an editor, but not everyone wants this. Don't make it the focus. The new fonts, hidden tools, and the dumb circle to swipe is messy. Stick to your former clean and simple design."

As of right now I'm on the verge of deleting the app. Everything that was updated is pretty much useless so there is no point of me to continue to use the app. Unless they bring back the old layout (which they won't because hey who cares what the USERS OF THE APP WANT), I feel as if the app has run its course and will soon go out of style."

I use it for all my pictures. but now I want to buy new filters, and it says I need to update the app. however, when I go to update it it doesn't give me an option to, it just says, ""OPEN+"" please help!! I want more filters for this glorious app!!"

However, every single time I launch the app, within 3 seconds it crashes. I've tried resetting the app, deleting & reinstalling and updating it and nothing seems to work. Sometimes I'll try to launch it out of the blue and it works, but when I upload photos from my gallery, instead of my photo being there, it's just a black box."

I have bought all the filter packs. But despite numerous interface redesigns, the interface is inscrutable. It's impossible to understand, even for me after 3 years. It's great that VSCO has designers really interested in custom interface icons but with no label text, it's a usability mess. 10+ stars for the filters, 1 star interface."

4354,Anonymous14884,"November 11, 2016",5,Great app! I love this app it's my favorite for photo editing but can you make the next update allow us to put filters on videos! I love using this app to create my Instagram themes but when I post videos they don't match! But it's still my favorite app. I love the setup and it's very simple and easy to use!
4355,Elizabeth S Gol,"November 13, 2016",4,Surprised by bad reviews & suggestion This app is amazing. I think it deserves at least 4.5 stars. If you are the type of person who loves photography- this app will most likely satisfy you. The filters and effects can completely transform a photo. My suggestion is to make it so we can have different albums for the published photos. Thank you :)
4356,Mr. Mediocrity,"November 29, 2016",2,"Meh. Useless ""community"" feature. Cool filters, but nearly impossible to figure out how to save the finished product. It doesn't automatically save to your camera roll. You have to upload it, send a link to yourself, click the link, choose to open the link in the app, THEN save the pic. What a hassle. Why not automatically save to the camera roll? Will update my review if they add this feature and I haven't moved on to better apps by then."
4357,pdxmph,"February 5, 2017",1,"UI is behind the capabilities VSCO has some great editing tools and its filters are really nice. Unfortunately, it's designed like an iPhone-first app, so using it on an iPad isn't very good and makes it hard to use the capabilities it has. "

4365,TheModernCount,"June 9, 2016",2,"Editing is great, app is confusing Why change the app all the time? It's not just adding a feature here or a feature there, but entirely changing the layout of the app so that it's even more confusing than it ever was! I just don't think a new layout should've been the priority! I think listening to the requests of the users for specific features (like adding video support, or RAW support) would've been a better than just changing the UI."

You're supposed to be a more PROFESSIONAL app, but this looks so cheesy! The layout looks like a beta version and some how slipped through the cracks. Half the time, I'm just guessing at which buttons to press to do something as simple as save a photo. I should be able to navigate seamlessly, not trying to guess what's behind door number 1. Please tell me this is a joke! Kill it before it lays eggs!!"

I really want to like and use this app but its been 2 weeks of not being able to use it due to the latest ""update""! I wouldn't bother downloading this App until they take the time to iron out all the kinks, as it is right now, it will just take up space on your device!"
4372,Cherstain,"June 29, 2013",5,Wonderful! I wish there was an iPad version I love the option of making an account. All of the filters are amazing and you can adjust the visibility of the filter if it is too strong.

Completely overcomplicated the entire app. The gestures are stupid and the lack of a navigation menu is confusing. The redesigned look is ugly and degrades the experience. So many changes that are  completely ridiculous like turning the check mark to upload a photo into a circle. Please change back to the previous design. This is a failed experiment just like the blue app logo.

It's very frustrating because I use this for instagram and it just doesn't seem to be working out. The only reason I still have it is because I like to edit my pictures.

This fantastic new app is quite the opposite with very little not to love about it! The bundled in-app presets for purchase are very well done and highly recommended.
4422,Meg7475,"February 20, 2014",4,"New Update I love this app, and i always have. Its great for editing my pictures and is the only app I use. I used to get low storage warnings, but i've barley used half my storage. After the update I cant use the app anymore because their isn't any more ""storage"" while i still have plenty of room. Fix this and it would be worth 6 stars!"
4423,twildermuth,"October 17, 2014",5,"My Go-To Photo a Editing App VSCO is my go-to photo editing app! Perfect edits can be made in a matter of seconds and saved or shared to a variety of social media outlets. You can use a number of the preset filters, or use the editing tools for brightness, contrast, temperature, saturation and more to create your perfect picture."
4424,NYCMediaMix,"November 15, 2014",4,"Great app, online support needs improvement Updating to version 4.0 made the app slow and crashed my iPhone 6 Plus before I can save any changes rendering the app useless. I looked online for support and didn't find any. I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app to see if performance improved--it did but I lost my photo library."
4425,layfambam,"January 2, 2015",5,"MY FAVORITE PHOTO EDITING APP!! I have gone through a whole lot of photo editing apps, but this one is by far my favorite. I'll admit, I did buy the big pack of filters (on sale), but they certainly come in handy!! Tonssss of color filters and lots of b&w ones too!!! You only need this one app to edit your pictures!!"
4426,birdyj9,"June 24, 2016",1,Too complicated for even a detailed review Seems that VSCO prefers the social network over the overall photography i.e taking a photo and editing. I can't even get to the Editing after taking pic. The swipe of the shoot button goes directly to the Collection. I loved the controls of focus and editing especially the Perspective options the instant the picture taken. I can use any App for what this App offers and with much more ease AND with more options for LESS money. Going back to Cam pro+ and Snapseed
4427,Kristinank,"July 2, 2016",1,"Seriously a dumb update I regret ever updating, should've read the update info. VSCO was my favorite app to edit pictures for Instagram. The overall design of the new VSCO has a horrible interface that is confusing, and I've been using it for a month since they've updated. I hate the area where you upload pictures into VSCO the most, what the heck is all the black space? I loved that I could see how it look in squares and now it's hard to see anything!!! Looking for a replacement for this app!"
4428,"TPB, Esq.","July 24, 2016",1,"Once brilliant but now a mess I had to give up on VSCO this week. Too many mid-morning crashes. Too many file saves that never saved. An interface that, with each version, became more incomprehensible. Why is it trying to develop a social media side? That race has been run. Why use icons for various functions that are completely different from those used by other major editing apps. Why does it seem like there have been changes but no new features in a long, long time?"
4429,connerssss,"December 4, 2016",5,"wonderful app!/suggestions i love using vsco daily for my photo editing needs! recently i have found with all of these great filters and bundles, it becomes very difficult to know which filter goes with what. Since the edits are bought in bundles i would love the edits to be grouped. thanks!"

4431,ChuckHaller,"October 28, 2014",5,"My favorite app, I just wish one thing Easily my favorite app, not just for photography but in general. I just wish you could use either the volume controls as the shutter control as you can with the native camera app. That would make this app perfect."
4432,hcobs,"November 25, 2014",5,"Best app ever!! üíï I'm soooooo in love with this app! Not only does it have basic photo edits, it also has numerous high quality effects that could make pictures breathtakingly beautiful. Some effects, you have to buy, but they are worth purchasing. Although, the free effects, alone, are wonderful."
4433,Rae t s,"December 29, 2014",5,"Love this app!!! This is by far the best photography app I've found. It has beautiful filters and the possibilities are endless when it comes to editing. I love the fact that you can control the exposure, focus, shutter speed, etc. while you are taking the photo. This app is amazing!!"
4434,bluegrasspicker42,"October 27, 2015",4,"About the new update... Bring back the old grid view please. The new update was a step back in the right direction, but even on my iPad, the pictures still look small and don't fill up the screen in the new streamlined view. Other than that, I'm loving VSCO, and have been very comfortable navigating the interface."
4435,gjhng,"February 1, 2016",4,"Lovin it I've been using this app for a while now but there's a problem. I'm trying to edit a photo so I import it and shows as the great quality it was before. However, after I press the button to take it into ""editing mode"", the quality becomes pretty bad. Please fix or tell me if I'm doing something wrong."
4436,TheLuceDog,"June 11, 2016",1,"Just bad I loved this app for editing/planning out images for my social media, but now the layout is just weird and it doesn't make sense why they would change what I already enjoyed greatly. The main thing I dislike is how there is a lot of blank space around all my images in the library. I really do not like this update and I anticipate that it goes back to the old design, because I will probably end up finding better apps unless this one fixes itself. Very disappointed."
4437,Madelyn Styles,"June 12, 2016",2,"I Hate the Update !!! I used to love this app so much and it was all I used to edit pictures. I loved how it lined up your pictures as it would look in Instagram but with this update, you can no longer see it. I also hate how you have to use the button to swipe. It is just very confusing and I still love the filters and how I edit my pictures but the layout of it is so bad !! Please VSCO, if you see this, change the app to it's old version."
4438,Michiemm,"June 17, 2016",1,"New Update is HORRIBlE The new ""update"" is absolutely horrible and feels like this app actually took a step (or ten steps) back into the past. "
4439,Good Bean,"June 22, 2016",1,"Ruined Would love to hear the developer explain the thinking behind this train wreck. Beyond the miserable UX, I find that photos taken outside of the updated app are unavailable to import into vscocam until I close the and reopen it, so it's buggy as well! I've built VSCO into my workflow on the Mac and rely on it solely on iOS (and unwisely bought almost every preset!), but after struggling with this ridiculous update for a couple of weeks, I'm done. Maybe the developer can create a new update with the user in mind... maybe not."
4440,TheRacyte,"June 8, 2013",4,"Love the app BUT......, Love this app!! However, I cannot get it to restore my purchases it just freezes after 2-3 downloads. I have uninstalled it and tried to reinstall and restore my purchases several times to no avail. Anyone else having this problem? Hope it's just a little glitch the developers will address very soon!üòÅpls."
4441,kate spicer,"June 11, 2013",2,Okay? I'm lost. The previews looks pretty good and once I read the reviews of seeing half yes half no I had to see for myself. I opened the app up and I agree with who ever said there is no tutorial for where anything is or to use the app. I love the templates used for the app and like I said the presets looked awesome but I wasn't even able to click on an image or take an imagine to edit it. I think some changes or bugs need to be fixed. Would love to use this app.
4442,Jorsiem,"June 12, 2013",2,"Not what I was expecting I gave it two stars because of the aesthetics and the beautiful UI, in terms of funcionality, it doesn't do much. A couple of crappy filters and effects that quite honestly the instagram's default filters look better. Also VERY frustrating that none of the buttons are labeled and you need to figure everything out. On top of that everything else is a paid add-on. Not worth the space in my memory. Deleted."
4443,stetyldic,"June 12, 2013",5,Brilliant and clean camera app This is a gorgeously designed app that has a very large range of filters (although you have to pay for them). I've gotten some incredibly beautiful images using this camera and would highly recommend it.
4444,Love soccer 7,"February 27, 2014",5,Everything and more I absolutely LOVE this app. It works wonders. I love photography and I love to edit my pictures and this app is everything you could ever want and more. Amazing filters and options for beginners plus in app purchases for more advanced users. One of my all time favorite apps.
4445,Saberlarry,"July 19, 2014",5,"One of the best - if not, the best photo editor app on the AppStore I had a long and hard time just to find a good app for editing photos and my friend suggested me giving this an attempt. Ever since that moment i've been using this as my main P.E app. Great filters, best UI ever seen, great community with loads of sections. Simply 5 stars."
4446,Kevin11724,"July 20, 2014",4,Close to perfection I love the complete control this editing software gives the user and this is my go to app to shoot and edit. This app completely deserves to have 5 stars however if the user had the ability to make the picture turn to landscape mode by turning the device that would be great.
4447,BeAbleToChangeTheUsername,"January 21, 2017",3,"Private mode Vsco is a great app, however I feel like it would be even better if the users were able to put their accounts on private. I feel like everyone would feel more safe and secure if this was allowed. I understand the simplicity the app has but this is just a minor detail that would make a major impact and everyone would be pleased."
4448,jackscraig,"March 6, 2017",5,"Powerful, unique, and positive I've been using VSCO, along with several other camera/editing/portfolio/community, etc. photography apps for a long time. VSCO seems to stand out among the best of the best, in often subtle but useful ways. "
4449,Shvrgzdfjnddg,"July 11, 2017",5,Love the app but one thing The one thing I'd really like to see happen is when you click on another profiles photo it would be cool to view who had reposted it to widen the variety of new people to follow considering you share the same interest in the photos!
4450,el3vated,"February 19, 2015",3,"okay but editing features are beautiful & holistically sound; my only qualms are in regards to uploading directly from app to instagram‚Äìcould there be any way for the user to crop the photo as THEY would like? right now it's locked on uploading to ig solely with a preset resolution...hard to explain, but vsco often cuts off my pictures poorly, & i end up saving to my phone & uploading to ig manually anyway"
4451,Jay Teamer,"March 6, 2015",4,"LOVE IT VSCO is an amazing photo editing app and it's wonderful way to step up your photography skills. It's also cool to see your friends' photos in your feeds!! The only thing I wish they could was if you could see who follows you (so you can follow them back) and also if they'd put in a ""like"" and a ""comment"" function that'd be sweet!!! Other than that, VSCO is AMAZING!!!"

4453,Crazygal1228,"June 9, 2016",4,New update Love this app so much it has changed the game when it comes to photo editing but the new update has completely changed it the set up isn't as aesthetically pleasing and completely different for users I hope it will become a bit more like the last version of vsco that was its true prime
4454,CharbearC,"June 11, 2016",1,"Not a huge fan of the new update I used to love VSCO because it allowed me to check whether my pictures look cohesive. With the new update, the black gaps in between different pictures just bothers me so much, especially when a lot of my pictures are of different dimensions. I also don't quite understand the big chunk of blue at the top. I hope in the future, the users will be allowed to change the setup of the interface, so we can decide how the pictures are displayed in the gallery."
4455,Browniescanpee,"June 11, 2016",4,"Love the app, hate the update. I absolutely love VSCO, it is a clean simple app and so easy to use. Honestly the update is confusing to me, i personally like the old one a lot better!! I hope the next update will be similar to the old VSCO, it was much more simple!! But overall I absolutely love this app, it makes editing my pictures so much easier and fun!‚ù§Ô∏è"

After making sign into my acct again, I can't even access my own library or photos in VSCO - there is no button for this? Also, in Camera mode: I was taking pics on accident by pressing the lower right hand corner of black space with my thumb - not even pressing the camera button on screen. Can you guys go back to the old VSCO please? This is annoying as hell and I want to access my photos. Thanks!"
4458,Jokrueg,"July 13, 2016",1,"Terrible,  horrible,  no good,  very bad update If I could rate this zero stars,  I  would.  I used to rely on this app to layout my Instagram feed but the update changed the interface from square photos to the original ratios with tons of black negative space around the photos.  It's not intuitive at all.  This app serves no purpose to me at all. I'm hoping the developers will finally get it that the users want the original interface back! Horrible update.  I wish I would have never updated!!"

I had an account on the app and than when I redownloaded my app after the concert all my drafts/My Images were gone. I had not published any photos at this point because I was waiting till the end of summer to post all my summer pictures. I lost near 50 pictures of the places I had visited, my friends, my family, and other very important moments in my life. As a result I am sitting in my car crying currently because I lost all these precious moments."
4460,Danny Pas,"June 24, 2013",5,Best Photo App I've tried a multitude of photo taking apps from the App Store and this is by far the best app I've tried so far. The deal going on right now allows you to get 48 filters for $5.99. These filters open up a door to so much more. It's all in all a great app and I recommend it to anyone.
4461,W.Everett,"July 2, 2013",5,"Great editing app! Really easy to use. I bought the extra filters and so far I feel like they are worth having, although the included filters are awesome and very believable and useable."

4463,Zabott,"February 12, 2014",2,"No More Default Camera I use VSCO as my default camera for months, now that it opens straight up to your library I can no longer just whip out my phone and use it for my camera when I want to take a picture. Please change this back or give us the ability to set the camera as the default to open in preferences. Thank you! I really love VSCO and edit and shoot photos so much. Daily taking pictures. Please please fix this."

A lot of people are having major problems uploading pictures from our camera roll to the app. The pictures just don't show up when we look at our camera roll on vscocam.

4468,danalorenzana,"May 15, 2014",5,The best I love everything about this app. From all the presets to literally the ability to create your own with individual photo adjustments. Can you also add noise reduction? Even for a small price I would pay for it. That would make it even better. :)
4469,Buttttttercup,"December 12, 2014",5,Love love love Absolutely the best editing app out there. Tons of free filters and so many editing options. 
4470,haykitttyy,"June 8, 2013",1,"Slow, clunky, old version was better I wish i hadn't updated this app, the old version was better. This app is slow to respond, has endless cryptic icons (how do I even adjust the image fill, contrast, etc like you used to?). Also, when you import an image the app tells says the image file is too big and it resizes it. Why would I want my image resized when I'm trying to edit it? I like to keep the full resolution considering I do more with my photos than just post them on Instagram. Fail."
4471,Leliii22,"June 12, 2013",5,Wonderful! This app is pure beauty. It makes my images look so elegant and professional; it brought out the photographer in me. I've never experienced any problems with it since I got it. I loved it so much I bought the rest of the filters. It works just fine and wonderfully.
4472,Leprr,"June 9, 2016",2,"The UI shouldn't have been changed I was actually happy with the UI we were using. I thought there were going to be minor good changes to the UI but a lot has changed and now we have to remember the gestures doesn't make it better. Another thing is that I can't find the manual camera settings. I can't find where I can change the ISO, shutter speed, aperture. I use it all the time with every picture I take. Please bring it back"
4473,Ashlyn P.,"June 10, 2016",3,"IDEA TO ACCOMMODATE ALL! I love this app so much but like others I don't like the set up of the library, allot of people used the app based on the set up of the library being ""Instagram layout"" style, a way to fix this problem to accommodate all I recommend having a layout option in the library to either see your pics in the new update layout or ""Instagram feed"" style with all squares."
4474,Superw0man111,"September 27, 2016",1,"JUST A PROBLEM NEEDS FIXED I love this app usually, I love the edits and how it works. However, what made me rate this 1 star is that I like to go through my old photos on there and delete what I don't want anymore. Lately when I scrolled down and deleted a picture, every single time it crashes back up to the top of my vsco. Its so annoying because I cant delete anything without having to scroll down alllll the way down again which takes forever to do!! Once fixed, Im willing to rate 5 stars! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

So I tried saving to my camera roll to share via a different app, but the saved version is very faded! Not at all the filter/edits I used. Definitely needs attention. I'm holding out for an update, this is a major issue."

Also I don't even know how to view my own profile anymore... but by far the most annoying thing with the new update is how it crops all my pictures when I try to publish them. If the cropping isn't gone by the next update I'm seriously gonna stop using this app. I used to love it too...

I don't like how you have to click on every picture just to see the caption. either make it so we can slide down or sideways. all my friends always say how they hate that we can't slide anymore. bring that back and then you will be good
4503,Seadit,"June 12, 2016",1,"Update Shmupdate Not a fan at all of the new update. Did not improve any aspect of this other than its more designy. It's faster, but confusing and buggy so that's a wash. Ended up somewhere that had no way out - had to quit out and restart. If you want to update something, update your sliders - Instagram's work so much better: easy to make small adjustments and you can see them immediately. I love this app - it's what I use for all my processing (and have for years), but man this version makes it tough."
4504,piggy sooie,"June 16, 2016",1,"ROH2316 I don't like this update at all, it's confusing and not simple at all. The time stamps and dates are all gone, that's what I loved the most about VSCO was the time stamps and dates so I could look back and see the pictures from a certain day. I can't find anything anywhere on the app, and I'm honestly thinking about not using the app anymore. Not happy with the security settings either you should be able to keep your account private from predators. Go back to the way VSCO used to be"

I used to love VSCO, but now it's just frustrating. It shouldn't be so hard to view my friends' photos. At first I thought that feature was just gone. That being said, it took me a while to figure out the new layout, and I can't even say that it doesn't still trip me up over a week later. This update is complete trash. Bring back the old VSCO."

I'm even more upset that even after I turned off my automatic updates and I've been avoiding the update for as long as I could, it still updated by itself. I'm so disappointed in this new update and in this app."

Like freezing my phone when saving an image; not downloading purchased filters (even after multiple attempts); saving an edited image correctly one moment and then the next, nothing. It's a shame really. I liked the concept of the app and the filters available. However with more and more issues cropping up each time I use this app, I'm going to cut my losses and delete it."

It feels claustrophobic, navigating between your feed and the journals and camera is horribly confusing. Seriously, this is the WORST update I've ever seen. People freaked out about Instagram, but that was nothing compared to this. It's not just different, it's WORSE."
4583,Djakajsid,"July 2, 2016",3,"Eh? I've been using VSCO for about a year now, and I've fallen in love with the app. However, its new update failed to impress me. Even though I don't particularly like it, I'm still using VSCO on a daily basic, merely for the fact no other editing app has the simplicity that VSCO has. I wish they would return to the previous user face, as it seems everybody doesn't like the new look."
4584,Xoxo... Gossip Girl,"July 12, 2016",3,"My Opinion The app is okay. I love the filters, but thing is the app will not let me change my profile pic and it takes forever to put a pic on your vsco. With the profile thing, it lets me change it and then it changes it right back to the one before and that really gets on my nerves. So overall this app gets a 3/5 stars, but it's very close to a 2.5/5 stars for me."
4585,SashaAgapov,"July 15, 2016",1,"Disgustingly overdesigned Vsco used to be one of my favorite apps ‚Äî differrent, a bit confusing, but still lovely. When the update rolled out I didn't like it but decided to give it time. Well, the time's passed and the new design is still utterly unusable, the navigation is beyond confusing, the app looks like it was designed as a school project by an overachieving art student ‚Äî blunt, flashy and meaningless. This all led to me not ever opening VSCO, which is kinda sad because I spent money on filters back when VSCO just launched."
4586,sanserifs,"July 18, 2016",2,"Was one of my top 5 apps... I've used VSCO for a couple of years, and it was my go to app for photo editing. The recent UI changes have made me reconsider this. From a design perspective (which is my profession), the interface is no longer intuitive or straightforward.  According to the VSCO site, they ""push boundaries in order to create a compelling experience"". This latest UI is only compelling me to use a different app. Please work on updates!"

4589,basboyblair,"October 25, 2016",1,Interface is confusing. I heard this is a great app. But saw all the 1 star reviews for the new interface. Had to check it out anyway. Even signing up for their social site is confusing. It offers to sign in or sign up. But only offers option to Sign In Mike you have an account. I suspect they only tested this app out on geeky friends who suggested the interface changes. Too bad. Well Snapseed was the other option suggested. So moving onto trying that one and deleting this app.

You're also not allowed to upload photos from your phone, which is the only way I used the app. And, it only lets you sync one device. As someone who uses this app between an iPhone and iPad, this is extremely inconvenient. I will have to find an alternative app for this unless it changes back."

4600,this Whole city,"June 22, 2013",5,The filters behave differently and better than in any app I've tried. VSCO's professional quality is very apparent in this app.  I often use it instead of the camera app just so there's fewer steps to applying their filters.

4624,Narchocracy,"July 20, 2016",1,"Bring back the old user interface The new user interface is a joke. It's counterintuitive, I spend more time trying to figure it out than actually editing/sharing photos. The old interface was not great, but it was much better than the current one. I HATE the three panels that you swipe between... Not to mention the viewer for your own shared photos is plain and ugly. If Instagram is Facebook, the current version of VSCO is livejournal (yikes), but less easy to navigate."

My investment in all of their filters has gone to waste because I can't stand the interface and it gets worse with every update. I can't stand to use the software. It's that bad.

When I try to upload a picture that has the ""grid"" edit on it to Instagram it goes away. don't know if it's Instagram or the VSCO cam app but other than that. GREAT APP!!"
4668,m_diggity,"March 10, 2015",5,"The closest to film Most camera apps create general effects. The VSCO camera app, like their other products, are the result of studying actual film types and emulating them in software. Photographers understand the undertaking of this and appreciate what they are doing."
4669,Frenchy131,"August 6, 2015",4,"Wonderful VSCO is an amazing app, much better than Instagram due to its privacy and overall class. It's sophisticated and has awesome features, I highly recommend! One thing I would recommend to the makers is to add a color splash option in editing photos and make it easier to find fellow users!"
4670,Sruiz0417,"June 6, 2013",5,"A Dream The original VSCO was such a beautiful editor, but this new app is a definite upgrade. The output quality is perfect, the new filters are amazing, the option to buy additional filters is great. The new camera and library are a much needed improvement. It's perfect. Great job, VSCO."
4671,cheryldc,"June 7, 2013",3,"Brilliant but still needs tweaking This application will revolutionize mobile photography. However, it needs minor adjustments in order to get there. Particularly, when exporting edited photos on an iPhone 4. These photos do not come out at all as they are saved in the VSCO cam library. I trust an update will fix this in time. Other than that, pristine work."
4672,Chloe√´,"June 8, 2013",5,Great App This is my first review ever. I had to write something because I am in love with this app. It is amazing!! I've been using it ever since I got it! It has the best filters and they're not overdone. It's for everyone but if you're a photographer you'll appreciate it even more. 5 out of 5 :)
4673,BuyingTheseFromThePinas,"June 9, 2013",5,"Better than the old app Even if there may be some things people might complain about, the design and thought put into the whole app makes up for it. Despite my bias for apps with nice interfaces, this delivers as much as it is pretty."
4674,SDrew222,"June 12, 2013",5,One star? I don't think so. I don't know where people are coming up with these problems. VSCO has been working fine on my phone. The new version of this app has become my favorite editing tool and hasn't given me any trouble at all.
4675,RemarkableRyan,"June 19, 2013",5,"Now the only photo App I use! Works great, love the customization! And the fact it doesn't use destructive edits. I can go back and change a photo months later if I want! Bought all the presets and use each of them all the time. Well worth it! Thanks VSCO!"
4676,richardfsho,"June 23, 2013",5,Love it/ Needs some fixes Love it and will always use it. Only problem is I bought he bundle of all and now saying half is missing but no matter how many times I reupload it won't work. Once that gets fixed this will be perfect!
4677,natalators,"June 29, 2013",1,"Everything. takes. forever. There's no reason a photo app should take up this much memory / be so dang slow. Even Hipstamatic with all its bells and whistles runs faster than this new version of VSCO cam. The old version was easier to use, faster, and I don't see why every photo app these days has to model itself after Hipsta with paid filter packs. The paid filters are lovely but who wants to shell out more $ on even more filters with all the other apps out there? Ah-nnoying."

4680,fellow VSCOer,"June 27, 2016",2,"PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!! ok, I never ever write reviews (this is my first review ever) which proves how mad and confused I am about this update. WHY?!?

4681,BCDC4,"July 7, 2016",1,"Another terrible update Putting out new versions again and again and again without changing the app back to the square grid will not give you guys good reviews. No one is going to be happy until you do that. Keep the app the way it is, but bring back the square grid and you might get some more stars. I haven't used VSCO since the new version came out...sorry guys, but this app is deleted from my phone until someone wakes up at VSCO and does something."
4682,adam_sykes_bradley,"July 9, 2016",5,I LOVE THE NEW UPDATE and APP üòçüò≠ Ok so everyone complaining about the update to me is crazy. It's 100% better and I love it. It is so much simpler and is honestly amazing. I am trying to make a business out of photography and I user this app to edit my pictures. BEST APP that I have ever used for photos before!!!
4683,Geoff_y,"September 1, 2016",5,Bad change Updated review back to 5. App loads faster and the navigation controls are fluid. The added clicking on presets for other images is great. Great work VSCO. Now please make DSCO great. 
4684,Justfixtheupdate,"September 9, 2016",3,"PLEASE DO THIS IDEA!! I love the app a lot. It is very beautiful, professional, and aesthetically pleasing but the only suggestion I have is to sell all of their filters separately and not in bundles. Some people (like me) don't want to buy the whole bundle because we are scared that we will waste our money only for a couple of the filters in the whole bundle. Please take this suggestion/idea into consideration."
4685,Coliocooli,"November 10, 2016",1,Stretched photo when exporting!!! Always been a loyal VSCO user and love it! Only issue I have ever had is when I tried exporting a photo today and suddenly it saves the photo squished or stretched! My only work around I found was using a different editing app to export a photo unedited then edit that in vsco. Seems to work this way. Maybe some sort of issue with vsco reading the picture dimensions from the data the iPhone creates with each photo taken. Please FIX ASAP!
4686,busyscott,"December 19, 2016",5,"VSCO cooked rare RAW!!! Loving the new update, I think most people are still bitter at vsco for the changes they made a while ago to their UI, but they really have listened to the community and are making efforts to right the ship. Love the new sliders to more precisely edit photos and the RAW support is amazing!"
4687,All in for the jellies,"January 28, 2017",4,"VSCO is not working well So today I went onto vsco and saw that my photos were not uploading. I went to the home Page and no pics came up it kept saying ""server eror"" I am very said bc then I deleted the app to get it back then log in and it's not letting log back in. I am depressed...please fix this."
4688,Samuelfn,"February 6, 2017",5,App problems I love this app it's great for editing i love seeing other people's pictures the only thing it would be great to like other people's posts and to at least know how much followers you have and to get followers easier
4689,South_FL,"March 1, 2017",1,"You have got to be kidding me.... I purchased every preset on this app a long time ago. For whatever reason, the app has always been unable to remember my purchases which is fine because I was always able to restore them until now...there are only two ""free"" presets available and all the others that I have purchased all have a price tag on them now. Unbelievable. I would love for the support staff to try offer an explanation for this."
4690,Wnugg,"September 8, 2015",4,"No complaints.  Thank you! I have no problems using this app.  If anything ever happened to this app, my phone photo taking life would change for the worst.

I love this app a lot and it has really great features but before the update I really liked the feature where on your grid you could change the layout of your pictures. Now I am stuck with the layout I had before the update, which I don't like. Please change this to how it was before. But overall I really like this app!!"
4692,N_pesa,"September 26, 2015",4,New Update Could Be Better I love this app. The only thing I would change about the new update is the fact that I can't change my layout and I hate that. I have such OCD about it. If the next update allowed me to change my layout as it did before then this review would receive a 5/5.

4694,VvanV,"April 13, 2016",2,"Frustrating I've deleted and reinstalled this app before to clear cached memory/data and not had an issue with losing photos. All my presets and photos in the library would reappear.  Now, with the update, all my library photos/thumbnails are gone. Very disappointing. I can retrieve my presets, but then when I go back into the filter packages it says ""download/restore"" even though I've already done so."
4695,Ncnxbcnalsudn,"May 9, 2016",4,Awesome but wish there was more privacy This app is awesome for sharing photos with friends and editing your photos but I don't like how you can't make your profile private or block users from seeing your profile. Someone followed me and I can't block them and it's annoying
4696,üçïüíò,"June 11, 2016",1,Loved it before...dislike it now!! VSCO cam was my go to app to edit my photos and it's still a good app to edit ur photos with its many filters BUT the layout is not as good anymore. One suggestion change back the library to square photos that look like your Instagram feed. Two some of the photos aren't as zoomed in as before when u would view it individually. Overall I want it to change back to how it was and I'm now having mixed feelings about the app.
4697,White girl.,"June 12, 2016",3,it's ok I just gave some suggestions sooooo..I'm cool with the update I guess. but I'm wondering if you could go back to where we don't have to use that circle to swipe between pages?
4698,kittynguyen,"June 16, 2016",1,"New update üëéüèº I've always liked VSCO cam not only for their filters but their layout. It's similar to Instagram, and makes it so much easier to adjust your editing to make sure that your pictures flow and match with your Instagram feed before you upload. Now that VSCO has updated, the pictures aren't in square preview mode anymore and I'm sure I'm not the only one bothered by it. Please change it back to the square previews if you value your customers."
4699,Lover jk,"June 19, 2016",1,Make us ALL happy Ok VSCO I highly highly suggest bringing back the square grid. You went to haveing of the best rated apps to literally one of the worst because of this update. This indicates doing something wrong! So do good and get your users what they want because the users is what makes a successful app and your losing all of them. Read the hundreds of negative comments you have gotten. No one likes the update so Please make the next update one that gets all your users back. Thank you
4700,gusislegend,"February 19, 2014",5,"The Only Camera App You'll Need All of my images run through VSCO, and that's about it.

4704,Plissken,"November 16, 2014",3,"Couple issues Undoing an action takes far too many taps now. Please bring back the button. I love the history view but we need an easy access undo button. Also, when a filter is undone it takes you back to the beginning of the list. This is very annoying. It should stay where you were."

4706,Jacobwall273,"March 5, 2015",5,"Amazing app I bought this app the day it came out. I saw the trailer for the grid and was instantly inspired. Me and my friend signed up for the beta and began. Amazing grid experience, best functionality I have seen In a iPhone app. I have used this app every day of my life and will continue to! Great app."
4707,Hannah Arendsen,"June 14, 2015",3,"Great app! Needs a few bugs fixed I love this app so much!! It really is awesome for editing photos and such.

But, when posting to the journal it duplicates everything multiple times and gets very frustrating!!! Please fix."

Thanks guys!!
4710,JasonQuiz,"June 6, 2013",5,VSCO CAM we were waiting for The new VSCO CAM has been completely rethought from the ground up and it shows.  All the little things that bugged me in the first version are not only fixed but executed beautifully.
4711,courtneydenyse,"June 6, 2013",4,Photos save much lighter? I love VSCO (original and now the updated new one) but am having some problems after I save the photo. The photo appears MUCH lighter in my camera roll than it does in the app. This means I can't really use the photos since they end up looking completely different. Help!
4712,Danielle is thinKing,"June 7, 2013",5,"Excellent!! I'd love to see Flickr export support in the near future, but for now, the app more than delivers. It's got the same great feel from the old app, but a bit cleaner, and the INSANE deal on all the filters ($6!!) is like getting the best of VSCO Film on my phone. I can't applaud these folks enough."

4715,Alciphron,"August 4, 2013",5,"Great filters, clear editing options. If you know what you're doing, the editing options in this are far more powerful than in other more mainstream apps. Good to have sharpness, highlights, shadows, contrast, etc all available separately!"

But, the only problem is that whenever I add a filter to my picture, the whole image will go black. I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but it's just not working. I've reinstalled the app multiple times, but nothing is working :("
4717,krisxlife89,"March 6, 2017",3,Change the format Everything about this app is great except the new format. I found the layout where the photos are closer together to be more convenient. It resembles the Instagram format which makes it more easier to work with. I don't like how the photos are now spaced out on the grid. Please change it back to the old format.
4718,Zekedabeast,"June 9, 2017",4,Format I love this app and the way I can express myself on it but every time I post something to my wall the picture goes to the left side when I would like it to be on the right so if we could have a choice of which side it posts on that would be great

Nothing works!"
4720,conga91,"July 1, 2016",1,"NOT user friendly! I love the simplicity and beautiful minimalism of this app, the filters are wonderful and I love to use it for editing, but the app is EXTREMELY difficult to navigate! Every time I start to browse other pages and photos, I have to close the app out and reopen it just so I can go back to my own page. I find the symbols very difficult to recognize and use and just believe this app could be so much better if it was made to be easier for users."

4723,jbreeezy_,"July 31, 2016",1,"I dislike the new update Honestly, I enjoyed the functions of the old version. Easy & quick to work. I wish they didn't change the format of the photos we edit especially. I liked how it didn't show full size of the picture & showed it as a square. Most of the people who download VSCO Cam use it for Instagram. The old format was able to let us visualize how it would look when we post it on Instagram. I really regret updating it."
4724,Riyannaüíò,"August 9, 2016",3,"update is disappointing i used to like VSCO Cam because it would allow me to see how my photos would end up looking on instagram, but now with the update, it doesnt make the photos SQUARE anymore (without having to crop it into square form). which is disappointing. but i still give it a 3 star because i love editing with this app."
4725,tskk lil cabb,"November 21, 2016",3,"favorite, but... ok literally every FREE photo editing app has the option to flip photos horizontally/vertically EXCEPT for vsco... i paid for this app and that option is so essential to photo editing like why is that not already available???? honestly no other app satisfies my photo editing needs like this app does but i just need that option n that would be so great"

4751,AJDIFMEKFO47294,"June 16, 2013",3,"(Before update) Amazing! Before this update its amazing and the filters are beautiful! Although I was going to update it which is usually a good thing for apps but then I stumble upon the reviews and a notice a review telling me they has the same model as mine on the same iOs and it won't open, plus it crashes! Lets just say I'm my gonna update it now..."
4752,tony_217,"June 21, 2013",5,"By far, my favorite photo app. The filters & controls are stunning & simple to use. The results are beautiful. Also, if you have the money, I strongly recommend buying the Preset Collection while it's still on sale. You won't regret it."
4753,JenniferClement,"July 3, 2013",2,Lots of potential but too buggy this version. Paid for bundle but all 10 of the P filters are corrupted and won't load no matter how many times I've re-downloaded them. Also crashed/froze my phone when trying to save. I miss the fill and highlight editing tools from the toolbox from the previous version. Hope an update fixes these things soon. If so I'd be giving five stars.
4754,Hazey Daze,"July 15, 2013",5,"love this camera app! this has become my go-to camera app. I love the filters. I love the ability to adjust focus and exposure. I love it all! I do find that it gets hung up sometimes, though, so it would be nice if that could be addressed. Otherwise, it's a fave!!"
4755,Loli,"October 11, 2013",5,Best thing that has happened iphonographers I would recommend this app to pro's photographers. It has awesome filters awesome settings to achieve a pro and film like style and maintains real size  pictures. Please get rid of  Instagram and use this real application for photography.
4756,Mehone,"February 13, 2014",5,Latest update made it even better! What can I say that hasn't been said already? This app is what Apple wish they were. Best camera and editing app! I recommend everyone to download and buy all filters cuz it is worth every penny!
4757,Taylor Dae',"February 23, 2014",4,"The update Okay I love this app. The only issue I'm having is the ""low storage"" warning when I go to take a picture. Or upload one. I literally deleted three apps and five songs for that message to go away and it didn't. I have enough storage on my phone. Yet the message still pops up. Smh."
4758,Tremane28,"March 12, 2014",4,good until today. it's having some major issues by crashing and taking forever to load pictures into the library. and it even deleted all the pictures I had in there and they won't come back. üòî
4759,Wesly399999,"March 22, 2014",3,Bummed Loved this app until the last update. Now I can't sign in because it keeps saying my password is wrong so I click the forgot password function which says it sent me an email to reset my pass but I never get the email! Also it won't let me buy the in app purchases it just keeps saying it cannot connect to iTunes..
4760,Beth234326,"June 6, 2013",5,"Stunning app This was my favorite editing app even before the updates, and now I love it even more. The filters are beautiful, it's very sleek and easy to use, and makes my pictures look awesome. You really listened to your users and delivered. Thank you!"
4761,Jmcup,"June 6, 2013",5,You guys have truly outdone yourself with this app! I downloaded this app today when I  was prompted in the old application and I am extremely impressed! The new filters and UI are phenomenal. Keep up the great work! Can't wait for new filter packs to be released!
4762,AyeeItsAda,"June 10, 2016",2,"This is so disappointing... So I love he new design but I hate how all the pictures are separated and not like an Instagram type of order; I loved how but was before so I can see if my pictures I was editing matched my feed but now that's really hard.. This is a huge problem thats upsetting everyone who uses the app.. Please fix, I'm sorry I know you have worked hard on the way it looks but it's not gona work out."
4763,unfrenzied,"June 11, 2016",2,Was better before I'm sad to say i loved the original version but I am unhappy with the new update. I can't find my gallery (as I think of it) very easily and I have yet to figure out how to edit images that are already published. There's a big circle on the bottom of the screen that I spent too much time figuring out won't go away. Disappointed. At least I have the old version on my iPad for now.
4764,Fleedar,"October 21, 2016",2,"Terrible UI This app has some of the best filters and editing tools, but they're hiding behind a frustratingly obtuse and confusing interface. I use the app regularly and I still forget what sequence of bizarre, non-standard glyphs I have to press to move from selecting an image to choosing a filter to editing fine details, and I end up making a mistake and losing my picture or settings almost every time."
4765,smemm,"November 6, 2016",2,"Confusing I think if I had been using this app for a long time I would probably have been acclimated to the interface as it changed gradually and therefore had at least a clue how it works. As it is, as a new user, I have pretty much no idea how to use the app, so even though I've heard great things about it, I just don't. I feel like I need to go find some sort of instruction manual, which is, well, not ideal."
4766,sspader,"November 21, 2016",2,"Not worth the trouble Great in concept, but misses the mark by trying too much to be slick and cool.  Controls and navigation are too confusing.  ""Explore"" only seems to show what you've seen before or what is ""curated"" for you.  Very limited.  Supposed to be a photo editing app, so why is it so obscure to edit?  And, app regularly crashes. There are lots of better photo editing and portfolio apps out there.  Even FB beats this."
4767,‚Ä¢ Gabe ‚Ä¢,"January 29, 2017",2,"I'm Sad I loved this app for several reasons. An obvious one is the editing features. But one that I really loved was the social part of it. Many people at my school use VSCO and it was always interesting to see their creative side. But now all I see when I'm on VSCO is ""error loading content"" ""server error"" I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. And now I can't even log in because it doesn't know who I am. What's going on."
4768,BriannaU,"March 14, 2017",3,"Old version > new version This newest version is great and all, but when you hold down on an image is makes it too easy to publish a photo to your collection. I keep doing it on accident and it's really annoying. Also, when you hold down on a photo it zooms in too far and you can't see most of the image."
4769,WendyCarney,"August 30, 2017",5,"Thank you. Finally! Thank you for listening and working hard to release the very acclaimed video-editing feature we all had been waiting for. One request: Please release a ""Curves"" adjustment setting!"
4770,peteroppa,"January 11, 2015",5,"Seriously the best One of, if not the best, photo taking and editing app on the market. Navigation through the app will need some getting used to and I haven't had any problems with redownloading the filters i bought from VSCO yet."
4771,Cutiepatootieeeeee,"April 13, 2015",5,"love love love Great app for sharing artsy and creative pictures w/o the demand for getting lots of ""likes"" and ""followers"". Very peaceful and positive  society within the app. I haven't seen one negative post or even negative feedback due to no ""commenting"". Overall a great app for editing and sharing pictures."
4772,@gracelm13,"July 29, 2015",5,More than photo editing VSCO Cam allows for more than just photo editing. There is a whole social network for users to share their pictures. The actual filters the app provides are very good as well.
4773,Daniellababyyyyyyyyyy,"August 10, 2015",5,"Amazing! VSCO opened me up to something different. It helped me get inspired from other photographers work, realize that everyone has there own style and that photography is simply amazing!! Thank you vsco for all of your amazing presets, grids, journals and so much more."
4774,Taytaycarriecountrycutie,"September 20, 2015",1,"Bad update I love the app overall and I use it frequently but the most recent update will not allow me to scroll through my own grid like I could before. the new update also doesn't allow me to change my profile picture at all, even when I access the website from a computer. this needs to change because my current profile picture is super old and I don't want that to be up for much longer."
4775,Greeneyesnikki,"October 14, 2015",2,"Love this but... I've been using VSCO cam for three years and I love it. The only thing is that the grid no longer has three rows which is used to see how my pics would look on instagram before I posted to maintain a theme. I know most if us used this feature and I've seen many reviews asking for it back. VSCO Cam, LISTEN TO YOUR REVIEWS AND BRING IT BACK. I've waited and three updates have passed without fixing this. BRING IT BACK!"
4776,Wildcat jack,"October 18, 2015",3,"Help I loved VSCO before the update. I enjoyed seeing my photos all full size and in order as I scrolled down the screen. Now they are randomly sized and randomly placed through the screen as I scroll. If there could be a setting to switch between the old and the new, that would be awesome. Also the app icon is weird. PLEASE DONT MAKE THE FEED ALL RANDOM AND UNORDERLY. VSCO was classy and simple, and now it is stressful"
4777,ianschneider,"January 13, 2016",3,"Nice filters but custom icons are confusing and some options are buried in unlikely places Overall great for photo filters but custom icons don't make sense throughout the app. Basic UI / UX practices for icons would make the app a lot better. Also, sign out is buried in unlikely places. I understand making it slightly difficult for people to sign out of the app, but come on..."
4778,c4gray,"May 30, 2016",4,"Looks nice I like the app but needs more innovative ideas! No risk, no fun! "
4779,jonmadison,"June 10, 2016",1,"??? it's gone from usable to completely arcane. ""???"" Is pretty much my thinking when I try to use this."
4780,Kadrey,"June 26, 2013",5,"Yes I love it! I don't use the filters--which is due more to a personal aversion to filters in general, rather than anything to do with this app's filters--but I love the interface, which makes the stock iOS camera app seem clunky and old fashioned."
4781,What the hell?!?!?!?!,"June 30, 2013",2,Upset I loved this app but the new update is very annoying. I mean this is still a good app but the old one was a better in my opinion. The filters on the old one were much better and the layout was easier too. Please bring back the old app! Since some people like the new update and some don't maybe you could have both of the apps and people could choose? It's just a thought
4782,ddrtatsujin,"August 25, 2013",5,Great design The app is minimalist and keeps all of the icons simple and straightforward. It has easy quick editing tools and some useful filters. Great to fix under exposed images or ones that are too warm. Also good for that hipster Instagram look.
4783,kwellis,"March 25, 2014",5,"The very best photo editor I love this app and what it does for my photos. I never felt like an artist before VsCO. The only thing I wish it could do is apply changes to part of an image rather than the whole, but that is a small thing. I love this app!"
4784,Bima Nina,"April 10, 2014",5,"AMAZING I have had vsco cam for the longest time, and it this is one of the greatest filter/edit apps I have used. I don't hafto download 5 different apps just to do this pic because it's all in vsco cam and the grid gives me a lot of inspiration for pics I Truly love this app"
4785,lolmypandaisaunicorn,"May 12, 2014",5,"Amazing, highly recommended! i love to take photos and edit pictures, so I've been looking for a good editor. i found it! this app is amazing and truly perfect. i have so many presets and abilities, and to think that i can share my skills, too? brilliant!"
4786,Mikey Likes,"August 27, 2014",5,"Love this app..although I wish.. Love everything about the app, however I wish there was a way to know what presets I already have when in the preset store that way I'm not downloading the same ones over and over again."
4787,alirezabanijani,"September 25, 2014",5,"Now it's even more essential! This app has always been my favorite tool for editing photos, but this last update with the new shooting features makes your iPhone a real professional camera."
4788,FreneticSeaurchin,"November 12, 2014",5,"A must This app is mandatory. I'm even considering vsco for PC, despite having the usual editing suspects there. Consistent, easy, intuitive. It's so much better than any other photo app I've tried, and doesn't have more options/clutter than necessary."
4789,BrianTNYC,"December 21, 2014",4,Update made UX poor Thrilled this is finally on iPad! However the new update made the user experience pretty poor. And the controls are now somewhat unresponsive. You have to really press and slide the sliders to get them to work. Previous versions felt like they took less effort and were simply more fun.
4790,evie324,"June 7, 2013",3,"Having some problems Great changes and love the filters but... After saving photos to the camera-roll, the resulting pictures look different from when editing in-app and some of the editing stuff doesn't show up :( I love the effect the filters give my photos before I save them to my library though."
4791,expellingmooses,"June 9, 2013",5,"Superb filters! The filters are like no other! They are all unique, simple and makes the image better without looking ""too filtered"". Lastly, I wish that you'd make the bundle available for longer because I'm still saving for it! Kudos!"
4792,Guythattakespictures,"June 10, 2013",1,New crashing problem I have an iphone 5. I was editing a picture and it suddenly crashed. I can't get it it to stop crashing now. I've tried restarting my phone. I'm reluctant to delete and reinstall for fear of losing my photos. 
4793,Xyz girl;),"June 10, 2013",5,Glad I downloaded!‚úå This is definitely one of my favorite camera apps of all time!!! It's if you really don't want the tacky filters and I like the number scale for when you adjust things! It's pretty easy to figure out and worth it!!! A++ VSCOcam good job!
4794,Ames B,"June 11, 2013",4,"Love it! As much as I loved the original VSCO cam, this one is even better.  The filters are great and the fine tuning (for brightness, contrast, etc)  is just what the app needed.  I would like to get grain (not available for 4S) but overall it's a great update.  And it's definitely worth buying all the filters."
4795,Mandyandree,"June 14, 2013",4,"Amazing when its not crashing When the app functions normally, it's wonderful. Lately it has been crashing nonstop though. I haven't been able to use it or days. Looking forward to when it works again because its my favorite to edit photos."
4796,Shareshareshare!!!!!!!,"March 5, 2017",4,"Help! This app is amazing and I've used it for so long, I am a photographer and I always put these filters over my pictures, BUT!!! I need to upload pictures today and I can't because VSCO is crashing non stop! Will delete and will not keep this app if this keeps happening."
4797,LaineyBug10,"March 7, 2017",4,Love this app but I wish I could like other people's pictures! The filters are amazing and this is the only editing app I use and I just started using it to share my photos on VSCO but I wish I could like others' photos instead of putting them on my page!
4798,Sam4567w,"January 28, 2018",1,Really disappointed I‚Äôve been using this app for years and now suddenly I‚Äôve lost all of my filters that I purchased. I purchased the limited edition collection and when I try to restore it it says it‚Äôll restore for free but then a thing pops up trying to charge me 8.99 again for the package. Not cool I lost most of my filters now that I paid for and it‚Äôs trying to make me purchase them again. I‚Äôd really like this problem to be fixed.
4799,Manginta,"May 25, 2018",1,"Please fix it my app keeps crashing Ok so I'm still using and ipod touch 5th gen, the app works perfectly well when I take photos or edit the pictures. But with high resolution images, I just can't save them to my galleries because when I pressed the save button, the app crashes. This happen continuously no matter what I do (redownload, switch off my device, restart the app,...). Please have it fixed, I really can't survive without this app!"
4800,Cynthia bieber awesome forever,"June 10, 2016",5,Not happyüòü Cool update but the biggest flaw is the feed of VSCO cam no longer matching Instagram's profile feed. I loved how the old version on VSCO cam allowed me to view my edited pictures side by side before uploading it the the gram. P.s I take my Instagram feed very seriouslyüòé
4801,Check out The Cool Kids,"June 12, 2016",1,Dislike the Update I used to absolutely love vsco cam for editing photos and posting however the update is hardly user friendly at all. The button seems unnecessary and even quite confusing at times. The suggested accounts also seem to glitch when you try to scroll downwards which is a little bit frustrating as well as I'm not even sure how to search for people. That's all. Please change back asap.
4802,1D-Lover152,"June 26, 2016",1,"I loved the app before the new update:( I NEVER write reviews, so this is really saying something. First off, the new update is very disappointing and confusing. All of my posts are still there but I have to re-upload them, and when I try to do that, it fails. Another thing is that I like seeing my profile how others would see it and with this update I can't. PLEASE change the layout. I would have given this app 0 stars but I have to give it one."
4803,Moneymakerjewels,"July 15, 2016",4,"Collections This app won't let me get all of the collections I originally bought. I have a new phone and would like to transfer the collections, but I can't because i have to buy them again. The app altogether is really amazing, but I can't get the collections I need to edit my photos."
4804,Erika654,"July 28, 2016",5,"lovely app üå∏üå∏üå∏ People have nothing better to say about the update, but I do. Although I prefer the layout of the gallery before, this new one isn't too bad. It works just as good as it did before, so I have no complaints. Keep up the good work, loves."
4805,Brutallyhonestpersona,"August 3, 2016",1,"Completely demented Which self-indulgent designer created this unusable piece of crap?! It was working just fine. Now extra animations, tiny text, bad iconography, and overall horrendous UX flow. "
4806,Kandice kay,"August 19, 2016",2,was amazing - now not so much The app was so easy to use and not complicated.  Now the buttons have changed and are not normal buttons used for what they are used for (hopefully hat makes sense). Before it was amazing...now while it essentially does the same thing which is why t got 2 stars...  It's just not nearly as user friendly and ends up being more frustrating than it's worth.
4807,dustinwstout,"September 15, 2016",2,"Too. Much. Memory. Usage. This is the best photo editing app in the entire App Store. Apart from the overly opinionated UI, it's beautiful. I'm a designer myself and I understand having to balance opinion vs. usability, however the latest UI has gone too far in the wrong direction. The biggest problem with the app though is the unholy amount of memory the app consumes. It's by far the most memory/storage intensive app I have on my phone."
4808,cmdchavezz,"December 9, 2016",1,"horrible update please revert back to where we could just choose between 1-12 on a filter and nothing in between. or if not, please just give us an option setting to go back to that. also hate how whenever i open the app, the first page i see are not my photos. the UI isn't as swift or easy as it looks like it was supposed to be. also hate how it's all white. i could see my pictures better when it was all black."

4810,dorysparty,"March 20, 2015",5,"WOW. Honestly, I just started getting into instagram, Pinterest, and photo editing. This app is such a lifesaver. You can't edit pictures so beautifully for social media in their platforms, but vsco allows for this. I'm so happy to have found this app!"
4811,EmAhmazing,"May 10, 2015",2,CONFUSING- has potential Decided  to download this because I saw a lot of professionals were trying it out. I have been playing around with the app for about 3 days so far and it is so confusing to navigate and use. Kinda disappointed but I'm hoping with some updates it will become more user friendly because it seems like it has a lot of potential to be a 5 star app
4812,elizabethp0404,"June 8, 2015",4,"confusing at first but so beautiful this app can be kind of confusing to use at first, but once you figure it out you will have the most beautiful photos. it's like Instagram but much more focused on photography and less on likes and followers. really simple and I love all of the effects"

Please take it into consideration."
4820,Thisboyreggie83,"June 12, 2013",5,Best photo editing app ever. This is hands down the best photo editing app on the iPhone I've ever used. Such a great improvement over the old app. Plenty of beautiful presets and all the editing tools you need. I really look forward to future preset packs. Thanks VSCO!
4821,Emizzzz,"June 13, 2013",2,"Gives me a headache. Editing tools are fantastic, and I love the way that my photos turn out in the end. Too bad I can't export them without the application crashing; on the rare occasions when it actually does send to my email or save onto my camera roll, the photo is in its original state, with absolutely no editing done to it. This could easily be my favorite app if it actually functioned properly."
4822,Sgaske,"June 29, 2013",1,"Just stopped working... I bought the combo pack and I've been using this app a lot. I love the filters and options and simple editing functions. Until today it even replaced Snapseed. Suddenly it refuses to save any of my edited photos to my camera roll. My phone (iPhone 5, iOS 6.1.4) locks up and I have to hard reset the device. I have deleted and reinstalled the app twice with no fix. This is very disappointing VSCO.. Fix this and you can keep my money."
4823,DaveC006,"July 8, 2013",4,"My Go-To For everything it is trying to do, the app excels!  I do wish the presets would be housed per category like those in which they're sold, but even without them this is a brilliant processing app.  Does seem to be a bit soft as far as cameras go, though, so the sharpening feature is a must."
4824,userfrom670,"December 20, 2013",5,"Everything is great! but... everything is just fine & all, but I was wondering if you can make the camera quality better? or make the effects blend in when you take pictures & it's kinda dim? PLEASE?!"

I get a small image of a torn photo. I've never had this issue before and it's a little heartbreaking for a freelancer such as myself. I absolutely love the app, but without access to my photos, what's the point? "
4826,Asuperia,"May 12, 2014",5,"It's the greatest. It's an so amazing app that let me have bought all the filters in the shop happily. But I think it can have a better UI, it's a bit ugly now. And I wish I can have the functions, such as sharpen and two more, on the iPhone 4S."

4831,Smosh That,"June 21, 2016",1,"Horrible new design This app went from a pleasant way to edit your photos, to a crazy slew of incomprehensible icons. I use VSCO the way many people do: edit photos to upload to Instagram and Twitter. But with every update, the VCSO designers shove the in app sharing network a little more in your face. I don't care about the sharing network (or whatever they call it) and I probably never will as long as they keep making the editing experience worse."

The devs have done such wonderful work in the past and now I feel you guys are compensating for something. Please keep the viewfinder and library views separate. I'm so bothered by it that I actually took the time to write a review and I hate writing negative reviews."

It often crashes when I try to save a photo to my camera roll, and it often takes six to even tries to save successfully after starting it up each time. Often, I have to restart my iPad entirely. This app is very cool, and could be very useful, but improvements need to be made."
4841,Planteater,"May 31, 2015",3,"Beautiful, but Problematic The app is stunning and beautifully set up. I love the clean edits, and the ability to alter contrast, lighting, sharpness, etc. But it constantly crashes every time I try to save a picture. Even with normal iPhone shots! This needs to be fixed. Nothing is more frustrating than having a perfect picture stuck in a useless app."
4842,Hunterlynnn,"June 7, 2015",3,Beautiful but constantly CRASHING! I use this app constantly but for some reason the last week or so it keeps crashing. I haven't been able to edit photos like I normally would and am becoming very frustrated. I will update my review if/when this is fixed. Until then I am seeking out another photo editing app.
4843,Arflyyyy,"August 20, 2015",5,"Amazingly good This is one of the best free app out there, not that it's just plain simple and easy to use but also has some of the best filters that you can adjust. If you are a tumblr type picture person, this is your app! Awesome"

I understand every new update release might have bugs so I guess. Hopefully it's fixed fast though. I'd hate to have to switch to a new photo editor."
4846,Aylin_8613,"October 19, 2015",4,"Great Love the app. My only suggestion would be to add a feature where you can create your own filter and save it. It's a pain to have to figure out what you did to create a certain effect on a photo. If you could add that feature, I would definitely give this app 5 stars."
4847,gogo1195095,"June 9, 2016",2,BEAUTIFUL (not) The design is insanely gorgeous and it is so intuitive (if you can't figure out how to use this app it's your fault) this app will revolutionize layouts for apps and I think this app is so amazing that it is beautiful and it fits so much content into such an easy to access space!

4849,gabyaponte,"June 19, 2016",1,"UNDO THE UPDATE VSCO used to be one of my favorite apps for photography when I could upload them to my library, edit them, & view them in the way I could view posts on an Instagram page. When I could view them like this, it made the editing process easier and it also helped me lay out my Instagram page. PLEASE CHANGE VSCO BACK. It used to be a 5 star app & now it's a 1 1/2 star app because of this update. Clearly the people are upset. Please just listen to us."

Before, there was a warning when the space on my phone was low and there was a danger of uploading it safely. Now, it prevents me from uploading at all because of this. No matter how much room I make for this ONE app, it does not let me import. I am infuriated at VSCO for allowing this to happen to a paying customer who relies on VSCOcam for great editing.

4866,WillMilne,"February 15, 2017",5,More than just photo editing! VSCO has grown into a must-have for any self-respecting photographer. I teach a photography class and have students that prefer to edit on their phones in VSCO rather than on their laptops. Great community and editing capabilities.

4872,Glitterluvvvv,"June 12, 2016",1,I hate the update. if I had just bought the app after the update came out I would have deleted it. the older one was so much easier to navigate and the new one is so ugly! PUT THE PICTURES BACK INTO FREAKING SQUARES IN ROWS OF THREE. or at least make an option to change it. the ONLY good thing about this update is that you can copy and paste filters. the only reason I'm not deleting is Im hoping for an update that puts my pictures back into squares when I look at them.
4873,Bio squat,"June 17, 2016",1,"UPDATE In all honesty... The update makes me NOT want to use this app. I used to love this app but now my photos look jumbled and unorganized. Also the whole ""collective photos"" is an annoying little album I cannot get rid of and I hate seeing it. It is no longer user friendly. Instead you've made it much harder to understand how to work it. PLUS YOUVE DELETED MULTIPLE PHOTOS THAT I KEPT IN THE EDITING PORTION JUST SO I COULD SAVE LATER AND NOW I NO LONGER HAVE THEM SO THANKS FOR THAT. Biiiiig thumbs down. Go back to what you used to be."

4875,am.puma,"June 19, 2016",1,UI setback The updated user interface is a major step back in usability. VSCO went so minimal and obscure that you can't even use the app. It takes 3x longer to use because I can't understand anything or find a editing feature. User experience has continued to go downhill update after update for well over a year now.
4876,cookayemonster,"June 25, 2016",1,"The worst update possible Wow. All the things I loved about this app are gone. You have managed to make everything much more complicated than necessary. My main gripe is the ""Studio"" view. I used VSCO to see how my feed looked to my followers. Now, the images have too much space between them. You can't easily tell which items were synced and which ones aren't. The circles are confusing. The old version wasn't broken. Please bring it back."

When I open the app all I see is a circle. How do I get to my photos, library, or tools? It took me several minutes to figure this out, and I'm still confused as to how I got there. This is not the fault of your users. This is the fault of your design. The other one-star reviews are evidence of this. Hire a UX/UI Designer. Fix your horrendous app."

REALLY hope they fix it soon bc I enjoyed it before..."

But I've been having trouble accessing my camera roll and whenever I try to save a photo to it, the app says successful but it didn't save it. It always says user denied access and I don't know how to reverse it. Tried reinstalling it but did not help. If these issues are fixed I would give a higher rating."

Please fix this.

I also don't like the feature where you switch areas of the app because it was so easy before but not anymore, so overall I am not happy with the update."
4931,Jessie_catherinee,"June 15, 2016",1,the new update is horrible I downloaded vsco for the whole purpose of seeing my Instagram feed before actually posting pictures. the new update took that completely away and my photos look nothing like my actual Instagram page.

I am extremely disappointed that I cannot use this app anymore for the purpose I've been using it for... please change it back!!"

I really do not like the new layout they have at all bc it doesn't make the collection look as organized.

I wish I can undo the update."

I never write reviews, but I felt compelled to for this app."
4952,_celliott,"June 27, 2013",5,Best mobile editing app PERIOD. It has everything needed to produce high quality visually appealing mobile photography. The sharpening tool alone is worth its weight in gold. The additional filter pack is well worth the price. It's the only app I'll use.

4955,Sanchez2175,"March 10, 2014",2,"Very complicated In trying to look sparse and modern, they've forgone function for form. There are no clear indicators of what any button does except the one with a camera on it. Then there's a half-witted attempt at a social component that fails miserably. Overall it's a confusing experience that isn't worth the trouble. There are programs that do the same and are far less complicated to use."

4966,oddball85,"September 29, 2016",1,"A great app ruined I've been using VSCO for over a year now, but I took a break from it for a few months. Upon returning a discovered an app that was made impossibly hard to use through really poor interface design. It's not straightforward or easy to use at all to the point where I can't use it to maintain my old journal posts or create new ones effectively. It filled a void in the market in my opinion but is now irrelevant due to poor design."
4967,Gabby rigg,"October 11, 2016",3,"Why did I update?!? SOS. So sad I updated this app to the most recent version. The interface looks like it's Windows 95, and instead of getting easier to use, I think some of the controls became super obscure. I LOVE this app, the presets and creative controls, but I have absolutely no idea what they were thinking with this newest update. So disappointing."
4968,Maddiemadi,"October 30, 2016",4,Love it but‚Ä¶ I love this app so much! But one thing it needs is a way to transport the live motion videos so that u can edit them.

4971,azoolkool,"December 18, 2013",2,"Lacking. I do love the speed and simplistic look, and I am also fond of selection the filters it has to offer... But. Besides good filters, the photo editing tools are very lacking. Exposure doesn't work right, and you can't even view the original image when applying filters. The only reason you should get this app is for a small collection of good processed-look filters."
4972,Sithithavorn,"January 3, 2014",5,Mobile Photography at a nother level... VSCOcam truly brings out the potential in all photos. It is also user-friendly & simple to use for those editors or non-editors alike. My favorite photo editing app hands down.

Unfortunately, the update is terrible. The layout is odd. I'd rather have the pictures in squares in your library instead of full sized and spread out like how it is now. I sometimes used that to determine how my instagram feed would look, and now it just throws everything off. Please change it backüò©"
4977,Mike Arce,"June 10, 2016",1,Why did I update? HORRIBLE redesign. I loved VSCOcam and have been using it for a good while now. Nonetheless this new redesign in terrible. There's no synched/unsynched visual reference. That big circle while browsing the library is bothersome and not intuitive at all. I don't understand why that profile box has to be at the top of the library and it just terribly boring. Library display sizes are no longer an option. I just wish things went back to normal. Bad update.
4978,Amiraaüíï,"June 21, 2016",1,"No. Okay, so I want to start off by saying I never review apps. But this app... Oooh this app needed to be reviewed because maybe if enough people say it sucked they'll change it back. I use to love vsco cam because it was like a pre-instagram. I got to see my instagram feed without posting it and being disappointed. Now I'm disappointed before I even put the theme on instagram! Please please pleaseeeee change it back to the VSCO cam that we all knew and loved. And ASAP."
4979,hayhayhsh,"June 21, 2016",1,"Horrible Update I miss the old vsco where you were able to swipe left and right through the feed. It's a pain to keep opening and closing each individual photo. Also, you can't even swipe through your own profile feed, the only way to view your caption is to edit it. Overall this app would be so much better if you were still able to swipe left and right through feeds."

5005,Nat the Editor,"September 29, 2015",3,"LAYOUT!! I love this app, but I hate the update where they made it so you can't change the layout! I hate the look of the side by side pictures. It doesn't have the same individual feel of the photos, now it feels like instagram. I'm sad I can't change the layout so VSCO Cam Makers, please give us back the layout option!!!!"
5006,Bird Sh!+,"October 15, 2015",3,"Still no zoom? I love everything about VSCO (but due to the reviews of the latest update, I've decided to skip it üòâ). My question is with all of these updates there's no zoom? Like isn't zoom one of the most fundamental functions of a camera? "
5007,marls2001,"December 5, 2015",3,"good app but so takes so much storage I personally love taking and editing pictures even though I am a complete amateur, but I like uploading them to my vsco account and posting them. However, this app takes up so much storage!! can there b a way to change it so there's less storage taken up on my phone?"
5008,BagelAndLox,"December 16, 2015",3,No zoom This is a great app but you CANNOT zoom when taking a picture. This is a major problem and complaints about this feature (including from previous versions) go unaddressed. I use Camera+ more often now because of their richer feature set including zoom
5009,Princessteacup,"June 3, 2016",3,Can you make a change? My iPhone 6 takes lousy pictures in lower light. 'Lousy' is kind. Your app allows me to get much better pictures in low light. Thanks for that. BUT could you put the picture-taking button somewhere else? Making it bigger and more obvious? I have to hunt for it every time.
5010,Sean McCarthy,"June 12, 2013",5,Great photo manipulation The VSCO app has been my number one photo app for the last 2 years. This new app has taken it to the next level. For iPhone pictures this app helps makes beautiful pictures.
5011,Briiisuschrist,"June 24, 2013",5,Iphone4 After the most recent update my vsco app works perfectly! And the support team even checked in to make sure everything was going well with it. By far my favorite.
5012,Mll4eveR.,"October 7, 2013",4,Great app with minor issue The app itself is great. However not matter how many times I tried to purchase the IAP filters it just didn't work out. It just kept telling me that the purchase I made could not be completed. Please fix this. Otherwise an awesome app.
5013,vctc4636,"January 24, 2014",5,"I loovvveeeee it I'm really happy with this app, it's so easy to use and it makes my photos look amazing. I recommend it to anyone who wants to save the hassle of downloading photos into your computer and making simple edits."

5015,NAM7791,"May 9, 2014",5,Best photo editing app out there! I use VSCO photo editor for all of my photos because the filters are simply beautiful and add such a high quality to my photos! I would definitely recommend this app.

5017,Marct04,"July 18, 2014",4,"Almost perfect This app is perfect. One little thing however is missing. And that is the camera support of the sony qx series. The possibilities to take pictures with the sony qx100 in combination with the amazing filters and handling of this app, would make photography with a smartphone even better."
5018,ellyanor,"October 19, 2014",3,"Fix this issue please When I go to edit my pictures, the filters pop up rainbow colors and all filters make the picture black & white. This is the 3rd time I've had this issue. I love this app to pieces, but this is starting to get annoying. I updated the app, and this was a result of the update."
5019,rachaelannhan,"November 1, 2014",5,"Best Photo Editing App on the Market VSCO is by far the best photo editing app available for iPhone. It's easy to use and your pictures will turn out gorgeous. I've used VSCO for a long time, and I could be happier with it. It's a definite must-have."
5020,cbarronjr,"June 8, 2013",5,So far so good! Great presets. This app redesign has motivated me to shoot more with my iPhone. I think it's the best iOS photography/editing app. Very slick interface and easy to learn. Looking forward to shoot more with this app and the future features. (Including VSCO Grid.)
5021,ErinElizabethB,"June 11, 2013",1,"FIX IT When I downloaded the app it didn't come with any filters or tools. I purchased the pack of all the filters, and it worked, but some of the filters, I guess the ones that were supposed to come with the app in the first place, weren't there. The only thing the update fixed was the tool issue. Also, whenever I edit a photo and pick a filter, the picture turns black. Please fix everything!"
5022,KtotheizzH,"December 21, 2016",3,"iPad app is mostly useless to me =[ I love this app on my iPhone, and when I bought an iPad Pro I was excited to see it worked on iPad too. Except... if there are any RAW photos in my camera roll, the app freezes when I go to the import screen. It won't show any of my photos, RAW or not, and eventually crashes. Make RAW available on iPad! PLEASE!"
5023,Iamcartermoore,"February 20, 2017",5,"Love this app! I've always loved VSCO and as someone who has shot a lot of film in my life, the new Film X presets that are part of the VSCO X subscription are so good and accurate that I've transitioned a lot of my workflow to be mobile first. Keep up the awesome work!"
5024,BonkerFly,"April 2, 2017",2,"Constantly crashing I can barely use it lately. The iPhone 6 is not exactly new, but should be able to handle an app like this. Keeps crashing while editing photos and when exporting a series of 4 or more pictures. Besides, overheats the phone and drain battery at a crazy pace. Too bad experience for someone who spent so much on IAPs as support for the developers.."
5025,dvermaak01,"April 26, 2017",4,Pretty good Would like to see some additional features added though. 
5026,R_jaski,"May 14, 2017",2,"Always having problems This app has never ran properly. There are always loading problems, posting glitches and more issues with this app. The developers put out updates that seemingly fix nothing. Also extremely slow to refresh - especially when not on wifi."
5027,PlainJaneSC82,"June 20, 2017",3,"Good but... I absolutely love VSCO, but when I updated it, all of my presets were reset back to default. Now all of the presets are available and I have to continuously scroll to find my favorite presets. This has happened twice and it's a hassle to go through all of the presets to set my favorites only for them to be erased."
5028,dulce barrera,"July 13, 2017",3,Really like VSCO but Today I opened the app to edit a photo and noticed that at least 10 of my preset are goneüòü. I bought the $18 subscription a few days after it came out so not sure what happened. I also use the app on my iPad mini and same presets are missing as in my phone. Pls fix this.
5029,KermiKroger,"August 2, 2017",5,"Wow! Just wow. You can even edit videos! I've loved this app even when some hated it most at a time, because the quality of the films is amazing, but now I get to apply my favourite films to video too!!! This is on top!"
5030,Cal9978,"November 5, 2015",2,"Good filters. Terrible UI. The latest update from VSCO is terrible. I still like the filters, but the ""grid"" display is totally random. It looks broken -- did someone really design that photo grid display on purpose? The UI has always been confusing. But now it's worse. The buttons really don't make sense. And why is there a ""grid"" and a ""journal"" and a ""collection""??  Doesn't make any sense."
5031,R o s e <3 animals,"June 10, 2016",4,I don't like the update I loves vsco can soooo much. It let me see how my Photos would look like on Instagram and they had such great filters. But the update has changed how everything looks now My photos that I edited are all different sizes and I hate the update
5032,knatehuff,"June 11, 2016",1,"Don't love the update... I love VSCO cam, I've been using it for as long as I can remember, but this app update is pretty rough. The gesture control is confusing and not intuitive, and none of the icons are confusing (of course the app has always had this problem). My biggest complaint is that the images are not emphasized well, they are small with large borders around them. This is a camera/social image sharing app, make the images king."
5033,Nessakdisnsjsks,"June 12, 2016",1,"Crashes and Clutter The app crashes every time I try to save a high quality photo back to my camera roll. If I want to save it, I have to select a lower quality, not the original quality. Alongside this, the new layout where the images take the shape of the photos (horizontal and vertical rectangles) and not squares is a clutter. The number of people who used the square layout to plan their Instagram feeds are majorly disappointed."
5034,LT-1472-5105,"June 19, 2016",1,"Used to love it..... I was a huge fan of vsco. Don't get me wrong, the filters and editing is still great but please bring back the grid! It was so nice to see my feed. I will no longer buy anything else from this app is it stays like this. I've probably spent about $10ish since I've had it. Which I never do on an app. Please listen to all these complaints and change it back! Or at least bring back some of the old features."
5035,XjsllapdocujebrbjdoxoDanny,"July 1, 2016",1,"Terrible update The update it's self isn't bad. The functionality, however, is. The clean layout and easy to use interface is what drew many users to the app in the past. Its's Instagram-like layout was beneficial to many when planning out their Instagram posts. That function is no longer available and ruins my feed. Please give us the old version back. Classic case of fixing something that wasn't broken."
5036,ultrviolent,"August 1, 2016",2,"I miss the old layout plz go back to it :/ So the only reason why I got this app is bcz youtubers recommended it, like for example if u wanted to create a theme on ig and see how it would look on ur actual ig page u could just create it on here first and see how it looks like and now with the actual full size photos instead of squares it looks off. If u could back to it that'd be gladly appreciated !! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5037,#1stworldproblems,"August 2, 2016",2,HATE NEW UPDATE I used to love Vsco but the new update has made it not as much fun. When you click on a photo you can no longer scroll left or right but you have to exit out of the photo and click another one which I do not like at all. I hope they bring Vsco back to what it used to be also I do not know how to use it and the new update made it so complicated to use
5038,ReallyVSCO,"August 6, 2016",1,"I'm so disappointed. This is the worst update VSCO has ever had. If I could rate it 0 stars, I would. I hate the new layout. Before, I could actually see what it would look like before I posted, but now, it's a complete mess. I wish I would've looked at the other reviews before updating it. If VSCO could look at its reviews and see that 99% of its users hate it, they would change it back. I need to look for another editing app now."
5039,xoxo.malaysiaa,"August 21, 2016",3,"Just an opinion I really like this app, i really do. But one thing i dont like about it is that we have to pay just to use some type of filter and i think its just stupid, but i think that the company or whatever of this app should add in some new filters that we would have to pay for. Thank you"
5040,Boxed Snack,"June 19, 2013",5,Diggin' The Update Not experiencing the crashing others are talking about. Works flawlessly on my phone. The updates are very well done. It now makes editing much more precise. Best photo editing app in my opinion.

I have over 300+ pictures and when I open my gallery on the app only 12 pictures show up, I don't know what to do. Only a few pictures from my gallery on my iPod show up on the app."
5043,SteveGossett,"February 28, 2014",4,"Very nice but . . . Installs on my 3GS and is functional but after taking a picture the wheel at lower right just spins like its processing the image.

5044,whitepufflife,"December 12, 2014",5,"VSCO read this Awesome photo editing app! I would like you guys in the next update to add "" blur "" the whole picture. Not the way Instagram has it, to select portion, but the whole picture to be able to blur it."

I have the iPhone 4S. Please fix this."

Read reviews before downloading, because I've heard so many good things about VSCO Cam, but saw many that warned of the app crashing and being rendered useless. I decided to download and try it out anyways, and all seemed well for one day, until, in the middle of editing a photo, the app just crashed. Now, every time I go to use the app, it automatically crashes and nothing works. Uninstalling this piece of crap app."

I'm probably switching to other apps, such like ""1967""."

I have to press random buttons and hope it's the one I'm looking for. Make it easier to navigate.

I really liked having the main gallery page (where I upload and edit my photos) in squares - that way, you could see what it would look like in your Instagram feed.

5091,Cpostel86,"June 9, 2013",4,Shuts down As far as I could tell the app was great I was only able to edit two photos though.  Whenever I open the app now it shuts down right as I open it please fix that problem so I can continue using this fabulous app.
5092,Ko0laid!((:,"June 21, 2013",1,"New update The filters on the new update are alot better than the old but it takes too long for them to load. Also the layout on the old update is better i have both apps right now. And thinking about deleting this one. The other ones easier to use, faster,Takes up less memory,the only difference is the layout and filters. But i love the other layout . So bye bye mew update."
5093,Torrentsoul,"August 15, 2013",5,Very clean interface amazing filters I am a photo junkie and I absolutely love the variety of filters offered by this app. It allows my creativity to be taken to a new level with ease. Well worth the $5.99 for the bundle. Great job!

When the favorite and repost buttons were on the bottoms of pictures it was no problemo but now when I stalk people's vsco account I accidentally favorite and repost their posts from like 2015!!!! They get NOTIFICATIONS that I did that!!! Why would you do that to me vsco

Instead of the effects going up to twelve and having decimals, it goes all the way up to 100. Very disappointed. I used this app to edit pictures for instagram, tumblr etc... now I can't get the same custom filters I used to use. Very frustrated. Please change it back!!"
5100,Onorthrop,"July 7, 2016",1,Please go back The update is terrible. It is so difficult to use. It takes so long to figure out which way to drag the ball. I wish you would revert it to the way it was before. I can't even see what my friends are posting anymore and I preferred the white color of my own page. I wish it were easier to see my own page. I honestly wish I could delete this app and redownload the old version.
5101,Johnsephr,"July 14, 2016",5,"Next Instagram Love this app. There are no likes, comments, shares. Just people sharing their passion for photography. The filters are unreal, and you can buy expansion packets with more of them if you aren't satisfied with the free ones. 5 stars."
5102,Puppylover166,"July 19, 2016",1,"Very bad I liked the old vsco way better. The latest update is extremely hard to use and to understand.  I'm considering deleting the app, even though I've had it for quite a long time now, because it's gotten to a point that I can't use it since I don't comprehend how to function the app.  People like easy and simple!! I don't usually write reviews-especially not negative ones, but it used to be a great app..."
5103,FloatingintheClouds,"July 28, 2016",4,The update.. I love this app but I hate what the update did to the main display of pictures. Each one is different sizes instead of them being all square. It looks weird having each picture a different size.
5104,EllaJ0lie,"August 9, 2016",3,"Hard to Use VSCO is one of my most used apps. The new update is hard to use.

Please go back to the old VSCO."

5117,Melbottjer,"June 5, 2016",1,"new update is as awful as instagram's look I don't do reviews but the newest update is awful. the spacing between the photos was a horrible idea, and it's even more confusing to use than it was before. the circle key on the bottom is obnoxious. I used to use this app to edit my photos and figure out what order to place them in that looked best but now I can't. I spent too much money on this app for it to go to crap"
5118,Pham Duy Nguyen,"June 10, 2016",2,"Anri-user-friendly new interface Requiring the user to touch a specific button to swipe is very unintuitive and not at all how iOS works. In fact, I can't recall another iOS app that does navigation UI like this. I'm fine with the rest, but please get rid of the new ""button"" and let us swipe from Private to Public from anywhere in the screen (lazy swiping)."

5120,marcusstabenow,"June 6, 2013",5,Love it! Vsco Cam has really done it this time! I love all the new filters and things I can do to edit my photos. So many new features and I like how I can connect with others by viewing people's work. Nice job Vsco crew!
5121,para fictional,"June 7, 2013",5,Fun to play around with! Was a bit confusing at first but figuring out the different features was fun! I absolutely love that you can turn the flash on and keep it on so that the camera can actually focus.
5122,leehanso,"June 7, 2013",5,iPhone 5 update Let's get this fixed. Been using new version just fine and it was amazing. Just updated app and now it won't even open. Love it too much not to give 5 stars... for now.
5123,Bvchvz,"June 8, 2013",4,"Shutter button So far, the only thing I that bothers me is the inability to take a picture using the ""+"" volume button like you can in the apple camera. I've grown used to doing that and find it more comfortable so I wish it was possible in the vsco app."
5124,river________,"June 11, 2013",5,Life Changing I have been using vscocam for about a year and instantly fell in love with it. This new app surpassed all expectations and raised the bar in iPhone photography. It's what the pro's use. Reading peoples negative reviews opens my eyes to how much ignorant people love to hate.
5125,Amybethunephoto,"June 14, 2013",3,"Loved it...wish I could still use it This was a really great app. I loved being able to edit my iPhone images to be more in keeping with images I take with my ""big girl camera"".

5126,aaron r.,"July 2, 2013",5,My go-to camera app VSCO has easily made my favorite iPhone photo editing app. The new features they added to the camera let you easily adjust focus and exposure to get the perfect shot. Wonderful app!
5127,Lililian,"July 18, 2013",4,"Great I just found out about this app and I love it. The UI and filters are stunning. Lovely variety. I also love how you can fine tune each filter. However, I really wish it could save higher resolution images, as high as the original resolution will be perfect."
5128,leaca_travels,"August 8, 2013",3,Torn I love the filters and the rotate feature is a great element to this app.  BUT when I attempt to export the edited photo everything freezes and I have to restart my phone. It would do this off and on and now it does it more often.  I have been hopeful that an update would be out soon but have not seen one.
5129,rabbitfighter,"September 12, 2013",2,"Bring back grain! The latest upgrade seems to have neutered the grain functionality of the other VSCO cam app (legacy). This may be a total coincidence, but now when you edit in the new VSCO and throw it over to the old app to add grain it now just boosts the brightness with no grain effect whatsoever. Is this a ploy to make users buy the overly expensive desktop app? Am I insane? Are these things mutually exclusive?"
5130,User500000000001,"July 2, 2016",1,"missing the old vsco ever since the update that was supposedly meant to make the app more user-friendly this app has really gone down hill. you cannot click to see the full information on your own photos anymore, you cannot (unless I'm just not seeing it) create a journal, and it's simply harder to navigate. wishing vsco would listen to users and bring back the old, better version."
5131,Manny8765,"July 26, 2016",2,"Great editing tools - Horrible UI I have been a fan of vsco since the very beginning. It's the best photo editing app. The filters and editing tools are great. Having said that, the UI keeps getting worse and worse with each iteration. I don't know where anything is anymore. It's incredibly frustrating trying to navigate this app. Please make it more intuitive."
5132,appleuser1155779,"August 3, 2016",1,"Why? The filters are beautiful as always but the new interface is just baffling. It's so confusing and there's nothing about it that's intuitive. Even after using it repeatedly I still can't remember which odd button I have to press to go where, and the follow and social features are even more alienated than ever. Terrible design. It's not even aesthetically pleasing or minimalistic as I sense they were attempting. It's clunky and muddled."
5133,rodigorj,"August 25, 2016",1,"Frustrating new version - total fail I've been using VSCo for years - probably since the very fist version. I've always found the app enjoyable to navigate - visually simple, with an intuitive usability. The new version, however, is a fail. It's confusing to navigate through and visually pretentious. The VSCO design team should be ashamed for having delivered such a mess. Please, get back the old team and the old version of this app."
5134,CandyClay,"August 29, 2016",1,"VSCO update has ruined this app Since the update, this app hasn't been the same from the terrible layout and bugs, such as being able to seamlessly import a photo to edit which constantly closes the feature every time I hit the button.  Hopefully their team takes this feedback into consideration to make changes that make it better and not worst as they've done."
5135,@ConPLUR,"December 12, 2016",1,"Just when I thought they couldn't make it any worse..... I'm always astonished at VSCO's sheer determination to make their app worse and worse with every update. Just when the app was more confusing than ever before, they found a way to make it even more confusing and non-user friendly. Their made-up icons have been a disaster, why can't they just use normal words and icons to navigate the app?! Unbelievable."
5136,CareyyyyyyyR,"December 25, 2016",4,"Good app I love vsco cam. It lets me edit amazing photos to make them look 10x better. But 2 thing I would love if vsco would use less storage space and change the design of the app, it's getting confusing and I preferred the old way better."
5137,Fullphotos,"June 24, 2017",1,"Just confused I edit a lot and used to use VSCO a ton. The UI has gotten so freaking confusing. It's pretty bad. I hate that I can't organize my tools and filters anymore. Most of the time I see this app and think, ""what were they thinking?"" For a company that should know design, this app it terribly ugly and bad. Super disappointed."
5138,TheBiggestandTheBest,"September 5, 2017",3,Update Not So Great The new profile layout is cramped and ugly.  Too similar to Instagram or Tumblr.  The single-photo view on the previous version kept feeds neat and clean.  This new layout meshes it all together in assorted rectangles/squares and the use of different filters is really noticeable/not visually appealing when the photos are arranged this way.

5144,aesthetic feed enthusiast,"June 14, 2016",1,"disappointing ): i use vsco to plan out my feed on instagram & to edit the pictures. if you use vsco for the sam reason or just for aesthetic purposes, do not - and i mean do NOT update it. i don't like how the photos are no longer together on a square grid as instagram pictures are. i liked seeing the way the colors of the photos worked together. i used vsco for it's simplicity, and i don't like how that has changed."
5145,HanMac927,"June 16, 2016",1,Hate it I have always loved using VSCO cam but I hate the update. I enjoy the new editing tools but the layout is annoying. I liked VSCO cam before because the pictures turned into squares. Similar to Instagram. I could see how my photos would look on Instagram before I posted. They images are also too small. I understand the fact that they want to modernize the app but I don't like the way they did it.
5146,ilovecolleen,"June 19, 2016",1,"terrible I absolutely hate the new update. I loved VSCO before the update. Now, it's so hard to use, every time I go on, I never remember how to switch from my profile to go to my feed. And the black background was a horrible switch. The white background was so much prettier. I loved the aesthetic of VSCO before the update and it was so so so much easier to use!! Please just go back to how the app was before this update!!!! It'd be amazing again."

I can't get back to my collection after being on my public profile or a friends page without completely closing the app and going back in. Also search does not work and you can only view suggested friends to find new people to follow. Interface has become completely incomprehensible and I'm ridiculously disappointed.

I Would not recommend this app, unless a new updated version is released with a more user friendly interface."

5177,Sir_Salem,"June 21, 2017",1,"Bring back syncing My prior review sang praises for this app, but that was years ago. I essentially stopped using this app with any sort of regularity once the developers eliminated the ability to sync photos across devices. This was my go to mobile photo editing tool prior to removing syncing."
5178,willPOW_r,"June 22, 2017",1,"5 star down to 1 Arghhh üò≠ I use VSCO more than any other app on my phone and have used it to build the aesthetic that my entire personal and business Instagram accounts have been built around. Now I can't edit anything to post on IG because it won't let me without a SUBSCRIPTION even though I've paid $$ for every single filter up to this point. I hope there's a fix, and FAST. I have work to do!"
5179,chlo04,"July 2, 2017",5,"Favorite editing app! Vsco is such a professional editing app and has tons of filters and effects to edit ur photos! I definitely recommend this app. Overall, I love VSCO and it's one my favorite apps!"
5180,Gj99‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢,"June 9, 2016",2,Not loving the new update Was not a fan when I put the update in. I miss the white bright look. Also in my photo library I dislike how tiny the photos are. The camera is also hard to find! Very disappointed in this update. I hope that it is greatly improved. I will be using the app less until changes happen.
5181,Hwright324,"June 9, 2016",4,New profile design is odd I understand that apps have to change sometime and the new design is alright for the most part but i don't like the black background when looking at my library or profile.
5182,jackhawley,"June 11, 2016",5,"I love the update I never used to use the app because it was impossible to understand. Now it's actually pretty simple. I know this update is getting a lot of bad press but I love it. Nice, snappy animations as well. Great job vsco team."
5183,mragonese,"June 11, 2016",1,"They're right, it's not intuitive at all. So I haven't used the app forever and am not overly familiar with using it, so when I  just went to use it, it just wasn't clear how to use it, so I closed it and moved on.  It was after that when I read all the negative reviews I realized OK, I'm not the only one. I mean, I'm no dummy, I'm sure if I kept messing with it for a while or studied some list of instructions I could figure it out but that's stupid."
5184,kejNC,"June 11, 2016",1,"Can't even use after new update! I love VSCO and use it to edit all my photos of drawings before uploading to instagram. This new update is awful! I can't even get past their new Welcome screens. It gets stuck on a page saying ""This is your personal space"" and will not let me advance to the next screen. I've tried deleting and reinstalling several times with no luck. Really disappointed to say it, but... bye-bye VSCO."
5185,Caseymacypacy,"June 11, 2016",1,"horrible update I never write reviews but this update was so disappointing that I had to provide poor feedback. Change the update to the older layout. It was much easiest to understand. The entire app is now revolved around Vsco grid and I do not even use that, so now the app seems almost pointless to me. I loved the simplicity of the old layout. Please bring it back or you may lose a long term customer."
5186,beeforchicken?,"June 12, 2016",5,gorgeous. i thought it couldn't get better but the folks at VSCO really did an incredible job with the intuitive commands. took a bit of time to get used to it - but well worth the effort!
5187,joannaolg56,"June 16, 2016",3,"Good but a few changes needed I actually like the new update. The only problem I have is that it's missing the grid. The grid was such a key part to editing for Instagram, not only that but it was easier to view your images. I like the update, just bring the grid back!"
5188,Instagram user R.S.,"June 18, 2016",1,"AWFUL update! Awful. Atrocious update. Whatever happened to ""if it ain't broken, don't fix it?"" I have never written a review on an app before. Ever. But I had to, in this case, because VSCO is one of my favorite apps. The filters are great and the old square grid was GREAT for previsualizing Instagram feeds. Now the new update makes it look really messy. It is not pretty at all. I am not happy about this and I can see so many other people aren't neither."
5189,Enduros nerdish,"July 11, 2016",1,"Useless update New update is horrendous. I can't find my older pictures or take new ones. Even if I take pictures using my iPhone's default camera app, I can't even edit them on the app because I can't find the editor anymore. Well, assuming it still exists. I hope there's a way to downgrade the app, or that the developers change the features back to what they were before this disastrous update."
5190,rockersunshine,"May 22, 2015",5,Best app out there! I LOVE the filters. It gives that vintage arty look that I love for pictures. I bought the package for the extra filters because they are that amazing. I recommend this app to everything ‚ò∫Ô∏è
5191,Water that is blue,"June 5, 2015",1,"Why...like why. Vsco cam you really need to fix all of these problems. Great layout, great design, but what good is any of it if no one can save or share a single photo. There's a way but who wants their picture to come out in practically 240p? The app looks better, but I'm afraid it's pointless because I can't do anything. It's been a long time as well, and you would think you'd get your things fixed by now seriously."
5192,Pinkystan,"July 28, 2015",5,Really great This app is super nice and it edits your photos really well for the price aka IT'S FREE. Honestly I bought Afterlight after getting this and am truly disappointed that I spent a good dollar on something I could have gotten for free from this app.
5193,Autumnangel92201,"September 14, 2015",5,"loveeee I freaking amazing. it lets you post your pictures without worrying about likes or comments. it allows you to edit them, also. you can also journal and it's great"
5194,Happy Powders,"October 17, 2015",3,"New Update I've loved VSCO since its beta days and still do. With that being said, the explore tab feels ruined. I miss the simplicity and ability to ""explore"" other people's content, but everything is so slow (iPhone 6) and I can't tell what I'm looking at anymore, whether it's vsco grid or the people I follow's feed."
5195,Bake beyond,"February 21, 2016",5,Stunning This is the best photo-editing app there is & I love it. There are so many filters available for purchase & I love how you can see the layout of all of the pictures you've edited.
5196,Covered in joy,"March 3, 2016",5,"My Go-To Photo Editing App My favorite photo editing app by far! Has a bit of a learning curve but once I got past that, it was awesome! Best presets I've found so far and I've tried a lot of apps! Highly recommend!"
5197,Good at first ....,"March 8, 2016",4,"4/5, one star missing bc... I love this app & I use it all the time to edit all my pictures.. but I also have an account on vsco & I have a follower who only follows me to harass me & bully me. I think this happy would be a lot better if you could block people & be private :)"
5198,Alyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyytt,"March 22, 2016",3,New update Why did they have to change all the good things? I loved how seperate from Instagram Vsco used to be but now it's becoming more like it. Also I hate how profiles look now what an awkward layout. I hope they change this feature back or I don't see the point of using Vsco anymore.
5199,Jddhyfxxbjyvssl,"April 2, 2016",5,AMAZING Definitely the best app for filters! The social part is also really cool. I enjoy being able to share my pictures with other people that actually care for stuff like it.
5200,Sarakhanov,"August 11, 2013",5,"Great app! It is really great app, I use it often. The filters are beautiful. But I have one question: at my sister's Iphone 5 ther are two more Tools, than on my 4s: Grain and Sharp - is it right? Or I have some problems with my app?"
5201,Kota_JPN,"August 26, 2013",5,One of the best!! This app makes me feel like I'm an creative artist!! I absolutely like the fact that it has tons of options to adjust and edit pics and yet it's very simple and easy to use.
5202,rosekaz13,"September 21, 2013",4,"Good I love this photo app! The only feature I would like to see is the option to view your photos on a white background, as many of us upload to Instagram. Otherwise, it's fantastic and only gets better!"
5203,chiquisperez37,"February 13, 2014",4,new update! my all time favorite editing app but ever since the update I can't edit anything! I can't upload the pictures i want from my camera roll! please fix it. im considering buying after light if this isn't fixed.
5204,Is this nickname taken????!,"February 14, 2014",4,"Love, BUT This app is awesome and the update for iOS is - I've had it since the summer 2013 worked like a charm. BUT, after I updated the app, I was unable to load or even see screen shot pics (which save to my camera roll."
5205,CJ Ingraham,"July 31, 2014",5,"Proud Vsco user Top of the line photo editing with this app! Some things i would like to see in the future however are a tilt shift settings option and newer presets more often. Otherwise, ace!"
5206,andreaaa723,"September 1, 2014",5,"Lovely. I got so sick of seeing #mcm and #wcw on Instagram that I deleted it.  I'm glad I found this after where things like that don't exist. All of the focus lies simply within the photos, which happens to be quite perfect."
5207,Hmm0625,"November 14, 2014",2,"Not a fan of the new update I updated my app yesterday, but regret doing so. I hate that the flags are gone (I LOVE THEM), the new icons with the app are confusing and I don't understand what they mean and the all white app icon isn't attractive (the color version was MUCH better).  I think the old saying, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies here!  Please go back to the old in app icons and return the flags."
5208,xqnonx,"February 20, 2015",4,Best app!!! But... This is the best app i've ever tried (and i've tried a lot) but it would be even better if we could download filters from the store without having iOS8.
5209,Evolamla,"March 21, 2015",5,"Amazing I love this app. The pictures look amazing after editing then. Some of them don't even look like I took them with my iPhone, it's such a great asset for those who are into vintage photos as well. Very cute."
5210,saamuelrichard,"June 6, 2013",4,crash been using it all morning and love it! stoked on the multiple slider dots. way more and way better than the old. i dig it. the only thing is I can't open my app without it crashing the second I try opening it.
5211,EMCELITE,"June 6, 2013",5,#northwestisbest welcomes #vscocam Thoroughly impressed with the new VSCO Cam app. You can tell their team thought everything through and their hard work has created a high new standard for iOS Photography.
5212,Petie Pizarro,"June 7, 2013",4,Almost Perfect This app is fantastic. Best filters on the iPhone and even more customizability and shooting options. Only thing missing is a shake reduction for the camera so it only takes pictures when your hands are stable.
5213,xcaliforniagirlx,"June 8, 2013",5,"Great app I have a lot of other photography apps but this one is my favorite. The presets you get with this app are unlike any other. Moreover, I like how I have more customization, with most other apps you don't get that."
5214,Not a mess at all,"June 9, 2013",3,Loving it!! So far I love that you can get a preview of the filters.  Just one thing... is it just me or is it normal that it takes a LOOONG time to save? and when it finally saves to camera roll the filters are completely off.  Hope this gets fixed because this app is really good otherwise.
5215,idtpq,"June 10, 2013",4,"My new favorite app! The app is great, amazing filters, easy share."
5216,Linaaok,"June 23, 2013",4,ÿßŸæ ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ I like this app more than afterlight. You don't get overwhelmed by the number of filters and I like that I can use the old vsco cam filters as well. The only thing I would add is a share option to tumblr. But it's a breeze to use overall.
5217,Bex167,"July 1, 2013",4,Simple and perfect Easy to use. All the photos come out gorgeous. Makes iPhone photos look like stunning dslr photos. Really worth the download. I love how you can apply their filter and adjust how strong it is and you can adjust minor details as well.

5220,HaileyCraw,"June 23, 2016",1,"Confused This was honestly my favorite photo editing app, what happened? This update was absolutely unnecessary. It glitches randomly when exiting a picture and I have to open the app all over again. The previous version I had no problems with. This need to change what was already fine is just confusing. Why did you guys make it harder to navigate a beautiful and simple app?"
5221,„Öó(~„ÖÖ~)„Öó,"June 26, 2016",2,"Disappointing VSCO must either not know their customers well or they just don't care about us.

I'm never going to update unless they bring back the grid!"

I love the way it makes my photos look and I don't mind the clean look of profiles and of the app in general BUT THIS APP IS SO NOT USER FRIENDLY.

5226,Hbcgvc,"March 8, 2017",2,Shocked So I really think that the developers should go back to the original design because it's more harder to use and take more time to edit now I'll still use it but your making it harder for me and it went back recently to the original but I miss and updated it back can y'all reset mine back to the original??
5227,Cheegcx,"April 6, 2017",3,Yay I have always been a big fan of this app and recently I accidentally update my app and I think I lost my pics because they're not showing up and it's completely different from before.. bug everything is good but the new features was unnecessary.. I'm disappointed üòíüòê
5228,Every Mom,"April 19, 2017",5,"VSCO I love this app so much! I love that its eveything that Insta is but without the competition for likes and followers! My one suggestion, can I save my DSCO's? That would be nice cuz lots of my photos I don't publish! To anyone who likes photography this is for you!"
5229,Jdoudna,"May 2, 2017",4,"Interesting app I like the idea that it's not about followers or ego. It's simply an album of memories and pictures that you personally like. I haven't fully got a hang of it yet, because I'm not familiar with exactly how it is supposed to be used. So far, I love it though."
5230,Forest2024,"November 2, 2015",4,"The interface would be nice... To be honest, this is a good app for taking pics. But the interface is kind of weird, when I used this app, my time was wasted by interface, I didn't know what is that button for? But the pic that I took looked awesome!"
5231,mooncheez,"November 17, 2015",3,Really missing old VSCO I was hoping this last update would revert the old view settings on the Grid and Explore sections but sadly not. I used to love looking through these before but now I've lost interest. Please change back it was so much prettier before! I don't understand the switch... üòî
5232,Pais_s,"November 18, 2015",5,Crash on iPhone 4S I am having an issue that it crashed whenever I try to save into camera roll with actual size (dslr). Please have a time to fix it. You guys rocks! Thanks!
5233,sammmulkeeen,"March 14, 2016",4,"Update I love this app, in fact it may even be my favorite. But the update is SO BAD when you scroll down on the pic to see what filter was used and stuff that whole thing is changed. Its soooo annoying. Change it back!!!!"
5234,Arianajm13,"March 20, 2016",3,"Update‚Ä¶ I'm pretty sure before we could swipe left and right between pictures, but for some reason I'm not allowed to do that anymore. Frankly it's just frustrating, and consumes more time when I would like to just be able to swipe quickly between posts."
5235,jah7502,"June 9, 2016",1,"Been a fan for a while. Not so much now. In a world of overtaken by social media, I loved the simple UI of VSCOcam with the great editing tools and lovely filters. Big fan of the Vibrant and Essence presets. "
5236,Mona1610,"June 10, 2016",5,"Update I don't mind the new look, the only thing I suggest is having more options such a removing blemishes or whitening backgrounds or even blurring something out but other than that I love this app‚ù£"
5237,NicJGelo,"June 11, 2016",5,"Update looks good I really don't understand why there's so much negative backlash. The new update is incredibly simple, and in my opinion, much easier to navigate than the previous UI."
5238,Shahindaaa,"June 11, 2016",4,"VSCO In all honesty, VSCO was my go to photo editing app and helped me organize the way I saw my pictures for my social media feed. However, the new update has interfered with how I see my pictures, and ruins the effect of my color schemes. I liked VSCO before the update."
5239,Katherine0507,"June 18, 2016",1,"Absolutely and completely dissapointed I have never written a review for an app before but I was SO MAD at this horrible new update that I had to. Your top selling point was the square grid, so that you could preview how your Instagram would look. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS NEW LAYOUT? HONESTLY. It is not intuitive and the ""aesthetic"" you are trying to achieve does not work. Please bring back the old layout because I am this close to deleting this app forever."

5241,einsting,"November 30, 2014",3,"Good editing app, needs work After recent update sliders slow to become active. Lightroom adjustment arrows easier to use than sliders. Good range of tools and filter options but filters need description option so characteristics are quickly discernible...Particularly on Iphone where icons are very small."
5242,iNewett,"December 28, 2014",4,"üëå AMAZING. Filters are gorgeous, only reason I gave it 4 stars is because every time I try to buy the 6.99 pack, it closes in the middle of downloading and won't let me get the filters. Other than that though, it's probably the best app I have honestly"
5243,Phartsy,"January 5, 2015",5,Gorgeous App I've used VSCO since the first day it was available on the App Store. Big fan of minimal editing to match my minimal style. I'm a professional photographer and wouldn't suggest any other photography app over VSCO to friends.
5244,AppleSnyc,"March 27, 2015",1,"Like wearing a Burberry trench in Antarctica Pretty filters but unintuitive. Seriously. The buttons that mean what exactly? If you're going to diverge from easily recognizable icons there better be a help button on every page. Hell, there probably is... I just can't find it. And how on earth do I exit a screen? Trying to get around this app is a pain. Worst UI. It's pretty, but doesn't work until you memorize their odd icon set. Like wearing a Burberry trench in Antarctica."
5245,Purpleeeee2,"May 16, 2015",5,"Perfect App! This is an amazing app and I am so glad that I have it because it makes my pictures look gorgeous! But, I would really like the color purple to be added when I tint my photos. So pleas please please add the purple :)"
5246,JayAbel_,"May 30, 2015",5,üòÖüí™ This is my favorite photo editing app of all time. Literally. This app has been out for quite a long time now and I think filters for the camera would be a good idea.

The only problem is that every time I try to save a photo the app crashes. The picture doesn't save to my camera roll either. Other than that it's a great app.
5268,MommyQ,"January 30, 2017",1,"Used to Love VSCO... Overall VSCO is one of my favorite and most commonly used apps. But recently, within the past few days, the app stopped working. Out of habit, I deleted and re-downloaded it in hopes it would work. Really irritated that the app deleted the edited pictures I had saved but not yet posted. There should be a way to save those pictures so no matter what they're connected to your account."
5269,Daquesh√≠a,"January 30, 2017",5,BEST IN THE UNIVERSE ‚ú® Not even gonna lie this is literally my favorite and most used app. The interface is beyond aesthetic and truly a work of art. Even to this day the VSCO app continues to baffle and amaze me. Pls just download the app and buy all the presents it's so worth it
5270,Julievovo,"May 18, 2016",5,"Is something wrong with the app??? I love this app, yet I guess there must be something wrong going on with the new version. Mine keeps installing. What happens? Don't tell me I need to delete the app after spending $$$ on it!!!!"
5271,Alex09888lol,"May 18, 2016",2,Needs improvement It's a great app with nice filters but why use it if it reduces the quality of your photos. The photos lose resolution after editing with VSCO. It's ridiculous. You spend time taking a nice landscape photo and all you hard work goes down the drain. It would be much better if that was improved
5272,TWD IS MY EVERYTHING,"June 9, 2016",2,new update ??? I've always used this app the help sort out my Instagram and get a feel on how my feed would look but with the new update it's very difficult to see or plan because the pictures are tiny. the only reason I still have the app is for filters I really hope they change it back to the old vsco.
5273,Nenemichelle88,"June 10, 2016",2,"Love the app, not the update I love vsco and its my all time favorite editing app. Although, I dislike the update. The layout is the biggest problem. I loved the look before, where each picture was squared. In this update, I can hardly see the pictures I edited. Also, I want to be able to see the ""caption"" for my photos when I post them."
5274,cocoshann,"June 12, 2016",1,"I can't with this app anymore. They were already doing too much to make it confusing to use, now it's not even usable with this latest update. CONFUSING UI, the icons aren't even close to what's widely used so you don't know WHAT they do. Stick with what works! Why try to re-invent simplicities like recognizable icons? The attempt to make it more social is horrible. Convoluted with horrible design. Way too fashion-forward for it's own good."
5275,sarah5284,"June 12, 2016",1,"WHY VSCO Man I used to REALLY LOVE this app, it's all I use in fact to edit my pictures, but I HATE the new update. I used to use the app to get a feel for how my insta feed would look before posting and now the layout of the app doesn't match Instagram. It's incredibly hard to use and downright confusing. I think the new features could be cool, but I know I and fellow users I know would all love to see it go back to the old layout!"
5276,erikaiscoolll,"June 13, 2016",3,"update :/ app used to be bomb asf before the update. don't get me wrong it still does all the same stuff, but the layout and such makes it all the more confusing. it used to be all about editing photos and not to publish them, that's what Instagram is for hence why we need an app for editing."
5277,Birdfan4ever,"June 15, 2016",1,"Horrible update! This update totally ruined VSCO cam for me. The update shrunk the pictures and now instead of being in perfect squares, it's not and I can't see them that well. Also I can't even find where to search for different people on VSCO or even see anybody else's pictures! How do I see the people I'm following? Vscocam has turned into a puzzle to try and find where things are! I'm deleting this app!"
5278,littlecousin69,"July 1, 2016",1,"The new update is terrible The version before this new update was amazing. It was easy to navigate, looked beautiful, and because of that I bought so many filters because I loved the app and had a passion for editing photos. Now, with the new update, you've taken it and thrown it the trash. This new layout is simply ugly and hard to navigate. Thanks for ruining a perfect app with a so-called ""improvement."""
5279,ag4098,"July 2, 2016",1,"Nothing is intuitive!! This navigation design is ridiculous. What in the world would make anyone think you must hold a striped circle and swipe to move between pages (pages that you don't even know the order of because nothing indicates it)? And why would striped circle = camera? Extremely frustrating to need to re-learn an app that I use so frequently. Usability over looks, please."
5280,Eriklica,"September 19, 2015",3,Bad update. It was once an awesome app. This version crashes like crazzzzzy. Super annoying!!

5287,My dad is a computer,"March 25, 2016",5,Oh boy This app makes me quiver like a mad dog because I just love it sooo much! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. It makes my pictures look so dank and fresh. Their dsco app is pretty Love able as well.
5288,Gwynn,"March 26, 2016",2,"Panorama problems It seems like this app has a problem saving panoramas after you've edited them. I've got a couple I've edited, only to have the app crash every single time I try to save them. That's pretty frustrating, and also pretty unacceptable.

5360,Andymandyy,"July 11, 2016",3,What Even happened!! Okay when I first got this app it was amazing with the Layout of the pics. Now there's a huge gap between All of them and it makes it look Messy. I want to look at it how it was before. Also put the uanessacry profile Away from the Layout of the pics
5361,X5012,"July 30, 2016",2,"UI from hipster hell The UI's user friendliness has gone down the drain in an attempt to have a ""minimal"" experimental design. Scrolling through the Explore used to be fun, but now it makes me nauseous because the images are all over the place in terms of location and size. Cut out the edgy UI tweaks. I can't even figure out how to take a picture in the app now."
5362,Chelcflenn,"August 2, 2016",1,"Simplify or explain how to use it! Can we get a tutorial for this or something? It's nearly impossible to navigate. I have to completely close the app to post from my library again because I can't get back to it. It forces the features they want you to use rather than just making them all easily available. Newsflash, not everyone uses apps exactly the same way."
5363,Ronster123234,"August 11, 2016",1,New interface takes 4 stars back What happened? The new interface is overly complicated and not very intuitive. Still really enjoy the core functionality of the app - but now every time I launch I'm not sure if I should be adding pictures through that big blue box or elsewhere. Super confusing - hope you all didn't spend a lot of time or money developing the updates.

5370,Samsamys,"June 9, 2015",5,"Vsco Cam>> Probably the best editing app I've used on a mobile device and would hands down refer this app to any young, aspiring photographer.  It's so simple and elegant you're insane if you aren't in love with vsco cam."

5374,AWiki2727,"January 22, 2016",5,Best thing ever My all time favorite app! I love how followers can not like or comment on your pictures because it lets you post photos for yourself instead of for other's approval. Great outlet for creativity!!!!

When I load photos to edit into the app now they do not load and are just black blocks. I can't open them or do anything about it. I've tried sending a report through the vsco app which will not work either. Please fix vsco so it can be the amazing app that I love again!
5381,douglasfotografix,"July 4, 2014",5,Spectacular app but missing one thing A version for the iPad. I use the iPhone version on here but since it's not compatible it's got some flaws. Still one of the best photo apps around.

5388,Jfkow,"May 16, 2015",5,Love the idea! I just love how there are no followers nor likes which not only takes this app out of the social network category but puts absolutely no pressure whatsoever on people. Great and brilliant idea! I applaud the founders and makers of this app.

It used to be simple, great editing tool, with quality/stylish/artistic photos. Now it's trying to be a social media platform for selfie takers. You can't even sync across devices anymore! What is this, 2008? What kind of dunce made the decision to take away syncing feature?"

I absolutely loved the older versions of the app, where I could choose how to display the photos on my profile, but that's gone. I go to view other people's photos on my feed, and it's completely different than the simple scroll. I miss the older version that I was so use to, and I would like to have the options back."
5463,muzikabuser4444,"November 13, 2015",1,Full photo display size is gone with update. Full photo display size went away with this most recent update. It's the only view mode that lets you differentiate between horizontal and portrait versions of a photo and now you have to select to edit a photo before you can see the orientation. I miss this feature and hope its removal was a mistake with this last update.
5464,MableM,"December 11, 2015",4,"Great app, could use some extra features. I really love the quality of the pictures, but it would be awesome if it came with a self timer feature, flip vertical and horizontal and ability to take video."

Once it completely locked up the phone while trying to save to camera roll. Required two force resets and some swearing to fix. Unacceptable. I'm on a 4S."
5482,Bryon S White,"August 9, 2013",5,Best photo app PERIOD!!! This app is amazing! I love all the tools your given to create what i believe are the best photos possible on a mobile device! & it's totally worth paying $5.99 for the bundle to get all of the awesome preset packs!
5483,Nagging Nelson,"September 14, 2013",5,Make a version to edit videos!! I love vscocam's filters and editing system. Now that Instagram has video we need the same vsco edits for video too. That would be awesome!!!! Please and thank you!

I LOVE everything accept this new update. Please change it back or the app will loose a lot of its users!
5492,MovieMan5000,"June 30, 2016",3,Update Confusing I like this AP generally and use it a lot for my own pics and to view the pics of others but the recent update really changed the UX and it's now much more difficult to do some things (like collecting other users images).
5493,yellow brown banana,"July 9, 2016",1,"If I could give it -1 stars I would I understand that the app is intended to share photographs, but I like using it to plan out what I want to post on Instagram without actually posting.

No longer satisfied."

I'm sure there's still a great editor underneath, but I'm not going to dig for it while VSCO keeps trying to be something they're not. I deleted it recently, for the first time since I first downloaded it. Recently I found Polarr, which is a great alternative."

Plus, all online guides to perfect photos using VSCO are now useless.  1-100 in my eyes should be revered back to the setting 1-12 including decimals."
5550,JuStInbiebbaaa,"July 23, 2016",1,Why did they have to change EVERYTHING The new update ruined this app I'm so close to deleting it. The whole point was to use the set up to model as your Instagram to see what filters and pictures would look good next to eachother and now they're in a weird hard to use set up. They kept not one thing the same. It's terrible. I want the original version back
5551,WUT364,"July 27, 2016",1,"So difficult I just re-downloaded this app to find it's more ""modern"" and I guess ""hip"" but it definitely isn't easy to use. I honestly have no idea where all of my original photos or filters can be found, and I can't upload a photo-only take one. I guess I'm deleting this again. Not worth your time or money. PS: new and hip isn't always good or worth it. Make it easier to use, please."
5552,Dnxmdmxn,"September 11, 2016",4,"VSCO VSCO is a great app and I love it! It's so much fun to use and I really recommend it. The only thing is that I have been having problems. Sometimes when I publish a photo, it will get deleted a few hours later. It's so annoying."
5553,Charbarcharbar11,"November 23, 2016",3,Love the theme! But the camera? I love the new white theme of VSCOcam! It looks really neat and fresh. The thing I don't like is the camera thing at the top. It is just distracting and annoying. I also wish all the photos where next to each other like in Instagram. Besides those things I love the new theme!!
5554,Fgutgigfvhffhifvgydf,"December 6, 2016",1,Let ME decide what goes on MY feed This app is great but I don't want to be following VSCO. Their posts take up half my feed. Also stop posting to my feed when someone adds an image to their collection. I don't like seeing the original posts then 10 people above that who added the post to their collection. my feed ends up being VSCO crap followed by the same picture 11 times.
5555,Tamarod,"January 3, 2017",1,"Clarify tool not exporting Super frustrating, what's the point of making all your edits and then saving the image only to find out the edits didn't actually export? I didn't notice this until I got to my ~50th pic edit (which was a very textured photo so it was too obvious to miss). Basically all those hours were spent on nothing. Use a more reliable edit tool if you have one cause VSCO ain't it."
5556,..VSCO..,"January 23, 2017",5,Good & Could Be Better I love the editing tools for photos on this app! I would love it even more if I could edit videos the same way I edit photos on here.

5558,Shutterbri,"February 12, 2017",3,Got rid of landscape mode?! Now I have to turn my iPad and keyboard on it's side to edit. Has taken the physical ease out of editing. Now it's archaic like instagram in its orientation. Still my go-to for editing and I love the fact that I can edit the photos and they are still of high resolution.
5559,Livilou1212,"February 26, 2017",5,LOVE VSCO is my favorite app to edit photos and it's a great was to view everyone best pictures when they are published! All the presets look amazing on each type of photo.
5560,Kate.kge,"April 19, 2016",3,i want the old VSCO back I hate how you now have to click on and off of every picture to see them all. the update doesn't even let you swipe to the next picture. I love the app but at least bring back that tiny feature.
5561,Queenbee161,"June 9, 2016",5,Mixed I love the app it was so helpful with planning my feed and getting inspired but I hate the newest update because it's not like the layout before and now I can't plan my feed
5562,Alyblahblah,"June 9, 2016",1,"Go back to the old version! I really do not like this new version, everything is different and the format is terrible! I used to use VSCO bc they had the same format of photos as Instagram but now it's all different. Now I need to find a new app to see if it stores photos the way Instagram does. So annoying! Why did it have to change! It needs to stick to simple ways"
5563,Kerrberr17,"June 9, 2016",3,"Disappointed I've been using vsco for a few years now and I love the app. But the new update is horrendous. Navigation is not easier and the over all look is no longer appealing. I'm very disappointed in the new update, please bring back the old look."
5564,naomixshort,"June 10, 2016",1,"very disappointed. this app was popular due to the fact that you could see what your Instagram feed would look like before you post, now the update doesn't let you do that and ruins one of the main reasons people use this app, taking away this feature is basically like taking away the filters in this app. (that's how much that feature mattered)"
5565,iman69696969,"June 10, 2016",5,A REAL photography app Actual photography app with awesome customer service. Not a lot of interaction between people which really emphasizes the importance on the photo which I love. This is my favourite app of the year. Keep it up VSCO
5566,Londyn9821,"June 10, 2016",1,"New design I love this app, I've always used it and even purchased extra filters on it. But this new design is awful. I liked it when it was all square and big and you could see how the photos looked together. This new design is making me want to delete the app all together because I can't use it for my main purpose anymore. Please go back to the old design."
5567,Ambervander,"June 16, 2016",1,"Horrible I never write reviews but I'm taking the time to write this one out of anger. I have LOVED vsco and have used it for a long time. The new update is horrible. I hate how small the pictures are now, and that little circles are being used for everything. I am really frustrated. I had all bought all of the presets but when I updated, I lost them and unable to download again. üò°"

5569,Flawless!!!,"June 19, 2016",4,The new update I love VSCO so much and it's one of my favorite apps but I can't use it anymore because the new update is complicated. I don't understand how to use the app anymore with the new update. The old version was much better.
5570,Baicano,"August 11, 2014",4,Color glitch I would give this 5 stars but I tried to use it today and all the colors are messed up so it makes everything (on every filter) black and white with green and purple splotches. pleaseee fix this

5574,Raidrair,"May 7, 2015",5,The only app I use to edit my photos! My only complaint is that I can edit panoramas but I can't save them.... if that could be fixed that would be great. Thanks VSCO!
5575,savannah grube,"June 7, 2015",4,great but ! I loved this app but now when I click it to open it it goes to the apple screen and restarts my ipod 5 
5576,GerJapa,"August 20, 2015",3,"Please fix iPad app crash Whenever I save a journal (I haven't tested for grid and collection) as a draft, later on when I resume the app crashes when I open the draft journal item.

5578,egags16,"December 2, 2015",3,"Change the Layout I love this app, but the old layout/structure of the pictures looked so much better than it does now. It's so unorganized and the pictures all cling to one side for the most part, so it looks really random and unappealing to me. The old way way better!"
5579,Morgan111100000008643,"March 28, 2016",1,"Seriously annoyed I never write reviews, but I'm really mad. Edits great, but my biggest frustration is when I'm trying to save my photos the app will crash. I've been waiting for this to be fixed for the past four updates, maybe longer. I want to be able to share my photos right away, not wait until the app decides to work. Why hasn't this been fixed yet??"
5580,Helena Jade,"June 24, 2013",1,"HATE the new update. This used to be my go to app for editing my pictures for instagram/tumblr, and now i just cant even seem to use it at all. The layout on the update is confusing and so much more time consuming. I would love it if they decided to go back to their old layout, and im so confused on how to use it. follow my instagram: simplyhelenaaa and tumblr: youre-t4cky if you want to see some of my old edits."
5581,Lttlemermaid1999,"August 7, 2013",4,"Great! This app is amazing! If you had the old app you can download the old filters, and the camera is high definition. Only problem is that it takes a while to have your vsco grid setup."
5582,Katherine.Ann.666,"August 22, 2013",5,"AWESOME APP!!!!! iPhone 4, no freezing no crashing thankfully. Filters are beautiful. Had some download issues, contacted VSCO Cam. They responded and fixed my problem in less than 12 hours."

5587,that.sunflower,"February 17, 2014",2,I would recommend the app to anyone But here's the thing that bothers me so much. In order to edit a picture you need to import it into the app and when your done you need to export it into your library. Please make the app more user friendly and show the phones gallery in the app and save to photos automatically.
5588,1wwoo11,"June 14, 2014",4,Editing is so much better but... Love this app but why does it when I use high quality images and it degrades it or saying maximum quality downgraded. I would like the whole max quality I can get not downgraded. Fix that pls.
5589,Lovehottie800,"June 23, 2014",4,I don't know what happened So I loved this app soooo much. Today I went on it and every option I click on just turns to black and white. I don't know what happened and it's all messed up now. :( is this just me? Can someone help me

5600,Yesyesyesyes:),"June 18, 2016",5,"ADORE IT!! Gosh, I love this app! The filters  and photo adjustments are perfect because they truly enhance the photos instead of making them look insanely edited. It's my go to photo editing app for sure!"
5601,helloimryann,"June 30, 2016",1,Horrible update The new update is so unintuitive. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to get to the camera. I got stuck in the filter store section because the X disappeared. The old version was way more user friendly. This one is so confusing. Whoever forced you guys to go with this update shouldn't be allowed to design UIs anymore. There's no way people at VSCO tested this and thought it was good.

5604,kailzcg,"July 20, 2016",1,Update Horrible This app was great until they decided to update it... Why fix something that doesn't need to be fixed. Now it's complicated and annoying. This is unnecessary and quite aggravating. Going back to Afterlight as my go-to editing app because this is a MESS. Everyone use Afterlight instead.. better filters anyway than this disaster smh. Maybe I'll change my mind

Also in the last version I used it to see how my pictures would look on my feed in Instagram. Now with the update it doesn't look as good so I can't view it how I normally would. 100% recommend not updating. I get they're trying to switch it up but personally I don't like the update.

Also, for the life of me, I can't figure out how to exit camera mode. Minimalism is great, but it needs to be more intuitive to pull it off."
5648,Josh & Rosemary,"December 4, 2014",5,Now supports high-res photos This version of the app will allow you to edit the full resolution of photos imported to your phone. Of course the presets are really nice--that is what they are known for.
5649,Carolina1225,"January 2, 2015",3,App crashing It's a great app. The Amazing features always makes the pictures turn out amazing except that whenever I try to save it to camera roll or post it the screen says loading then it crashes. Please fix this asap
5650,tylerphenes,"June 11, 2013",5,Changing the game of photography This app is simply beautiful. From to UI to the social integration with grid. The experience in the app is perfect. The presets are so powerful. The exposure settings are the best in the game of mobile editing.
5651,mikrobious,"June 11, 2013",2,"Hold off till its fixed. I strongly support the vsco team and know they will get it right eventually, but for now this app crashes way too much to be worth purchasing any if the additional presets. The old VSCO never crashed on me once and I was really excited for the new one but this thing is horribly broken right now."
5652,Lpet50,"June 16, 2013",3,Crash and loss Worked great until it crashed. Only had about 12 photos edited. Wish the app would auto save photos because I lost all of them when I had to delete the app and re-install. :-(  Hope it works better this round.
5653,tooshea5,"June 20, 2013",1,"WHAT!?!? After being a faithful user of this app for close to a year, I am disappointed in the new app. The first couple times I used the app, it was wonderful. However the past couple times I've tried to edit photos, the photo turns black. All editing tools and effects are useless because they all turn black. Will this problem be fixed soon!?!?!"
5654,Neutered Panda,"June 23, 2013",2,Disappointed I just updated it and I didn't get any new filters. I deleted it and installed again and didn't work. I might be misinformed but wasn't VSCO CAM completely different before (I'm new at this app)? People rant about this app but there's has a different pic and has a complete different format. Their's seems better. I got my hopes up.
5655,Sterlingenuine,"July 2, 2013",5,Great app! I love everything about it and it makes me strive to take better pictures. Now all it needs is a little video action. That would be perfect.
5656,88kee,"August 12, 2013",4,"It's cool Awesome app really. Just got it a few hours ago and so far it does a pretty good job, and I think it's also user-friendly. But for an account you have to wait for a grid apparently. And it only crashed once."
5657,nathanacn,"August 20, 2013",4,"Favorite Editing app! I love it, but you should add the ""crop"" feature. Also, it takes forever to load the filters. But if you were to make a new update, KEEP the moody filter, please. That's my favorite filter to use. Anyways, love this app."
5658,Thegirlstateofmind,"December 27, 2013",5,VSCO PERFECT APP I've been looking for a good app that could edit my pictures the way I wanted. And this app is the perfect one! It has all I need! I love using Fade and the love that now you can grain a little the picture‚ù§Ô∏è Love love love!
5659,commyostrich,"December 29, 2013",5,Great film emulation This definitely isn't an app for overdone Instagram filters. It's for emulated the beauty of film and it does that wonderfully. Amazing app. Shadow and highlight save is fantastic and very easy to use compared to iPhoto.
5660,Cvlol,"June 8, 2013",4,"Hard to work I love all the filters, however I believe that importing and editing is hard to maneuver. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, but now I can use it and I love the way my photos are turning out."
5661,aimee chow,"June 8, 2013",3,I love Vsco! But... I've imported my photos from the old vsco app and it crashes everytime I try to import more in the new app. It's saying I'm running low on space but I've deleted everything I possibly could to make more space and it still crashes. Please fix this! Thanks~
5662,gfaceshizzles,"June 8, 2013",4,"Great app! Except for some things The app makes pic come alive and it has good filters but when you save one of the edited pics to camera roll on iphone 4, it lowers the pics quality and filter"
5663,.mariaPaullA,"June 9, 2013",3,"Fix it:( I have an ipad but I fell in love with the first Vsco cam, so I downloaded this one, I was comoletely excited and I even bought the presets collection, but when I tried to edit a pic, the tools didn't appeared, I really wanted to cry cuz I love vsco cam and it seems unfair that the app doesn't work for me:( please FIX IT!!! Great work<3"

5665,Nabbie,"March 11, 2017",4,Love this app but it can get expensive Love this app and they give away a lot of filters for free but the ones they sell are very useful and it can get pretty expensive. Other than that I love this app! They gotta make their money somehow (:
5666,6xXManuelXx9,"March 15, 2017",5,I love the app The only complaint would be not being able to download your photos back
5667,jhgiy,"April 23, 2017",2,"Pictures won't load I had a fairly old version of vsco and recently updated to the latest version. Although there are a couple new filters and the editing is more clear, my pictures never load on my timeline and the layout isn't my favorite."
5668,hellofromsanfrancisco,"June 3, 2017",2,"Update Got Downhill Vsco updated and it's worse than ever. I used to have 8-9 filters, but now they've dummed it down to 6. And they're all ugly filters too. What happened to my HB1 and HB2? Where's my free filters that I downloaded before? I don't even think I'll use this app for its filters since there's such a small selection.."
5669,Sanalte123,"August 7, 2017",3,"The app is gold but... There is lots of glitching and crashing with i suppose the new update. I love the app but had to delete it and redownload it and now it won't download, that part could be my phone but the app is having some technical issues."
5670,Simonsabol,"June 29, 2016",1,Worst App update This update is horrid. I love vsco and I can barely figure it out now. What is this. Please restore how it used to look...this is horrible. I hate that stupid little Slide thing at the bottom it's dumb and I don't like how the profiles look or anything. the previous VSCO was the most amazing. If the look of the app doesn't change I'm probably going to delete it....word to all: do not update.
5671,Peacefulasia,"June 30, 2016",1,Horrible don't recommend This new update is horrible. They changed everything. It use to be so helpful to see how you're picture would look with your feed without posting it. But that's no longer an option. They've made VSCO so difficult to use. I purchased filters to bring my Instagram feed together and now I can't even use them .
5672,Friscott,"July 1, 2016",2,"If their goal was to make the UI horrible, then 5/5 Why is the UI so horribly complicated? Not user friendly. Ambiguous symbols for almost every action, which make no sense. Why would VSCO try to make this app more complicated with each update? A few years ago, their app was much easier to navigate. Please fix this."
5673,Kooky pen,"July 6, 2016",2,bad update I really used to love this app and would go on it a lot especially when I'm bored. but this new update has completely changed it. I now only use VSCO when I need to and even then I don't like it. it really needs to be changed backed to its old design bc I cannot navigate through the app with this new update.
5674,Piggyrobbins,"July 7, 2016",2,"Awful Used to be my favorite app on my phone.. Now with the update it's just hard to use and quite confusing.. I don't like the look and think it's ruined the app completely. Now, I barely use it. I do like the layout when looking in the explore but the rest is awful. Please change back."

I live in what is considered the most ""hipster"" city in the Pacific Northwest, where there is a lot of annoyingly pretentious stuff like beard oil and vases in restaurants with one single flower in it etc. And literally everyone I've talked to around town hate the VSCOcam update. I know y'all were going for a ""modern edgy look"" but even a person with the largest vegan, grass-fed, organic, nut-free kombucha brewery and an infinity tattoo on their wrist finds this app update to be TOO MUCH!! I am SO annoyed."
5677,burgerpalace,"July 28, 2016",4,nice the privacy settings don't save; they just revert back to the original settings if you close the app. please fix. I like to keep my location data with my pictures.

5679,julesmaluends_,"January 23, 2017",5,GO GET IT I am obsessed with this app. I love editing my photos on here with all of the effects and filters. The only thing I'm confused about is the RAW picture feature.

5684,Nmangual,"June 10, 2016",1,"What a disaster... I've been a long time user of VSCO and have always loved using this for editing. I really regret updating, the new look is hideous and really unnecessary. It looked fine before, why change what isn't broken? The black negative space around my photos is an eyesore and the UI is just annoying and cluttered. Please change it back, it was fine the way it was."
5685,TheMrsNiallHoran!,"June 11, 2016",2,Favorite app until the update I absolutely love vsco but after this new update I don't even feel like using it anymore. It's extremely confusing to use. I don't even know how to search people anymore other than the suggested users. I'm hoping there will be a new update or I'll probably delete it :(
5686,Jicneihrirjdndj,"June 12, 2016",1,"Bring back the old vsco I think I am speaking for everyone when i say that I want the old VSCO back ! This new interface is very stressing on the eye, and very glitchy . It freezes constantly, takes longer to import and save photos, and my photos are gone. Generally, the app is slower. If you can at least fix its many many bugs then Id make it back to a 5."
5687,3lizabethkim,"June 15, 2016",1,"I hate the new update The new update makes everything feel so inconvenient. Also I liked the square layout feature and the sync photos feature because it gave a preview of what my IG feed would look like. But that that's gone, the usefulness of this app went down. I'm very disappointed at the new update. They should bring back the previous one."
5688,audreykc_,"June 22, 2016",3,"New update: meh Meh. Not bad. I don't like that pictures got smaller in my feed, or that they're not square in my library, but I'll live.

5689,Uhmmmmmm No.,"June 24, 2016",3,"HELP!! HOW DO YOU SEARCH I honestly love this app, and the new update takes getting used to it was like everything changed at once and it's hard to use and it's hard to see your grid profile, keep everything but make the grid profile better"
5690,Your_mom_ha,"November 17, 2014",4,Love the app but won't let me purchase. When I click on the store it says I need to update to access. But it is already updated. Do you think this is because I didn't switch to the newest ios8?
5691,KathJoanne,"January 14, 2015",1,Imported Photos I hope VSCO can fix the problem whit editing imported photos from my digital camera. The pictures can be added to the vsco library and are editable but they cannot be uploaded on my social networks nor can it be saved to camera roll. The photos taken from my iPad's camera doesn't seem to have problems with editing and uploading.

5697,50817,"November 1, 2015",1,R.I.P. Anonymity BRING BACK THE ANONYMOUS VSCO! I don't want to know who follows me and I don't want people to know I follow them! The whole fun in VSCO was being able to post what you wanted and follow who you wanted without having to think twice or feeling judged by it! You guys have ruined the whole VSCO experience! Stop trying to change things! And don't even think about putting a comment and like section in it either! üò°
5698,minified,"November 11, 2015",5,Love it Great app. It's really a must-have for iPhone photos. This might be more on Instagram's side than VSCO but I wish my non-square photos wouldn't get cropped to square when sharing to Instagram.

5705,bvosler,"July 25, 2014",5,Honored This is a special gift. So much time is wasted on these stupid little digital devices. VSCO runs the opposite direction and refuses to let moments pass without considering the beauty in a single moment of life.

5743,_dianafame_,"December 23, 2015",3,"Download/Update I update the app on my iphone, but then it wouldn't work, so I deleted it. But now each time I try to download it again it won't let me. I really like this app, but I can't use it. Soon my opinion might change if you don't fix this problem :/"
5744,Billybob22111,"June 5, 2016",5,This app is the best... all the other reviews on here are stupid this app does great for what it's made for (editing photos) I use it for every picture I take and it never disappoints me.
5745,Cameron17363,"June 9, 2016",5,"Great app!! Needs one more feature though Guys, please consider adding in landscape orientation! It would make working with landscape photos so much nicer. Just a thought!"
5746,TYLER324,"June 9, 2016",1,"terrible update :( I've LOVED vsco since forever, but this update makes me so upset. I liked the layout before because I was able to plan my Instagram feed within the app with the squares. Now with the new update, all of the pictures are different sizes, and their aren't anymore rows like our Instagram profiles are. I guess I'll have to find a new app with the old layout üò©"
5747,Furiousamy,"June 10, 2016",2,"I dislike the update I love VSCO and I've been a fan for years, but with this new update, much of what I loved about this app is gone. The clean, minimalistic style has disappeared, and the ability to view my pictures in a grid like on Instagram--a feature I know many adore--has disappeared as well. Please bring back the old VSCO."
5748,Bg14infinity,"June 10, 2016",3,Needs some changes... I love vsco cam before the new update. The old vsco cam format let me see how my instagram looked before I post but now I can't. The folder that says collected images takes up the spot where I would usually place my third photo in a row.
5749,ThreeMaAwesome,"June 11, 2016",2,"it WAS a good app I USED TO BE HUGE FAN OF VSCOcam. It was one of My most favorite apps üíûüíû but when I opened it today and saw this DRASTIC change I was very disappointed and upset. The new look totally changed it around and just upset all of VSCOcam's fans! There was no need for this update and it was a very poor marketing decision, making this app go from 4+ stars to 1 in afew days!! PLEASE CHANGE IT BAAAAAAACK"
5750,Brynnbby0912,"February 18, 2014",1,Update broke it Still in the new update it has told me I can't upload or take pics due to low memory. So I then deleted every single photo I had to make memory... It still said the same thing. Clearly that is impossible. It says I have 5% of USED storage.... Where's the other 95%? Fix this because I can't use it anymore. üòî or please let me know a way I can fix this.
5751,4mel4,"February 19, 2014",4,"Still unusable after update. Despite the most recent update, the ""low memory"" message appears each time I try to upload a photo. I love Vsco but it's worthless if I can't use it. Please fix ASAP."
5752,Kellydiane778899,"February 19, 2014",5,Best photo editing app Hands down the best photo editing app out there. Not to mention all the filters available for purchase - worth every penny.
5753,sydneymckayla,"May 1, 2014",5,timer? please please please put a timer on the camera please please please I'm begging you here! but other than the the app is absolutely perfect! I use it for all my pictures!!!
5754,Yajairab25,"June 1, 2014",3,"I USE to love this app I don't know what happened everything was going so well, then it started to act funky and I thought if I just deleted it and just downloaded it again it well be okay, but it deleted all my photos I've taken on the app, I'm very disappointed."
5755,Plavamacka,"June 11, 2014",5,The best app ever! I have tried millions of photo editing apps and every one of them had some kind of problem. Until VSCO. I recommend it to everyone!
5756,Graham BBQ,"November 14, 2014",2,"Great but not a fan of the update. I've used VSCOcam for a while now, and I don't get why they made so many small but annoying changes with the update. I don't like the smaller interface buttons, the updated look moved some common tools around, and it seems you've removed some of the best features? Booo. Bad update."
5757,Nfujfdtub,"November 17, 2014",3,:( disappointed When opening pictures it's a little glitchy. 
5758,TaylerSethasang,"December 2, 2014",2,"I used to love this app, not so much anymore. This used to be my go to photo editing app but lately with the newest version I've been getting very frustrated by it. It seems to crash and lag while I try to edit or save my photos! Use this app if you have a lot of time to waste trying to get it to work."
5759,Lilagirl213,"April 15, 2015",5,Love This is my go to app for editing photos. I love it. And the customer service is awesome. There was a hiccup in a recent update and they were so speedy in replying to me and fixing the issue. Thank you VSCO team!
5760,adelineploscariu,"June 9, 2013",2,"App crashing I downloaded the app a few days ago and since then I've had a lot of fun editing pictures. It's one of the best photography apps out there. However, just today it has been crashing every time I try to open my gallery of photos. Now I can no longer use the app. It's disappointing."
5761,pedrocela,"June 9, 2013",5,"Excellent work VSCO Cam has become one of my favorite photography apps for iPhone. It's different filters are incredible. Just buy the whole pack, it's worth it."
5762,Codi J.,"June 17, 2013",4,"It's Ok I personally didn't like it. I think it depends on what type of filters you're looking for. This app has filters, but their very subtle, unless you like those filters that are light and subtle, then this is the app for you :)"
5763,Ryguy957,"June 18, 2013",4,"Love the app, but The one thing that frustrates me is that whenever I want to select a photo to edit I have to scroll through hundreds if pictures because it combines all of my albums together."
5764,Jazmyn Huyghue,"June 21, 2013",2,Was working Was working fine up until the most recent update. Now when I go to save my photo to my camera roll it stops and freezes up my phone at about 25% and I have to force restart my phone.  Guess I'll have to use something else until this is fixed. üëé
5765,Kevin First Review :),"June 23, 2013",5,"VSCO, In a class by themselves. I have never written an app review, but VSCO is in a class by themselves when it comes to iPhone camera, developing, and sharing.  Their Lightroom presets are above the rest too."
5766,Graceelizabethwhite,"October 12, 2013",5,"I love this app so much! It makes photos so much clearer, and you can focus a lot better, I never use my real camera always this app! Highly recommended."
5767,Micllynn,"October 12, 2013",5,Stunning The photos you can create with this thing are just amazing. Would definitely recommend.
5768,lukeamazooka,"December 26, 2013",5,"Love VSCOcam! After discovering VSCOcam I discovered my love for photography!  It has some great features, presets, and tools to make your photos look great!  I've enjoyed VSCOcam so much that I plan on purchasing VSCOFilm.  Thanks, VSCO, for a great app and great features!"
5769,clucluclcu,"February 14, 2014",1,"Can't See Pictures! I used to use this app all the time, but after the update, I'm unable to even see the photos I want to edit. When I click on a specific filter, the photo disappears. (This happens with other editing tools as well, not just filters) And when I save it to my camera roll, it comes up as a blank picture. ): Disappointed!"
