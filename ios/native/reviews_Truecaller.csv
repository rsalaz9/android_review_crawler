0,B.A.Thompson,"February 12, 2018",4,"Blocks spam, but not if they‚Äôre collection agencies! I got this app, TrueCaller, and its only works part of the time.  Understanding there are constantly new numbers added to the spam list, I expect to update the app database daily.  Not that big of a deal.  The problem is, it clearly identifies a spam caller, but still allows some through.  I have found it blocks legitimate spam calls as I recently put my resume online and immediately began getting spam calls.  I bought the new iPhone X 256GB, but neglected to turn the blocking options on in settings.  Once that was done, no more spam calls... or so I thought.   The calls I was receiving, promising job opportunities, required me to sign up for more school.  Holding two bachelors and a masters degrees, I politely told the first few I had no interest in school and explained my education level.  If you refuse their persistence in signing up for school, they rudely say they can‚Äôt help.   Truecaller stopped these.  However, while clearly marked in red a call is spam and you answer, you will find they let collection agency calls through.  I‚Äôve had my number for 10 years now and still get collection calls for someone I don‚Äôt know!   I haven‚Äôt found any better app out there, though, so the collection calls will have to manually be rejected."
1,LeonJon,"October 3, 2018",1,"WORTHLESS MAIN BENEFIT IS ALLOWS REPORTING OF A SPAMMER - GEE THANKS I find the app worthless, and the cost to privacy not near worth the price of giving the developers FULL ACCESS TO EVERY SINGLE CONTACT ON YOUR DEVICE.  There are two main benefits to this app.  One, is to allow you to report a spam caller as a spammer to the developer - Gee Thanks (can you hear the sarcasm dripping in my voice?).  Two, allows you to double check a number that has just phone you, to see if other app holders have previously reported the number as a Spammer.  Really do not understand the near five star review average, in fact I‚Äôm baffled by it.  Someone, please explain to me how this is not a worthless app. "
2,BasCarMel,"October 5, 2019",1,"Wrong for many reasons We had an issue with someone on Craigslist who tried to get personal information from us.  We hung up on him.  Shortly afterwards we learned that our phone number was listed as a scam on Trucaller, probably as retribution from the Craigslist scammer.  We learned about our phone number being listed as a scam from a local pet grooming shop when they saw it was listed on Trucaller.  Trucaller never bothered to check that we had the same phone number since 2001, nor did they check our home address, nor did they contact us before labeling us as scammers.  When we finally contacted them, they removed our number from their list. Maybe you should check with them to find out if someone has given them your number out of spite.  This is a dangerous violation of privacy for them to convict people in a way for the whole world to see without any proof at all, just some jerk reporting you.  The Nazis and Soviets had the same kind of system where you could rat on a neighbor and they would disappear!"
3,DweezyGurl,"January 10, 2019",5,DUDEEEEeeeee It‚Äôs awesome I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to work but it immediately turned all those spam calls into red lettered SPAM. I get spam called all day long at school ONLY AT SCHOOL I‚Äôve literally never got spam called at home but at school I get so embarrassed when my ringtone goes off super loud in the middle of class one day it literally happened 3 TIMES i turn my ringer off but the stuff in my backpack shoves my phone all around and one time even ended up calling the cops on accident because of the side buttons. They literally were like ‚ÄúCan the person with the phone number (blah) bla - blah come down to the office IMMEDIATELY.‚Äù I was like üò± but yeah my phone causes problems but this app can fix em so :3
4,Tenthandjordan,"March 14, 2019",4,"Need consistent, frequent app store updates Love the idea of this app and really appreciate it. It seems to work well at blocking spam callers, HOWEVER, I hate that it doesn‚Äôt automatically update on its own; notify you when there‚Äôs a new update available; or even show up in the app store to show there‚Äôs an update. As a result, I still get spam calls more than I should because they are not included until I go open the app, check if there‚Äôs an update, and then initiate it myself. Imagine if we had to do this with all apps? That would be obnoxious. I really hope we can get regular/frequent app updates for this via the app store so we dont have to constantly go in this app and check ourselves. It would save time and stress."
5,Sertano,"September 9, 2019",1,"NOT True Caller... After adding the app, my spam calls increased considerably. Apparently, the app sold my phone number.  In 2 weeks, only 1 call was considered spam by the App when I started receiving over a dozen calls per day. I had to turn the ringer off and ignored the calls I didn‚Äôt recognize. I called back some of the ‚Äúmissed calls‚Äù and all of the numbers were for non-existent lines.  Apparently, the numbers appearing on the calls were randomly generated from non-existent lines.  Most of those numbers attempted to be from areas where my number originally came from.  I no longer live nor communicate with people with numbers from the area my number originated from, but kept the same number because I‚Äôve had it since the brick phones of the early 90s. I don‚Äôt know what True solutions are out there to resolve the spam calls issue which has now gotten worse."
6,enginxxxx,"November 26, 2018",1,Uploaded my contacts to their database and made all public I loved this app. I don't know to how many friends I suggested it over the years. I've been one of the early adopters and have been a huge fan. It blocks spam quite effectively.
7,enginxxxx,"December 19, 2018",1,They uploaded my contacts list to their database I loved this app. I don't know to how many friends I suggested it over the years. I've been one of the early adopters and have been a huge fan. It blocks spam quite effectively.
8,JoshuaJ37,"July 2, 2019",1,"App is worthless now I used to love this app, and used to tell everyone I know to download it because of how well it blocked spam calls and gave you excellent caller ID. I work in wireless, and used to tell all my customers about it as well. However, in the last 12-18 months it's slowly but surely been going downhill, and now it's completely worthless. It literally blocks no spam calls anymore, doesn't give me any caller ID, and the number lookup took finds absolutely zero names of people or businesses. I will be deleting as soon as I'm done writing my review. I had always considered this a 5 star app, but now if I could rate it 0 stars, unfortunately I would. "
9,CShay2272,"January 25, 2019",5,Saved contacts I would have lost upgrading my phone. I am very glad I installed True Caller on my last phone and now this phone because when I upgraded to an Apple phone I had trouble transferring everything and wound up with only a portion of my contact list. 
10,GBZA,"October 23, 2017",4,"Great app but not so good on IOS Although, it doesn‚Äôt work like it is on the Androids, but it comes handy whenever  I need to check unknown numbers , and there it works at about 98% on all numbers , however I didn't grant the app permission to my contacts anymore because the first time I did, it loaded my contacts with strange numbers called spams, I wouldn't want to scroll through numbers I didn't save in my contact, so  I deleted all those numbers, and  simply denied the app the permission and there after use it in an isolating mode."
11,Quad quad,"November 7, 2017",1,Worse than the problem it purports to solve Once this app is on your phone a red screen will pop up saying ‚ÄòSPAM‚Äô every time someone on their list calls. This isn‚Äôt often - it only blocks a fraction of unwanted calls - but you will always know about it when a spam call comes in. Infuriating! I don‚Äôt want to be notified when a spam call comes in - I want it blocked before my phone goes off!!!
12,Ruilus,"December 19, 2017",3,Works - sort of... The fact that the spam database has to be updated daily is a huge setback. I have to manually open the app and click update every day or otherwise spam calls go through. Why?
13,GhostriderGaleJ,"December 26, 2017",5,"Newbe Haven't had this app long enough to properly review it, but it's bugging me for a review right off the bat! So this is what they get till I use it."
14,valharp,"June 21, 2018",2,"No longer effective I have used Truecaller for the past 3 years. It was great at identifying mystery numbers, especially those reported by other users as spam. It was integrated into my phone, stopping blocked calls before they rang. And the database updated quickly every time the app was opened. Deservedly, it was picked up by reviewers as an effective tool. But for the last 5 mont, the app has been totally useless. It does not update its database on opening, and updating it manually is very, very slow. It rarely finds the numbers calling me and no longer blocks them. Short story is that it was once a 5-star app and now is a 2-star app. I'm moving on to something else. What happened, Truecaller - did fame go to your head?"
15,Tasticks,"August 2, 2018",1,"Increased Spam/Robo Calls My number is registered under the National Do Not Call list so I rarely used to receive spam, marketing or calls (switchboard) calls. However, since installing and using this app, I‚Äôve gotten at least one spam call per day ‚Äî sometimes three. After some investigating, I read other app users are having a similar experience regarding this app‚Äôs privacy policy. It‚Äôs almost as if the app is catering to spammers by providing them with your info. "
16,cowboyskirt,"October 28, 2018",5,"I love this app I‚Äôve had this app for a couple years now and I very seldom receive spam calls. To be sure, the more often I open the app and click the little shield icon (spam id) at bottom right of screen to click on ‚Äúcheck for updates‚Äù, the better it works. I open the app several times a week to be sure I‚Äôm protected by following these steps. So it‚Äôs an app that you will need to frequently manually refresh, but it takes only a few seconds to do. Easy Peazy! Highly recommend!"
17,Melih..,"November 12, 2018",1,DON'T INSTALL THIS APP!!! I've registered my phone number to the National Do Not Call Registry and I was getting a couple spam calls per month.
18,Monkey Markings cat,"February 8, 2019",3,"Not as good as it was at first. Loved this app at first, but now it doesn‚Äôt identify most numbers as it did in the beginning. Now I just get a message- the truth is out there, search the web, when I try to find info on the caller. Then you have to pay another company to get the info. I am a paid member of Truecaller, but I am about to cancel. I have now downloaded RoboKiller and it works great, even let‚Äôs you use one of their bots for answering or make your own, and recording the call. However, if it is spam or robo call, your phone does Not even ring which is wonderful, you can check on your own without interruptions."
19,Rainbow_Revenger,"May 29, 2019",5,"Puts you in control. The app does as promised. It blocks already flagged number. If you decide it‚Äôs not a flagged number, it give you the option to unblock. The best feature in my opinion is the community input. If you report a number, it takes note of this and then the next time someone reports it, it will show how many community members have already flagged the number. You are able to the same with text messages. Also, it creates a contact list labeled SPAM with all the fraudulent already verified number."
20,bythebay10,"May 24, 2018",1,Sketchy privacy policy! Ironic given the nature of the app. Truecaller is actually an Indian company or at least they funnel your data through an Indian she'll company if you are a non EU user. I'm guessing this let's them do sketchier things with the data they collect when you install this app like your contact info and the people in your phone book etc. Their privacy policy also says they will use your contact info to send you targeted advertisements etc. Kind of ironic given this app is supposed to help protect your privacy and reduce spam calls. Just goes to show you never know what you're getting until you read the rules. Surprised apple allows this on the app store. Cue: defensive response from developer in 3..2..1..
21,my last try at a nickname,"July 3, 2018",1,"Uhm, fail. Worked great in the beginning. Unfortunately the last 10 spam calls were not identified as the call comes through. After each update, the blicking function has to be turned in again in iOS. Why? Just got 2 calls, from same spam number, but only the number is shown - no spam info. So I checked - turned on under phone settings. Copied number, swiped right to widget - zero info except 'Tap here to get started' (or something like that). Opened App, pasted number in search field and oh my, over 1500 reports of spam in the exact same number, yet it failed to display this when the call came through...? And yes, the app database was up to date!"
22,JOüòÅü§ë,"August 15, 2018",5,Really happy about it Truecaller has relieved me from all the scam callers that call repeatedly. I have got scam after scam call for years. But with Truecaller I can finally stop getting repeated calls from the same person. If I wish to know if someone is a scam caller I can type their number in too. Usually it will say scam caller and tell you want they want. I would highly recommend it. It is affordable and gets better constantly.
23,Dmgabriel214,"October 13, 2018",3,"Good... when it works:  INCONSISTENT Used to work consistently, but does not any longer.  I update database regularly, have software turned on to screen, yet the spam/scam calls keep getting through.  I immediate check the app w/the copy/paste feature, and number is already in the system listed as ‚Äúscammer.‚Äù  Why is the software not catching these calls as they come in?!  WHY AM I TAKING UP STORAGE SPACE WITH THIS APP IF ITS NOT WORKING?!?!"
24,Gud Spelher,"December 19, 2018",1,"No Free Version Don‚Äôt bother to download this unless you want a subscription. There are no free features to use and you can only try the app after giving them your credit card info. Most of the other available apps have a free service and offer a premium upgrade at a cost but I‚Äôm not paying before I‚Äôve tried the service at all especially not 100 a year for the discounted service. This app should say that it‚Äôs a subscription service in the description because it‚Äôs deceptive that it is a free download that has nothing free in it. Also, I don‚Äôt trust anyone who forces third party billing, apps should be charged through the App Store and I should not have to enter my cc into an app. Shady."
25,Teckmarkram,"January 8, 2019",2,"Makes Default Phone App Lag Warns when the Red Cross calls about blood drives. Does not block spam calls from local (hijacked) numbers. Ad-supported. Must access your contact list. Not sure what they do with your contacts. Truecaller puts a huge database of Spam numbers into a couple of contacts which make the phone app lag horribly whenever you have a recent call or voicemail from any of those numbers. The contacts app also lags when you try to view the contact Truecaller generates. This app is supposed to make your life better. IMO, it is worse than not having spam filters at all."
26,Lainey L.,"January 19, 2019",1,"Still having to block spam/scammers While Truecaller will identify a caller as spam IF you put it into their app it does nothing for the ten plus illegitimate calls I receive daily. Nor does it block spam messages, which I get frequently, though by no means as often as calls. Also, reporting/plugging the number into the app and blocking there does not actually BLOCK the calls. Truecaller has proven to be like all the other so called apps that block scammers. ‚ÄúPlug the number in and we‚Äôll block it...‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll identify scammers and block them...‚Äù so far a big pile of steaming BULLSPIT (you all know what I‚Äôm really saying.) Not only does it not work but I get notifications all the time telling me to support them by upgrading to premium. So glad I didn‚Äôt."
27,Edgy01,"May 7, 2019",1,"Worthless, Scammer Themselves Listed as a free application, but upon digging further you discover that‚Äôs untrue.  It‚Äôs absolutely worthless.  Hasn‚Äôt done a thing about intercepting and labeling robocalls.  The basic premise of their system is flawed.  It counts upon building a database (to share) of all numbers that are telemarketing numbers.  YOU GUYS ARE LATE TO THE PARTY.  The scammers are merely blocking calls with Call Blocker and then displaying a number of their choice that may or may not be active.  There are clearly nearly an infinite number of these numbers.  One time my girlfriend got called by HER OWN NUMBER as they attempted to get her to answer her phone.  TRU CALLER doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîbut they‚Äôll charge you a couple hundred bucks a year for what should be a free service by your provider."
28,Leonphoto,"December 18, 2019",1,Has yet to block one single call I receive 3-4 robocalls a day from different numbers and thought I would give this app a chance. I've now had it for a few months and can say it has failed to block ANY of these calls. I thought it would block at least a few of them but nope. So far every single spam call I receive still comes through with no problems. I report every single one but because they spoof different numbers they just keep on coming! I'm just happy I didn't pay for the app since it appears they rely on us to report these issues for them instead of them proactively blocking the spoofed calls.
29,Caratsoup,"December 9, 2019",3,Good but could be better I‚Äôve had Truecaller for over a year as a recommendation from my sister. I recommended it to my daughters and neighbors. It seems to block a few spam (2 or3) callers each day however plenty get through. My phone rings alllll day. Also my phone rings several times before Truecaller identifies a call as spam. Numbers I look up have NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED! Just the carrier which is nothing. Why can‚Äôt all number be identified and why do we have to PAY for better spam blocking when calls still get through .
30,BrokenSoul262,"January 18, 2018",1,"Absolutely Useless tl;dr Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Bite the bullet and get NoMoRobo, you really get what you pay for. "
31,WT ‚ÄòTuro,"May 10, 2018",2,"Better Than Nothing; Leaves A Lot to be Desired Works irregularly, and if I‚Äôm getting what I know is a Spam call but one that‚Äôs not in the True Caller database, I‚Äôm unable to submit the number to True Caller‚Äôs database though it‚Äôs obvious spam. Frustrating!"
32,DboV,"June 12, 2018",2,Recent version loses features and usefulness I was thrilled with this app when I first downloaded couple years ago. Now it doesn‚Äôt auto load the number that just called or I copied as it used to. I literally have checked over 30 numbers with no results at all. It has also become very difficult to tag a spammer. A very useful app has become a waste of space on my phone as I get 3 to 4 spam calls a day and this app no longer recognizes any of them where before it would identify at least 75% of them previously.
33,Froze me ‚õÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è,"June 13, 2018",4,"üòè This app used to be good. Before when you copy number to search, it will automatically ask you to paste and search it. After some kind of update on the app this feature has stopped working and you will have to copy and paste then search manually. In addition they won‚Äôt find the name for the number you searching for like they do before. It‚Äôs kind of annoying. I wish they bring back the old version."
34,acadiel,"June 27, 2018",3,"Used to be better; some features taken out Used to be better six months ago, seemed to catch calls pretty well.  Now, it barely catches anything.  Definitely not paying for pro now if it doesn‚Äôt work, plus the below issues:"
35,d687531,"October 11, 2018",1,"Can‚Äôt be uninstalled? I installed this app, then uninstalled it after a couple months because it is incapable of stopping callers with spoofed caller ID numbers (which is 99% of spam calls anymore). BUT truecaller is still screening my calls, even though I‚Äôve uninstalled it! I know this because I actually got a call from a legit telemarketer today with a non-spoofed caller ID and the red truecaller screen came up. I checked in Settings and the App Store and there is no indication that truecaller is still installed or that it has permission to screen my calls. But it is anyway. I guess I may have to reset my phone to get rid of this thing."
36,Jep6363,"January 8, 2019",1,"Beware: You may lose voice mails I used this app for a few months.  During that time, I had a number of people tell me they called, left voice mail messages which I never received. I deleted the app, but messages continued to be lost. I Googled ‚Äúyou call voice mail‚Äù and found an article of the company‚Äôs webpage stating that deleting the app was not enough to stop voice mail from going to their service. However, I was never notified I had voice mail. You need to take an additional four or five more steps to completely delete your account. I felt this was dishonest, and the app felt like a scam to me. I suggest you avoid."
37,Barriles,"January 17, 2019",1,"I wish it worked.... Ive had Trucaller for a year.  I get two or three spam calls a day, usually robos. Only 10 percent are ‚Äòblocked‚Äô - that is my display shows it as a spam call.  Another 20 percent are allowed through but when i search the number in Trucaller it shows as spam (red), but I was NOT alerted when the call came in. Another 30 percent of the calls are found in the database as being reported but there is no alert, no indication of it being spam.  The rest are new to Trucaller.  One last complaint - Trucaller allows numbers to come through with no alert that I have already reported and ‚Äòblocked‚Äô. !"
38,JPNYC81,"September 17, 2019",1,Have Premium --- Disapointment I used to recommend Truecaller all the time.
39,cccccccsssdd,"December 3, 2019",1,"Garbage product, non-paid version does not work This product really is garbage and a waste of your time to install..... the numbers I search are never found. There are so many useful products of this type available, and many of those work great. This developer has really missed the mark, product should not offer a free version if it does nothing to prevent/identify spam. They do offer a paid version, starting at $2.99 per month, which I did not try in light of the fact that they first wasted much of time with the free (useless) version. I wish them luck!"
40,PinkZebraLady,"January 5, 2018",4,"Only lacking 1 thing... For the most part, I love this app... but there is 1 thing I wish they would fix. I don‚Äôt often have a number that I need to look up, but when I do some of them have no information (mostly on cell phone numbers). Hopefully this gets fixed... soon... because the last unknown cell I answered turned out not to be a customer, but a very... strange individual."
41,PhelineCat,"April 27, 2018",5,"Run it in the background all always I don't have any problems with this but some of the complaints sound like what my partner had when his settings weren't giving the app enough access. He was getting red ""spam"" labeled calls; I was getting nothing. I  didn't know anything was happening until I looked through custom labeled calls."
42,Sharma1,"May 22, 2018",3,Useful but can be better in so many ways Cannot mark an incoming call as spam unless its already there in their system. When you get a spam robo call and you copy and paste it all you get is analyze your contacts screen. Please have a way to mark or enter spam calls manually. The system scans your contacts if you give it permission and lets the whole world know about name of your contact when that number is searched by anyone.
43,Bad Actor Get Your Grove On!,"September 8, 2018",1,Are you responsible for the increase in spam I‚Äôm receiving? I installed this application two weeks ago just to see what it was about. After looking at the features for a few minutes I uninstalled it. Now I‚Äôm receiving all kinds of spam messages something I‚Äôve never had a problem with before. Did you sell my number? Do you spam app installers so they subscribe to your product?  Yesterday I received a text from someone that included a suggestive picture of a woman. Never have I received spam like this before. Now I‚Äôm wondering if you have something to do with it!
44,Tech search,"November 29, 2018",4,"Good & helpful, but... If you have a phone number in your phone contacts & you want to know the owner of it, it will not gives you the right information, it picks the data of your phone only, this should be modified so I can see the other names of the number I'm searching for, one more thing, it‚Äôs tilting too much nowadays, very slow & can‚Äôt type the numbers normally"
45,Gamer6151,"February 13, 2019",3,"Too many problems The app is great for the most part. 8/10 times it will give you the name for whatever number you search and identifies spam. However, the app itself has severe problems. It does not connect. It has been saying problem with connection for a week now. While there isn‚Äôt an issue with the connection but the app instead. It is frustrating that you can‚Äôt search because the app itself has issues."
46,gypsyink,"February 14, 2019",1,Going downhill Update: I‚Äôm done and deleting the app. It hasn‚Äôt identified a call as spam in weeks and yet when I share the number with the app it‚Äôs labeled spam or ‚Äúhealth insurance scam‚Äù or something similar. This app is no different than just blocking each number on your phone after they come in. Do not be suckered by the high reviews. They‚Äôre fake or old. 
47,Raptor Dave,"February 18, 2019",5,Ease of use and efficiency Truecaller has definitely given me my sanity back. I only use it as a free service so I‚Äôm not really taking advantage of everything they have to offer but it‚Äôs working fantastically. I‚Äôm really enjoying the ability to enter a phone number and find out what it is to report it or save it and that‚Äôs just so easy to do so I think them very much
48,Avin Li,"September 16, 2019",1,Not delivering its promise I‚Äôve had this app months now for awhile it was working but ever since the past updates the promise of blocking of spam/scam calls has been broken. Calls getting through has drop none to weekly to daily now. Whats even worse the calls getting through are sometimes the ones I‚Äôve blocked and others base in data so my trust on this app is very close to non existent so unfortunately I can‚Äôt say I recommend this app in fact I feel this app is a scam to forcefully buy premium and telling how the maker of this app really fill the gap of rich/pay and poor/freedom.
49,ShawnLe,"November 19, 2019",4,"Works well I have used this app for many years and been fairly satisfied with it except for one thing. I been retired for longer than I had the privilege of using this app and suspect with many users especially those of us who had to retire early for medical or similar reasons there is no way we can afford the subscription fees for this. Thankfully, we can use this to some degree for free. I hope this does not end or"
50,mbowdy,"November 11, 2017",1,Scammer‚Äôs App What calls come through regardless when you use this app. This is a scam now people that have been trying to track me down now have my address and phone number. And block calls now come through even though they say SPAM on them and they are blocked on my Apple phone. Don‚Äôt use this app it‚Äôs a rip off and I set up to steal your information. Now all of a sudden all creditors have my number and are still able to get through my phone.
51,USAR Ch,"August 4, 2018",3,Update diminished service The July 30 update diminished the service. Received two calls not marked as spam yet they each had over 50 spam reports after I typed in the number.  It used to know the number that just came in when I went to true call right after.  Now I can't copy and paste have to type in number.  I had been recommending it but until it gets back to where it was I won't.
52,Sbhusky4,"August 29, 2018",3,As of recent hasn‚Äôt been blocking So far so good when I first downloaded this 5 months ago but in the last month it hasn‚Äôt updated the list of blocked calls and again I‚Äôm starting to get random calls. Maybe there are scam callers out there who are smart enough to get through your flag signatures. Please please update the block list again it was going well until recently where it was no longer blocking spam and scam callers.
53,Grandmom1,"September 14, 2018",5,I already have over 300 (blocked by myself) scamner calls over the past couple of years. calls I followed directions to set up the app on calls and texts. Six scam calls still came through untouched by TrueCaller yesterday and five scam calls  today untouched by TrueCaller. I deleted the app in less than 24 hours of use.
54,sshunteroantiquity,"November 26, 2018",5,Works..... Works well to a point. Most of the time I end up copying the number and Truecaller does a great search. Then I google who that company/ person is then decide whether or not it‚Äôs spam. I‚Äôm using the free app.... so.... can‚Äôt ask for much more. It does block known spam numbers and will block and report numbers you add. So.... I‚Äôd download this app for free again!
55,Tattooed_Video_Boy,"November 26, 2018",5,"Used to be great I‚Äôve had this app for a long time now and it used to be a great way to see who was calling, but in the past year or so the developers seem to be more interested in turning this into a social media and advertising app than actually making it do what it is supposed to.  Shame, because it was such a great app before."
56,Noelly56,"December 5, 2018",3,"Helpful, sort of I‚Äôm beginning to think this app loses performance as you use it and decline to update to the paid version. There are many numbers that my AT&T spam identification app. Initially, most of the numbers who called me were identified by Truecaller. Now, 1 in 5 are appropriately identified. More and more requests to start paying for an ‚Äòimproved‚Äô service, less and less effective in identifying the bad guys. I‚Äôd be inclined to pay them the extra if not for this. :("
57,Ms. SpringLilly,"April 14, 2020",3,"Inconsistent I had a difficult time trying to rate this app. I guess it deserves a 2.5. I wonder if the premium edition gets rid of the bugs.   Somehow all the numbers I get called by are mobile phone and in order to find out any other information, you have to pay to get a full report. During the past 18 months, I have had the app, it ID‚Äôd one number as spam and it turned out to be one of my doctors offices!"
58,Cherlicity,"March 12, 2020",2,"Not impressed I got Truecaller a few years ago and when I first got it, it was awesome. I could plug in an unknown number and it would tell me who it belonged to most of the time. Now, the numbers are always unknown and just give me the cellphone carrier or tell me if the number has been reported as spam. It does not do what it used to do and I find the app rather worthless to me these days. I still get spam calls so it doesn‚Äôt block them all - and it never tells me anymore who the unknown numbers belong to."
59,TheLadyBaker,"November 15, 2019",1,Waste of money Downloaded on iPhone XR and could not get the spam phone numbers to load meanwhile getting bombarded by Robo callers I reached out to customer support and Shawn took 9 days to respond to me. I had followed his instructions but still no luck. I reached out to him again as I had prepaid the year and was told you have 3 days to cancel after purchase. Are you for real??? I thought when I bought this app it was installed and working but when calls kept on coming in I reached out. Truecaller took 9days to respond on first email. Not a reputable company to deal with

As soon as I did this, I start getting more spam calls. I was literally entering spam calls into Trucaller as multiple spam calls were coming in.

76,GainsyGirl,"May 22, 2019",3,"Works some of the time So tired of being asked to upgrade to premium when the standard app only blocks some spam some of the time.

Unfortunately, the spammers seem to have found a way around the app."
77,Aelin Baker,"August 5, 2019",1,"Blocked calls from my university and not actual spam I really gave this app a try but instead of blocking the spam calls that continuously torture me every day, it blocked essential calls from my university. It detected that none of the actual spam calls that I was receiving were, in fact, telemarketers. The only phone numbers that were listed as spam were those of my admissions office and login verification for the university‚Äôs website. I would not recommend this app. Save yourself the time."
78,Themusicman08,"August 3, 2019",1,Not impressed with the professional version I‚Äôm not impressed with the professional version of this application after subscribing to get rid of the ads. I still see that if the switch is turned on you have to turn the switch back off to update the database. I thought that when you bought the subscription that your database would automatically update? I guess not. So what do we do at this point. Still accessibility needs to be looked at and worked on.

82,The Jacemeister,"February 22, 2018",3,"Catches some spammers, falsely identifies legitimate callers While it‚Äôs accuracy is controlled by the accuracy of the people reporting to it, the app meagerly delivers.

However, I have yet to find a spammer call me from the same number twice. So it has done nothing for me unfortunately."

1460,pigGulp,"October 20, 2015",5,"Interesting Information I had some unknown numbers on my phone. The first one was an answering machine. The second was a number that said not accepting calls at this time. I looked it up and got a name which led me to the we and another number and address a few blocks from me. I called the number and got voicemail. When I began explaining the situation, the caller  got onto the phone and asked me what was this about. He was very suspicious and I did more searching to find he's a security guard. This is all to strange. I've had a lot of suspicious activity around my home recently and it makes me wonder with 3 unknown calls today, if I need to research more. At least this gave me a heads up of suspicious activity coming my way from my neighborhood. The coincidences are too obvious to just turn a blind eye to them. Kinda makes a person feel paranoid. I hate that feeling.  Thanks to this app, I have some grounds to the recent activity around my home that may link this caller to the event."
1461,JD7509,"May 2, 2016",1,"Worst app ever! I would not even give this app one star, but obviously I have to. This is by far the worst app I have ever installed. I thought it would do some good but all it does is attract spammers to call your phone so the stupid app can tell you that it's a spammer. The day I installed it, within minutes I had already received a spammer. A another one called not even 5 min later, 3 minutes, 2 minutes and so on. Always unknown numbers.  This repeated itself for at least 15 times in less than 2 hours. Well enough of this, I deleted it. It's funny  how 4 days went by and I have not received one spam call since. I really did not get a whole lot before I installed it. Maybe one or two a week. I just thought I would try it out, worst mistake ever. I will never install another spam caller app on my phone again. I just will simply not answer like I normally do. However if a spam call becomes frequent, I will infact answer, give them a piece of my mind and tell them I don't give a crap of what they want or are trying to sell me. I am not falling for their scam and hang up. No one should have to deal with these scammers and I would hope no one falls for their trick. At the same time, this app needs to be perminently removed from the app store. I like how you can block numbers that show up, however, I don't like how you can not block unknowns. There should be a way where they can not block their number and if they try to, the call simply will not go through. Thank you."
1462,alantingle,"June 7, 2017",5,"App has too many problems, no indication of spam caller when they call, no background Spam updates This app needs a lot of improvements. When a known spammer calls, there is no indication that it is a spammer during the call. To be safe, you let all calls roll over to voicemail, unless you recognize the number. When you go to look up the number, you find that the call was a indeed a spammer, with multiple incidents. Also, there is no or infrequent background updates to the Spam Id list. Every time"

I have been using TRUECALLER since then best on the market can always count on this app to block the spam callers. As for having to verify your own phone number this is for security to yourself, why we'll lets see with so many apps that allow you to make calls with anyone's number it makes sure it's your phone and your number, I've seen ally of reviews of customers stating that this is what is stopping them from using it, seriously of that's all your worry? Then stop because FYI your number is listed on the internet cell phone, landline etc. Use the app and do research before making accusations of being afraid to verify your own number because with one click you can be found online, even if your on a DNC. ***** Bravo TRUECALLER for service provided."
1472,King of gps,"January 6, 2016",4,"Amazing app This app is great.  It could be ultimate, but it only has one flaw.  It uses human technology as the basis to protect against a sometimes automated ""robo-call"". I paid about $15 or so to protect my landline using a tele-zapper, which can still be found on auction sites.  If true caller would incorporate that technology into their cellular app, I can easily envision myself paying $1 per year for that option.  Just like 911 needs .95 a month to operate, a tax of 8 cents a month to fund the elimination of spam callers would definitely make sense.....(let me cut & paste to app help so someone might read this and MAKE BANK!!)"
1473,barbkev,"February 5, 2016",4,"Good app, but hard to keep up with ever-changing spammers This app mainly adds known (reported by users) spammer numbers to your address book, so when you get a call from a known spammer, you see a big red ""spammer"" caller ID picture. It also provides a very easy way to check numbers and report spammers/scammers. "
1474,TekManiac,"March 24, 2016",5,"Does what it says First, the people who have stated that it does not block phone calls are correct.  Apple does not allow access to the phone to that degree.  So how can this help you, you may ask?  It is easy, go  into contacts, find ‚ÄúIdentified as Spam‚Äù and edit the settings for that contact.  Set the vibrate to none and then you will have to find a ring tone that is silent.  They are all over the internet, DO NOT PAY FOR ONE.  You can look to find how easy it is to make a Ringtone using iTunes and then set the silent ringtone to the contact Identified as Spam.  Now when a number calls you that is listed in TrueCaller, it won‚Äôt ring or vibrate.  You will only know they called when you are looking at your call history or notifications.  This is a great app."
1475,Mo1225,"April 14, 2016",1,"More spam calls then ever I've had the app about a month or 2 and I've actually gotten more spam calls then ever! I get about 2-3 spam calls per day now all from different phone numbers. Before installing the app I rarely had spam calls. Yes the app has a list of a few hundred known spam phone numbers, which it adds as 1 contact in your phone book and blocks that contact, but I think it might cause the millions of unidentified numbers to get ahold of your phone number to call you. "
1476,BEWARE BUYERS!,"May 27, 2016",5,It really works!! Installed this app only a week ago. Had been receiving minimum of 6-8 calls every single day. It's only been a week of me reporting (super easily) each phone call and Ive now noticed I'm not getting any soliciting calls!
1477,Laschmelala,"September 2, 2016",3,"How to use TrueCaller I deleted this app before the 7.0 upgrade due to privacy concerns with the dialer function, but I'm downloading it again. Why? It actually does filter out spam callers. But you have to do a little work on your end to make it do that. The way you make truecaller effective is to scroll allllllll the way down to the ""Identified As Spam"" contact it loads into your contacts and tap ""Block This Caller"". That's using your iPhone's built in call blocker AND truecaller's spam database together. It's cumbersome, especially since you have to manually update the Spam ID list within the truecaller app (annoying), but in the months since I deleted the app the calls have increased, I suspect because I haven't been updating that blocked caller list. I'll see if fiddling with the settings in app will alleviate my privacy concerns. Probably better than nothing."
1478,BigRalphN,"October 6, 2016",1,"A waste.  We should all be refunded. As others have stated you look it up and it says that 300 people reported it as spam yet it doesn't block the call or warn you. One person stated that Apple does not allow call blockers. Then why are they selling this. You can do just as much by using Apples block contact feature. Amazingly though that feature does not work on the identified as spam contact made with this app. The call, if in your database, just lights up red when it rings. And why doesn't it add to the identified as spam list automatically each day?  If I have to add it manually by sharing it with Truecaller first, then what is the point of the app?  The potential is there but the implementation is poor. If that is all Apple allows then it should not be in the market. At the very least it should not be a paid service. I am considering reporting this to the better business bureau to see what they have to say"
1479,Bubbuh Jones,"March 24, 2017",5,The best $0.99 I ever spent Filters a TON of spam calls.  The only ones it has trouble with are the callers who spam your local number.  You do need to update it very frequently to get the current spam list because it changes so much not because of them.  Improve your life $0.99 right now.  Either that or believe you are a Nigerian prince with $1 billion in a Swiss bank account who needs to refinance their mortgage after a free vacation and consolidating their credit cards to save money on enhancement medicine and mail order prescriptions and give money to the fake police/sick kid/religious/etc find after you pay the massive tax debt you didn't know you had with the help of Microsoft technical support.
1480,Debrina005,"December 13, 2012",5,"Best app! The best app for blocking phone number. The first time I used it, it didn't work. But finally I figure out how to make it works. After you add the number on the ""call filter"" or the blocked list, tap the number and choose ""read more"". It will tell you the location of the spammer. Choose ""spam"" and the app will block this person. If this doesn't work then go to the ""search"", put the phone number again and tap ""search"". This also will give you the spammer's location. Then choose ""spam"" and this app will block this person. It will take a while to do this but trust me it works. Hope it helps :)"
1481,Rteal,"December 24, 2012",4,"Nice app You don't really need this app if all you want to do is silence unwanted callers while leaving your ringer on. You can create a contact, say ""Blocked,"" and then add spam callers to this contact. You can then turn off the ring for this contact in your phone settings (iPhone). The phone still lights up when a spammer is calling you, but if you need to leave the ringer on for important calls and don't want to be bothered with spam, this is a solution. It's sad that it's so easy to get away with spamming numbers on the DNC list."

Came across this website (and then got the app) and was amazed to finally find a resource for finding out the name associated with a phone number that was quick, easy, accurate, and FREE! I don't use the spam blocker function so I've had no issues. I didn't mind putting in my number because I have no need to be anonymous when I call someone. For my needs, this app (and the website) are the best."

I know they got my address from the Orange County Probate file, ad I am the PR of her estate. Now the phone calls, with no ID have started. I used TrueCaller to ID the callers, id them as SPAM since a little bit of reading would have told the Jerks the house could not be sold until my sister also passes, therefore I copied the info and paced it on my FB page with a Public Audience and a description of the cursing at me when I told the Jerk to leave me alone and remove my name snd address from his list. I will continue to use TrueCaller to ID and warn others of the Jerks."
1484,ScooterB1964,"September 6, 2016",5,used to be a good resource This used to be a good resource for looking up unrecognized numbers before I decided to block them.

I saw someone ranting about how horrible it is -  I had to make sure to go into my settings and allow the app to access my calls to filter them as they came in..... and that's been wonderful. Most of my spam calls are caught by this app and then I can block them.  There are some that do get through without a warning.  I will copy and search that phone number in tru callers database and add it if necessary ."
1486,Noir Amnesiac,"February 22, 2017",5,"Wonderful, helpful app! This app is truly a lifesaver. It does exactly what it says it will do in a very simple, straight forward way. Most apps that have in-app purchases are pretty handicapped and constantly bug you to purchase the full package. This one is fully functional, doesn't constantly harass you and doesn't seem to be spying on you. That is exactly why I want to eventually become a ""full subscriber"". I wish more apps did this. When I see the in-app purchase thing, I automatically assume it pretty much has minimal functionality and will just spam me. "
1487,Supercalafradglistic,"February 23, 2017",5,Used to work good but now it doesn't This app when I first downloaded it it worked very well in blocking a bunch of fake pharmaceutical callers from India using American phone numbers from New York to California. I Have been running this for over a year. Now it seems that it doesn't really block anything and the update download takes forever where it used to just take a few seconds. It's very cumbersome to copy the numbers and then go search for it to find out that it is indeed the same pharmaceutical outfit based in India. Had I reviewed this when I first got it I would've given it five stars however now I'm giving it one because it no longer functions correctly.
1488,thenexte,"April 14, 2017",1,"Beware: Personal information might become public I initially bought into the hype that this app would be able to help you screen spam calls.

1489,WASHeidi19,"July 6, 2017",5,"True caller review I have used true caller since a friend recommended it.  For the most part I am very happy with it. You have to update all the time, but not a problem, doesn't take much time. I even have used it to look up landline fishy numbers & ones that appear to be robo-calls.  I don't like the fact that it wants permission to use my contact list, but it gives me an option & it is totally up to me.  If people are in my contacts, their names come up automatically, true caller does not need access nor will they get access to my contacts list.    Other then that, they have earned 5 stars in my book. Thanks for this free service true caller."
1490,Imjustyouraveragestoner,"March 5, 2015",5,Wow... So I downloaded this app not thinking too much of it because every single one that I've used so far it will only show some numbers the rest it will just say cellular but this one actually shows ones that have already been reported just if it's not listed it'll tell you that it's most likely spam and you can block contact straight from the app and it will pop up on your phone if it is a sales call I would recommend this app if you get a lot of sales calls or wrong numbers all in all I'm pretty impressed but please mind the grammar errors I'm using talk to text

Building a database is a very long and tedious adventure, especially when setting out to target A CERTAIN GROUP OR GROUPS OF CALLERS. We hopefully are all using the ""True Caller"" for the same reasons, to put an end to the annoying callers that leave no message, or trying to sell you the world, and blah,blah,blah.

1492,Deems19,"March 23, 2015",5,A Complete Surprise. I expected very little from this app. I had tried many similar apps prior to using Truecaller and they were all complete disappointments. But to my surprise Truecaller is extremely good. It just works. It is very simple and easy to use and it isn't cluttered with unnecessary  features that only help to annoy you. I have nothing bad to say about this app and recommend it to anyone looking for a good caller ID app with the ability to lookup phone numbers and get detailed information about the owner of whatever number you look up. Truecaller deserves a strong 5 Stars.
1493,Mrs Hartwell,"April 23, 2015",5,"Installed on iPhone 6 plus works great I had this app when I had my iPhone 4G and it found almost 200 numbers that were spam.

1494,Dave_Golliher,"June 20, 2015",5,"IAP done right. Other developers need to take note. Truecaller allows you to gain IAP using offer walls / watching advertisement videos.

Than they said I would have to create a 2nd iTunes Account to get a 2nd subscription - unacceptable. When I purchased the subscription, it didn't note that it only covered one phone; in fact, it should cover all phones under the one ITunes account.

My complaint, and if fixed will get 5 stars, is that EVERY time the list is updated it resets the custom ring & text tone I have set back to the defaults. So I am not bothered by the unwanted calls, for the True Caller contact, I have turned off the vibration for both the ringer & texts and I have set the text tone to none & have added a special ""silent"" ring tone which plays 10 seconds of silence. After every update I have to change these again from the default. It's not a deal breaker but it is annoying."

Now: Still get just as many, report, report, they all are known on Truecaller. It has done nothing to block them. I have had one red screen come up telling me the call was spam, but it didn't block it. So far this app is pointless, unless you want to quickly do the reverse lookup and be sure it's a spam call, which I can figure out myself. Will give it a few more days to step up and work.

I'm a busy man I don't have time to waste on phone calls that waste my time but then again if I don't recognize the number I usually don't answer it but everyone that I've received that I don't know has turned out to be spam great app if you don't have it you might as well throw your phone in the ocean or be bothered with the constant barrage of spam phone calls because there's a lot of evil people in the world ""true caller"" wants to help you identify them just get the app it's free!!!"
1510,Bill(USA),"September 8, 2013",1,"Scam The app belligerently and consistently asks you, via fast & furious pop-ups, for your personal contact info, bribing you! The idea is for the developer to build up their database (little black book) which has about 9 people recorded, no doubt. "

I Believe with a little bit of work this app can be the next big thing to ever hit the app store. Sure it asks for some information, but remember, this is a caller Id app, meaning it helps identify who is calling you, so it needs you number to go into the database."

I recently broke my phone, so that led me to switching over to one that doesn't have anyone's number saved. Oh no! How will I know which calls to avoid and which to answer? Surely, out of my hundred + contacts the three people I actually talk to would be affronted if I ignored them, too. This app is wonderful in that I can now block every person I don't feel like talking to with confidence that it's the right number :) crisis averted. Thanks, TrueCaller."
1513,Blackhawk99,"October 28, 2015",5,"Works great and getting better! I don't like answering the phone unless I know who it is. With this app I can almost always find out...I say almost because I have had a few numbers that the app couldn't pull up, but the database is always growing so that's good! One thing though, it would be nice if the app could automatically pull up the number without having to put it manually. I usually forget the number half way through putting it in... Anyway, keep up the good work!"
1514,tattoohead,"November 7, 2015",5,"Awesome App Keeps me from getting a lot of spam calls. I can add to the list too instead of making my block caller list on my iPhone a million miles long. I've had the same number for about 10 years now. In that amount of time, there's no way to keep it out of the hands of people trying to sell you everything under the sun. This app keeps me ahead of them and puts them on the spam list before I get the chance to block them. Very useful."
1515,xiape,"January 4, 2016",4,"Good App, Wish It Were Free! I like this app much better than the free MrNumber! I spent over an hour deleting labels from my contacts app after discovering that MrNumber has added HUNDREDS of labels I didn't even know we're there, and this was all AFTER I'd deleted the app from my phone. This app still looks up numbers for you, & you can still find spam. There are ads, but I still wish it were free, hence the four stars rather than five. It would be nice if they'd block calls, but apparently that has something to do with Apple & iPhone."

I then said, Maybe it's because the number doesn't exist but then I searched a number that's in my contacts and it again said no name found. This is really annoying and I would love to be a faithful truecaller user but I can't do that because of this recent update. Please fix!!!"
1517,Giasb,"August 23, 2016",1,"I feel used. I get a lot of spam calls and have been diligently reporting the numbers to the app database for perhaps a year. But I always wondered: why didn't app stop these calls? And how many spam calls is the app really preventing from reaching me? Does the phone simply block those calls without ringing? Then about two days ago, I received a call which made my screen bright red; the caller was identified as spam; this was the first and only such call I have received with a red screen warning. Question answered! One identified spammer in a year! Yet in return, the app has all of my contacts in a data base. So unless I am clueless--and my gifted IQ suggests otherwise--I suspect this app is at best almost useless and at worst violating my privacy."
1518,Loving the quiet,"January 23, 2017",5,This app has really been great I think I took over a phone number from either a small business or just a very popular person so I was getting a lot of unwanted calls. I was also getting spam calls as well which made it hard to differentiate between innocent callers just looking for the wrong person and someone trying to sell me something. With a little effort this app has greatly reduced the unwanted calls. Thank you so much!
1519,HawkEye2015,"July 11, 2017",1,"What happens when a number is reported? I get that blocking a number keeps it from calling me, and likely shares it with the rest of the TrueCaller community. But do any of these numbers get reported to the providers to stop them? For example, I had a spam caller seem to come from a local insurance provider. I happened to call them when I looked it up on your system and noticed it was for my farmers insurance agent. They were unaware that there number was being used for SPAM, so how does a misuse the number get taken care of? It seems that if you're providing this wonderful service, that you guys should be double checking in making sure that the phone companies are alerted to the fact that their numbers are being Misused."

1523,IrishOak,"October 4, 2016",1,Use to be useful Well previous version use to tell you that a call was scam or spam when you received the call if the caller had been recognized previously by anyone using trucaller. Now it doesn't. You don't know the call is spam or scam until you look up the call after receiving it. It seems to use it best you just don't answer your calls then you check to see if you should or shouldn't have answered. It would make more sense to let you know when the call is coming in. This way you could catch maybe an important call with a number unfamiliar to you. Also I don't think the Pro version is actually worth it. Save your money. Trucaller you have work to do.

Not only does the app never update on its on you have to go into the app then click update to update the list of spam callers. Not only that it still let's spam calls through without identifying it as spam. I've got the app fully integrated into my iPhone 7+ it seems all my calls as a matter of fact when I copy a number then go into try caller it asks if I want to search this number. It searches identifies it as spam but never identifies the number while it's actually calling. Good idea poor execution on this app.

But you can look up the number after answering the call and find out that 700 people reported it to True Caller as spam. Useless!  This was the whole reason for installing this app. My frequency of spam calls has increased since installing this app. Worse than useless!  The online forums indicate that no anti-spam calling app is going to work during the call because Apple restricts app access to the phone and contacts. This app is a big piece of false advertising, and is likely selling your phone number. Avoid like the plague."

Not only that simply deleting the app won't fix the problem (account must be deacivated, located in the ""about"" section - at least I HOPE this solves it).  Stay away, this is not an honest setup"

1567,BostonFrank,"November 17, 2016",2,Buggy and inconsistent The app worked for a couple of days and then suddenly stopped identifying callers. The problem is that the app works by keeping a list of known bad numbers and that list is not dynamic. Since spammers constantly change their numbers it's easy to outsmart the app. Furthermore the widget often fails to identify the number so you always have to go to the app and then often it knows the number is bad but it should have identified the number in the caller screen! It seems there are no good apps yet in this field.

1573,PhillyFever648,"March 15, 2016",5,"I highly recommend this app. This app is essential to any phone. There are thousands and thousands of scam artists calling on store shelf phones, buying minutes, calling innocent people to steal their money. Trucaller is you first line of defense. It tells you right away if it's a scam call. You can also add new ones. It has saved me many times already. I highly recommend it."
1574,SS Daddio,"August 25, 2016",3,"Just Okay The ap DOES identify spam calls, but that is all. It doesn't block them, in fact, it essentially disables the call blocking on my iPhone. True Caller just turns the screen red and identifies the call as spam. Numbers are added to a single Contact in your phone book, but the calls still come through. And, you have to manually update the list, which is sort of stupid. The ap should at leSt have the option to completely block calls."

The truly nefarious players could care less about DNC, and the number of prosecutions under it was paltry at best. With TruCaller to offenders may get through once, but only once. Once identified you can block them and report them to keep them from annoying you and notifying your fellow TC app users of the bad players."

1577,HelloitsDerek,"March 7, 2017",2,"It works well, but drains battery This app works well and blocked all spam calls. The trade off is a decrease of 25% battery loss in the course of 8 hours. I'm used to going to bed at say 90% battery, waking up and it's at 88%. With this app I'd wake up and it'd be at say 75%. Woah!!! I had felt like I was charging my phone more often and after I deleted this app everything was fine again. It's really disappointing because this app does block spam calls very well. But since I only get a few every week a decrease in battery is not worth it to me."

1580,electro481,"January 2, 2013",1,"Does not work!! If you have an Iphone just use Google to seach numbers and use the do not disturb feture to block unwanted calls. I tried searching for several numbers I knew and it did not find them, but Google did. I tried blocking my own work number while I had the do not disturb turned on my iphone and it allowed the call to come through. I deleted the app and tried calling my iphone again from my work phone while I had the do not disturb turned on and it forced my call right to voicemail without ringing. Do not purchase this app, do not waste your time."

When I get strange Numbers it can immediately gives me a pretty accurate account of the location of the call and ways to find out who the number belongs too! Protects me from spam calls and most recently prank calls from numbers claiming that you missed jury duty and could be in trouble. I found this call not humorous in the least bit and tru caller verified that the number was a hoax. The app is awesome!!
1582,Kccccccccc1991,"September 23, 2014",1,"Spam Not only did the app not work, but it also spammed my phone. It added a contact to my phone called ""identified spam callers."" This would then add 1,000s of random numbers to my contact list a day. Even after I deleted the app, it still continued to add numbers to this list. I didn't realize this was happening until going through my contact list. My phone was running sooo slow because the numbers it was saving to my contact list took up so much space. Luckily, I was able to resolve the issue. "

1584,BlazeIrish9,"July 17, 2015",5,True Caller is great so far! True caller has found and identified every number I have entered into the search window!  There are services that you can pay for such as spam labeling and creating a list of numbers to block!  It does ask for access to your contacts which I don't allow!   Over all it does what it says!
1585,p'eed off,"October 3, 2015",5,Great app for identifying spamming I really like this so for identifying spam calls. At first I found it a little clunky to use but now you can copy numbers from your recent call to find out who a number is. That feature made all the difference for me.

Get rid of the frills from the last 2 or 3 updates it seem to work great then. I not sure if Apples update is stepping on the app or what.

I love it that it's ad free and fast! The daily spam updates help too - especially since they're quick and I decide when to update. Definitely better than the others I've tried.
1593,aaustin6253,"November 14, 2015",5,"Terrific!!! This app identifies callers and also identifies spam callers and maintains a block caller list on your phone for spammers.

1596,Doug in Seattle,"June 16, 2016",4,Quick way to stop annoying calls Keep app running and rarely need to pick up a call to find its Windows or the IRS or any other kind of spam/scam call.  Find a number that slipped by? Just search it and report it.  As an added benefit it creates an Identified as Spam contact with the numbers. I set a unique ringtone for that contact of silent with no vibration so I'm never bothered by these calls again.

1599,Felix Jo,"April 20, 2017",1,"Not useful Just like everyone has been saying, it doesn't automatically blocked the spam calls for you, so you need to manually add it to the block list, which defeat the whole purpose of having this app. It also don't recognize the spam call most of the time, even though sometimes the number is actually already exists in their database."

1606,Salliesmart,"April 19, 2017",1,"This app is garbage After I installed it, the number of spam calls I received tripled and it doesn't block any calls. I became suspicious by the unprecedented number of spam calls I started receiving, so much so that I dreaded every time my phone rang. Now I believe other reviews that this app just wants to harvest (and probably sell) your information. Do yourself a favour and don't download this app and don't give it access to your contacts. I'm doubful that merely deleting it would erase your information. Anyone giving this app more than 2 stars is a fake."

1608,j3nnuhh,"July 7, 2017",5,Awesome. Catches about 98% of the spam calls. It's wondering. Wish I didn't HAVE to use the app though. The amount of calls I get is insane. I think the do not call list is actually the call list. There was one time were I updated the app and after I looked at my recent calls it updated the names of a few to spam. Pretty cool!

1611,Norcalsteve22,"November 19, 2015",4,Works! I have had this for a few months now. I think it is working... Because I had to uninstall it to see if it can fix a glitch.

Please fix the issue and I will rate five stars!
1612,Tiptoe Turtle,"December 24, 2015",2,"Good idea bad on Apple! I love the idea behind what truecaller is trying to accomplish. Since I have a iPhone device truecaller doesn't live up to it's full potential. Maybe Apple/iPhone will wise up one day and get with the program instead of being part of the problem. Apple has a billion dollar deal with bot/spam callers, so their given free reign on all iPhone devices that no app can prevent or stop.

However, after it blocked all these numbers and fit it into one contact, it broke my phone app. I wasn't able to load voicemail if any of the blocked numbers had left a voicemail, and opening the spam contact would crash the app. If there was a fix for this, I'd reinstall the app, but for now I'm better off blocking the number myself."

Anytime that I go into my settings it freezes the phone and I have to power it off and reboot.  Once I uninstall the app the settings function works again.

I know that the number calling me is spam and I ignore it but why not just automatically block it so I don't have to look at my phone. FTC already does a bad job about being on the do not call list. Your working pretty much like they are. Not sure why I have kept this app running if there is no point of it doing its intended purpose
1628,DJCwells,"March 21, 2017",1,"Does not work I have made sure to update the spam list daily. Updated it this morning and sure enough received a call that true caller did not identify as spam.

I got a call today, my caller ID from True Caller said spam but yet my phone is ringing!!! This app works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't, take your chances with it."
1629,Former poynt fan,"March 28, 2017",1,Not impressed Have had it running for 5 days now and not one single spam call was blocked or even notified that it might be. Have had 13 calls that were spam and came right through so looking for a better app and deleting this one. The other major problem is that legitimate numbers show as spam because the app relies on users to identify spam. Your bank or credit card company is probably listed as spam. My healthcare insurer comes up as spam because some doofus reported them that way.
1630,Possible this is spam,"December 17, 2012",1,"Don't dl Don't dl I think this is spam this app randomly added a ton of contacts associated with the name true called and would have notes saying do not deleteDoes not work at all. Even after I removed the app, kept finding contacts labeled as ""true caller"" that I never personally entered. When I would open the contact it would say ""do-not-delete"" and have at least 20/30 numbers listed under the contact. I deleted the app and these random numbers days ago and they keep showing up again. Bad app...I think it's spam"

I installed and downloaded all the spam contacts, but when I get a new robo call it is not blocked or even identified as spam. This is even for numbers that have already been marked as spam by 200+ other True Caller users. Perhaps it's user error or a problem with my settings, but this does not help with my spam calls."
1635,Panax KC,"January 28, 2016",5,Great App It works 80% most times and I guess it's a good level of performance for any app. I'm disappointed and surprised when it fails to identify a number cos I feel that most definitely someone has stored a name for that number on their smart phone so why does true caller not get it? Anyway overall the app is great.
1636,mmt2095,"March 1, 2016",1,"N.O. I downloaded the app in hopes it'll help me identify and block any callers that I did not recognize. It amazes me how much more ""spam"" callers and unknown numbers I was receiving a week. I was like, ""Wow! This app tells me where/who this is coming from and I can block them."" Then it occurred to me that I WAS receiving an unusual number of random numbers. And that it could possibly be from the app itself. I then deleted the app and I kid you not, the amount of ""spam"" & random callers have dropped. Not sure if it's just a coincidence but either way, it's no longer on my phone."
1637,Lj7788,"April 6, 2016",4,"Works well This app seems to work pretty good. Now I don't have to look up an unknown number on the Internet to see who it belongs to and the iPhone would sometimes fail to id a number that was already in my contacts, this app takes care of that.

Why would I want a spam # to ring my phone for this app to just place a banner across the screen indicating its being blocked but u still have an option to accept or decline? If u allow the call to come through, then what are u really blocking? Nothing! Deleting this useless app!"
1641,Mister_Tog,"December 19, 2012",1,Important: Read this before installing This app apparently does not actually block anything. It just gives you a note saying that the call is from a spammer.

1642,Steve Talacki,"July 22, 2013",1,Tried it and immediately deleted it I had a couple of simple missed calls from today. I installed the app and did a simple search on these numbers and it came up with zero information.

I could enter a number and most of the time it would show a spam score or at least say it appeared to be spam.

1647,joshea123,"October 26, 2016",1,"Good concept but doesn't work I've been trying to use this app for several months. It has only successfully identified one spam call.

In theory, this should have been flagged as spam when I was called. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work."

1649,K Capelli,"April 21, 2017",1,"Since IOS update, app is worthless! As others have mentioned, you now have to constantly turn the app on in settings, for some reason, it keeps being turned off. Another huge problem I've noticed today, every time I try to ""share my contact"" with Truecaller, I get a pop up notification saying my connection has been lost. It's not my internet connection nor my phone's internet so the problem is with this app. Unless they fix this asap, I'm deleting this piece of junk."
1650,Tru caller user,"February 6, 2013",3,"Spam Blocker! I do like this app for the most part because it has blocked all the spammers I added to my list such as the education callers and the job career callers. But one thing I didn't like was the fact that, out of curiosity, I entered my own number in the system to see if it would bring up my name and it brought up someone whom I'd never even heard of. Weird. But as far as doing what I need it to do it has worked!"
1651,levrontom,"October 5, 2015",4,Great app - minor improvements I'd like it if the spam numbers that get saved into my phone will be better organized somehow or categorized.

I love that it keeps the spams up to date. I couldn't live without it. This also lets me block calls from people I don't wish to speak to.
1656,Hteb52,"November 18, 2016",1,"Crashed my phone app The latest update has caused numerous problems on my 6s plus. First, I cannot even get to the screen under settings/ call blocking because it's completely frozen and crashes. Then, after the first spam call came in post update, my phone app is totally dead. I can't get to my missed calls, vmail, or even open the phone app at all to dial a number. Yes there are workarounds for all this but buyer beware this app will kill your phone.  If you know a fix for these, please post!!"

1658,Kim P.,"June 17, 2017",2,Very disappointed This app simply doesn't work. It doesn't update automatically and so it doesn't identify any spammers. I don't think it's ever identified a single one. I seem to get a several spam calls a week and none were identified. So now I just don't answer my phone unless I recognize the number calling. Typically a spammer won't leave a voicemail and this seems to be working for me. I had such high hopes for this app but sadly it's no good and I've deleted it.
1659,Ladyjluck,"August 19, 2017",5,"Very good app I usually don't answer calls that I don't know. However, when expecting important calls regarding my husband's meds or calls from a doctor's office, I have to answer. Sometimes a call from the doctor is placed from a number I don't have listed. I love this app."
1660,its_lexxi,"April 13, 2015",5,Amazing!!! It really does work. I received a random call from someone that wasn't in my contacts today and I didn't know who it was so I cross referenced it with this and it totally works. It had said person's name on it and now I know who called me. It's also really simple to set up an account (which I love).
1661,Honest game player,"September 18, 2015",5,Great app that screens phone calls I have had this app now for about six months and I absolutely love it. It allows me to screen unwanted phone calls at the tip of my fingers for not only myself phone but also for my home phone since I keep myself on always on.
1662,scoolins,"February 18, 2016",5,"Tries Hard to Keep Up This app is great in trying to keep up with the ever increasing bombardment of spammers.

1663,Tony Gaeta,"May 31, 2016",1,"Made phone unresponsive After using the app for awhile, it stores hundreds to thousands of numbers to the contact Identified As Spam. Cool, but sooner or later, opening up your phone app will cause the phone to freeze. Soft resets, hard resets, even uninstalling the app didn't work. I had to download a third party contacts  app to delete the Identified As Spam contact. Only that restored my phone to working condition. This is a nasty bug. That, plus the 100 million accounts that are currently vulnerable, I give this app 1 star."

After a month using it. During the week days. I'm getting More Spam calls each day. Every time I update they store All the updated Spam numbers on my phone in a identity they created. So I know have Tons of Spam numbers being stored on my cell phone. WOW ...

1668,Travis716,"November 28, 2016",1,Useful as a wet towel This app does absolutely nothing as far as I can tell. I get a call. I suspect it's spam so I don't answer. I check it out on this app and it says over 400 users have reported the number... So why didn't it tell me this when my phone was ringing? There are plenty of web sites that I can go to to find out the number is spam after the call. Why do I need this app talking up storage on my phone? I asked the developers this and they don't know either! Just weird. I've deleted it.
1669,Larry.Ray,"June 12, 2017",2,Buggy TrueCaller keeps telling me that it is not turned on. When I go to Settings>Phone>Call Blocking I usually get a list of blocked phone numbers that is locked up. I never get back to the button where one actually turns on the app. Usually have to force quit my iPhone to get it accessible again in Settings and lately it just repeats what I described above. Very very frustrating. Please fix. (iPhone 6s). As far as I know it's still turned Off.

In order to find your labels, you have to go through their 50+ labels .  So even when you get fed up with your phone ringing from 'blocked' numbers and delete the app, you still have to search for all the stuff Trucaller added and delete it, wasting even more of your time.  I've deleted them twice already."

1678,Kayakscott3,"September 1, 2016",1,"Very Poorly designed! This app is actually counterproductive. It doesn't block nuisance calls despite being able to identify them!  And it actually makes it harder to block them manually by intercepting the calls so that you cannot simply use the ""block this caller"" feature of the contact list to permanently dispense with a particular spammer. Yet it could be fixed so easily by simply adding the ability to do all that for you. It's hard to comprehend why the developers are so pitifully myopic!"

Pretty disappointing."

I've deleted and reloaded but still spam calls come through. I search the numbers and true caller indicates they are already in their database as spam. Why do I need an app to tell me a number is spam when I just took the spam call. I need it to block the call or at least silent my ringer. I have to manually add numbers to my block list which I can do without the app.
1682,Xze0n,"January 10, 2016",5,"Awesomely Excellent App...... For avoiding those pesky and irritating call centers that want to offer you services you already have and are happy with.

I uninstalled the app and I am still getting calls identified as spam with no way to block or delete the numbers in my iPhone.  I feel like I'm being held hostage by this app!

1685,Teacherosb,"November 4, 2016",3,Good concept- not for me This is a decent app for blocking those annoying calls. It needs to always run in the background to work.

I did that and they never responded. Ill be deleting this app soon. Please fix the bug or something. THis app has so much potential."

1688,Redkinglover,"June 3, 2017",1,"Disappointed after install I came to this app after a feature in NYT. However, it doesn't do its job. Sure, it identifies the caller as a spammer but it does absolutely nothing to 1) block the call and keep  the phone from ringing, 2) log the caller as a spammer in the block list, or 3) prevent similar callers from pestering you.  You give up a lot of your data (and that of your loved ones) for no purposeful gain. Be sure to deactivate the account first, then delete the app.  Bummed this was not more helpful."

I think the majority of these reviews are from the people who made this app. This app will not block your unwanted numbers it will just notify when they call saying this number is protected blah blah. Basically, if you save a unwanted number and save it your contact as ""avoid"" is the equivalent of this app. Also, you can't use this app unless that save all your contacts in the their database, which is true aim of this app. They want your contacts information, please don't download this worthless app!!"

1692,Melanar71,"July 24, 2015",5,Works! Identifies the account holder of the phone number 95% of the time. Place of origin 100% of the time. I like the fact that if I copy a number and then open this app it automatically reads the clipboard and asks if I want to search the number

1695,FrankTatoz,"June 11, 2016",5,Must have app This is one of those apps that every phone should have by default from the factory. I even think this sorta app should not be allowed to be uninstalled or disabled.  It is literally an app that every mobile phone user would support and actively use.
1696,Travelnow,"July 12, 2016",1,"Henry Sorry to report that this app is useless. It does block numbers, but you can do that already yourself. If you are inundated with these phone calls, you know they create fake numbers, so it does no good to block them. In the last couple of hours I've gotten 5 or 6 calls from the same company but from different numbers. I get them from abroad, even one had my own phone number as the caller. So I regret to advise to not get this app, it will not solve you problem."

1714,Jacquestcomc,"November 19, 2016",1,"Should be called liecaller This app lacks any features that it advertises and then breaks some that you already have. Instead of a caller ID coming up, the app broke the ability to see who was calling from my contacts, therefore breaking my call announcement. As well when I did look someone up, because it failed in the first place, the information was either bogus, outdated, or not even there. Then on top of that it did not block the spammers whatsoever like it promised."

1721,CaityQD,"February 28, 2013",2,"Let Down There's nothing about this app that is helpful. It's just as easy for me to do a search online of the phone number and find out who's calling. I wanted something to block calls, my opinion of a blocked call is not having to hear it ring or even know it came through until I check a call log. This app simply let the call ring and ring and just changed the caller Id to protected by true caller."

1727,1yruser,"June 8, 2016",1,Leaves files behind / intrudes on calls Truecaller was impossible to uninstall.  The app left a large database on my phone and mis-identified callers as spam even after uninstalling.  I studied their uninstall rules and did all according to their instructions to no avail.  True caller did not respond to several requests for help.  It is truly creepy to have this uninstalled app trace my calls and identify legitimate businesses as spammers.  I took my phone back to factory settings to get rid if Truecaller intrusions on my privacy.
1728,juhgail,"March 29, 2017",2,Used to be great The update has now added those crappy adds. But you can remove them for a price.  It wasn't that way before.

It filters 1 out of every 15 calls I waste my time copying and pasting numbers in to the app only to have it tell me that it's already a reported spam phone number. If it's already in your database as a reported spam number then why isn't my screen turning red identifying the call as such so I can ignore it? I understand some interaction with the app to report spam. But to date, everything I've pasted in has already had 100s of prior reports. Deleting the app."
1730,Mdmayank,"June 28, 2013",5,Awesome app It helps in locating our friends who stay very far away from us. It's a reliable source & actually we get the number of the person whom we are looking for. I recommend it to everyone. Use this app & never miss talking to your loved ones.
1731,Borgpyro,"April 3, 2014",5,Great applicationüëç I have been using truecaller for almost 3 years and haven't had any problems. It tells me when a known spam # is calling as I'm getting the call. What more can you ask for? Not to mention the reverse phone lookup feature.
1732,Arielzzz,"October 7, 2014",1,"BEWARE !!! Don't download I never had spam on my cellphone, the day I download this app, suddenly I started getting at least 3 spam calls a day trying."
1733,Eskimofoot,"September 22, 2015",5,Great app I had this app with my last iPhone but ran out of space and had to delete it. :( I have it back at last! I have been randomly getting a bunch of spam calls.. And it's good to know if it's spam or if it's someone calling me about a job. Love this app.
1734,PJCI Guitar,"April 26, 2016",4,Works Great I was getting spam calls sometimes five and six each day. My manual solution was putting them in a contact labeled SPAM so I could ignore them when they came in. A friend suggested this app and it works like a charm. It could use some improvements but it's far better than the manual method I was using.
1735,mdms1019,"October 1, 2016",5,Great App with solid privacy options I love this app not just because it works well but it gives you the option to share your whole contact list. Some of their competitors don't. They just take that info. Great Work True Caller! I'm a happy user.
1736,Pixie Wizard,"January 5, 2017",4,"Only One Thing Could Make It Better The only thing that would make this app better would be the ability to prevent the call from ringing through. If the call were terminated before (or even after) the first ring, I would be ever so grateful for a quiet resistance to spammers!"
1737,Parse01,"March 20, 2017",5,Love this APP I rarely get any unsolicited phone calls. On the 2 occasions that I did get a telemarketer I added third number and never received another call from them. 
1738,peeweejo,"May 18, 2017",5,Appreciate Truecaller I appreciate Truecaller actively letting me know who is calling me. I know they have my best interest in mind when they have updates often. I am relieved when I have the knowledge to block someone who has no need to contact me. Thank you for secure service!
1739,willbellislepio,"August 1, 2017",1,"Nothing secure about it. TrueCaller accesses all your contacts names, numbers, emails, device info, location, inbound and outbound call logs with times and durations, all SMS messages, allows itself to record audio, view wifi info, download stuff without notification, read calendar events plus associated confidential info. Even worse they store some of this data in their own database which they then sell to marketing agencies so you can ultimately get more calls."
1740,AL_Cracker,"September 26, 2013",1,Beware-Unable to leave neg 5 stars Every once in awhile an app makes it past Apples test standards. An app developed by the developer in order to gain access to information the user would never release to anyone for any reason. An app that makes every effort to trick users. An app that does not do as it says it will but released with slick sales copy to entice app users into downloading.  An app that if it has any favorable review that review was written by the developer and their friends. This is one of those apps. Beware!
1741,Abe.kho,"March 24, 2015",5,"It works It worked fine for me, now all unwanted calls have been block. All you need is just a little setting adjustment and tada.. Calls block and you can find who was calling and thier location. Thank you developer."

I downloaded this app because someone recommended it to me and just like the previous reviewer said this app actually CAUSES MORE SPAM CALLS! After downloading this app my phone is constantly ringing with spam calls. Before this app I maybe got one or two calls A MONTH now I'm getting anywhere from 2-5 calls A DAY! this app is a piece of crap DON'T INSTALL IT.

1745,Mary yourfarts,"August 24, 2016",1,"Lack of auto-updates lets too many callers in It works, rarely.  It's a cloud system, relying on user-submitted reports to identify numbers as spammers. There are two fundamental flaws with this. "

Sometimes I'll get a call that's spam and it's already identified as spam in the app but the call comes through anyway. Other than that, it's much quicker than searching the number through a search engine."

1748,Rocky7077,"January 6, 2017",5,Great service I really appreciate this app. Recently i have been receiving a lot of spam calls and this app really helps a lot to identify the identity. I have stopped picking up unknown numbers and I check via this app to make sure its a spam or not.

1750,Sibioun,"July 10, 2015",5,Great! It has actually shown a red screen on my iPhone when a known spammer is trying to call me allowing me not to answer. I don't answer numbers I don't know anyway. This app hasn't identified every single spammer but that's ok because spammers numbers change
1751,Whizzkid5050,"August 26, 2015",5,Needs to work better on the iPhone. It's a great app. But it needs be improved for the iPhone so you can know the caller while the call is still coming in. Not to copy and paste the on the app later to find out who called.
1752,Fid0did0,"November 20, 2015",5,Works good I just really hope that it can work instantly during the call to provide me with all the information about the caller without me having to open the app and search for it. That will be perfect.
1753,candiem28,"November 22, 2015",5,Great for my work I'm a real estate agent and get a lot of inbound calls from unknown callers. I use the app to clarify their names after they leave a voicemail. Half the time you can't understand people messages or guess at the spelling of their names so this is a huge help.
1754,-=doubleM=-,"May 10, 2016",5,Amazing This is the best anti-spam thing that have been ever made! It's like add-blocker on a computer but just for spam calls. I did not got a single spam call since i start using it and this is already 2 months. 
1755,Maguid,"May 17, 2016",5,"Great service This is a very good app which complements the iPhones blocking feature. I don't answer unfamiliar telephone numbers. If they don't leave a message or sometimes leaves a message or just hang up, I block them and report it to Truecaller. It's all very simple."
1756,DerekJohnny,"August 20, 2016",5,Really good app!! This really helps when you need help. Just when you thought you've seen it all you haven't! This app helps and tracks down who's calling and where the address is to help you find out who it is. Gave  this 5 stars!!!!
1757,Suzanne99,"September 4, 2016",1,"Doesn't identify spam calls - what's the point?? This app is completely useless.  I thought it was supposed to identify when an incoming call is from a spammer, but it doesn't.  It happily lets the spam calls come right through, then AFTERWARD you can look up the number in the Truecaller database to see if others have reported it as spam.  What is the purpose of that?  I want an app that tells me WHILE THE PHONE IS RINGING that it's a spammer so I know not to answer.  Don't waste your time on this one."
1758,Mcdaniels00,"January 11, 2017",5,Need help I don't know what's wrong but it's not working right for me. It doesn't spam out details of callers to my phone only if it's advertising numbers I wants to know how I can fix this and have all unknown numbers shows details
1759,Amer @arzleb,"July 14, 2017",5,A trusted sidekick Always good to have this app at least for search mode. Reliable and an excellent helper when needed. The continuous updates and improvements make you know that the team behind this app are taking users for granted.
1760,emad1900,"December 9, 2012",4,"Emad from KSA Despite the fact that this app doesn't block unwanted numbers, it seems a good tool to identify approximately 90% or maybe more of unknown numbers compared with other apps that have same function. I did compare it with some other apps. The best results i've got were by using this app."
1761,Stylishly sexy,"April 15, 2015",5,"Pleasant Change This app does a lot more than all those other ones, where they just have a spinning circle that looks like it's searching but always ends up asking u for $ before it can give u results."

1763,Trini3902,"April 23, 2016",4,Better with new version TrueCaller has improved on this new version giving more info to unknown numbers and appears to process information more quickly.  I give it four stars because compared to the competition it is at the top of its list.
1764,John-Apple,"May 7, 2016",1,Comcast is listed as a spammer Seriously! I know some people don‚Äôt like their cable provider but listing them as spam is crazy. Does anyone at the publisher verify what people submit? Just because somebody hates Comcast is no reason for them to be quarantined as spam on my phone. I‚Äôve deleted the app and urge others to think seriously about how unreliable and potentially dangerous this kind of unmoderated crowd-sourcing is. I do not work for Comcast or any of their affiliated companies or business partners.
1765,WarrenCut,"June 16, 2016",3,"The iPhone version needs a lot of work I cant really blame truecaller for this, but the iPhone version lacks a lot of the best functionality of this app, like the ability to identify spam as its ringing, or using the app as the default dialer. Like many things, Apple likes to have total control over stuff like dialing, so we are stuck with a half-useful app. Oh well."
1766,Liveinlavender,"August 29, 2016",4,"Came back for this app twice Tried other blocking apps but this one does its job. Always working hard to identify spam. The other spam app needs you to choose every ""unwanted number"" while this one lets you know other ppl get spam from them too."
1767,ChiragM,"January 9, 2017",5,Very useful app It shows me the spam numbers and also able to look for unknown numbers. Very helpful to avoid spammers and credit card and other marketing calls.
1768,Jediken56,"January 25, 2017",5,Great app This app is a very great app. It helps you identify spammers quickly and I like the fact that it updates regularly. My best feature about the app is that it identifies the name of the contact call on whether creditors or loan agents or whatever it is just gives name
1769,be things,"April 14, 2017",2,"Doesn't work automatically Doesn't block the calls and only sometimes gives the caller ID. Most of the time you have to go manually search the call in the app and it will correctly identify the spam call, but then you still have to use iPhone's built in call blocker. It's all too manual and inconvenient. Eventually I just stop bothering with the app and do it myself."
1770,Shelly301984,"September 16, 2014",5,Great app I don't get all kinds of 800 numbers calling me anymore and it does work because I wanted more room on my phone so I deleted it and once I did my phone was going crazy with all the unwanted calls from 800 numbers. So it is a great app!
1771,Ronlap,"September 9, 2015",4,"It seems to work :-) Although I would like background updating, this app seems to do what it says it is supposed to do - note which telephone numbers are spam and then pop them up on your smart phone screen so that you don't answer and waste your time."
1772,SarahGwenn,"October 2, 2015",5,"Super Helpful! This app is awesome, it ensures all the spam in the area is marked as so in my phone! It's great when I get a phone call of a number that I've never seen before, I just plug it in and it almost ALWAYS gives me the name of the person calling. Incredible!"
1773,DGoodrow,"January 17, 2016",2,"Hell No!!!!! Yes this app does what it says BUT, it will load you call inbox with thousands of numbers that it has blocked and it is a serious pain to delete all of them because it also blocks spam numbers in text messages and their will be thousands of numbers locked in messages which can only be deleted one at a time! If it wasn't for that this app would be great!"
1774,Leeman 505,"April 1, 2016",5,Lee Druktenis I do believe this application must be the most important and relevant example of the technological advancement the human race has accomplished in the twenty-first century thus far.

1776,IHeart Radio Junky,"July 18, 2016",5,True Caller is a great app! When I first started this app to help identify spam and other unknown callers I was skeptical due to the learning curve.  Once I figured out how it works I'm still learning but I am happy with it. It has halted a lot of spam callers for me and it's great for identifying unknown callers.
1777,Tamat420,"December 16, 2016",4,Not Bad but Not Perfect!!! Very nice app works as it says for the most part but there's alot of numbers that they just really don't give any info.

1782,Thevitaminme,"June 27, 2014",1,Really bad app! I'm not sure where all of these positive reviews are coming from but this app is not good at all. Not once has it correctly identified the person calling. Also the search to find people is very confusing and very poorly created. The worst thing is I've received so many spam calls since I've downloaded this app. I unlisted from the server and I still get the calls. This is very annoying. Don't download this! It is not worth it.
1783,A.j.Levine,"March 30, 2015",5,Great app This app really does the job before I can pick up the phone and see if it is a spam caller- tru caller already identified it for me and I don't even have to deal with interrupting my busy day at work to find out of somebody's trying to hassle me

IT HAS NEVER STOPPED ANY OF THEM."
1820,biohazardred,"January 26, 2013",5,Awesome Blocks calls when I put the number in. It searches numbers and even gives me the option to see where it came from on a map! And I haven't gotten any txts from my blocked numbers.
1821,Why-Z,"June 29, 2013",5,Very handy The application is very useful and handy .. You know all these numbers that calls you everyday and helps to stop answering the annoying people who calls from different numbers
1822,summernora,"December 30, 2014",5,"Update I have used true caller on my Samsung whenever someone calls Instantly it shows the callers ID ,but on the ipohne it shows the number if I need to know the name of the caller I have to copy his/her number to the app which wastes a lot of time üò¢üòí"
1823,RenaultE,"November 5, 2015",5,Wonderful easy to use App Wonderful easy to use APP that works beautifully. A must have APP especially for all those annoying SPAM phone calls. Very accurate identification of calls. 
1824,Selrachotuxne,"January 8, 2016",5,"Impressive The underlying mechanics are sound and well thought through.  It's an app that will improve as it grows in popularity and their database of spammers grows.  It's not now nor ever will be perfect, however it's good enough that I'm willing to spend the time writing this."
1825,WadeFL,"July 20, 2016",2,"Needs Automatic Updates Works pretty well, but it needs automatic updates instead of having to manually update the known spam numbers every couple of days. Known spam numbers are put into a contact called ""Identified as Spam."" I have that contact blocked, but I still get some calls that come through with ""Identified as Spam."" But overall it does help."
1826,Lynn 100,"September 23, 2016",2,"Just OK FIRST I get a spam call, then I have to write down the number . Then I have to copy that number in the search screen to have the app search. Finally I find that 300 others have reported it as well! Really!! Then why am I going through all those steps? If you know it's spam then hang up on them already!! That's what I want. Hopefully the next update will be easier!!"
1827,Daniel Vox,"October 26, 2016",3,Half Works I have an iPhone 7 Plus. I can't get the new feature for iOS 10 call kit to work where you enable call blocking via phone settings. It just doesn't show as an option to enable. I've deleted the app and reinstalled force quit the app and powered down my phone. Just doesn't show up. - Oh well.
1828,Cbobc,"January 9, 2017",4,Good But Not Perfect...! Identifies spammers most but not all of the time.  Thus 4 stars. But a good step in the right direction. 
1829,Smackie the Frog,"January 23, 2017",1,"Hit & miss App keeps changing. Used to automatically add numbers I blocked to a spam list. Now, I have to add them myself. Used to be able to ""search the web"" for a phone number but now it opens Google to ""spam"" or whatever appears with the number (if anything--usually something nonsensical). Numbers on my spam list don't necessarily stop ringing. It's all frustratingly barely effective. On the lookout for something better designed."
1830,Jul1ana,"December 31, 2012",5,Love it I love this app it works great but maybe they could do something that doesn't allow the number to text you at all so you don't have to receive the text.. Other than that it works great
1831,EmmaGentle,"January 31, 2013",5,Excellent This app does exactly what it's designed to do. Just copy the unwanted caller id and launch the app. The copied number appears automatically and all you do is click on spam. Job Done. No more calls from that number. A+++++
1832,Robbierob02,"June 18, 2016",5,All county funerals and cremation Great app! Let me know if the call was a real number or if it was a telemarketer. Highly recommend getting this app if you receive a ton of spam calls or just simply want to know who is really calling.
1833,Kalea1215,"June 28, 2016",5,"Works great Best part is Spam maybe labeled. I called Comcast and they called back, the number came up spam but it was also labeled Comcast. Since I was expecting the call back, this was soooo helpful. Thank you to all that contribute to the database. :-)"
1834,moopoints,"August 24, 2016",1,"Horrible experience, read this before installing! TrueCaller will clog your contact list. It creates hundreds of contacts for spam phone numbers in order to be able to display them as such if they call you. This led to my phone app not working anymore. My phone app would crash and I was not able to launch it for months until I figured out that TrueCaller was the cause. Do not download this, it's very bad software."
1835,jacobkesler,"November 11, 2016",5,"DOWNLOAD NOW This app is a must have for sure. Now when random numbers call me, it tells me whether I should chance it, or if I can just ignore it and not be scared that I missed something important. Must have, must download, and the widget works GREAT"
1836,TanMalHot,"December 29, 2016",1,App doesn't show caller ID for few calls What kind of app is this with so many restrictions from Apple that it doesn't detect spam callers. Do you expect spanmmers to call me via Truecaller so that iOS is happy to show their names?? App doesn't show caller ID for few calls. I had enabled truecaller privacy settings to show during caller name but it never shows name !!

1838,Dboyes99,"January 19, 2017",3,"A good start This app does a fair job of identifying scams and flagging them before you answer. It doesn't catch all of them, but it is a start. It does not provide access to the entire line number database and the 800 routing info, so it can only filter #s that have been reported to this company."
1839,MrPebius,"May 20, 2017",1,"Scam App 90% of these reviews are clearly fake from a review farm. This app isn't allowed by Apple to actually do what it claims to do so it seems they are actually themselves selling numbers to spammers. It never IDs or blocks any new numbers that call. You search, and up pops dozens of reports of spam, for a given telemarketer, so why doesn't it block them in the first place? The giveaway is that this blocking ability isn't actually shown in the manual/FAQ at all."
1840,Pinkiology,"December 9, 2012",5,"Creative and Genius I just love it! The fact that u will know 90% of who is truly calling u! Plus blocking numbers is just brilliant!

1842,Aquarius0207,"September 25, 2013",4,"Not So User Friendly Great tool but when I tried to check up the numbers I previously blocked, I was unable to find it.

1843,tekhed,"March 20, 2014",1,"Doesn't work / waste of time Poor interface and concept. Gives no relevant information or help in identifying or stopping automated sales calls. BUT - you can ""search for your friends"" and ""ask them to join"" and all the rest of the worthless social media rhetoric. I want to ask my friends to join me? In an app designed to trace and block spam calls? Why on earth would anyone want to do that? Oh, we're friends on True caller?..  Pass."
1844,Armandolio,"December 23, 2015",1,It is not good as it looks I tell him that's for one truecall strangers number and block unwanted call. But it is the case that in the same application you sell an account number to verify that interest you or that you want and you provide the number of the person and that the criminals are taking advantage to know the numbers of people and call for fraud. Well what I want to say is that lobque one believes that good a deal for truecall. It is a deceptive scam ... Desintalada and application.
1845,jlsadb,"May 30, 2016",5,"So far it's great! I don't get annoying ads, not sure of who the suggested contacts are or where they come from, but it gets rid of spammers and I've only had one or two numbers it can't decipher!"
1846,Sepehrpto,"November 29, 2016",1,Doesn't work most of the times I set all the settings and keep my spam database up to date but the app Works very inconsistently. It gets some spammer from time to time but most of the times doesn't catch the spam number. The reason I put 1 star is that when you copy undetected spam number and open true caller app it finds that spammer instantly. I guess the app is broken or unable to get realtime information upon calling
1847,MaesterDudeman,"February 18, 2017",4,"Pretty good, but... Still many of the numbers that the service identifies as spam are not flagged as spam, leaving me guessing."

1856,Lugzzz18,"June 18, 2016",5,True caller It's a good app. Through other reviews I've not seen what others are calling spam Id. On my screen it might be because I'm not getting spam callers on my phone but it does work in manual mode
1857,Drewskie_za,"July 5, 2016",5,How did I live without it It has saved me so much time not having to answer spam calls and even missed calls I can check who it is before I phone back.
1858,Danny020878,"July 25, 2016",1,Doesn't work I got his app because a news broadcast was touting it as such a good app- bs.  It has flagged 3 non spam callers as spam and 11 spam calls made it through just fine.  I will not trust it anymore.  Oh- and it says I live in Canada but I live in NY- so anyone I call who uses this app gets my location wrong.  Also- the discovery option is weird- it lists numbers for my neighbors but has all heir names wrong- the names aren't even people who live here.
1859,"Tall,CoolOne","September 22, 2016",5,"Best Ever. I can't believe how much less of my time and money is spent here, rather than wasting it on those expensive search engines only to find out the same thing TrueCaller could have said for free...and God bless the spam screening!!"
1860,Ladydebs119,"July 28, 2013",4,Unsure?? I like this app and then again I don't. I think may be its because I don't exactly understand how it works. Very few numbers seem to get blocked and I get way to much spam calling me during the day. If I figure it out I will be more than happy to re-write this review.
1861,AMILkita,"July 25, 2014",2,"I don't get it This app is clearly, to me, the definition of unnecessary. Not sure what the app is offering that I don't simply get by googling a number. It data mines your contact book for all that valuable info and then it simply just defers to online searches for feedback on a particular phone number or address... And that's only if it actually finds the address you request. Fail!"
1862,Seabee77,"June 13, 2015",5,Awesome App! Really help to clear up and block a lot of the trash I was getting. even though I am on the do not call list I keep getting a bunch of crap. True call blocks a lot of it once I add the number as spam.

1870,thomas_meh,"September 24, 2012",1,Not Good I like the number look up feature. The app does a lookup to tell you who and where the caller is. The main issue I had with this app was the duplicate phone number entries stored in my contacts list. I have 15 numbers to black list but there were a couple hundred duplicate entries under one contact. It took many page flips before I could delete the contact. Made my phone run slow in the contact book. Not good.

1878,Reydrian,"April 12, 2017",3,Keep having to activate it via settings over and over For some reason the app keeps disabling from within the iOS settings for phone/privacy. I have to keep going back in and re enabling it. I have an iPhone 7 plus running iOS 10.3.1 and latest version of your app
1879,Javier rover,"August 16, 2017",3,Works Much Better Still you don't offer a way to identify the callers and their business. Your categories are way to narrow. As an example I keep getting calls from a car warrantee company for a car I no longer own and I get car that from my dealer when I do get it with cars.
1880,MyTcute78,"July 21, 2015",1,"Waste of memory space Had this for about 6 months and just deleted it. I prefer to save my phone space with apps that work for me.  It never works because it doesn't sync with current calls. Only after you use their search for a number that already called you, can you see if it's spam. Also because it's sort of crowd sourced, some people incorrectly mark legit numbers as spam. No good."
1881,Bubbaspink,"October 18, 2015",5,Great app Works very well and comes in handy. It doesn't identify every single number you throw at it but does better than I was expecting. Highly recommend you try it out if you'd like a caller ID app.

2022,Tammarrra31,"December 21, 2012",4,"I like it, so far. So far so good, entering in the numbers manually is a real pain in the keester though.  There should be an option a list of incoming calls to block without entering manually every number you want to quit harassing you."

2099,pkusmdc,"March 18, 2016",2,"Good Concept, Poor Design The idea is that TrueCaller saves known spammers to a blocked contact. The number of spammers is high, so phones do not block numbers of the contact, and the call sold comes through. They should come up with a better solution.

If you then try and contact app support it says you have to log in to post message but every time you try the screen shuts down in 2 seconds so you can't report problems.
2102,GoHogs1331,"November 25, 2013",5,Great App Love this app for its ability to allow me to block unwanted callers. Anytime the Truecaller pops up I know it's a number I blocked and not to answer. Thanks Truecaller for actually doing what you say you'll do!

2104,LTabron,"November 9, 2015",5,Reverse phone call happy!! This is s great app for identifying unknown phone numbers. There are websites that you can use but none will give the contact name for free. I use this app all of the time.

2108,nmenegay,"September 27, 2016",2,"Why doesn't it block calls from numbers that are already reported as spam? This app is a bit useless.

2109,KK03269,"February 22, 2017",5,Great app to have! I never answer my cell when I don't recognize the number. Truecaller enables me to verify if it is legitimate company or not. Saves time and minutes of my calling plan.

There is literally no purpose for installing this app."

2260,Rajaspsingh,"August 21, 2012",4,"Innovative Ideas This app works on a simple rule it uploads ur complete phonebook the way u hv saved it and makes it available for every user. The more downloads, the more phonebook upload and d more data available."
2261,BelleJJ,"October 15, 2012",1,"The Worst üëéüëé It doesn't block unwanted callers. Callers can still get though. It only highlight as block caller. They can still text and leave you a voice mail message. Don't get this app, if you want to block a call. This app does nothing at all. I'm not sure why the person even create it. It should be free. It's a waste of space. This app needs to be deleted ASAP!"
2262,Ricks fire pics,"December 20, 2012",4,Does what I want :) likey Blocks my calls that I put in the filter. One tiny thing. It would b nice if it new how to fix it so it doesn't ring at all just a notification. It rings 3 times before stopping. But that's not a biggie. Thanks. :)
2263,Jonesnco,"March 22, 2014",1,Unimpressed Tried searching for four different numbers that spam called me over the last two weeks.  Zero hits with the app.  However I can google all three numbers and find dozens of sites listing these numbers as spammers and scammers   Given this I have little faith the app really will do anything but report no findings each time I try to use it.
2264,Joelfan1,"April 7, 2015",5,"Finally found this!! I have been looking for a caller ID/ blocking app that actually works for a year now, finally found this and it works great. Thanks"

2269,Cookkkkieckliker1122,"April 5, 2017",3,"Kinda works The auto call spam identification has never came up even though I went through setup.  The only useful part is the number look up, and figuring out which carrier someone has."
2270,apprater9271047,"June 29, 2015",5,Super awesome at identifying fakes! This is great for finding out if that guy at the bar was really who he said he was or even if that prank caller is really someone you hate. It's so convenient!

2275,Randy12345678910,"April 28, 2016",2,Didn't identify any spam calls I agree with another reviewer that I receive more spam calls after installing this app. The app hasn't identified any spam calls and I receive at least 4 per week from random mobile numbers. I always report them as spam.
2276,Crystal2499,"June 6, 2016",5,"Excellent This app is great. It blocks me from picking up phone calls that are junk calls, so I don't have to listen to the sellers. Saves my time!"
2277,Therealmz,"July 19, 2016",3,"It's ok It finds numbers, there's one from a friend I tried and it comes back to someone else. Could it be the former owner of that number? I suppose but my friend has this number for over ten years. Doesn't block all the spammers it identifies. Need some fixes."
2278,foodie321,"August 17, 2016",1,Useless and misleading The app only lets you search a number after it calls you and mark it as spam. Or you could just block the number like normal....

2284,The Unknown Genie,"May 20, 2015",4,Very useful app. It helps keep the scammers and spammers away. Works well on the iPhone 6. The only downside is that it doesn't identify unknown numbers as the calls are coming in. You have to copy and paste
2285,KillerCram69,"June 8, 2015",5,Killer Wish I could get every bit of information I can. You all provide at least a mama thanks
2286,LadiBugg18,"June 13, 2015",4,Efficient I like how you can just copy and paste the number and if the number doesn't show up you can search the web for it.
2287,Clawdan3,"May 2, 2017",4,"Works pretty well I would like to view reports from other victims, but I'm old and feeble so I may have missed the link. In conjunction with other similar apps, I escape from crazies fairly well."

I have allowed full access to my phone book and call history and yet no results. Probably it's an IOS thing or some issue with my phone/settings. I am tired of getting spam calls."
2289,StayonTask,"August 27, 2017",5,Peace at last Thank you True caller. So easy to use your app  and eliminating those annoying spammers it exactly what I needed. Recommend TrueCaller it works!

2294,Laura Z 13,"July 21, 2016",5,Works great for annoying spam calls Get this app. Works really good. I have had zero issues with the app. Two thumbs UP
2295,Howmanynamescouldtherebe,"October 27, 2016",1,"Broken While I can enable TrueCaller's CallKit capabilities in Settings > Phone, it doesn't do anything. While I can still ""share"" an unidentified caller with the app, and while they are known spammers, it no longer updates the ""SPAM"" entry in my contacts list. Therefore the reported spammer keeps showing up as a phone number. This is effectively broken. Please improve your QA, devs!"
2296,Onzyq,"November 4, 2016",5,Onaiza Good service. But iPhone users need more integrated searching options. For instance showing the name of the person for an unknown incoming call

2307,Lester2915,"November 29, 2015",5,Just what I needed I love this application. Not only does it block spam callers but you can also identify callers who may have blocked numbers.
2308,Annoyed by Telemarketers,"February 22, 2016",5,... Every call you share with TruCaller is a thousand calls blocked for other people.  A number is worth a thousand calls.

I just got one about solar panels and the phone rang. TrueCaller did not block it, but took credit AFTER THE FACT that it identified the call. I need something that is very proactive."
2315,Rambling_Man,"March 10, 2017",5,Great App! Haven't had any problems so far!  Only spam that gets through is when I am late in updating the app.
2316,DBLClick,"April 10, 2017",3,Currently it gets knocked offline I love this app when it's working but lately it doesn't. With iOS 10.4 release Truecaller continues to stop being enabled by the setting phone app.

2318,Gilgamesh4Eva,"June 27, 2017",5,Absolute best app ever There is one app on the App Store you cannot live without and it is Truecaller. Get rid of all those annoying calls instantly.
2319,Cam.246,"July 13, 2017",2,Meh This app is helpful in some ways but I got a call with No Caller ID and I could not track it with the app. It did not have the option for me to share the contact. I think this app should be able to provide No Caller ID calls not just numbers that don't have contact names. :(
2320,JoshioSarker,"February 9, 2016",5,Joshio Just superb. Somebody was disturbing my girlfriend. And I didn't know him. Then my friend told me to use this apps. And after that i found that who was that dumb. And this apps is great. Working so good

2323,marlostarr,"April 7, 2016",4,Good app.. I like it. Works 90% of the time to identify numbers that may not be on my phone book... What more could we ask; it's a lot more than we had previously.
2324,StoneSnoop,"May 20, 2016",2,Can't Update Number This app works decently to give caller ID but doesn't give info for every number. I've changed my phone number and there is no way to update that in the app so that's annoying. It can still use quite a bit of improvement.

2360,waynead,"October 13, 2015",1,Scared to try it The first thing you have to do is give them your phone number- before you can even find out what the app can do. And of course by giving your number you are agreeing to their terms which can include sharing your contacts. All this before you see if it's even a worthwhile app. No thanks. Deleted.

2366,Yogi student,"May 24, 2016",4,"Plus and minus The app asks for a lot of permissions, which some may see as intrusive, however the trade-off is that they do actually identify numbers that may be harassing you."

2387,craigminah,"May 5, 2017",1,"Works ok True caller identifies spammers but I (like others) think the volume of spam to my phone had increased since installation. Additionally, I cannot delete the thousands of phone numbers in my call identification and block list (settings>phone). This is going into the bin and I'm going to restore phone from backup to unfubar my iPhone."
2388,Mark@Boston,"May 11, 2017",1,"Doesn't work!!! This app is completely useless. It doesn't block incoming spam calls, but only has spam caller ID which doesn't always work. I still find myself having to manually block numbers identified by this app as spam."
2389,justinxreese,"May 26, 2017",1,"Made things worse At best, it identified one out of every fifty calls. At worst, they sold my phone number and caused me to get more spam calls. I'm very protective of my number and got truecaller to avoid the 3-4 calls per month I was getting. Since installing truecaller I now get about 3-4/day. It could be coincidence. But I'm very suspicious of Truecaller being the culprit."

2440,Cindy1980,"October 5, 2015",5,Great app Truecaller has found every number since I got it. I would recommend this app to everyone!
2441,kg shizzledawg double Z,"October 29, 2015",1,"Manipulative Scam The minute you register, your phone is spammed by an unknown free offer call.

2442,tinabelina,"December 22, 2015",2,Does Not Play Nice with Daylite THis app's data creates LABELS for each telemarketer -- not contacts -- in Marketcircle's Daylite. So now I have hundreds of labels I have to scroll through. I'm in the process of deleting them but each deletion is a two point and click process-- much like trying to delete pix off Facebook.
2443,elixanchor45,"February 1, 2016",5,Must have you need this if you get calls from unknown numbers
2444,AgileEntrepreneur,"February 3, 2016",4,It works Not sure I like all the labels in my contacts it creates but it is making a decent sized list of spammers and does seem to have a hit whenever I look up a suspicious caller.

I don't my phone to ring for unwanted calls so always used block caller or created a DNC directory with silent ringtone.

2466,JNECyclist,"March 17, 2017",1,Not working well It used to work better but today it is letting a lot of calls through even though it has previously identified those calls as spam. If I have to check every call through TruCaller it is easier to block a received call through my IPhone.

2475,steelheadslayer,"August 4, 2016",1,True caller This app use to be a great app until they changed it. Now they want access to your contacts so that they can have your phone number as well. If you don't agree to it the you can't use the app. So all the numbers I had are now lost now that I had to update the app. Tells me they are controlling. Do not go it !
2476,PodcastGuy22,"August 26, 2016",2,"Rather pointless Yes I know that Apple doesn't allow the access needed to make this app useful.   Which begs the question, why bother writing and publishing an application that's completely ineffective?"

Why would I want to do that when I don't want to talk to them. That just verifies my number is a good number and they can pass or sell that to another bunch of creeps! It should be removed!

2518,AceAvi8r,"January 26, 2017",5,Cell phones identified This app will identify cell phone numbers.  Maybe a little behind if it's a frequently
2519,Usapower01,"January 31, 2017",5,Awesome I like this app. Works great. I use to look up numbers all the time even ones from my home phone.
2520,Soharley,"August 31, 2015",5,Really worked right out of the gate This app worked right out of the gate. It really was fast and is worth the download.
2521,beckybarb79,"September 12, 2015",5,"Great app, especially now that spammers have discovered mt cell phone number. I even use this to check for spammers on my landline."
2522,Tongkadog,"October 9, 2015",5,Unknown caller I get calls every once in a while and today I received 2 literally 15 seconds apart. This app told me who was calling. Love the app.
2523,Dr.zuhyr,"October 26, 2015",5,Damas True caller is the most powerful tool for get information about someone we search him
2524,The One and Only Dgreen,"November 13, 2015",5,Awesome app Found most numbers!! Had a few that it didn't know but still amazing
2525,bresbones,"November 17, 2015",3,Won't let me download the spam list Tried installing it 3 times but continues to give me a connection problem error when trying to download the spam list! Please fix!!
2526,Tsue77,"December 1, 2015",5,"Great I love this app. I have a lot of spammers that call me cell. So, before I answer or call back I check the number first. So I give this app a 5 star"
2527,Salaheddine_Jnr,"January 14, 2016",4,Awesome app Really have nothing more to say abt this app! Although I wish it could tell u the identity of numbers as they call but hopefully it will be soon available in IOS!
2528,Gizmosprocket,"March 8, 2016",1,"Breaks spotlight search. Most of the time it fails to detect spam callers... But worse, in my area it creates a contact called ""Identified as Spam"" with so many phone numbers it causes spotlight search to break."
2529,Raginghardon17,"April 7, 2016",4,Works somewhat Doesn't identify all numbers but does find the majority of them.  Easier than using a search engine.  Worth a shot.
2530,LNG2,"April 18, 2015",5,I like a lot!! Gets the job done quickly and give the option to add to my contacts....or not!!  A real keeper!!
2531,BlindSquirrel72,"April 20, 2015",5,Found #on first try Found a # I didn't have in my address book on the first try
2532,dallfo,"June 12, 2015",5,Great app! Works as advertised. 
2533,Rakicool,"June 16, 2015",5,Awesome.! I like this app. It gives u relief if u r struggling to find out unknown who calls/text. It's quick n easy finding. Thanks to the app developer..!!!
2534,mwangi324,"July 5, 2015",5,True caller It's worth having if you have to tell who is looking for your with a positive intent or just another enemy or spam
2535,Lea's Jams,"July 10, 2015",5,Not bad at all I would say that 80% of the time it has a number for you. I like it. I'll keep it & use it a lot.
2536,Rodenator,"July 27, 2015",5,"So far, so good! If I don't recognize the number I don't answer the phone. TrueCaller helps me determine if it's a call worth returning or not. Much appreciated."
2537,Sunset sandy,"July 29, 2015",5,Very helpful This helps identify the numbers that randomly dial you when your on a do not call list.  Pretty accurately.
2538,Ky boat,"August 10, 2015",5,Simply amazing one of the best apps out there This is one of the best most helpful apps out on the App Store check it out have some fun simply useful
2539,Ga7or87,"August 24, 2015",5,Got the very first one Very accurate and helps screen spam calls
2540,Worldly one,"December 3, 2012",4,"Mr. It does tell me that a spam call is coming in,what I would like to see it do is block it from ever getting to my phone and never ringing. Pleased with this app! By the way I hate Robo calls!!!"
2541,PhilisBrown,"December 30, 2012",1,"Bullüí© I recently bought an iPhone and Sprint granted me a brand new number as well. Ive never once received any spam calls, until I downloaded this app. Ive received a total of one text & one call four days after installation. Im convinced that this app is promoting the spam calls. I only downloaded this app to block annoying people."
2542,jasonpettus,"February 8, 2013",1,"Doesn't actually block calls This app doesn't actually block calls; it merely shows you a warning sign whenever one of the numbers you've flagged is calling, but the call itself goes through like normal. I can't attest to any  of this app's other features, but as a call blocker it is literally worthless."
2543,natashaann11,"February 10, 2013",5,Love this app!! This is such a fantastic app! Being able to control spamming and phone numbers you don't want calling! Love it!
2544,Looney99,"April 8, 2013",5,Awesome Kept on getting spam calls but this finally stopped them.
2545,Sumit80785,"August 30, 2013",5,Superb search I was trying very hard to find someone's number and true caller helped me find him
2546,pendolino,"October 27, 2013",1,"Great concept, weak implementation Yet another brilliant idea that's likely going down the drain because of shoddy execution and privacy concerns. Someone's going to crack this but it's not them. I've deleted the app and never gave them access to my contacts but one this I hopes to find was an open way to search for business listings and I got zero results."
2547,Psychonaut67,"April 26, 2014",4,"Less reliable than it used to be... This app does exactly what it says it does. Done deal. Just not as reliable as it used to be, otherwise I'd give it five stars."
2548,Smurfil47384,"March 20, 2015",5,True caller Lets see how it works i have been getting a lot of spam calls
2549,Tollie Williams,"July 3, 2017",1,"Added ""message"" bloat. Why?! Latest version adds completely unrelated and undesired ability to be able to chat. Developer is trying to abuse the success of TrueCaller to go a different direction, and that's not why we installed it. Developer, if you really want to go down the route of yet another messenger app, make a separate app."
2550,FrogTY,"June 13, 2016",5,Impressive Delivers something 9 times out of 10. A first name at the very least. So far I'm impressed. Worth the download.
2551,Bombaryy,"July 21, 2016",3,Solid Solid app but on iPhone it doesn't tell me who it is while the number calls it only tells me who it is when I copy and paste the number after declining the call
2552,Blessed52,"August 14, 2016",5,So far it works great! Does what it says.  I am glad I found out about it on a news program.
2553,TSamrin,"October 29, 2016",1,"Doesn't work with CallKit I have Truecaller enabled in ""call blocking and identification"". As good as it sounds, the new feature simply doesn't work. I receive a number of spam calls everyday and Truecaller displays nothing on my screen. I have to go back and share the number with Truecaller to identify it as spam every single time."
2554,hdtyi,"December 28, 2016",5,Good application It is a good app that help me identify unknown phone numbers plus it helps me get rid of spam/telemarketers. 
2555,Vanna__M,"January 5, 2017",5,Helped to identify scammers Helped us avoid a debt scam by properly identifying the number. Would definitely recommend
2556,Jay Umar,"March 6, 2017",5,Best Identification I like it because are you tired of people calling you and you don't know who your talking Bamüëç Truecaller helps u know who ur talking to
2557,Rocket Master,"April 18, 2017",1,Worthless App I installed on my iPhone. This app doesn't block calls. To block a call you have to copy the number and paste it into the app so that it recognizes the phone number as spam. For numbers it recognizes as spam it still rings your phone. It's easier to use the built-in iPhone app to block a caller.
2558,Grumpy 2014,"April 29, 2017",5,Spam call This is one of the best apps ever it will tell you who is calling so you don't have to answer
2559,Lookitup,"May 17, 2017",1,"Useless My thought was that this app would identify spam calls and eradicate them before I had to deal with them.  This is not the case, you still receive the call and then manually have to run it through the app.  I basically did this with my own blocked call list."
2560,nournazha,"September 14, 2015",5,"LOVE IT! Works awesome,"
2561,Shawnandmelene,"September 26, 2015",5,Amazing First time I put in a number none of the other search number apps couldn't find...bam!!!! There it was. Awesome app
2562,ODD WHITEBOY,"November 7, 2015",5,AMAZING My phone is jailbroken so I have the tweak WhositPro. It works with true called and makes the app more active. Even unjailbroken this app is amazing. Keep it up developers üôåüèª
2563,Jaycies,"November 8, 2015",5,Awesome app! I love that not only can I find out who the number is but I can also report it as spam if needed!
2564,Anas140,"December 29, 2015",5,"This is really what we want To identify spam callers , or new number , or to look for any one , the design also very good"
2565,LeChef111,"February 9, 2016",4,"No obvious way to correct a false spam alert This is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than this bug, this app is truly a godsend."
2566,Doogie1976,"February 23, 2016",3,I like the features.... Unfortunately there were so many reported SPAM numbers that my contact list froze any calling feature on the iPhone 6s. Use the app but do not save in contacts.
2567,Change of number,"April 7, 2016",4,Works! Recently got new phone & number. With the new number got lots of spam calls. True caller has saved me a lot of time & and aggravation.
2568,Skullkrusher2424,"May 16, 2016",5,Great app! I love this app had some bugs trying to get it to verify my phone number but overall it's good.
2569,iMuzamel,"May 25, 2016",5,It's not working It's stopped working suddenly in-spite I delete it and downloaded it again what's happening
2570,Nicocohayek,"April 24, 2014",1,"Caller ID needs improvement The feature is MUCH needed for iOS, thank you. However, knowing that i have many numbers from different countries, no results are given since it only matches with US numbers. "
2571,dstarnes,"April 17, 2015",1,"Seems to use private database, not public records. When I searched for a phone number, the app said that it searched its database of numbers and didn't find it. It then offered to add my contacts list to its database. No, thanks. Plus, for some reason, App Store didn't disclose that the app cost $5. I found out that it wasn't free when I got the receipt."
2572,Mar Golf,"May 4, 2015",4,"Found the number quickly Was skeptical at first, but this does work very well and quickly!"
2573,Jukeboxnationbro,"May 11, 2015",5,It's great It tells me who calling me & also shows scams number. It also protects your phone from getting a virus. This app is the best app ever!!
2574,Tx3141,"June 10, 2015",5,Great app Good job finding callers info just wish it would cut the phone from ringing at all when it detects spam
2575,FrustratedByRoboCalls,"June 22, 2015",5,Good app!!!! So far the app does exactly what it says it will do. Just installed it and it has already identified a survey robo caller and added it to the block list!!!!
2576,MsFeFe31708,"July 27, 2015",5,Love this App! It absolutely works! I use this app all the time! I don't answer numbers I don't know and this app tells me who has called me! Love it!

2578,Tavis Schriefer,"August 19, 2015",5,LOVE this app - Hate Spammers This app has worked great for me to identify many of the scam / spam calls I get on my cell phone. Highly recommend it!
2579,MarkMalu,"September 10, 2015",4,"Very helpful Instead of answering calls from unknown #s, I check out who the caller might be with this app., if something important I can return the call"
2580,Stasia1261,"August 27, 2012",4,Very Good Really awesome app!  Other apps that I have used would provide nothing more than what I already knew or the location of the number. This app steps it up!  Great job!  Thanks
2581,d&l 2019,"September 19, 2012",4,"Great!! I reality like this app! Just wish that when it blocked a spam call it did not let call show up at all, now just says number blocked.  Still like the app!!"
2582,Mikejoneswho!,"October 15, 2012",2,Seriously?!?! I thought it was suppose to block unwanted calls. It only highlights them with a advertising back ground. The calls still come through. And they still can leave messages. This app is worthless. Seriously
2583,Wall Street guy,"January 9, 2013",4,My first ever review. You get what you pay for and this app gives you more than adequate results for its cost .   Classy app thAt helps identify those growing annoying calls.   Thanks guys.
2584,krisscee,"July 22, 2013",5,Great App I like how it shows all the other numbers that can be coming from the same caller
2585,ATTICUScc05,"January 29, 2017",3,iOS 10.3 Beta Does not work with iOS 10.3 public beta (due to new apple system file type I assume). Before that it worked perfectly. Will put back to 5 stars when it's updated for 10.3.
2586,LinxSpree,"May 17, 2017",1,"Waste of efforts Thanks a lot truecaller. I went to block a number that was marked as spam AND it blocked around 200 numbers that didn't even call me. Even more so, that caller that I have blocked, still calling me because my block list is now flooded on my phone. Thanks, now I have to unblock all 200 callers that never called me."

I've been using this for almost a year and almost all spam and robocalls come thru multiple times before Truecaller stops it, even though I immediately block and report it in the Truecaller app."
2590,marxamill,"March 24, 2016",4,Definitely worth it. And gives accurate information Just doesn't do well on cellphones so not five
2591,Kinglouie1,"April 24, 2016",3,"Not bad. I don't get the spam calls people are talking about, my deal is the caller id works for a while then it doesn't, I quess they want you to buy the professional version, but when it works it's cool."

2596,Louistan15,"September 1, 2016",1,"Not functioning, lost trust App is not blocking spam call, although I updated spam list and the number is clearly in the list. Your software engineer should better test it before release. The whole purpose of your app is to block calls, you lost your main functionality! Where is your QA??"
2597,Timur Lysenko,"October 27, 2016",5,Good App I love this app so far. Using for last 6 month. And I actually have the enable button in settings. iPhone 7.
2598,Masry moslem,"December 17, 2016",4,Great app help you to identify spam easily Need to make it easier on apple to avoid copying number and paste it to find it through true caller

2608,Moneyman6082,"February 19, 2016",5,Awesome It works great so that  when you get random calls you can block them.
2609,beerandhotsauce,"March 7, 2016",2,"Crashes constantly. App worked great until the most recent update. I can still share numbers to the app to check who it is, but any button pressed afterward crashes the app, as does trying to update the spam directory."

2617,Plinko75,"April 30, 2015",1,"Not helpful at all Once a unrecognized number comes in, I copied and pasted them into this app to be identified. This is a ""800"" service.

What drugs are you people on?  Deleted!"
2618,Rikalman,"May 9, 2015",5,Excellent app Thanks to True caller I was able to identify a number who was sending blank messages. It's must've app.

2626,Skoffee,"May 25, 2017",1,"Will not uninstall This app barely worked to filter calls, so I uninstalled it. I just received a spam call today, which had the True Call spam screen. I searched my phone to see if I forgot to uninstall it, but there's no trace of it on my phone. It feels like a virus the way it lingers after uninstall."
2627,Matrix 1999,"August 3, 2017",1,"Hardly secure! I still get spam calls, but the only difference is Truecaller will identify it being spam on caller ID. Therefore ANNOYING calls will get through and phone will ring. You're better off setting your phone on do not disturb, and allowing calls from contacts."
2628,E=F Flat,"August 16, 2017",2,"Try Again Used to work great, but not anymore. Only blocks calls with 1000+ spam reports, which means nothing gets blocked because thebspammers change numbers too fast. Will be looking for something else."

2632,bkarlan,"July 13, 2016",2,Eh... Doesn't do what it says it will do. Very few phone calls identify themselves as spam despite already being identified as spam in their list. I feel like I'm just providing them information and getting little benefit in return. Not impressed
2633,cloud_dog_9,"August 4, 2016",4,"Almost perfect I wish it would update itself.  This is my only complaint.  Other than than, it is awesome."

2655,OurDarlinJill,"July 2, 2015",1,"GET OFF MY PHONE!!!!!!!üò° At first this sounded like a great idea. Then, it started blocking calls from numbers the APP determined were SPAM. In reality, those were numbers from callers I wanted!!!!! I only saw they had called when I checked 'Recent Calls'. I deleted the app but this awful feature is STILL blocking numbers. You'll be tempted to download this app-DONT DO IT"

Prior to installing this app I have never had this problem. I am convinced this app sells you're phone number to numerous telemarketers. If you're going to use this app prepare yourself for many annoying phone calls

2796,bill92377,"March 19, 2017",1,"Not accurate in Nigeria I have being using true caller for about four months now in Nigeria as a scam busters. My experience is that the app is not accurate in Nigeria. When I search a Nigeria number I get names like: Ayo agent; Oga Tailor; Ojere; these are not Nigerian given names at birth. These are nicknames. Therefore, it is still very easy to scam someone. Truecaller is not accurate in Nigeria."
2797,Vassago Straad,"April 5, 2017",5,Amazing app! This app accurately helps determine who keeps trying to call you.  No more answering telemarketing calls!

2823,44Deb,"April 15, 2015",2,Fishy... It worked for the first couple of calls. Now it just says it  can't find anyone unless it analyzes my contacts. Why would it need to analyze my contacts to identify an unknown number ? Obviously there is something not right with that.
2824,nicemike,"April 15, 2015",5,Accurate No more wasted time looking up unidentified numbers

There is no other plan for this app developers. Waste app
2832,Sam_613,"April 5, 2014",1,"Not a very True application This app is worthless. Ever since this app got upgraded, search results have become very poor. I have searched for listed numbers like for doctors, etc., and this app did nothing. Prior versions, however were great, returning a good search results. Don't waste your time downloading this app."
2833,Sisco510,"April 17, 2014",1,"Poor results, Posts to Facebook Out of 10 numbers I searched, I received ZERO results. With enhanced search as well and logging into my social media accounts. Then it posts to my Facebook page without permission? No where in the TOS or in the Privacy Statement does TC mention it will do such thing. Great concept but so much to go."
2834,Anaya1506,"August 26, 2014",1,Do not download. Downloading This app is one of the worst mistakes I have made. It's inaccurate - for instance it shows my companies office number as spam.

2843,Jeanine Bean,"February 5, 2013",1,DOES NOT BLOCK CALLS AT ALL This does not block unwanted calls. The numbers I added to my list...still called. So a friend of mine has the same app. I told her to block me and I was going to call her. Well TRUE enough when I called her she answered! So...with that said the creator needs to fix that or clarify that this app will not block calls.

2887,Charlestx,"May 21, 2017",1,"Does not block spam calls until after it is entered manually As title states, it does not block spam calls until they are entered manually into the app. Once a phone number is declared spam by anyone using the app it should be blocked for all app users."

2902,Sunnyj76,"January 11, 2016",2,Truecaller App is great except it won't give you the name of the people the numbers belong to. I only got this app because I thought it gave you the names of the people. If this started giving names of the people that belong to this app then this app would be exceptional!!

2944,jmgrenda,"March 21, 2016",3,It's OK--wish it would integrate with iOS This app does not integrate with iOS automatically so you have to copy and paste a phone number into the app to check if it's in the database.
2945,Malik malik,"May 4, 2016",5,Excellant Since i got this i know who is spam caller and i am so happy that i have this app in my phone
2946,YerikVP,"May 7, 2016",1,Spam list needs work Lots of legitimate numbers are listed as spam and the spam callers that call me don't even show up as spam. Also Facebook likes to track numbers in my contact list and random crap is being suggested to me I'm assuming because of these numbers.
2947,JStone47,"June 4, 2016",1,"Fakeüëéüëéüëéüëé I used a bunch of phone numbers from my mother's phone. Numbers people have had for years were showing up as names we have never heard of.

3101,Jeff Snowden,"April 5, 2013",4,MS Useful!  But I have yet to find one number...I like knowing the probability of the call being a spam caller or spam number though!
3102,Durnman,"April 26, 2013",1,"What happened??????? Can even use it anymore ""Connect to itunes store......."" prompt keeps popping up and won't let me do anything or use it. It still blocks the numbers that have been input but I can't input any new ones because of the iTunes prompt that won't go away. Iphone 5"
3103,Romi Patel,"July 20, 2013",5,True caller It was very helpfully to find any number throughout whole world. It was great experience about this app. It was awesome.
3104,Vikas joshi,"February 11, 2014",1,"Too much information to share This app literally wants the customer to agree to share his social network acess ( posting stuff ), IP address , technical data from phone, and other confidential info ( look up terms and conditions). I can never trust them with so much power."
3105,Pradeeppp,"July 15, 2014",1,Worst app !!! Update it Even I watch 2-3 (watch a video ) for premium purpose I get a notification that I got 1 day premium but when I try check the validity and who viewed my profile it asks me complete an offer or watch a video...... Please dev update it or remove the a app from the store......
3106,Tootah-80,"October 20, 2014",4,Good But is it safe??
3107,Rick2877,"March 28, 2017",2,Spam blocker? So far I can't see it doing anything useful on my iPhone 6s iOS 10. 
3108,dencon22,"May 9, 2017",3,Love the app but I have to keep enabling it in settings Why do I have to go into settings and enable it every couple days? It works well but this is annoying.

3111,Groy7859,"August 23, 2016",1,Quite useless in my opinion The only numbers this app has been able to identify for me were those already in my contacts list. It hasn't been able to provide any info on other numbers that called.
3112,INnurseDiva,"October 9, 2016",1,"Wish this actually worked As many others have noted, you have to actually open the app and manually enter the phone number, only to discover that 300+ users have already reported that number as spam."
3113,Designeric,"December 1, 2016",1,Latest update ruined features The last update has ruined how the program works. Called aren't being blocked and the new features haven't worked at all. There needs to be an update soon to address these things.
3114,eat2fuel,"December 1, 2016",3,"Meh I think it's great that you can look up a number to determine if it's spam, but it would be great if it would tell you that natively. I really like how it ties into yelp though."

3129,gregherk,"July 2, 2016",2,Doesn't work The database is helpful but it never alerts me when I'm actually receiving the call like it is supposed to. I keep it running in the background like they say but still nothing.

3140,Prettylth0822,"January 28, 2013",1,"Does not work for me The ""blocked"" numbers can still call and leave messages. The only thing this apps does is show a sign the says TrueCaller when a number that I have requested to be blocked calls my phone.  That's worthless. I'm deleting this app. I have an iPhone 4S."

3152,Sub Mandy,"December 2, 2012",3,Doesn't block anything It doesn't block anything. Call is still calling with no block.. I want this app more useful and can really block
3153,Amgen_Sucks,"December 9, 2012",1,"Doesn't work at all Merely relabeled unwanted numbers as ""Protected by Truecaller"" and showed as such when calls come in from these numbers. The phone would still ring/vibrate, and still allows unwanted callers to leave voice messages and even send text."

3155,iEvolutiOne,"January 23, 2013",1,"Rate the actual app ... Search ur own contacts. What r the others rating, is a good question, bcs this is an unfortunate app that searches ur contacts & not the official. 90% of searches beyond that require the 'enhanced search' mode which makes no difference. 10% of time results are returned. Watch the auto spam guard."
3156,H a CHARARA,"January 26, 2013",5,Dr C It is ok.

3161,Csm711,"January 28, 2016",5,Much needed app This app is everything and easy to use
3162,SusanwithaGoodBook,"February 15, 2016",1,Doesn't work and never updates I can't figure out how this thing gets such great reviews. It doesn't ever stop spam calls and it constantly says it needs updates but never actually seems to update. Don't waste your time.
3163,Russki Aggie,"April 25, 2016",1,Your info is not secure In order to use this app you must upload your whole contact list. It gets EVERYTHING. So nothing is private and other users can search those names and see everything you have entered into your contacts.
3164,Tic-- Tac,"May 9, 2016",5,True Caller Fantastic app. Gets me almost every number I put in. I rely on True Caller quite a lot.

3183,Bo_3zizan,"April 25, 2014",2,"Not working properly It's not very practical way , called id should be prompt immediately , doesn't work with all numbers !?! Need a lot of improvement , no need to access private photos"
3184,Janahiii,"July 28, 2014",1,Very very bad app I don't know how this app is to stupid .. It can access your whats app contact and it will change the name .. Even if you remove it from your phone it will still with the same problem .. Im very not happy with it and i dont know this positive comment coming from :@

3190,LunchboxFLA,"May 24, 2012",1,Useless and suspicious Does not do as advertised and searches your phone book. Did not ever give me more information about incoming calls than the iPhone provides AND you have to copy and paste the number into the app after the call.
3191,Rockyinstinct,"December 21, 2012",4,Average So far so good but would expect some more features on this application. Seems to be very basic.

3198,Newchamp5001,"March 25, 2017",5,"I think it works, Not bad I suppose, it isnt 100% but its better than nothing"
3199,Reco5404,"April 20, 2017",1,Truecaller Suppose to stop all those unwanted calls. However they still come in even after I update and make sure it is the program for caller ID calls still come in and are not identified at all by truecaller great idea but does not seem to work.
3200,Senator2010,"December 28, 2015",5,Great App!! Works almost every time.    Better than paid sites.  Love this app.

3204,Agnos1,"June 30, 2016",1,"Doesn't Work Spam calls always go through, even ones that have been tagged by tons of people. With the app active in the background it doesn't matter, waste of time reporting spammers since it doesn't keep spammers from ringing."

3207,keithslater,"September 24, 2016",1,Doesn't use callkit I don't know why this app hasn't been updated to use callkit in iOS 10. If they did it would be able to pop up as you're receiving the call to tell you if it's spam or not. There isn't a competitor that does integrate with callkit.
3208,Mick94114,"October 27, 2016",1,Just seems to be getting worse The latest update basically freezes the settings window...... come on....

3237,Subvertio,"May 9, 2014",5,Whoah totally AWESOME! Would be Perfect if you can make phone NOT vibrate OR ring for Spammers/telemarketers. Other than that this App IS a must have !!!
3238,Sternikit2334,"April 3, 2017",4,Ok Ok so far. Won't display pics or many names with numbers. Just bought 30 days so hopefully it's awesome!
3239,Bigwalkdaddy,"July 8, 2017",1,Terrible app Never once had a problem with spam callers until I installed this app. They must send your information to some really nasty spam calling centers. Do not buy this app. There are other better ones out there that don't stoop to that level.
3240,pWn3rs,"June 14, 2016",4,Works Works 4 the most part. Just listening as Spam doesn't really cut it though so -1 star.
3241,Alexluvspandora,"June 25, 2016",2,Ehh Love this app but I started answering some calls from my area and I came to find that it was a call for an interview at a job I applied at. It came up as spam so it is identifying a lot of spam that I don't know if it is or not.
3242,1budgeter,"July 21, 2016",5,Excellent I had app less than a wk Identified the caller as spam who was posing as a VerizonWireless survey for exceptionally loyal customers wanted acct info. Please... Red flag HANG Up!

3244,brian37,"October 14, 2016",1,Unbelievably bad I compared this with other similar apps -- this just couldn't find the phone numbers that I tested it with. What's even worse is that it constantly bugs you about accessing your Contacts (so it can get all that useful info). What a scam!

3260,Joejoe17,"July 29, 2014",1,"Doesn't do what it claims Simple: it claims it can search a number and provide u with a name address or anything, yet I've had this app for almost a year now and out of the one hundred or so numbers that I searched it got one right.

3581,Wmpga,"October 26, 2013",1,It is not worth At one point it was allowing unwanted calls to be blocked but now not only doesn't it not block them but they just identify them as spam and let the phone continue to ring..

3598,Sunshine Souperman,"April 19, 2017",1,Worthless app The app rarely identifies a SPAM number and if you get a marketing call you have to manually copy and paste the number into the app so that you could populate its database and even then it won't block the call. Totally useless!

3639,abraham mertz,"October 14, 2014",1,Very very bad Adds to your contact a entry with name 'identified as spam' with like a ton of phone number which causes constant crashes to your phone and drains your battery . This cannot be removed even after deleting this app.

Useless The app claims to look up caller id but the only place to lookup numbers is within the app.  By the time a scammer is calling you it's already too late.  This app doesn't actually warn you the caller is a known scammer.
