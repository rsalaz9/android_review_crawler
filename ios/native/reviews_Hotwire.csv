0,tyler2386,"November 27, 2019",1,Fraudulent So I‚Äôve never had problems with other sites booking a hotel and didn‚Äôt expect to have such a headache of a time with these scum. I have had two bad incidents now within two days. First I pick the hotel and the bed and go to book and pay I click pay and it says oops the deal is gone select another room and book now. All the while my card was charged the full amount for the room that was never booked. Now when I contacted them they said they didn‚Äôt charge my car that it is a hold placed but not by them so says the rep I‚Äôm talking to they can only release the funds and then I have to wait 5-7 days for my money to be put back into my account. So I figured alright I‚Äôll wait. Then couple days later going to book another room what do you know same thing happens again charged my card full price and didn‚Äôt book the room at all. Now I‚Äôm out a couple hundred dollars until this ‚Äúrelease‚Äù goes through and I get my money credited back to my account. DO NOT ISE HOTWIRE AT ALL FOR ANY REASON THEY WILL SCREW YOU OVER AND NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THEIR END AND BLAME YOUR BANK AND THAT YOU NEED TO CONTACT THEM INSTEAD OF HOTWIRE IM FILING A COMPLAINT WITH BBB AND MY BANK IS OPENING A FRAUD CLAIM AGAINST THEM FOR THEM SAYING THEY NEVER CHARGED MY CARD YET IT STATES CLEARLY IN MY STATEMENT HOTWIRE SO OF THEY DIDNT AUTHORIZE THE CHARGE THEN ITS FRAUD AND NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED SO IT WILL BE!!!
1,Pointless games,"December 26, 2018",1,Hotwire customer care terrible Booked a hot deal and my card was charged. I was then brought to a screen that said an error occurred and that deal was no longer available. So I had a full trip charged to my card and Hotwire customer care refused to do anything except lay the blame on my credit card company and me. Took 4 days for the credit to be available on my card again. Their customer care department is a third party company out of Malaysia that refuses to give you information on how to contact Hotwire corporate offices after they ultimately refuse to help you.
2,Husky Dad,"June 11, 2019",1,"Skip the app and use the website Worst app ever. For most hotels it only shows 1 picture, even when there are dozens on the Hotwire Website. I tried to book a trip on the app anyway, but it kept saying my credit card wasn‚Äôt recognized. So I called my credit card company and they said They authorized the transaction, but Hotwire canceled it. So I called Hotwire and they said it‚Äôs because I was trying to book a deal that wasn‚Äôt available. After hearing this, I looked again, and the deal still showed up on the app. I also had $15 of ‚ÄúHotDollars‚Äù credit, which an email said I could use to book, but couldn‚Äôt use it on the app. This app is so much worse than the website."
3,Loknasta T,"October 10, 2019",1,"Scam! Hotwire car rental is such a scam!!! I booked car online on September 30th and I got HOT RATE  for it. When I went to rent a car agency ( Ace ) they told me that there is mile limitation for my reservation ( 150 miles a day ) and that I should cancel reservation because if I go further that 450 miles in 3 days I will pay 25 cents per extra mile. These conditions WERE NOT in terms and conditions when I accepted reservation. I called hot wire after agent in ACE told me to call them and cancel. Hot wire did not wanted to cancel my reservation because they told me it was a blind reservation and it is not refundable?! I told them that even if it is blind reservation they SHOULD put all the conditions when you book it, otherwise I got stuck with the car I cannot use. They said they will put those information in the future üò° I told them I don't care about the future, I want my money back now because it's crazy to scam people like that and do not put all the conditions when you book a car. I ended up being charged for a car I did not use. PEOPLE SAVE YOUR MONEY, do not use HOTWIRE! Their customer service is rude and their supervisors not doing their job."
4,DougBoydad,"November 8, 2019",1,"Poor Customer Service and Retention Our company is removing Hotwire as an option for future travel needs. Due to human error (or perhaps a manipulation by the app) the incorrect date was selected on a reservation. I did make the mistake of confirming that purchase without rechecking the date. Once the error was determined we contacted Hotwire 24+ hours before reservation and they would not cancel and credit. After reaching a supervisor on phone I brought up the fact confirmation email does specify it is prepaid and can‚Äôt be cancelled. She wanted to resend confirmation email so I would have the right polices. She sent the email and well it was the exact same. So now I question if I made a human error in date selection or if app moved date. See the hotel was actually sold out for the dates I believe selected and the Hotwire reservation was a night following when the hotel had availability. In any case, Hotwire was unwilling to offer a credit or refund and chooses to loose out on future business. Poorly run and a shame human error is being taken advantage of. Fool me once but not twice!!!"
5,dbstock,"August 2, 2019",1,"Buyer Beware I used Hotwire to book my car rental for a trip 2 months from now. I had to make a change to the dates so went to the hotwire site, no change button to be found. Called customer service and asked to simply change my itinerary dates and was told not possible and reservation non-refundable. Just like that, a click of the button and they are stealing $300 from me. Whatever contracts they have in place with car rental companies, a customer should be able to make a date change, especially for a trip 2 months down the road. We are not talking about airline seats last minute at risk of going unfilled. This is a silly car rental reservation. At minimum Hotwire, you need a flashing pop-up warning with flames at checkout that says something like, ‚ÄúBEWARE Hotwire sucker, if you dare try to make a date change after you click this, just know it won‚Äôt happen because we‚Äôve already charged your credit card and pocketed your money!‚Äù Next step, contact my state attorney general and file a complaint."
6,Rifferr,"November 13, 2018",5,"Best Deals I‚Äôve seen this far! I‚Äôve used Hotwire twice now, both to book hotels in Charlotte, NC. First one was a 4-Star Hotel in Uptown Charlotte for about $111/night which was about $140 cheaper than any other hotel in the city. Next time I used it we got a 4-Star Hotel in the heart of the city for about $104/night - even better than the first time! Although you may not know exactly where you‚Äôre staying at the time of booking, it may be worth while if you are planning on being in a big city or somewhere loaded with hotels because this website will give you the best rate because of that no show until book policy. Just read the details like free WiFi, parking, choose your bed or hotel chooses for you, etc. before booking and you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem!!"
7,GuiSBorges,"November 6, 2019",1,I‚Äôll never use this app again PLEASE DON‚ÄôT USE THIS APP! Just go ahead and stick to booking or Airbnb!
8,Link2Leo,"November 10, 2018",1,Swindler App! I'm a long time user of Hotwire and thought to have learned the ins and outs of the app through experience but when I booked a rentacar with Ace @ LAX I was greatly disappointed to discover not only is Hotwire deceptive but also dishonest. They are swindlers! 
9,Lil Wonder,"April 8, 2018",1,"Won‚Äôt even switch hotels when you‚Äôre in danger Last year I used Hotwire and I got booked at a Hotel that I was previously booked at through Hotwire in another year and which I felt very unsafe. When I called to see if I could switch hotels and explained to them that the previous year I had an incident happened to me where I was assaulted at that hotel, they refused to change me into another hotel and told me that all bookings were final. It took me two hours to finally get them to at least change my Hotel as they would not give me a refund. "
10,Dmpyle,"October 2, 2017",1,"Terrible app for a terrible company This app and the company behind it are horrible and you can save yourself a lot of pain by avoiding them both. I was trying to book a hotel for the following week and noticed that the app kept changing my dates to the current day every time I refreshed the search. Finally booked one and thought I was good to go. When I arrive at the hotel they have no idea who I am and it turns out the app booked the hotel for the same night I booked it. Then the hotel says someone checked in and used the reservation. I called Hotwire and they said since it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúHotRate‚Äù deal there are absolutely no refunds or changes, which apparently includes their system screwing up. So now I payed for someone else‚Äôs hotel room last week and had to get a last minute room at full price when I arrived totaling over $700 for what ended up being a 7 hour stay in the hotel. I will never use anything with the Hotwire name again"
11,vee562,"June 19, 2018",1,"Not accurate description of hotel I booked a hotel and one of my main filters was a hotel with a pool. I chose the hotel but upon arrival noticed construction going on at the hotel near the pool. I then ask the receptionist and she says it will be opened the next day, FOR SURE. The next day, the new girl now working the front desk, says the pool will be opened after 5. Again I let it go because our reservations were for a few days and we would have time to hang out by the pool once it opened. I return to the hotel later that same day with my two children and husband to see posted signs saying the pool will not be opened til renovations are completed. I was very disappointed with Hotwire for not letting me know this hotels pool would be out of service and then the hotel, Comfort suites Odessa, for giving me the run around. Very inconvenient and upsetting. I work hard for my money and want what I pay for."
12,bad hotel riviera soutj beach,"July 2, 2018",1,Badly run hotel riviera Hotel housekeeping was not consistent in cleaning the room and many days by 5 pm had to call down before the came to clean. Days that didn‚Äôt clean dishes leave coffee pods left sand in the shower etc. secondly  we lost power 3 times and twice in one day and was unable to work and one night had to move to a different room. The second time we waited over one hour for the main fence guy from another property of there‚Äôs to come an couldn‚Äôt even find the power box we had to go switch it back on. After the third time this happened we asked them to in some way for spoiled food in fridge plus all the other inconveniences plus one day not be able to work and losing work I asked for some sort of compensation and for 45 minutes attempted to reach something and hotel refuse to do anything for all the issues that we clearly there responsibility
13,Ben0564,"October 14, 2018",1,"Beware of Scam I booked a hotel on Hotwire. I arrived at about 10pm only to find out that the hotel was over booked. The hotel said they would tell the third party (Hotwire) that they would approve a refund for the night and comp me a night stay at a nearby motel. Once I spoke to Hotwire, they said that they would apply a credit in my Hotwire account in addition and this credit would be good for a year. Luckily I called Hotwire back to confirm the credits. The new guy customer service rep informed me that the credit in my Hotwire account was what I was getting. After a conversation explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand it that way I asked to just credit my card. Let‚Äôs think about this, if I don‚Äôt use that credit within the years time I just lose the money! That sounds like a scam and will be in touch with the better business burea."
14,ph_ag,"March 20, 2019",1,"Seriously the worst ever ! Warning false advertising - just as another reviewer experienced I was also charged for a room but then receive an error. Which means the room and that deal ‚Äúgot away‚Äù which is bs. I called and they stated the price went up reason why it did not book but yet charged my card. So I asked can you they use that credit to pay the difference to book another room they said no.  So I let it be and waited til the next today to see if my credit card got refunded back. Nothing yet..... so I saw the same deal again (my mistake) and I tried to book it and the same error I received. I got charged again, so now I have two charges pending. I understand that it‚Äôs not fully charged just a hold but on my end it shows that it‚Äôs charged, now I have to wait 3-5 days. So now I can‚Äôt book anything for my birthday weekend. So be aware DONT USE HOTWIRE - PURE FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!"
15,DidappointedInHotel,"December 8, 2019",1,"Too far from Downtown Chicago I can‚Äôt voice my disappointment enough in this hotel. I came to Chicago to shop and go to a play. I input ‚Äòdowntown‚Äô when making the reservation and even called the hotel, when I saw it was an option, to ask if it was walking distance to the main shopping areas.  I was there three nights and paid more for urber rides than the hotel! I would have done so much more in Chicago if it wasn‚Äôt an additional $20+ to get to the city. Hotel itself was okay. Tiny and old. Plus when you get there an additional $20 per night, in the small print when you book, for extra amenities that you will never use. Spa down the road, discount at the bar(that was never open late enough to use). Live and learn. Unless you are planning on staying in the Gold Coast area book someplace else. The extra for the room is worth it.  Ended up costing me over $100+ more than planned."
16,moveplaylearnnow,"February 15, 2020",1,Over charge Multiple time problems with Hotwire. Their customer service is basically to tell you there‚Äôs nothing they can do. 
17,lcm lon,"August 9, 2019",1,Hotwire bait and switch app is misleading Hotwire uses bait and switch when you book with them. They said I was guaranteed to receive my car rental from Enterprise Alamo National Hertz Dollar Budget. When I went to book car rental they gave me Advantage. I called them to mention that advantage was not advertise in my five guaranteed car rentals companies. They did a bait and switch on me and they refused to switch me to one of the other car rental companies. In which they advised I was guaranteed in their online listing. I reviewed advantage and their customer reviews had so many negative complaints with this car rental company. I didn‚Äôt feel safe using them for my family trip. Hotwire refuses to issue me a refund or switch me the the rental company that they guaranteed to me. I will never use Hotwire ever again. Poor customer service and not a trusting company. Their bait and switch was very this honest. Buyers beware
18,SarahjZhang,"August 27, 2019",1,"Never a followup I had enjoyed using hotwire in the past. However, my last experience has made me change my view on hotwire service. I got a rental car through hotwire. On the day of my travel, the rental car company had no cars available. I was told that the wait could be 2-3 hours as 6 parties ahead of me were waiting for cars. I cant sit around at airport for 2-3 hours. So I got another rental car from a different company. I contacted Hotwire right after I left the airport. I was told that they will take care of it. After I came back from my business trip, I contacted them again regarding the credit, I was told that they are working on it. 2 weeks later, no one called me or followed up on this. No credit was issued. Now I have to dispute through my credit card company. Very disappointed with their service."
19,4;32-6?7:),"March 23, 2020",1,"Long time user no more Long time user of Hotwire for years...to the tune of tens of thousands of $$...no joke.  Business, pleasure, family trips, you name it.  Have touted this company and its simplicity with friends and family forever as I believed in its value.  No more."
20,Fiffjddjhfhjh,"October 20, 2017",5,"DO NOT USE IT I booked hotel on 20th October at 1am in morning when I was done with work in Nj . When I came to hotel around 3am hotel receptionist told me reservation is for 20th October but starts at 3pmü§î. So I lost night sleeping in car a I am tired at work because Of Hotwire . When you call hotel and ask to go in today it means now , not in 13 hours , this application is not serious tool for booking hotel , if you need some serious booking without mastaike you should call hotel and book it . Never again this stupid unusable aplication"
21,Sal-bug,"April 17, 2018",5,I like them! J.O. I travel on business a lot and use Hotwire often especially on short notice. This app has worked for me 99% of the time. And if I ever ran into a problem with any stay a quick call to them and it was taken care of immediately no questions asked. I personally can't say a bad thing about this company. Using this app requires the ability to read between the lines and knowing the areas to hit on a great hotel. In other words if you have half a brain it's a great way to go.
22,Dan Loves Debbie,"July 28, 2018",5,You lose all compensation when you book through them! If there is a problem with the hotel Hotwire will only offer $25. No full refund even if they do something horrible.  In my most recent case I saved $9 over booking the Comfort Inn Downtown in Chattanooga only to have the staff ignore our do not disturb sign and wake us early.   Normally I would get a refund from Comfort Inn.  1 hour on the phone and texting with Hotwire and the best they can do is $25.  This applies to thefts from your room and other losses also.  Not acceptable!
23,SharonGomezPR,"January 28, 2019",1,No real option provided I booked a hotel due to a delayed flight after at 12:30 am 28th of January. 
24,TheMerrierTerrier,"March 26, 2019",1,"Beware of booking unnamed hotels I booked a night at unnamed 2 star hotel in Anaheim one night.  When I arrived, there were 2 squad cars in the parking lot interrogating someone.  There were several ladies of questionable circumstance hanging out in the doorways of their rooms.  I then looked up reviews of this motel online and found out this place was notorious for drug use, prostitution, etc.   Before checking in, I called Hotwire to let them know of the situation.  They were not willing to make any adjustments.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting the Ritz but this place was beyond safe.  This was especially sad since it was blocks away from Disneyland.  What if a family had booked there?  There was no way I was going to stay there and called it a loss.   Hotwire was not willing to make any amends.  I never used their app again."
25,Wickster37,"April 6, 2019",1,"Very bad customer service Hotwire will never help you when a situation arises that‚Äôs out of your control or when they are at fault.  For example, I reserved a hotel that Hotwire stated they had an airport shuttle.  I called for the shuttle but the hotel said they don‚Äôt service the airport I was at.  I called Hotwire and they would not transfer the to another hotel near the airport I was at even though the hotel accessed the cancellation/change.  Another time, I got a hotel that was to be a 2.5 star rating.  I showed up and this hotel had massage parlors, and other sketchy businesses in the rooms of the hotel.  I took pictures and sent them to Hotwire.  They would not cancel or change the reservation even though this star rating was not accurate.  Hotwire customer service is by far the worst experience I‚Äôve ever encountered."
26,SLG1220,"September 16, 2019",5,"Booking travel has never been easier! This app is really well designed. We were able to score a great deal on a hotel in downtown Chicago for a family staycation. Thanks to the advanced filters, we could narrow down to a specific neighborhood and find a hotel with a pool. The kids had a blast and we were able to use some of our savings to splurge on a nice meal at the hotel restaurant. I will definitely continue to use Hotwire and will certainly recommend this app to my friends and family. Thank you Hotwire!"
27,bartekwsh,"January 22, 2020",5,Hotels from hotwire I highly recommend hotwire !!
28,sdgrught,"September 3, 2019",1,"Very misleading on charges. Will never book again. I have booked with Hotwire several times in the past, and the total cost to book a car has always been clear in the marketing. I booked a car for a recent trip to visit family, and the price was marketed for approximately 32 per day TOTAL. Buried in the fine print (which was not clear and easy to understand and buried at the bottom of a very long email) was a reference to taxes and fees. This added another 148 to my bill and brought the cost of the car to nearly 60 per day. Absolutely unacceptable and incredibly misleading. I am disputing the charges with my bank and filing a complaint with better business bureau. What a terrible business practice. My rental was through dollar. Terrible!"
29,Dad-Dan,"April 11, 2020",5,Crooked Company- Buyer Beware STAY AWAY!  Any ‚Äúdeals‚Äù come with extremely bad and unprofessional service. My family and I were planning a trip to Florida and we rented our car through Hotwire. (Big mistake)
30,Jnaumow,"October 16, 2017",1,"Left me stranded Booked a hot rate rental car and upon arrival the rental car company refused to honor the confirmed reservation. After calling Hotwire they kept me on hold for 30 minutes while they spoke with the car rental company. Hotwire‚Äôs response was that the company would not adjust, but Hotwire would make a special concession this time and refund my money. The agent acted like I should feel privileged that I would get a refund. No offer or willingness to find me an alternative rental with any of the handful of companies available at the airport where I was at. Needless to say I used a competitors website and was able to book a similar deal in 5 minutes and walk out with a car. Pathetic customer service and they will not see my business again."
31,Traveler with taste,"February 12, 2018",1,Hotel ratings exaggerated I use this app a lot and although I appreciate the good deals. It seems like some of the hotels are rated with a higher star value than the actual hotel could be rated for.
32,traveeleer,"December 15, 2018",1,"V√™ careful! horrible search system Be careful with the search system of this application! runs the risk of sending you far away from where you are. I was at a loss as I needed a hotel right next to the airport. I chose the location ""fco airport"" and they sent me to a hotel 15km from the airport in the ""lido di ostia"" region. if I put as the main filter the distance from the airport means that I need it to be as close as possible, since I had to have a few hours. as it was late it had no transport and had to sleep at the airport. total nonsense! and I still have to pay for the system error. as I was not compensated for the error, I will make this critic on the internet about this absurd error and the treatment policy of the clients of this ""company"""
33,Wellrope,"January 9, 2019",4,"Mostly good service I‚Äôve used Hotwire several years and have rarely been disappointed.  Most of my usage is booking some weekend hotels.  We have been very frustrated that recently Hotwire combined the downtown area and the 7th Street District in Fort Worth.  I‚Äôve mostly stopped using Hotwire when we desire to go to downtown Fort Worth on the weekends because we risk not being near the areas we prefer.  We like both of those areas, but it is too spread out to enjoy if the hotel is in the 7th St. District, but our entertainment that weekend is downtown."
34,Euroz!,"August 16, 2019",2,"Bug in Car search Hotwire used to be the best app for renting cars. No other app/service provided a better service than them, but some weeks/months ago the search is not working for car rentals in the same day or the next day. When you try to search for any car it always says there is no cars available. I am talking about NYC area, so there is no way there are no cars available. Even if I go directly to the website of the rental companies they always have cars. So it seems that you need to book the car 2 days in advance now. That is really inconvenient. I hope someone is able to take a look if this is a bug. Thank you."
35,Zndkzksndnskznsnsjzndn,"June 11, 2019",1,"Worst experience I‚Äôve ever had First time I ran into problems with Hotwire was when I booked a rental with them, They rental car company they sent me to had no rentals at the time. I called and talked to a customer service specialist and I was then charged again for another rental that when I got there the company had no rentals available either. The second time I‚Äôve had problems with Hotwire was today I booked a room with them and upon arrival the hotel was a disaster area. Furniture was broken and cushion was coming out. Not to mention the hotel I booked was not the one I was sent to."
36,streettoonz,"October 11, 2019",1,"Don‚Äôt fall for the hot rate!!!! I would give no stars. However that is not an option. The hot rate advertised was $4 cheaper than the regular rate. Ok great deal. After I booked it and checked it with the regular rate, I found that I paid more than if I would‚Äôve booked it at regular price. Customer service is absolutely no help. Spoke to regular agent R.D. and Jen a supervisor. Both were with the run around b.s. And said and I quote ‚Äúthe system changes the prices and they have no control over the booking costing more with the hot rate than a regular rate ‚Äú . I am still confused. Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt believe the hot rate b.s. It‚Äôs a joke. 42 minutes wasted out of my life dealing with them and still no help what so ever. The low price guarantee is a joke."
37,Dggarza,"September 22, 2019",5,Hotwire is Great! I have been using Hotwire 10 years and counting and it hasn‚Äôt let me down! I have always gotten great deals when traveling around Texas and even got a GREAT deal through Hotwire visiting my hometown of Chicago! Recently I also found out they have great customer service when the hotel I was staying in had an incident occur and the Hotwire customer service department took care of it to my utmost satisfaction! I have no doubt I will continue to use Hotwire services for my future travels.
38,unhappy hotwire customer,"March 31, 2020",1,Just lost a loyal customer I have used Hotwire for over 10 years and have never had a problem. Today will be the last time. I tried to call them to cancel my car rental since I am unable to travel due to the Coronavirus. What a scam. They will not refund due it due to it being a Hot rate. I understand the cancellation policy but this is due to an International Disaster. I contacted the rental car company & they said it‚Äôs Hotwire‚Äôs policy not theirs. They do not receive the money until I pick up the rental. Really Hotwire you won‚Äôt amend your policy due to unforeseen circumstances which is out of my control. Shame on you. I hope its worth losing a loyal customer. Your taking peoples money without providing a service.
39,Queer Vic,"July 2, 2019",5,Finally Great I have used Hotwire 7 times in the past getting the property I wanted 2 times out of 7. To my surprise there is now a feature that gives you a sneak peak of the hotel you will get. I use the app with Trip Advisor to look at the hotels that are up for grabs. Thanks to the sneak peek of the room I snagged a great 4.5 * hotel in NYC at an excellent price. With that feature Hotwire will now be my hotel app of choice.

My son has been deployed serving our country for 8 months and I had booked through Hotwire to be at the base when his ship returned since I am a special ed aide my funds are very low. His ship got extended a month on deployment so I tried to change the date of my stay NOT a refund....all I wanted was to change dates because it was nothing anyone could have known would happen when they got extended. I tried numerous times speaking with Hotwire and they would not budge!!!! These people are not military friendly whatsoever they do not care!!!! Giving them one star was even to high for a recommendation!

I wanted to book one night not 2 nights the system sometimes freezes on you and Press is more than one night so people please be aware it‚Äôs better to call or online but NOT the app.  To be completely honest I hate hate the app it just booked 2 night instead of one in the people at customer service can I help you because at the end of the day that was your mistake for not paying attention to the app. Because apparently it is your responsibility to make sure the app works properly on your phone.
49,dfgjjhgf,"September 6, 2019",3,"Lower expectations I have enjoyed Hotwire for many years and will continue to use them just with lower expectations, the last car I rented was a Chevrolet Tahoe or similar from Thrifty. I picked this size vehicle for a family vacation, I got a 7 passenger KIA something, I complained that was not similar or even close in my opinion, they had a Tahoe there and would only let me have it if I made another reservation through them.... I did get a Buick 7 passenger that still didn‚Äôt come close but I had to go. So if I ever need a specific size vehicle I won‚Äôt use Hotwire."
50,Marty Mich,"July 22, 2018",5,Overall best deals I typically look for deals the evening I want to stay (unless there is some big event) sorted by price low to high and choose the best I can with 70% or higher rating. I‚Äôve had some great deals. The very beat have been when I‚Äôm traveling in the off season. I haven‚Äôt found a better easier system for saving. Car rentals have been good too.
51,malikb5055,"July 26, 2018",5,"Good but could use more features Great app, but I still prefer kayak because it keeps track of everything like my flights, flight miles, places I traveled, how many cities I‚Äôve been to, and syncs automatically.

52,Tm4freedom,"September 9, 2018",5,"Hotwire is Awesome I‚Äôve been using Hotwire for years and have saved thousands of dollars on hotel rates. I‚Äôve never been disappointed, but it does require a little homework on the users part... i.e. have a general idea of where you want to stay in a city, read the amenities section carefully so you know whether your getting free parking, etc."

54,RockJunkie_NJ,"March 26, 2019",1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE Beware. If you ever plan on calling customer service to get a refund or change your travel plans stay far away from Hotwire. It‚Äôs like they have a script that they will NOT deviate from. They will NOT provide any type of refunds or work with you. They don‚Äôt even listen. 
55,topdaddy4twink,"September 12, 2019",5,Sir. I have found that Hotwire usually has the best rates at the best four star hotels.  The only draw back to hot wire is that the hotels hammer you with deposits for so called incidentals that take forever to return to either your credit card or bank accounts . Hotwire should share the billing info with the hotels to prevent this from being such a nuisance. Thanks Hotwire for having good ratesüëçüèª
56,elakemper,"September 16, 2019",5,"Best travel app for deals$$$ I‚Äôve used this app more times than I can count because it saves me TONS of money! I can get 4 star hotels (or better) for less than $100 in most cities. Simple, easy to use. I just filter by star rating and recommend score, then find the best deals in the city. Thanks Hotwire!!! You have made my dollar go farther for my vacations."
57,robert benca,"June 12, 2019",1,The worst place to rent the car delete the app before they screw you I know there is a lot of review and sometimes we don‚Äôt consider them as value till we try so let me start mine. I will never ever rent the car thru Hotwire they are the worst you better go straight thru car rental company and pay little more because you will ended up with no car and they don‚Äôt care about anything don‚Äôt even take ownership for the mistakes they did and that‚Äôs bad even they are the one who put you to this situation. They can keep Hotwire credit and stick it up to ceo where the sun don‚Äôt shine
58,EdRock,"January 15, 2020",1,"Pathetic and deceptive I‚Äôve used Hotwire, generally successfully, for more than 20 years. Recently, I used the app to make two reservations. The app failed to request me to log in and sent the confirmation messages to the SPAM folder of the email address associated with my Apple ID because I used Apple Pay. And yet, when I went to Hotwire dot com and entered that email address, the site said I had no reservations with that email address. And this doesn‚Äôt even go into the dismal customer service experience. Hotwire today is not what it once was. And their app is worse. Avoid."
59,CWEN4,"June 23, 2019",1,Bait and switch The so called deals are not really deals at all. They use false/misleading advertising and a story about their unique business model to create a perception of savings. 99% of the time you are simply being lured into the platform by the possibility of paying the rates of a second rate hotel and getting a first rate one. But what‚Äôs the possibility?!!! Practically zero under most circumstances. But their advertising makes it sound like it‚Äôs almost always guaranteed. Read the fine print before you book! This business is borderline fraud. And horrible customer service.
60,olawet,"October 1, 2017",5,Great way to save on hotels I use Hotwire all the time for hotel bookings. On the average it saves me approximately 30% if I book on the day of arrival.
61,Hierge,"November 4, 2017",4,Experienced User We only use Hotwire to book rooms.  Occasionally we end up in mediocre properties but on most occasions we get awesome rooms.  Depends on the market.  In Fairfax VA there are 4 star hotels available for the price of motels.  The only reason this isn‚Äôt five star is customer service which isn‚Äôt good. Promised me a coupon for $25 after dropping a reservation.  Nothing.  I‚Äôd rate customer service a two.

I stayed at 1 hotel down the road last night that is rated 2 1/2 stars by hotwire. Tonight I book a 2 1/2 star hotel listed as a hotwire ‚Äúhot deal‚Äù and this place is a straight up dump. This is a motel for construction workers, no offense thats my biz too, but I‚Äôm on a family vacation and I have small kids with me. This is not even worth comparing the 2 places, this is straight up being mislead by Hotwire. I would love to walk both properties with a hotwire rep and see if they can compare the 2."

I was charged including tax $151 per night when regular price at same hotel was $89 per night and through Priceline or orbitz it was even cheaper.  On top of that they listed the Crown Plaza in New Orleans as parking $42, I was charged $211 for parking and I didn‚Äôt even park there- I have a parking ticket from across the street to prove I did not park there then."

Second experience, I booked a convertible because weather was predicted to be warm but now it's very cold. Asked them to cancel that so I could Rebook a normal car. Was denied even though the policy states ""cancel anytime"" this is a bait and switch company that screws up your reservations and blames you but keeps yours money. Buyer beware!"

74,Bagwati,"April 20, 2019",1,"Unfair policies If you are planning trips with FRIENDS, never book hotel via this app. Just because FRIENDS are not blood relatives, this company doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to consider for a refund or discount coupons if we cancel a booking, especially because a FRIEND is not a blood relative. One of my friends for who we planned a trip got sick due to which we had to cancel a booking. I got a response that refund will be issued only if it‚Äôs a family member. This is very unfair.

80,TheLakeDaddy,"April 10, 2018",5,Can't read hotel reviews Few if any reviews are available to see. Stars mean nothing without a review of the hotel to read. This has been my long time complaint with Hotwire. None are shown on their website when using my Mac.
81,PK Chicago,"April 25, 2018",5,Best app ever! Best deals ever! I‚Äôve used HotWire a ton and have only had one disappointment albeit in a tough market.

526,Scottinarl,"July 7, 2019",2,"Ten year user deleting this app As a longtime Hotwire user, I am saddened that I need to delete the app from my phone. I had a bad experience with one of their car rental providers in Orlando this past week. 2 hours to get my car from Ace car rental. Roughly 10 renters ahead of me in line. Not one of the transactions went smoothly. There were four agents at the counter and none appeared grossly inept or incompetent. What failed them was a unique process and what I felt were predatory practices to extract additional fees from the clients. The agent picked you a car, and put the key and a damage form on a board for a porter to retrieve the vehicle. You then went outside and waited some more for the porter to find your car, and wash it. And if the guest before you didn‚Äôt fill the tank you may need to sign off that you will return the car with as little as a 1/4 tank of fuel. Weird. Long story short, the vehicles weren‚Äôt parked in dedicated spots but just randomly parked. The porters walk around hitting the alarm buttons on the key fobs to find the cars. Ours was apparently blocked in by multiple other cars. So after waiting for an additional 20 minutes they finally assigned us another car. That required new paperwork and an additional 10 minute delay printing and signing again. After the insane process our Nissan Rogue was fine, but we were so scared the return process would be messed up that we returned the vehicle 12 hours early and walked 3.5 miles to the airport hotel in crazy heat rather than risk missing our flight early the next morning. But until Hotwire develops standards including average time to check in/out, software and systems that meet industry standards I will never risk using Hotwire for a car rental again. I definitely didn‚Äôt save $50 from using the Avis app considering the time lost with Hotwire."

Purchased insurance through HotWire with I made the car rental booking, then received a reservation confirmation that stated it was imperative to show a confirmation of insurance, but no actual confirmation of the insurance I had purchased. When I called the insurance company I was told flat out that it might likely take up to 24 hrs for the insurance to be processed, which would have been after my reservation time. When I called to cancel The Hot Wire customer service rep denied it could take up to 24 hrs. After she called the insurance company with me on the line and was told that ‚Äúyes it could very well take up to 24 hours‚Äù (insurance co couldn‚Äôt even look up my claim because it didn‚Äôt even appear yet in their record - and that was at 11pm, 7 hrs after I had paid, my booking pick up at 9am) she said it wasn‚Äôt good enough reason to cancel the booking because if the car rental had problems with me not having proof of insurance I could always cancel and take out a policy through the car rental. As if it was the most normal thing for someone who had purchased and paid for insurance through Hotwire to find themselves when picking up theirs car having to deal with cancellations, making calls, and spending more money, instead of just getting in the car and go about their business. Hot Wire refused to reimburse me or even credit me for the booking cancellation. The insurance  company agreed to cancel the policy and reimburse me for their charge but 3 weeks later I still have not received reimbursement."

The hotel itself was rundown, had fluids and trash on the elevator floor, and the hallways looked rundown and hadn‚Äôt been vacuumed in ages. The hotel room I got had a funky smoke smell, had white residue on the counters and tables, I found a lighter and broken glass in one of the kitchen drawers, and there was a blood stain in the tub and a dry blood stain on the outside of the bathroom. I had my little sister with me and we felt unsafe and disgusted with the hotel and left after complaining to the front desk because they didn‚Äôt have housekeeping all they were willing to do was come up themselves and sanitize the bathroom and wall. I called hotwire and was told I could either get a refund or give me another fire deal and potentially put me in the same situation so I took the refund and ended up finding a more expensive hotel last minute without hotwires help. 1. Hotwire needs to investigate these hotels and make sure they are habitable to stay in for their customers especially if they are doing deals on them 2. They need to be willing to help their customers more if they get into situations like this cause I was basically left to fend for myself because I didn‚Äôt want to risk getting another horrible hotel. After this experience, I don‚Äôt want to book through hotwire again unless they really do some improvements to the hotels they provide."

I have been satisfied with all of them however sometimes you get more than you were bargaining for. That is not necessarily a bad thing. On one of my recent trips to El Paso Texas I used the service to book a hotel similar to a holiday in express or similar. The rate was under $50, and I felt it to be a good value. When I received my confirmation however I was booked into a much nicer hotel, on par with a Marriott or the Hilton. Normally this would not have been an issue, except for the fact I was having several people visit me while in town and needed the complementary parking that a lower level hotel offers. Subsequently a couple of my friends had to pay to come visit me, but I ended up charging it to my room. That said the room was exquisite, the accommodations well above my expectations. And a very pleasant experience otherwise. "
591,NavMac,"April 25, 2016",1,"I just deleted all - Will never use again So I have booked previously with Priceline and have gotten good deals. I saw that Hotwire was available so I decided to try it out. I saw a great deal for a three star hotel. Just like Priceline, I booked with excitement to see what hotel I received. The hotel was a brand that I never heard of which shocked me cause it was a three star hotel. So I decided to look it up online and I was appalled by the reviews of the hotel and how other wondered how it would be considered three stars. It was also located on bad side of town and full of bed bugs. So I called Hotwire to speak to a representative to which they told me that the hotel was indeed a three star hotel. I argued saying that there's no way that this is a 3 star hotel to which they threw Expedia under the bus by saying that they too classified it like that. Now I'm stressed out cause I lost a lot of money cause there's no way I am going to have my family come from out of state to stay at this roach motel. I will NEVER do business with Hotwire ever again."
592,Epicninjaofdoom,"July 26, 2016",2,"Ap good but DO NOT TRUST Hotwire We've had good and bad experiences with Hotwire--most recently we purchased a week at a 5 star hotel in Paris based on their ""hot rate"" which claimed to slash a $675 per night room over 60% off to ""only"" $250. After the booking gave us the name of the hotel--Renaissance Paris Le Park Trocodero-- We looked up and assumed we were getting a suite or family room based on rate. However, after getting here we were given a very nice but cramped and basic room which is published at under $250 on Expedia and similar sites. After emailing and calling Hotwire we we were given absolute runaround. 30 minute call from Europe to USA (routed to India)...representative just kept repeating that they bought rooms at the highest rate $675, which of course is complete baloney, and that its all subject to availability. So basically you should never trust that you will get a good deal--and you should expect Hotwire to have zero accountability."

No changes could be made, no refund would be issue. All sales are final and blamed me. The said it's my issue and that they can't help me. The hotel that I was booked at also said don't ever use a third-party to book hotel stays because it always is an issue. Then I called the headquarters to the hotel to see if they could do anything they said they can't issue me the money because my contract is with Hotwire.  At 12 hotwire only then books for the following day, which I was not aware of I thought I was booking still for that night.

595,DeZyne One,"January 30, 2017",1,"Ruined Family Trip. Booked us and screwed us. 4 agents giving me the run around,1 agent trying to save my situation and another agent with his hands tied. An aggravating experience with Hotwire! I had booked a room at The Club at Big Bear Village. Upon arrival to check in, there was a lobby full of upset individuals who were all on a list and did not have rooms. Approx a list of 20 plus. I was one of many on that list. The Club at Big Bear Village stated that Hotwire had overbooked several people giving confirmations with no room availability. I had booked our room on Hotwire a week and a half in advance and I received a confirmation. Being that this was a sold out weekend with record high snow fall, there were no rooms available in the city of Big Bear. They tried but failed to accommodate me. Hotwire screwed up my vacation plans and tried to resolve the situation with a hotel room available down the mountain (2hrs away). With 2 day resort activities planned,  and no room within in the vicinity, everything went down the drain real fast. I was refunded my money and charged for another backup plan room that evening, which was not even close to my room of a 4.5 star rating. Lying about trying to get me into a 3.5 star when the second option was really a 2 star spot, down the mountain? Ridiculous! I will never use Hotwire. Thanks again for screwing me. Ruined our family weekend!"

I have previously used Hotwire with no problems. This time, I booked 2 rooms and was not given any options of non smoking or number of beds for the second room upon confirmation. The hotel attendandant and I called customer service for support. I felt embarrassed and frustrated with the customer support team. I spoke to Mark and Carlos. Instead of trying to accommodate the hotel and the customer, I was on the phone for 40 minutes while my family waited in the car for a resolve. Mark and Carlos were polite but ineffective with helping us. This is my first time seeking customer service help. It will be my last time as a Hotwire customer. There is always a way to help the customer. The support team agreed the website was not clear, there is a broken system and it is obvious there is a communication breakdown. Even with that, I did not receive satisfactory support."

The first time I used Hotwire, my friend and I got a 5 star room in downtown Dallas for around $90. Once we split the cost, we couldn't believe our good luck. For this trip, I got a decent clean room in Irving Las Colinas for $53 a night for 7 days. No breakfast but free parking and internet. I just booked a room for the third time: got breakfast plus free parking and Internet, $48 a night. Only problem with Hotwire is that you pay in advance. I notice I got better prices if I chopped my stay into one week increments. Even though I need a room for 26 days, I couldn't find good prices for the entire 26 days.

The hotel wasn't that great and all that money tossing got me feeling played.. Sometimes you find good deals but BE CAREFUL and ASK alot of QUESTIONS!!!

I'm not sure if that means that Hotwire won't cover you if something happens or not. In the past when I did buy Hotwire insurance I also bought the agency's insurance too. I don't purchase it any longer. I still give the app a 5 star despite this small issue because idk all the particulars and mostly because we have the option to not buy the in app insurance.

These are where you book a cheap room by star price and they pick the hotel for you. Now you can only use the app to see hot rate deals and not the hotels standard rates. None come out to $100 so the 25 off is a joke and will not work. When you do the hot rate deal they always give you less of a hotel you are ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù and will not give up on changing it.

Also, Hotwires terms and conditions do not align with the hotels terms and conditions. And when someone actually goes wrong the hotel can't even call their internal support number.

This app is better then all the others I think and I have used others but I am staying with Hotwire. I deleted my Priceline app!
624,FatLittleDog,"October 13, 2015",5,"Perfect for road warriors and weekend travelers alike Hotwire is not for everyone.  If you want the security of knowing the hotel before you book, Hotwire's not for you.  But if like me you travel a lot, don't care about points, want to stay in a variety of places, and want the best deals in town- Hotwire is the app for you.  My tip: stay only at 4 stars and above, pay attention to the recommendations (80% and higher only) and read the reviews."
625,HeritageChic,"November 30, 2015",5,"Thanks I typically don't take time to write reviews on Apps (they need to make it a one click process -- are you listening Apple?!). But - feel like I need to with Hotwire. An avid traveler both personally and professionally - I'm always looking for a strong value. I want the best available within my budget. Hotwire always helps me achieve my goals. Easy to use App and the best deals around. Typically they beat the ""express deals"" from Priceline by 20%. Thank you Hotwire!"
626,NYKSetc,"December 31, 2015",5,"Fail proof so far Hotwire continuously provides me the best rates for cars and hotels, and on top of that the phone app is so user friendly, it's the best option out of all the apps to use while traveling and when in unknown areas. You can search by map versus lists making it very easy to identify best options based on location, which is quite a convenience when you are in unfamiliar places. Kayak and Expedia do not work quite as easily. I tried."

628,KgCruz,"April 13, 2016",1,"Nasty,appalling,unrighteous & anti professional!!!! Attention !! Buy a stay I never gave me the option to choose a safe place to put my purchase if I did not like the hotel to cancel. When I got the hotel was rubbish hotel, called to cancel Hotwire and lousy customer service, let me talking to myself, even as I was left mute. Claim and claim and never wanted to give me money. Call the hotel to see if they could do something for me and they said that if you buy stay with Hotwire is they who must answer for my money back. Finally I lost my money because he never wanted to return it Hotwire. As it surprised me was the way I was treated as in customer service and super super fatal misplaced. Anti Professionalism. It really would not recommend anyone applying!"
629,4DD317,"October 2, 2016",5,"Loved and Used for 9 Years Now!!! I haven't had a bad experience, yet, using Hotwire. First time... booked a 4 star hotel after hiking for 10 days in Colorado and  it was amazing!!! Been doing it ever since! That first room was $69 and had a kitchen and the fluffiest bed ever. I don't stay in hotels too often, but, I can always count on Hotwire to find me a great room at a great price. I've found awesome hotel personnel and even had a great time when traveling with my big black lab, Maggie. Thanks, Hotwire!!!"
630,AuburnChopper,"October 18, 2012",5,"Pay Attention...and ENJOY! I've used Hotwire for years. I'm a regional manager that travels multiple nights weekly all over the east coast. Pay attention to reviews, stars and maps. If you DO that, you'll rarely get a dud. GREAT for biz travelers.  You'll save a ridiculous amount of money. Not knowing the name of the hotel is how Hotwire is able to offer the prices. It's not a scam. It just works. If you HAVE to know the name of the hotel, go elsewhere."
631,Unicycledad,"January 15, 2014",2,"Didn't actually save me $, but otherwise ... But otherwise, what service does Hotwire really provide? I'm not sure. It's hard to judge by just one case, so the reader will have to decide based on several of these reports. "
632,Fontranina,"July 24, 2014",5,"How we book hotels! My husband and I take road trips multiple times a year, so we usually stop halfway and use Hotwire to get our hotel. We enjoy the mystery of finding out which hotel we'll be given based on the amount of stars we select and the specified perimeter. We've never been disappointed and we always get a great deal for what we want to pay. It's what we use to book our hotels!"
633,Julm1289,"August 7, 2015",5,"Great App, Great Prices, Easy Business, Awesome Value Just started using the app. Literally was just about to pay $195/day for a rental(their ""best rates"") and decided to go on Hotwire and check out prices..same car, immediate rental, $34/day. This app is great and would suggest using it to book all rental cars. It is a great way to protect yourself from price gouging, and sales representatives trying to play you for a fool and charge inflated prices."
634,Ines3X,"March 18, 2016",5,"Always the best deal and value I've used Hotwire countless times for hotel, car and flights as well as a combination of these for my family and friends. Sometimes the deals are ok but most of the time they are pretty awesome. While the value is always there sometimes it is greater than other times. I've never made a purchase and found it less elsewhere."
635,XtremeS18,"March 31, 2016",5,"Destination Station! What a great app, customer service representatives, and company! I have been an avid user of Hotwire since early 2011. I have never been disappointed by any deal that I come across. This is seriously my go to app upon any travel destination. The unprecedented rates are unbelievable and most times unbeatable. Thanks for making everything an easy transition from one destination to another!"
636,Mr. Goodfella,"April 26, 2016",1,"You Get What You Pay For I have used Hotwire a number of times in hopes of getting a ""deal"". But EVERY SINGLE ""deal"" has been a nightmare. I stopped using them after my last horrific experience at one of their hotrate hotels and decided I'd give it one more shot. Terrible. Terrible mistake. I got the Millennium Hotel on Broadway and the supposed ""free-wifi"" as it was advertised on Hotwire is NOT free. Their service was subhuman. The concierge ""Syed"" was NOT accommodating whatsoever. I asked for a queen and he INSISTED that he has no choice but to give me to double beds. The room smells funny. This is just a nightmare. Please just HOTEL TONIGHT. All the information is ALWAYS straightforward and accurate."
637,Eav09,"May 4, 2016",5,"Loyal Hotwire Customer! My family has been using Hotwire for at least 7 years now. We have booked hotels in several cities throughout the U.S. including numerous Hawaii trips.  We have not been disappointed yet. On one occasion, we got a hotel that blatantly did not match the hotel description on Hotwire's app. Hotwire let us change the hotel because we are loyal customers. Thank you Hotwire!"
638,PrincessA85,"September 27, 2016",5,"Would recommend over Priceline I only use Hotwire through the app. I like that it has Apple Pay capability. I would recommend over Priceline because it has the option to select the number of guests. It's easy to use and I don't get a sense of panic that I might be booking the wrong location, because the information appears on every page through the booking process."
639,Rgmckenz,"October 16, 2016",5,"Quick and easy to use app, great savings! I've used Hotwire for years on the computer, but I have never used the app. Tried it out this time when scheduling a business trip near DC. Unbelievably easy to use, displayed hotels with good detail and booking was quick and efficient. The savings by using hotwire have always been excellent. Will start using the app a lot more now."
640,AK_______47,"October 13, 2012",5,"Finally I have been waiting for Hotwire to release an app for so long, so I was so excited to see this. The app works very smoothly, and is simple to use. The only thing that they are lacking is the choice of whether or not you want a known hotel or not. Besides this however, Hotwire is definitely now contending in the ring with others like Expedia and orbitz."
641,Ladymags,"November 15, 2014",5,"Great search interface and prices App is stable and well designed, has never crashed on me. Was a big Hotwire hot deal hotel user already and the app makes it easier and faster to book! Reading hotel reviews is actually easier to do on the app than the website."
642,CGomez2967,"April 17, 2015",5,"Greatest Hotel Up This is an application I cannot do without. I've been at the vest hotels in NYC, PHI, CHI, SFO, MIA etc for a fraction of their cost. Sometimes below half price. Since you do not know where you are booking, the key is to look at the hotel ratings and their equivalent, this will give you the basis for your selection. The are very strict about the accuracy of the rating. Try it one time and you don't go back."
643,iCam Pix,"June 14, 2015",1,Ridiculous Aap and horrible service Hotwire is bunch of thiefs.. Every Time I booked a hotel using this Aap I end up in the cheapest room in that hotel .

Being able to find travel deals quick, and easily, while doing it affordably, is a feat! Love that it stores my payment info for easy check out. I can find a deal and have confirmation in minutes. Love this app!"
645,More for my money,"July 3, 2015",5,"Best app for travel deals! Hotwire is easy to use and honest about what it offers. I have used Hotwire for hotels many times and have never been disappointed!  The recommended percentage, star rating, and reviews paint a clear picture before you book. I have stayed at amazing properties for less than half the regular rate. This app is essential for anyone who travels and loves a great deal!"
646,Acb1701,"November 20, 2015",5,"Easy to use I love the Hotwire app because it is so easy to use, there are always plenty of options, and great prices even when booking on the same day. I use this traveling a lot. I do have other travel apps open just to make sure I get the best deal, but I always end up purchasing on Hotwire. They truly have the best value-based selections across the country."
647,Humanlink,"December 12, 2015",5,Best Friend from day one I have saved a lot of $$$ since I got this app on my phone on rental cars and on hotel night. My wife and I love traveling at least twice a month just to stay away from city and we have stay in nice hotel for a incredible rate. I have and I will continue recommend it to family and friends. What are you waiting start saving now.
648,Vaachu,"December 21, 2015",4,"Excellent rates and an awesome app Car booking has never been easier or cheaper.. It's just few clicks to get the best options and confirm the booking. Awesome app. Next time m gonna try hotel bookings too.. Hope the app will get  cancelation and modification options too. Also option to choose ""extras"" - like car seats, gps etc. thats the only reason it gets a four instead of five stars from me."
649,Sparty Sailor,"June 20, 2016",5,Easy and fun to use Provides lowest cost hotels. I even think that when you get the name of the hotel after you book provides a little excitement to the process. 
650,The Broseph,"March 31, 2014",5,Easy to use I've had no issues using the app. You just need to be prepared to buy right away. All of these deals are last minute and you need to swoop. Ive taken 3 trips in the last 2 weeks with this app and have been totally satisfied with my experiences. I'm always recommending this app when looking for cheap quality deals.
651,glopezruelas,"May 24, 2014",2,"Ok app, shady company, terrible services The app is limiting (e.g. You can't even register through it).  But the company and its practices are very shady.  Long story short, they charged my bank not, not two, but three different times (and no, it wasn't because I 'clicked' multiple times), AND didn't even provide the service in question (room reservation).  Now I have three approved charges in my cc, and no service to speak of.  To top it off, I can't speak with anybody to help me.  They ""will call me in the next 24-72 hours"").  Are you kidding?"
652,tfkjones,"October 1, 2014",5,Great app and a great service When we drive from Minneapolis to Detroit we always book a hotel in the Chicago area to break up the trip. Hotwire lets us stay in luxurious (for us) accommodations at a budget price.  
653,YoNichol,"October 13, 2014",5,"Best app for booking It takes a little getting used to with regard to booking through hotwire, but once you get it you will wonder how you ever lived without it!  My rule is 3 stars with greater than 80% customer approval and it's never steered me wrong.  I rarely pay over 100/night.  You can't cancel though, so don't book it if you don't know you need it."
654,NC4747,"December 30, 2014",5,"Solid interface, good deals The interface was very easy to use, and significantly easier than using the website via browser on the iPad. Definitely a better experience. Plus, it looks like there are a few app-only promotions running, which makes the sweet deals on Hotwire sweeter. Why NOT try it?"
655,diane pessoa,"February 6, 2015",5,"Hotwire is the way to go! I have always shopped and compared everywhere, but Hotwire goes beyond any other discounted site out there!!

Now that I'm retired, it has been very useful as I've traveled cross country. Not only do I save on whatever type of hotel I book, but I find the reviews very helpful in choosing my hotel."
658,Xoxocj33,"October 30, 2016",5,Love Hotwire!! I've been using Hotwire for about 10 years now. Love that you can read the reviews on the Hotwire app. Only wish you could read the reviews online.

660,Donutsaredabomb777777,"May 30, 2014",5,Loves this app and company! We have been booking with Hotwire for years now (we're preferred members who love to travel) and they have never once let us down. Not everyone is perfect but when there was a bump with them they always fixed it for us. They are amazing! We will continue booking through them forever :)
661,mrsrickson702,"June 6, 2014",5,"Love hotwire I love Hotwire hot rates! Every time I take a little vacation I use them. I like the surprise once I book. I have only had one bad experience and that was not hotwires fault,it was the hotel's fault. Otherwise I have had great stays at many amazing places that would've cost me a lot more if I would've booked directly through the hotel. Thank you Hotwire"

664,Asiakiera,"May 22, 2015",4,Very Useful I really like Hotwire. I've booked rooms through them about three times or four times now. Having the app making everything a lot easier. The only thing is that sometimes it might take a little while to update what's actually available at that time but that might just be the website as a whole as opposed to the app...

I have been very happy with the hotels and locations Hotwire has provided, each time the hotel has been right near where the start of the race is and the price can't be beat. I highly recommend using Hotwire."

Thanks Hotwire"
668,Ckseeg,"July 6, 2016",2,"Downgrade I love the convenience of this app. However, over the last 10 days of traveling, it has failed to complete my transaction with every single reservation I have attempted to make, forcing me to call the help line. Needless to say, that is a very time- consuming process as you endure listening to all the terms and conditions, a repeat of at least 2-3 times what you are reserving and the price to be charged, etc., etc. , etc. I am uninstalling the app and will reinstall in hopes of a reboot. If not‚Ä¶Bye, Bye Hotwire!"
669,Thiedea,"September 15, 2016",5,Love the Hotwire App! I have had great experiences booking with the Hotwire app over the last three years. It's easy to use and the map gives a general idea where the hotel would be found and the lowest priced hotel. It keeps a record of places you've looked previously to make further investigations or bookings easier.

It picks up my profile, sets a default date of today for check-in, defaults to a single night stay, and returns options faster on my phone than the browser.

673,Paradisco86,"March 30, 2015",5,"Better than the actual website! I've been a Hotwire fan for years and I can't believe their app is better and faster than their desktop version.

Hotwire definitely gets a 5-star from me!"
675,Lmbeamer,"November 16, 2015",5,So far so good I literally downloaded this app about 5 minutes ago and finished booking my hotel! It has a user-friendly interface and and even auto-capitalizes words in your address field (which is a pet-peeve of mine). So far there's nothing to complain about so I give this app 5 stars.
676,Roast ripper,"January 26, 2016",5,"Ms. A friend suggested Hotwire two years ago and I have been successfully using the app ever since. Easy, you learn to know what to expect (read user reviews!) and I feel like I always get a good deal.

Keep up the great work Hotwire!!"
678,Sopwqut,"October 16, 2016",5,"Great App Really like this app. Gives you great deals if you're okay with the unknown. Haven't had a bad experience, you get what you select from (star ratings).

I'm writing this review as my family and I sit in the parking lot of our ""reserved and pre paid"" hotel which has zero record of any reservation and is sold out. I have been on the phone for 52 minutes including being hung-up on once and my family and I are still homeless. Beware if you choose to use them you better call and confirm and do their job for them because they aren't doing their job on their end. Good luck and I hope you fair better than we did!"

681,Dr JMC,"February 14, 2015",5,"Love it To anyone who is reading this, Hotwire is the best thing for the customers choice of hotels since the invention of the internet. I am able to stay at a 4 star hotel as little as 86 dollars after taxes. I signed my email with Hotwire and they send great email discounts and I will always use this app for choosing hotels. I love it."
682,Grupert,"March 13, 2015",5,"Excellent App and Site! I use Hotwire anytime I book a hotel and it's always great.

My family loves it!"
683,David Cowart,"May 31, 2015",5,Easy peasy Super easy and convenient. Great deals. Very accurate as to reviews and star ratings. Lots of good tools to use to find the right hotel.

Great deals!

Do your research then book is my advice."
687,Asian Judy,"June 24, 2016",4,I can always count on hotwire Whenever i need a room it shows me the cheapest. I can check by review and hotel stars to know its good and then book without worry.

Never going to use this service again. Low price guarantee my foot. Tried to get a refund, they want me to send them a link for the room (I sent a picture of the bill in my initial email) within 48 hours. Not worth the trouble. Just going to not use Hotwire at all."

I recently started using the app and it was working fine until this month (October). Now when I open the app, it locks up every time until I hit the home button. It's very frustrating when I can't access my information. I will probably delete this app and just print my information from the website. This app is a major disappointment since I really like using Hotwire."

Loved some of the extras at the Colonnade - free water bottles - nice bath rug - the little light that you could turn on to show ""do not disturb"" and other things such as luxury bed and the green line subway just outside the door."
700,Mattmcmatters,"October 18, 2012",5,Great app!  Has already saved me a bunch! This is a great app for those who travel in the car a lot from city to city. Just wait til the morning of and then search the area you're looking to stay in. You will almost always find a really nice room for a deeply discounted price. Love this app!
701,IronHorn11,"May 29, 2014",5,"Absolute Lifesaver!! I travel nearly every week for either business or visitation with my kids, and I flat-out could NOT do it without the deals that Hotwire has found! The deals that they have found for me have saved me ridiculous amounts of money on AMAZING hotels! They are a truly a life/budget saver!!"
702,DJ2333,"February 9, 2015",5,Life Saver!! I NEVER write reviews but Hotwire saved me today. I start a new job tomorrow and my reservation with other company was cancelled at the last min and other companies were like $15 more expensive. Not what I wanted to dress about. Checked out Hotwire and received an AMAZING last min deal. This will be my go to app now!! THANK YOU!!!
703,BigNation,"March 29, 2015",5,Well-designed Smooth app for deal hunters -- only suggestion is the need to be able to access the Trip Advsior rating for each hotel as can be seen on the full site. This will help to better identify the hotel and get a better consensus rating outside of Hotwire reviewers.
704,CajunKate,"August 5, 2015",5,"Super! Easy to use and super efficient after initial set up. I've used Hotwire forever, and the only thing that I don't like is not being able to choose the type of bed when you book at most of their hotels. Weirdly, I love the ""surprise"" of finding out what hotel I get."
705,Fli-pop,"January 20, 2016",4,"Great, with one exception.... I use the Hotwire app frequently for hotels, but when it comes to booking cars it is not as user friendly as the car rental websites if you need to take the car one way (not returning to same pickup location). If they gave the option for one-way car rentals it would be better."
706,DPinedo,"February 26, 2016",5,"I use it almost every time I travel Either booking a hotel or rental car, I usually book through Hotwire. I keep trying other apps including hotel rewards programs, but I end up saving the most money using Hotwire. Still best booking app out there."
707,Beal9000,"July 30, 2016",1,"Awful experience My wife and I did a Last Minute Booking and received a confirmation from Hotwire. 45 minutes later we get a phone message from Hotwire saying that the hotel is overbooked and that we need to call back to that they can ""assist"" us. "
708,Spillmore,"August 26, 2016",5,Love this app! The best app for booking hotels and cars. The deals are unreal. I just booked a 4.5 star hotel in San Francisco for $150 a night. I use this app all the time for my business and leisure travel. It's simple and keeps track of all my trips in the account page. You must give it a try!
709,CaliPaula,"September 13, 2016",5,"Great App Works great and helps for business travel and pleasure trips.  The only flaw I've seen is that sometimes places are rated higher than they should be, but only off by one star.  Most of the time the places are a real bargain, and great places to stay.  We always opt for 3 stars and above."
710,yapishkahilt,"January 26, 2014",2,"What fees are included? When selecting a hotel to book, the total price includes the rate listed plus ""taxes and fees."" No detail is provided about the tax/fee charge, but for NYC, which is supposed to have a tax/fee rate of close to 14%, the actual amounts listed by Hotwire are around 30%. So while the actual room rate for the hotels at which I looked were somewhat better on Hotwire than the hotels' websites, the extra 15% cancels out any savings and makes the total Hotwire cost higher."
711,Serita86,"June 5, 2014",5,$2 cheaper than website and number of people option It's cheaper than using the website. Also I love that you can specify how many people are in a room. Other websites like Priceline only guarantee that each room will fit two people.
712,Faidwyn,"November 3, 2014",5,Best hotel app Love this app. Traveled across the country booking rooms when I needed to stop. App has never let me down. I always check the actual hotel cost and it's always less. I write this while staying in a beautiful room. The app saved me about 90 dollars a night. 5 stars!!!
713,Miss Nina,"January 7, 2015",5,"My ""go to"" travel booking app Hotwire's mobile app is so easy to use that one time my sister and I didn't even book our hotel room until we landed at our destination. We got a great deal instantly! It's easy to use and not cluttered. I've been using Hotwire since 2008."
714,mspammiepie,"March 26, 2015",5,"Great app for travel deals! Easy to navigate and use. I recommend doing your homework on the secret rate hotels on a computer first, then book on the app. I've been able to use app only promo codes that gave added savings to the already significant savings."
715,Jenniferjojo,"May 1, 2015",5,Stellar This app has literally saved me thousands of dollars. The hotels are never under par and I always seem to wind up getting Crowne Plaza rooms (hotel of choice) for even cheaper than the government rate any hotel offers. I can't not wait to start using the cars version of the services.
716,ghaselton,"May 31, 2015",5,Works well Very easy to used and worked well for me. I just wish it had a credit card scanning feature like some things do where you don't have to punch in the number. But it saves it after the first time so no worries.
717,Kilpaba,"August 29, 2015",5,"Incredibly useful Traveling a lot for work, I am constantly having to book flights, hotels and cars.  The prices are always outstanding but the app makes it so easy to book I can rent a car from my phone while sitting on the Tarmac.  Lifesaver."
718,johns432,"September 17, 2016",1,"Hotwire needs to exclude inferior car rentals I've been a Hotwire user for about 10 years, but I won't be using it again for car rentals. They need a feedback system where ultimately they can exclude a supplier if the reviews are poor enough. Advantage car rental in Houston (IAH) is hideously bad, and they keep appearing. Furthermore, I don't feel like I have an *easy* mechanism to give feedback about this experience. Clean up your act Hotwire. You provide a useful service for the most part, but seriously, clear the chaff!"
719,@Mac.graham on IG,"July 6, 2017",4,"Great in many different ways, but not perfect I've gotten great deals using Hotwire. I got a 4 star resort (the Salishan Spa and Golf Resort for $96) and it was amazing! Got a suite at Crowne Plaza Seattle Downtown for $84. My only complaint is that when I go to book a room sometimes, it will say ""something went wrong, try again later"" otherwise, I haven't had any problems!"
720,JV127,"January 24, 2014",5,"Easy, and saved big! Not sure why people a rating this low. So easy to use and saved big. If the complainers can't operate this app then they probably shouldn't have a smartphone at all. "
721,Bookwyrm Les,"June 14, 2014",5,"Great app for great deals! A great app for using my favorite travel site, and the app keeps getting better with every release. And so do the deals! I just booked a room at one of the nicest resorts in Carmel for HALF what everyone else listed it as. So what if I wasn't sure which hotel it was ahead of time. Pure awesome!"
722,MindNSoul7,"December 25, 2014",1,"Avoid Hotwire Blind bids Not long ago you actually were able to get decent deals using the Hotwire bidding system, however these days it's a real sham only for fools looking to get ripped off. "
723,Art1867,"January 3, 2015",4,"Love the improvements! The app is so much smoother now. Choosing cities, even satellite suburbs, is easy. Switching between payment methods was glitchy before but is so simple now. I travel for work and also to see family, so I'm booking hotels on a regular basis. This app is easier than using the browser on my desktop. Bravo!"
724,RevDr On The Go,"January 5, 2015",5,"Great website & now great app! I've used Hotwire for years for both business and personal travel, and I've never found any other site that can come close to the deals I get, especially on hotels.  And this app is just icing on the cake!  Highly recommended."
725,Stan junior,"February 2, 2015",5,Better than the website I got the same deals as the website but found the app so much easier to navigate especially sorting through the maps and details of various hotels.

728,mpahrich,"January 13, 2016",5,"Love, love, love this app! We have saved a ton of money using Hotwire over the years. The app runs great on my iphone6 and allows me to browse and book upcoming stays while traveling. We do try to only book 3 star and above with at least 80% recommended, but that is personal preference."
729,Rockridgeman,"March 30, 2016",5,"Easy to use, great hotel prices I've been using Hotwire for years, and this app now makes it easy to check prices and book rooms. It even easily linked into my calendar to upload all of the info on my stay."
730,ToddGFox,"June 18, 2013",5,"Bait and switch This app seems to think its ethical to hide bogus local up charges for resort fees, pets or anything else imaginable. Then a worthless customer service agent answered my dissatisfaction by pointing me to some nebulous web fine print.  In case you don't know it Hotwire you're not the only girl at the dance."
731,Chess Noob,"February 15, 2014",2,"Needs work Can't see standard rate hotels like on the website. I was using the in app feedback feature but you can't even submit feedback because it disappears after writing more than two lines of text and even when I tried not writing more than two lines the submit button disappeared. It need some work, just sayin. I'll check back in a few months but for now it's getting deleted."
732,Willwiggs,"September 1, 2014",4,"Great! I use this app for business travel all the time. It's great, I love the way it gets hotels based in your location as this is just what I need when stopping somewhere! The only bad thing about this app is the rental car system only allows round trip bookings and not one way. I use the website for the car.."
733,Drusmith's,"September 23, 2014",5,Traveling Salesman I use this site weekly for just about every single night I stay in a hotel. You cannot beat the prices with any other website besides Priceline but I find Hotwire to be easier and faster to use with this app.  Just booked the Radisson at The Mall of America for $55+tax. So epic! 
734,Jhlparis,"March 22, 2015",4,Kayak app is really great - one tiny improvement Extremely easy to use and intuitive. One improvement would be after filtering for neighborhood/area if you could re-open that filter to amend it instead of re-launching search.
735,StevenM2230,"April 1, 2015",2,"Costs more than website! I really do like this app and Hotwire in general. Almost 3/4 of my hotel stays are booked using Hotwire. Most people I talk to aren't aware of the cost difference between the app and the website. The cost on the app is usually only a couple dollars more, which I certainly don't mind paying. Today I booked a 3.5 star hotel using the website on my iPhone. Cost was 98 plus taxes and fees. Same room on the app was $18 more."
736,The best hurricane app,"May 28, 2015",5,"Fast, efficient and money saving Had a reservation at the airport, but it didn't work out and I thought I would be stuck with no car. Whipped out my phone, signed into Hotwire and 5 minutes later I was driving out with a rental. Excellent!"

It's so easy to open the app the day before or the day of travel and have a conveniently located room books in 2 minutes at an incredible rate at a sensational hotel. The app gives me all the info I need to make decision, with map & reviews."
738,Skier658,"August 30, 2015",4,"Long time user Great app, never had any issues. It allows you to use the full search and filtering features of the website. Lost 1 star because customer service takes FOREVER to get ahold of and when transfering you they ALWAYS disconnect me (or hang up on me?) (I usually only call to make a complaint)"
739,jmquay,"September 28, 2016",5,"Quick and easy I travel a lot, and make last minute reservations a lot as well. I've only used the app twice, but so far it's actually easier than using the website. I'll keep using it to be sure."
740,Jklimz,"October 10, 2012",5,Perfectly done for mobile What a great way to transform an online product to a mobile environment. Map functionality for hotel areas is great! Even though I am booking opaque I feel like I have a great sense of where I will be staying. Well done!
741,Heavyglee1,"January 31, 2015",5,Love Hotwire Almost like a game trying to figure out which hotel we are going to get. Only complaint is you can't choose king or double beds. Also I think some hotels put you in less desirable rooms than if you purchase direct from hotel.
742,Beachgal88,"March 18, 2015",2,"Won't give hotel name Trying to find hotel in San Francisco. Every time  I click one, I get message that rate has dropped and hotel won't give name until you book. I have been hotel searching for 3 days and what I see is, pay over $350 a night or stay in dump for $175. I would NOT book a SF hotel sight unseen. Until Hotwire tells me the name of the super, super great place to stay, I'm only giving it 2 stars. Mad and disappointed !"
743,Tnwillits1,"July 2, 2015",5,"It's great. Makes booking travel convenient, fast, inexpensive, and easy. Do yourself a favor and understand the no refund policies when booking. Once you've made your mind up, and hit BOOK NOW, it's done. So make your mind up and be content with your decision!"

745,Kalidas2.0,"May 30, 2016",5,"Great deals Takes the thinking and effort out of the process of finding best bang for the buck. Stayed at $160 per night hotel (quote given by front desk when I tried to add a night) for $69. Was going to KOA it tonight, but with such a good deal, couldn't pass it up. Just booked $57 at Holiday Inn Express. Love this!"
746,Tiffany Be,"June 26, 2016",1,"Do not use!! Be aware this is a FRUAD! I booked a hotel through this, I got something different then promised, they called the hotel to ask if it is in fact not in the location they said it was and the hotel confirmed that it wasn't!! They refused to do anything about it and made my vacation horrible. No customer service and no one to speak to if there is a mistake they just don't care about you after they take your money. Do your self a favor and stay away!!!!!!!!"
747,Thanks so much for this app (:,"June 28, 2016",4,Great last min booking app. Works well to find you a good deal especially last minute by showing important details and laying out the locations of the prospective places. Paying and confirmation is a cinch. Better deals than going there and trying to wrestle best price from the front desk!
748,ErolM,"October 1, 2016",5,"Convenient and simple Very easy to use, even though you don't know the name of the hotel until you book they provide more than enough info to make sure you'll be happy with your decision!"

I was in San Francisco and tried booking a hotel three times, all failed and yet they took my money, leaving me almost with lack of cash while am on trip!"

765,JSTNv,"September 18, 2015",5,Hands down the best hotel app.. After searching other similar apps for hotel prices not one could ever get a better rate like Hotwire did. Similar apps would still be $15-$30 more then Hotwire. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck Hotwire's the app for ya!
766,tbdigital,"December 1, 2015",4,"Simple and To the Quick Point I use this every week for car rentals and it's easy enough to do as I board the plane.

776,Fishin JD,"April 18, 2015",4,"Great App We've had good luck every time we've used this app. You have to read the reviews of the hotels though, and prices due fluctuate up and down the closer you get to check in.

780,Firecat Sue,"April 8, 2014",5,"Easiest of the discount hotel apps I've used Priceline, Travelocity's opaque hotels, and Hotwire, and I prefer Hotwire for ease of use, and when comparing, the rates on all three are the same. Also, they add you fairly quickly to a preferred customer level, which made me happy."
781,Royalthomas,"May 21, 2015",4,Great App Great app. Use it often for rooms. It's much better than Trivago and Priceline and pretty much zeros in on the area. The only disappointment is that the rates are always changing and when you find a good deal read all reviews but take in consideration of as many as you can to get the consistency.
782,Cheapb@st@rd,"September 1, 2015",4,Great deals with some hassles I have found that the deals that I get through hotwire to be fantastic. My only complaint is sometimes when you check into hotels they treat you like a third class citizen when they find out you used Hotwire. Overall a great app.
783,Steph5280,"September 1, 2015",5,Easy to use! Never had any issues and it's so easy to book anything! Only thing I learned is to never book a hotel less than 4 stars since you never know what you are going to get!
784,zidaho,"January 7, 2016",5,"Still the best way to rent a car! Hotwire has consistently been the best deal when it comes to finding a car. Easy to use, wide selection of vehicle options, and straight forward pricing. Thank you."

788,FabinLA,"August 13, 2016",5,Good deal if you research first I always research the area first by checking out the prices of the hotels through other websites. I never select anything below 3.5 star rating unless it has at least and 85% customer recommendation.
789,marmota m,"October 7, 2016",5,It's to be able to book from the road. We're often on the road and not sure how far we'll get. It's useful to be able to book while we're driving.
790,NobHillBillies,"December 1, 2012",5,Fast & Efficient I didn't think I would use this app as much as I have.  Quick last minute rooms for me and for my family has been a great help.  The app is also fast and intuitive - easy to use.
791,Dmelder,"March 27, 2014",5,Quick and Easy It's very simple to use and takes no time at all. I have used it multiple times and have never had any horror stories. As long you book 3 star and above you should be pleased.

793,Marylu80,"March 13, 2015",5,Great booking experience I've used Hotwire for almost two years and I haven't had a bad experience AT ALL. One time I did have an inconvenience with a hotel and Hotwire took care of the situation IMMEDIATELY. I continue and will continue to book with Hotwire.
794,Baby doll88,"June 9, 2015",5,Great This is very easy and you get amazing deals on 4 star hotels. Got a 4 star hotel for 108 for just one night compared to other sites where it was around $300 a night. Will always use this to book a hotel.
795,Tokai1980,"January 18, 2016",5,"The Good Kind of Gambling Hotwire hasn't steered me wrong yet.  I see it as a bit of a sport, actually. That very moment immediately after booking...: it's akin the watching the ball spin around the roulette wheel (although your odds are much better right here).  Good times."
796,Karic720,"February 28, 2016",5,"Scared at first My husband and I were so scared because it was our first time using Hotwire ever and we just needed specific criteria at a good price and we got it! I'm so excited about the deal and the app was so easy to use, I even used Apple Pay!"
797,uzumbi,"March 23, 2016",5,iPhone app fast and easy App does not show reservations in my trips when purchase is made from desktop.  The desktop and iPhone app should be interchangeable with this info.  Otherwise love it.
798,TechD@d,"April 12, 2016",5,Saved me in Tokyo I arrived in Tokyo 2 weeks ago without a place to stay. My trip had been planned for me except for lodging at one stop and I forgot about it. I was able to book a great place at a great price while in line for customs!
799,StephTRod,"July 23, 2016",4,Easy to use but has some glitches I frequently book hotels on Hotwire- it's the only way I reserve nowadays. The app makes it easier because it saves my recent searches and they also have promo codes that are exclusive to booking through the app.
800,Smks13,"October 8, 2013",1,Charged for a booking that 'failed' Tried booking a hotel and received 2 'booking failed' messages. Finally booked a separate hotel and checked in. Later received a confirmation email for the hotel from the 'booking failed' attempt. Called customer support and was told I would be charged regardless and I should try and get out of the current hotel I was at. I have used the Hotwire website for years but this app is crap.
801,Stellading,"January 24, 2014",5,Better prices than the website I read these reviews and decided to check their website instead of the app. I actually got better prices in the app. Used my 25 discount on top of that... So I'm happy.
802,Love the Pics!,"June 28, 2014",5,Best app for finding great deals! I've used app several times (a lot of times last minute) and have always gotten great prices on very nice hotels. I will definitely be referring my friends and family to this service!
803,Infinitepuppybear,"February 19, 2015",5,Fantastic and easy to use All other booking apps for flights and everything else fail when it comes to this simple and extremely smooth app. I love it and you save a ton of money!!
804,alwaysmy,"March 5, 2015",5,"Great, intuitive app I used the app to take advantage of their $25 off promo. I felt obligated to leave a five-star review after using the app. It was fast, easy and user friendly. I know I will use it again in the future as well. Thanks Hotwire!"
805,Gamble3866,"June 19, 2015",5,"Love this app I could research hotels for hours and never make a decision. I love putting in my basic parameters and Hotwire always chooses me somewhere amazing. I could never afford to stay at a five star hotel normally, but Hotwire makes it happen regularly. Love it!"
806,therman123,"July 5, 2015",5,Easy and great value I almost always get a 4+ star hotel for less than $100/night. I usually wait until the day I need the hotel -- seems like the deals are better. The app is super easy! I'm hooked!
807,Eyethere,"December 14, 2015",5,"Great UI and for last min deals I used this one and Priceline. I liked both about the same for deals - worth checking both, but this one has a better user experience."
808,Voodoo Undertow,"April 4, 2016",4,"Need ability to add car seat from app I like the new app, great UI and easy to use. However, I was unable to reserve a car seat with my reservation- it was not an option. Would make it much easier in future to compare rates with car seat."
809,Ketchup Fingers,"May 14, 2016",5,"Great app, useful for certain situations Got the same hotel I was going to book elsewhere for waaaaay cheaper using hotwire, but only because the location has very few hotel choices! Results may vary."
810,Praveen Gurram,"January 5, 2014",5,Hotwire is a great value If you are looking for value Go Hotwire. You may sometimes not like the surprise but more often than not you will like it if you book by looking at the % customer recommendations.
811,Vadik1979,"January 24, 2014",5,Hotwire is solid! A+++ Downloaded the app to get $25 off my hotel purchase... Transaction went smooth! The app is super simple and easy to use! I hope Hotwire will come up with more deals like this in the future! Thank you Hotwire!
812,DandTO,"February 16, 2014",2,"Lacking in features On the road and looking for a pet friendly hotel.  It would be nice to be able to filter by that.  Also need to specify that I need two beds and can't seem to find how to do that.  Hey developers, we users need an app that makes it easy to find a hotel that fits our needs and not just one that gives the lowest price without regard to our requirements."
813,Jost or bust,"July 18, 2014",5,"Love it! Hotwire beats another booking place which shall remain unnamed due to overbooking, and even THEIR COMPANY credit card being declined!!! Hotwire saved us at the last minute, my wedding party got the rooms they needed. Thank you Hotwire for saving me $$$ and being reliable."
814,Papaspot,"January 16, 2015",4,"Nice app, needs excludes. I love the app, it's easy to find great deals and checkout, however there is no way to exclude certain hotels you don't want, which would be nice, and no way to know which hotel you're getting until after you commit, which is kinda scary."
815,Amersmanders,"May 19, 2015",5,I've never had a bad experience with Hotwire Their customer service is really great when I've called to verify whether places accepted pets or other special considerations before booking and they really are well priced.
816,aejiii,"July 20, 2015",5,Quick and Easy ... Not Bugs Set my account up first on the full website via my laptop. Needed a car quick so I downloaded the app as I wasn't at my desk. 
817,Juvemerda forever,"September 5, 2015",1,"Fraud I booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children and I got a king bedroom. The hotel showed me that Hotwire change the initial reservation from two beds to one to get a better rate. They ruined my vacation to increase their profit. I needed to spend over 2 hours on the phone to be finally attended and they said: "" we guarantee the number of guests but not the number of beds?!?"" "
818,omorin1,"May 2, 2016",5,"Great deals every time Tried to book at our favorite hotel in Seattle. The hotel was showing $249 plus tax. /night. Checked out Hotwire, decided to book this 4.5star hotel, got the Hotel in the first place for $154 tax included. Thanks Hotwire!!"
819,Leventozturk,"June 17, 2017",5,"Scammers, DO NOT DOWNLOAD They cancelled our reservation without asking me. I called the customer service and they said the reservation fee is non refundable. They literally captured my money for making me find another hotel. They steal money do not download it"
820,tateep,"October 11, 2012",4,Good start. Living out of a suitcase just got easier. 
821,Shroeder14,"October 12, 2012",5,"Finally!! Excellent app!!  I use Hotwire frequently & LOVE it.  I often search & have been waiting for Hotwire to create an app...  the wait was worth it.  The app is extremely well designed, simple to use & hasn't crashed."
822,KI4ANR,"August 30, 2014",5,Love this App! Never been dissatisfied with any of the selections that were offered. Easy to navigate and simple to book. Tried all the other ones and always come back to this!
823,SGTC3P0,"March 5, 2015",5,You need this app This app has saved me both time and money at this point.  I just booked a long weekend vacation for the price I would normally pay for a single night. And I'm not exaggerating!
824,Jungle Cat,"April 7, 2015",5,"Great App Just when I thought Hotwire couldn't get any better, I found this app. Great to use while on the road. Also easy to use, maybe even more so than the website itself."
825,Dakotamangus,"July 21, 2015",5,I'm a last minute Hotwire addict now I travel to SF several times a month and I use this pretty much exclusively to book last minute. It's not uncommon to land a 4 star in fidi for under $100. Apps clean and simple to use.
826,AlexanderLevi2,"October 29, 2015",5,"Great App! Last minute planner for trips over here. Used the app to get a cheap hotel. It ended up being great and right next to where our concert is going to be on Friday! Thanks, Hotwire. Made our plans much less stressful!"
827,Biznizman,"February 19, 2016",5,"The App works tremendously well-now with Apple Pay I don't know if the prices are the absolute best, but certainly good if you like to live dangerously on your choice of hotels, but the app works just like you would want it to."
828,Montbleau,"April 4, 2016",5,Great service I love Hotwire.  I lead a band on the road and book almost all of our hotel rooms through this.  The deals are great and whenever I need help from Hotwire they always seem to come through.
829,MK2100,"May 24, 2016",5,"Have used this app for years No long review here. Works great. Hotwire itself is a different model but I like the price breaks and the ""adventure"" aspect of finding new places. I've used Hotwire for years and years and I'm happy with it."
830,DavidSF41,"April 15, 2013",5,Easy to find Last minute deals I love the map feature on the app it makes it easier then even the website to find the deal I'm looking for. Thanks!
831,pechartier,"June 28, 2013",5,Beautiful and simple Beautiful experience allowing you to shop cities through a map interface. Easy to see where the deals are in a city!
832,triniboi69,"January 27, 2015",5,I use it all the time. Can't find a simpler and more interactive hotel finder app. It's clean and extremely user friendly. But the best part is truly the secret deals. Stay loyal to Hotwire and get into it- saves u tons!! Thank you Hotwire!
833,ggr001,"February 11, 2015",5,"A great app and a great price/quality I have used this app for several years, always with great success. Usage in Washington and Chicago in particular has been excellent. "
834,Spikyjon,"June 5, 2015",5,"Great prices, Super easy! Tried booking online first and then saw there was an app. Got the app and was surprised at how easy it was. And at a better hotel than what I was expecting. Definitely recommend!"
835,Mercutio's Mab,"August 17, 2015",5,"Ease of use I always appreciate being able to fly through a booking process. I often use rental cars and hotels but don't need a plane ticket every time, so this app is perfect!"
836,diwahar,"December 24, 2015",1,"Worst customer service and app Even though the prices are cheap. You don't have option to select smoking or non smoking room, finally ended paying 15$ extra for a non smoking room which doesn't justify the cheap price listed. So it finally goes to standard price. Worst customer service they have I need to dial to them 8 times continuous and each time the call would end abruptly with out any response."
837,Jahjahbrown,"December 31, 2015",5,So far so good Hi AMA Priceline but your price convert! So far I like hot wire a lot better. His seems to be more consistently good the surprises! I haven't had to deal with how our customer service yet but it couldn't possibly be any worse than Priceline!
838,Hdchc,"July 23, 2016",5,"The best app to find a place to stay What I love about this app is that I can filter the results by specific amenities like Internet, Parking or Breakfast."

844,Jamskaff,"March 19, 2015",5,Fantastic I use this app and service frequently and I have always been pleased. Occasionally pleasantly surprised by what a great room I got for a low price. The app is easy to use and so convenient on the go.

849,Didi Bones,"August 7, 2017",1,"Just about the worst travel app ever Overbooked me, so I had to call them so they would get me another hotel. They book me somewhere else, DOUBLE CHARGE me, then once I get there it's AGAIN OVERBOOKED! So now I have more than 50% of my credit card charged, with no room to spend the night. Had to deal with them for 1.5 hrs at 11:30pm to cancel the over bookings and get my refund. Avoid this app at all costs. Nice customer service agents, but TERRIBLE system."

854,PasadenaBunch,"August 6, 2015",5,"Small fix needed Love Hotwire, love the app...however, I couldn't use my HotDollars on the app today when I checked out. I looked several places so if it's there it needs to be easier to find. Thanks!!"

857,An Alaskan Ginger,"March 8, 2016",4,I would marry this app! I love this app! Great deals on cars and hotels with a little mystery thrown in. If Odin and Thor got into the travel business and forged a way to book your own private stay in Valhalla this the app that would be created. Its your own personal Rainbow Bridge to great savings and stays. DO IT!

866,Ganviabfk134,"March 26, 2016",1,"Hotwire Hell Don't use this app. It's a scam and they are rude and take your money. We used this for a hotel deal, and besides charging us $24 dollars more than the hotel rate, the customer service was terrible. We asked to speak to the supervisor, and they ignored our request and called the hotel instead. Never using it again, what a waste of my time calling all these people trying to fix their screw-ups."

912,Mmking89,"March 10, 2014",5,Great for finding hotel deals I use this app whenever I'm booking a hotel. I haven't been disappointed yet and I've used it quite a few times!
913,Gregory R_93,"April 20, 2014",5,"Good deals, 18-20 traveler friendly. On almost every listing, the app and website list the minimum check in age. Although listing an age over 18 is illegal in many states, hotels still do it"

Was on hold with Hotwire over 30 minutes on the first call and 10 minutes on the 2nd call until the problem was resolved!  Very disappointed!!!!  It took over an hour to get checked in!!!!
921,Farrisconst,"June 2, 2014",5,Weekend warrior Hot wire is the cheapest of all hotel apps and when they over booked us they made up for it and then some.  I've searched all the prices and hotwire is always the best and best quality hotels
922,Purecatharsis,"January 12, 2015",4,Great but could be better So far it's a great app but I wish I could have the option to pay with PayPal like if I'm using the Mac/Pc device. The coupon where you get 25 off more for using the app for the first time is awesome.

939,Roanie1012,"August 3, 2016",3,"Hit or Miss I used to use Hotwire all the time. Now, when traveling, it's hit or miss on them. Their star ratings for hotels are all over the board. I appreciate the good deals they get but it's anyone's guess what the state of the hotel will be. Always read hotel reviews and please write reviews!"
940,Kurt Feick,"February 25, 2013",5,Hotwire iPhone Application Remembers login info so it is the fastest way to confirm a hotel transaction and to find a hotel on the spot from your current location. Works brilliantly and perfect for road warriors.

I found a good deal on my laptop and tried to book using the app but the same hotel wouldn't come up. I called Hotwire and they confirmed certain results are excluded on the app - and they refused to give the $25 off on the hotel I wanted to book. False and misleading. I'm deleting thus app.

Over and over again in 5 different devices I have tried it. What the heck is wrong with this app. It's completely useless. I'm going to exclusively use Priceline. I have have these problems on it. üò°

Hotwire does nothing and by now it's after midnight and I can't even book another room. They did give m a $25 credit for my next booking which I just made, but it ignored the credit. The India call center is the worst. They don't care about their customers at all."

975,Professor Petey,"October 31, 2015",4,The best deals for rental cars DC I rent often and always shop around for the best deals. Hotwire usually kills the competition with the lowest rates around. Sometimes they're even better than using my corporate discounts.
976,Tucson Graphix,"May 14, 2016",1,The worst booking I ever had in my life It's the worst booking of my life everything is disgusting towels are nasty bed was used walked in smelled like dog urine I won't be able to sleep tonight that's for sure very disappointed in hotwire and would like my money back or a comped night.

983,Sassy Man,"January 15, 2014",1,"Totally pointless Since any time you use this app, you could just as easily be at their website, what's the point? It gives you a fraction of the features of the website, runs slower, shows less results, and the results it did show were more expensive initially then at the website. I got my 25 buck credit, and deleted."

1006,peter v g,"January 23, 2016",5,Works The downside is not knowing the hotel until booking but the cost is what matters. At least the ratings are available as a guide
1007,Swager12,"July 23, 2016",1,BEWARE:SCAM! This app and whole service is trash it charged me 70 dollars for a hotel and I didn't get a hotel then when I tried getting in contact with them to figured out my hotel they put me on hold for 20 min 4 times in a row and then one lady awnsered and then I got sent to 5 different rental places that were not even frecking hotel rental don't buy from here I'm telling it's bad

1018,Airdesignn,"May 24, 2016",1,Horrible App and Unethical Company Be careful of sharing your data and credit card information with this app. Hotwire will charge your card and will provide an inferior product to what they show on the app. They will never answer emails hoping you will go away and their overseas call center just wants to sell you hotel stays. Terrible user experience.
1019,KendraBP,"June 27, 2016",5,"Great deals on great hotels They've never steered me wrong. I've used Hotwire to stay at 4 star hotels at 2 or 3 star prices so far in Orlando, Washington DC, and Myrtle Beach. I just booked a $265/ night room for $175 that's a killer deal."

So NOT using their service again!"

I called to be moved to an actual 4 star hotel and they told me that they use a different star system from the rest of the world and they would not move me and I could not get a refund. They lied and shoved it in my face. Shame on this awful company. Do not use. They are not honest."

Hotwire phone number put me on hold forever with and never get to the right person to get my hotel switch out or refund. Do not use this app."
1098,Hotel less,"April 1, 2017",1,Deserves NO STARS Don't waste your money using Hotwire. They don't accurately reflect the amenities at hotels. We recently booked a hotel over others because Hotwire represented  it had a pool for use. This was not true. To me it seems fraudulent to misrepresent amenities. I booked the hotel and spent more because of listed amenities. Contacted customer service and didn't receive a response.
1099,954runner,"June 28, 2017",1,Horrible Rooms Be cautious about getting hotels on Hotwire. They are cheaper but the hotels always give you the worst rooms they have.  I have used it a lot because it's cheaper but out of ten hotels two have had a working air conditioner. I'm sitting in a hotel room tonight I got off Hotwire and the ac doesn't work. I will never use this again for a hotel

Perhaps I just don't know the ways of these things, but I personally am not comfortable with the idea of booking a hotel room at the ""discounted"" rate when I can't see what the room looks like or even exactly where it's at until I book the room. That seems pretty sketchy to me."

2086,EK Publishing Media,"October 23, 2015",1,"Charge and THEN TRY TO book???!!! Hotwire has always been a pretty decent app for me. This time, I had a pretty good deal lined up, and in the time it took to input my payment information and book the hotel, they gave me a snarky ""sorry, good deals go fast, try again."" message. And then  I check my bank account and they charged it!!! 220$ charge AND THEN they attempted to book the hotel. It should be, secure the hotel and then charge my account, not the other way around. I didn't mess around and leave the app, it was just in the time it took to make sure my info was accurate. I called customer support and they said it would be back in my account in 3 to 4 business days, but meanwhile I'm out the $220 I was going to spend on a hotel! The representative asked if I wanted her to book a hotel for me at $50 more than I had initially planned to pay since the same thing might happen again if I used the app. Sorry, fool me once, shame on me. You're telling me that in 5 minutes it went from $150 to $200??? Get your programming right and give people a time limit to secure a room or something so they're not GAMBLING against the  speed of other customers. That's just unbelievably unfair. Even movie theaters have a 5 minute time limit to order your tickets, and that's on a far smaller scale than hundreds of dollars. I advise anyone who is going to gamble on this to make sure you have your info already in there and move as fast as you can because you're racing against others. Absolutely ridiculous."

That was a lie and operator didnt care. Other than that, deal was decent. Lets see how the stay will go..."
2233,blip1026,"March 7, 2020",1,"Hotwire.com is in the business of MISLEADING guests If you read a majority of the complaints filed with the bbb, most of them are about the ""Hot Rate"" deals... A majority of people complain of being misled, and when asking for help or guidance, are told ""Our Hot Rate rentals are deeply discounted, and as such, are booked as final and non-refundable... We obtain deeply discounted rates in exchange for guaranteed reservations. If our partners can be absolutely confident reservations will be used as sold, they are willing to offer reduced rates."" - this is a direct quote from a complaint written 2/14/20.

I‚Äôve been using Hotwire for several years, but lately I‚Äôve noticed every time I got a hot deal or a secret deal, I ended up getting a hotel that was cheaper on booking.com and sometimes cheaper on its own Hotwire site/app."
2236,journiebuescher,"November 20, 2019",2,"First time user on Hotwire.com I recently booked a hotel through Hotwire while looking for a new apartment, I was there for about 2 months, and It was supposed to be a cheaper way to go, for the first week it was fine, but after that first week the price kept changing, it got higher and cost me more, when I questioned the price change, the clerk informed me that they accidentally checked me out , which resulted clicking me out of my prior in advance 30-60 day reservations I‚Äôd booked with Hotwire ."
2237,FattzBuhhda,"October 13, 2019",1,1st time user Straight unprofessional! I booked through Hotwire for the first time and my expert has been nothing less than horrible. They haven‚Äôt sent me to a hotel that requires a 100.00 CASH deposit that they didn‚Äôt make me aware of. Now they won‚Äôt change me to another room now will they give me my money back. IF I HAD KNOWN I COULD HAVE PREPARED but because i have been stuck in Atlanta for 3 days because my car broke down I don‚Äôt HAVE IT. Smh never using again.
2238,sdshepston,"October 9, 2019",3,What happened to flights? I just switched to IOS from Android... No flights on Hotwire? Is that an IOS thing?  If so that‚Äôs not good.

2240,MacAtak80,"December 11, 2018",1,Hot Rate is not even lukewarm! I used to be an avid user of Hotwire and it‚Äôs app but I found out that their ‚ÄúHot Rate‚Äù is only an illusion. And their low price guarantee is a sham. I found the same hotel on booking.com for cheaper. And they wouldn‚Äôt refund me the difference after their customer service rep told me to send in a screenshot of the price. Two days later they told me they couldn‚Äôt match the price because there was no dates on the screenshot and there were no taxes and fees listed (guess they couldn‚Äôt deduce that the total cost minus the rate was most likely taxes and fees!).
2241,Mayra93,"January 11, 2019",1,DONT DO IT Don‚Äôt book with them!! Customer service is useless. They don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs hidden fees up the butt but everything‚Äôs non refundable so you‚Äôre ultimately stuck. Worst experience. Stick with hotels.com or book directly. You‚Äôll save yourself tons of frustration

I booked a car rental through Hotwire yesterday, the price went down $140.00 today, is was also through Hotwire but they refused to give me the lower rate or cancel my purchase.

2243,Edgar17rating,"February 16, 2019",1,"VERY DISSAPOINTED Firstly, I would like to say I have used this app multiple times and I had not had a issue until this last time I used it on 2/16/2019. I chose an area in the southwest of Austin considering I was coming from Houston, tx. When I booked and paid they gave me a hotel all the way in the northeast side in round rock, Texas!!! Like how does that happen! It was and extra 30mns up north from downtown where I was going. The hotel was horrible and it was not worth it. I ended up cancelling even though it says on here no refunds. Lost all my money but oh well. Will not be using this app again."

2246,Bubbs323,"March 3, 2019",1,Hotwire is terrible!! I had the same promo issue another reviewer had. My promo code of -$15 did not go through. We then had a flattening tire and had to drive 20 miles back to the airport rental and it took 2 hours total to exchange the car. Somebody filled up a near flat tire and didn‚Äôt say anything to their manager and let us take the car. Neither Hotwire nor Advantage would give me any refund for either the promo code or the exchange inconvenience! They offered me a $10 credit for future rentals after 1 hour on the phone talking to an agent and a manager. What a joke! I‚Äôve used Priceline for years and enterprise when I can. They took off a whole day rental with no hassle because they didn‚Äôt clean the car and it had sand all over and smelled like a wet dog. Hotwire wouldn‚Äôt refund me a penny for their bad service!

After I paid, they said there would be another $54 resort fee due upon arrival (now $335.10), but when we got to the hotel, they said that there was a $16 per day charge ($48 + $6 taxes and fees = $54) plus $20/day for parking (now our $228 hotel is $395.10)"

2252,Jrloveskelly,"May 19, 2018",1,"Very Disappointed...I had thought this app was great...NOPE You rig the ‚Äúhots deals‚Äù. Here is how: Your promo code is a hoax, at least as it pertains to the ‚Äúhot deals‚Äù. I know this because 4 people I was with, all whom have their own Hotwire accounts, experienced the same response. Upon entering the $10 off promo code and attempting to proceed with payment, we all were immediately informed that we had missed the hot deal. Upon resuming our search we all saw that our respective selections had increased by precisely $10; ironic! Furthermore, after selecting the same 3.5 hot spot deal, now at a rate $10 higher than before I entered the coupon, I selected a king bed and proceeded to checkout. After submitting the payment and just as I was trying to forget that Hotwire had ripped me off $10, I then received a message noting that part of my payment information was incorrect. I started over again, and found that now I not only am paying $10 more than I should, and wasted a good deal of time, but to top it off, now the only bed selection option was two twins. Ultimately, this is an illegitimate practice and arguably illegal form of advertising (see ‚Äúbait and switch laws‚Äù). I‚Äôll be passing along this my review of this experience and information Monday evening through Facebook, Twitter, and a travel blog I write. I hope for, and look forward to your response."

Yes at the end of the day their phenomenal rate Is the reward however their competitors Seem to be able to incentivize their particular markets and demographics leading me to question how we as individual consumers are valued or not valued within their companies structure. There has been numerous situations where I have booked a higher-priced room with a Hotwire competitor for The simple fact ‚Äì that purchase would get me one step closer to a particular incentive or Tier or achieve some level of recognition ‚Äì with hotwire.com I have no opportunity to achieve.

The ""fraudulent activity"" turned out to be that I logged in with my girlfriends account but booked with my credit card. That must have set off an alert with their fraud dept. which is fine, but when I tried to call them to avoid all the drama they said they would get back to me within 48 hours. Not what I wanted to hear when the hotel manager is standing next to me & im being kicked out of a 4 star hotel at 8 am.
