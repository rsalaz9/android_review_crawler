0,consumer 2016,"April 15, 2018",3,"Most features you liked are gone I'm sorry team, I know you are excited and you wanted to ship, but I don't think any users were asking for this update. At least not enough to outweigh the fact that many of the features that your users like and consider an important part of the app, are missing now. I know you'll be adding back some later, but as of right now it's frustrating that I can't do things I used to be able to, all for a design update that I honestly don't consider an upgrade. I don't care how hip my tweets look or that my photos are now in frames. I can't access my original tweets any longer or click on the links within them. I can't really scroll past large photo sets, or easily past whole years like I used to be able to. You put design over function and now your users are upset and potentially permanently lost. I know I'll keep using for a little while because I'm addicted to myself, but that won't last forever if every time I try to use the app, the features that I got the most utility out of aren't there, and the experience is negative each time instead. Did you survey your users about what mattered most to them? Did you look at metrics on what features were most used? Did you do any user testing with actual loyal users? Maybe you did all of this, but for someone who got this update out of the blue, I am both not happy and am passionate enough to write this, but how much I care for your app won't last long. --user since it was just a daily email back in 2012."
1,Haleyhurricane5,"January 13, 2019",5,"Love it, but I wish one small feature would come back! I‚Äôve used timehop every single day for over two years, and before that still used it almost every day with a couple of small breaks while traveling. The only thing I wish would come back is the ability to click on the part that shows how many likes and comments you had and see them pop up right there. It now takes you to the app (Facebook or IG) to view the post and see your comments and going back and forth between the two for every list of comments I want to see for that day gets to be a hassle and I don‚Äôt end up checking the commments at all now. But other than that I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing! I love the format and every update they make somehow makes the look even cooler. I like that you can even sync your iPhoto.  I love the flashback video and the screen at the end with a new blurb every day and the fact that it lets you know how many days you‚Äôve consecutively checked in with a banner for each year. Well done!"
2,danielanddan,"July 13, 2018",4,Is that possible to have a feature for deleting the photo? I downloaded this app recently suggested by my boyfriend and I felt it was an awesome and fun app to check the memo everyday.
3,augzea,"December 17, 2017",4,"Good app, careless retrovideo mistakes I use Timehop every day, I loved the concept from the beginning. Still like the old format better, but used to the current one now so it‚Äôs been fine."
4,2hellwitit,"January 25, 2019",3,"Update It seems that every time that you do an update you change the ways that things are done and you have to figure it all out again when you could do it without even thinking before the update. I have been having issues with the app stopping every 2-3 days I go on (I‚Äôm currently on day 201) and when I click on the widget agin it starts all over from the beginning and when I get to where I was if I click to save photo it shuts down again. I have shut off and restarted my phone but the same thing happens. I‚Äôve made sure I had string internet connection but it still stops. I was hoping that this new update would fix this issue, but unfortunately it did not and now it stops every time I go on. Is there going to be an update to fix this issue. I have contacted Apple thinking it was a problem with my phone, but Timehop is the only one that stops like this. And they said it was an app issue not an issue with my phone."
5,Ninjamusicmom,"February 15, 2020",4,"Love the memories, could be improved I really do appreciate Timehop. It‚Äôs fun to see posts from this day several years ago. Sometimes it reminds me of things I had forgotten! I like how you can click through to open the entire post in Facebook, if you want, and see all the comments. I‚Äôm coming up to my 1,000 day streak, so I‚Äôve had a lot of time to think about two things I would change. They are both in the Rewind portion. First, that screeching tape rewind sound effect is dreadful. I want to hear the narration sometimes but I do not like that horrible screeching. It goes right through me- not a great way to start the day. Second they have icons at the bottom of the page when they are playing the top hit from today that actually cover up the title and year of the song. Every time! So frustrating! Other than that Abe keeps it entertaining and fun!"

7,lynnekaren,"October 14, 2017",5,Thank You Timehop. October 2017:
8,Mary23456789,"July 10, 2018",5,I check this app every day I check this app every day and I‚Äôm now up to over 400 in a row. Just part of my OCD I guess. But enough about me. I really enjoy this app because it takes me back to what was important to me three or four or even more years ago as opposed to now. I also enjoy seeing the pictures I took in the past. Sometimes I‚Äôve lost track of them and it‚Äôs good to get a chance to save them again. 
9,catzac,"November 13, 2019",2,Was ok until I couldn‚Äôt connect to FB Loved this app....until the last few weeks.  Was dis one chef from my Facebook and since then I can‚Äôt log back in with my account.  It automatically asks to connect as my husband with no option to switch to my account. No idea why it goes to him as he‚Äôs never logged into FB on my phone and does not have the Timehop app himself.  I co reacted support...told me to log out and delete FB app and Timehop app.  Log back into FB the reinstall TH...which I have done multiple times without success.  Tried it with my cell phone number which didn‚Äôt work either.  I‚Äôve logged into FB from my laptop to make sure TH was still active.  Finally tried it on my iPad and was able to connect with my FB.  But no carryover when I tried again on my phone. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt go on my iPad every day to check.  Lost my almost 1000 day streak because of this.
10,Dianadda,"January 28, 2018",5,I want to cry! Edit: Not Crying Anymore Edit:  Ugh!  Please figure out how to get google photos back. ‚òπÔ∏è
11,Michael Rogers,"January 29, 2018",4,"Ads are necessary but... The ads obviously are necessary, but why do I need to click on something that requires me to kill? ‚ÄúChoose your weapon to wipe out 20 things!‚Äù Really? Not really a cut on Timehop, just really a comment on whomever chooses their ad choice AND placement. I‚Äôm sure there is an algorithm that figures out when and where a game ad goes, but I guarantee that IT‚ÄôS WRONG. Seeing snippets of my past? Yes. Having to select a specific weapon to destroy things and/or people to finish seeing snippets of my past? NOPE. 4 stars for compiling memories, but minus 1 star for the inconvenience of having to think about destruction. We already have enough reminders of that... How about place things that make you smile?"
12,ziachiquita,"March 6, 2018",1,"Incredibly annoying notifications I have one form of notification turned on for this app, just to remind myself to check it and keep my silly streak going. Good, great, whatever.  I open it usually within an hour or two of the first notification of the day. The first of TOO MANY. I don‚Äôt need constant reminders at regular intervals to check the stupid app. I checked my timehop not even 10 minutes ago, and roughly three minutes after completing the day of memories, I received ANOTHER notification ‚Äúreminding‚Äù me not to forget timehop! This is not the first time I‚Äôve received additional annoying notifications after completing timehop for the day. Please correct whatever issue it is causing the annoyance. If I completed it, there is no need for me to see ‚Äúyour day is waiting!!!! Don‚Äôt forget to open me even though you did two minutes ago!!!!‚Äù"
13,{~*R*~},"April 16, 2018",3,"Great concept I was so excited to download this app but find it frustrating more often than not now. It‚Äôs been two days since the app updated and it crashes ( or whichever techie term is proper) as soon as I open to scroll through my memories. Giving the app access to all my programs for the sake of remembering good times and it crashes when I go to view them. Makes me hesitant to keep the app. If it just went back to how it was like 2 years ago I‚Äôd be a much happier user. Yes I did the basic fix attempts- reboot phone, delete and re download app, make sure updates are all administered- so I‚Äôm at a loss as to why the app crashes every single time after less than 5 seconds open."
14,Imluvndabeach,"April 28, 2018",5,They listen to their reviewers The programmers really took a big leap and moved the look & feel of the UI in a whole different direction last year. The users were livid. Quickly they not only changed back to a user interface that was acceptable but improved upon it. Kudos to them. I enjoy the ability to look back (for me) up to 7 years ago and relive great memories & photos I‚Äôve taken. Thanks guys!
15,regulationnaughty,"September 13, 2018",3,"Maybe not compatible with storing photos in cloud Not sure if it‚Äôs because I have my phone set to upload full versions of my photos to the cloud and they have to download every time I want to see them, but Timehop doesn‚Äôt load any photos half the times I open it now."
16,Chantraine1975,"December 17, 2019",4,"Great app to see your memories, I have a few suggestions tho Facebook‚Äôs memory feature is OK but to see past posts on Twitter, you have to download and figure out how to use it, and they make it more difficult every year.  Luckily there‚Äôs this nice app, Timehop.  I‚Äôm really enjoying getting to see everything I posted in the preceding years.  I really love the RetroVideos that tell you all about what was going on in history and culture.  I would like to see more of This Day in History.  I think they could add another page to each day‚Äôs TimeHop.  Also on the Facebook posts, it only shows the comment I made on things I shared and not the entire post. I‚Äôd like that fixed, please. All in all, great app!"
17,I just want opacity,"July 10, 2019",3,"Ads are getting worse Lately the app hasn‚Äôt been as buggy as my last review (in 2017 there was a bug that would constantly cause the app to crash) but now these Ads are playing before I even get to them. For instance there will be an AD in the middle of your memories, so if you have about 8 or 9 years worth of memories, near the 4th or 5th memory you‚Äôll see an ad. Ads are fine when they‚Äôre quiet and you‚Äôre able to just scroll past, but lately they‚Äôve been loud videos and they play before you scroll past AND after. It‚Äôs frustrating to say the least, most of us look at timehop when we‚Äôre bored, and in public. I do not want to buy timehop to get rid of ads but what about a volume control option?"
18,Alyb303,"November 12, 2019",5,Love it! Great app love how it connects all my apps and shows me what I‚Äôve been doing today the last few years. If I could give one criticism I don‚Äôt like how if I‚Äôve already checked Timehop I do get another notification later in the day and if I check it I get yet another. I get constant notifications to the point I‚Äôm contemplating deleting it because I already checked it.... don‚Äôt notify me again? It‚Äôs the same all day I don‚Äôt need to check it more than once a day. Other than that love the app and use it daily and I hope something is done about the annoying notifications
19,Galaxy560,"August 2, 2019",3,"Won‚Äôt log into Facebook anymore My Timehop has automatically logged out of Facebook and is now trying to log back into it. I‚Äôll get the notification when I open the app saying ‚ÄúTimehop would like to use Facebook to sign in.‚Äù When I click ‚Äúyes‚Äù it take me to Facebook and let‚Äôs Timehop use it, but it doesn‚Äôt work. If I close the app and go back in it‚Äôll still give me the notification. Also, the settings will have this red banner saying ‚Äúmemories are missing‚Äù because it‚Äôs not logged into Facebook. When I click on settings it immediately give the the notification to use Facebook again. I‚Äôll say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and it will still not work. Please fix this."
20,Ryulunanekoneko,"October 15, 2017",5,"Yay! Thank you for bringing back Swarm! I stopped using it because it wouldn‚Äôt show up, but I‚Äôm gunna start up again. "
21,Scott'sGirl1214,"October 16, 2017",4,"Today, October 16th of 2017... was the best video flashback. Literally, all three of them (Steamboat Willie, Smallville, and Amanda Show) were top-notch, and I loved them while I was growing up. Still do. "
22,Shellmo2,"June 5, 2018",4,"Where are the comments??? I‚Äôve loved using my Timehop app but lately it‚Äôs become tedious. The only thing keeping me coming back is my current streak of 751 straight days. Because right about the 2 year mark, everything it is pulling up through Facebook only shows MY comments and replies. For instance, Facebook has the ‚ÄúOn This Day‚Äù feature that does the same thing as Timehop  and Facebook would show all 23 comments from all my friends, but Timehop would only show 2 comments and they‚Äôre both mine from replying to others. Please fix this and give me a reason to keep my streak alive."
23,MusicalThought,"July 8, 2018",3,"Enough with the updates The update I installed yesterday crashes the app entirely.  ‚ÄòRetry‚Äô doesn‚Äôt help, nor does closing the app and re-opening.  I have even restarted my iphone.  If I see ‚ÄòFiddlesticks‚Äô one more time, I will be uninstalling your app.  I love seeing the memories and all, but it‚Äôs fast approaching the point where it‚Äôs just not worth the time and frustration.  "
24,iStea,"July 9, 2018",4,"Awesome App & Concept, Unpredictable Problems Love the app and seeing memories daily. Love the little dinosaur mascot. And the little video shorts at the end are fun and interesting (though sometimes inaccurate). But every once in a while they have an update or bug that‚Äôs catastrophic and makes it unusable. Literally unusable this last time. "
25,aimeejjacobs,"August 23, 2018",4,"Nice but Too Slow to Waste Time I love the thought behind this app and I do check it often to be reminded of good times. However, the photos and especially the videos seem to take such a long time to load that I often end up skipping through the whole set of years without actually seeing any memories because they haven‚Äôt loaded. You guys should really work on getting memories to load quicker because no one has time to check their app on a daily basis if it‚Äôs going to take forever to load. Still love the app, just a suggestion!"
26,moMaureen9,"March 4, 2020",5,"Great app sometimes annoying While I love this app because it shows me exactly what I was doing 1, 2, 6 years ago it has a few annoyances. The buggiest one being you will look through the entire Timehop and get to the screen that says ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù then shortly later you will get a reminder you haven‚Äôt checked your time hop. Or a red notification will show you haven‚Äôt gone through it after I have often already gone through it more than once. Just a glitch that drives me nuts and wish they would fix. Other than that‚Äîgreat app!"
27,morgan_4evr,"March 24, 2020",4,Is it possible to connect it with more apps I really like this app it makes me remember things that I usually would forget that they happened. But I wish you could connect it with more apps. I have Snapchat and I take most of my photos on there so now I have to go through Snapchat and figure out which ones I want to be saved to my camera roll so they will show up in Timehop. Other than that I really like this app and I love it and I do think it is worth the work if putting them into the camera roll I just think it would be a lot easier on our part.
28,System!,"March 6, 2020",5,"Good start. Honestly, a solid case-study in how to build a useful little app, IMO. I‚Äôve checked this sweet little app almost every day, just for a fun, nice little trip down memory lane, but better. The little points of delight ‚Äî the little dinosaur, humor, extra bits of content that are actually fun and don‚Äôt yell at you ‚Äî just nice."
29,T3**,"August 8, 2019",1,"Glitching I‚Äôve reached out to Timehop through email & twitter and now I‚Äôm leaving this review hoping for something to be fixed. I have over a 2 year streak and have been using the app consistently for years before that, but yesterday and today the app keeps glitching. I can only scroll through a few memories from 1 year ago before it suddenly force-closes in the middle of scrolling and kicks me off the app. I was unable to finish my Timehop yesterday because of this, even after updating the app, it still glitches at the same spot and closes the app. I took a recording of it. Today I still haven‚Äôt gotten a response to my email or either of my twitter posts and the app still glitches and won‚Äôt let me complete my streak."
30,tavella81,"October 15, 2017",5,Not bad. Wish I could get rid of the ads w/ an IAP I didn't find out about TimeHop until Memoirs announced their shutdown and recommended this app. So far I like it a lot and the Foursquare/Swarm integration being added back go the app was right on time. 
31,the_zauriel,"March 2, 2018",2,"No way to get rid of ""ALERT"" I keep getting an ""alert"" in my Timehop feed because Timehop can't connect to my Instagram account."
32,neenaw7,"May 16, 2018",1,"YOUR PRIVACY IS AT STAKE!!! I redownloaded time home today after not having the app for a few months. When I logged in through MY Facebook app and account, Timehop showed being logged in to my friends Facebook and twitter in the settings. I thought this was strange, seeing as how neither of us have ever logged into each other‚Äôs social media accounts before. When I scrolled through the Timehop, I found posts from BOTH of our socials - despite the app only indicating being logged into hers!!!! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE??? It shows this way on both of our phones. DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND DELETE THIS APP!!! I have already contacted support and am awaiting a response. I expect to get to the bottom of this, as this is unacceptable."
33,LEM1164,"June 2, 2018",5,"MY GO TO APP...EVERY DAY! I love this app! I use it every day... And have been for YEARS! I can look back on previous years of my life with my family and friends! Timehop does an amazing job connecting all of my photo and social media apps together in one place. I do wish it would connect to my cloud service on ONE DRIVE, but everything else about it is AWESOME!"
34,jesssssssiiiiiiccccaaa,"October 23, 2018",3,So many bugs I used to love timehop before the major update. My pictures NEVER load but the ads always do. I can‚Äôt see my original tweets anymore and looking at comments on my Facebook photos is a total pain. I miss the simple timehop that always worked and was just so much easier to view. I haven‚Äôt been able to see many picture the past week because they are failing to load and the ones I do see are saved ones from years past (‚ÄúOMG THIS WAS 3 years ago‚Äù posts)and those pictures aren‚Äôt even on the day anymore! Change it back to the layout from the beginning. üò´üò´üò´
35,Mudpiee,"February 7, 2019",2,"Doesn‚Äôt load multiple pictures This app used to be fantastic up until I got the new iPhone XR and downloaded the 4.6.6 version. Now none of the multiple photos memories load, no streak stored either (which I really didn‚Äôt mind because I don‚Äôt care for the streak feature anyway) and I have plenty of memory on my phone. I turned on my old phone to see if I would still have the multiple photo loading problem and photos load no problem (4.6.5 version). Not sure where the problem lies, iPhone problem or version, but frustrating when the majority of my memories come up as multiple photos."
36,Sillishelli,"March 7, 2019",3,"Sooo over multiple daily notifications Dear Timehop, "
37,Lauren2019456,"November 24, 2019",4,I love the app but.... Why does the sound for the RetroVideo have to be so loud? And it‚Äôs a terrible scratching noise. I think it‚Äôs supposed to be a record scratch but it kills my ears every time. I scroll through pictures with the occasional quiet-ish video and then get hit with the ear stabbing sound from the RetroVideo. I don‚Äôt even watch them because of it. 
38,Words aren't enough,"March 26, 2020",3,"Less fun without risk of losing streak I enjoy looking at my old posts, but the addition of the ‚Äústreak‚Äù added more fun into it. However, I noticed I missed a day (which previously would reset my streak) and my streak continues. It is now to the point where I purposely won‚Äôt check my Timehop for a week to see what happens, and my streak is still there. It is actually annoying to me that the entire point of a streak is null and void because it will now remain whether you log on or not. Maybe it‚Äôs not a big deal to some, but it takes a HUGE amount of enjoyment out of it for me."
39,ALXAY,"December 2, 2019",4,"Good, but... This is a great app that brings me a lot of enjoyment looking back on memories over the years. However, sometimes things are mysteriously missing even if I‚Äôve given permissions to access my social media accounts. Also, the ‚Äúdaily reminders‚Äù never seem to recognize when you‚Äôve already looked at your memories for the day. Update after update and they still can‚Äôt figure this out. Sometimes I get repeated reminders throughout the day to check Timehop, and it‚Äôs annoying."
40,KendraHCOCK,"November 18, 2017",4,"Improving! üëçüèª The app is getting much better!! Im happy with the recent improvements, I feel like it was way too cluttered in the past years. I mean I feel like you already have a great app & it‚Äôs a great concept however for a while you guys were super annoying with the pushing your ‚ÄúAbe‚Äù mascot guy üòí. In my opinion you should just cut out the dinosaur guy all together. I don‚Äôt think the app would suffer at all; if anything you guys could focus more on a multitude of different filters & stickers to go with memories!"
41,lovemyraidersxo,"February 21, 2018",4,"Love the app but wish there was a way to ignore certain pictures/content I love seeing my past pics every day with the app, however, I experienced the death of my dad two years ago and every year around this time I get reminded of what we went through the week he passed. I wish I could tell the app to ignore those pictures for the future timehops. That would help me not relive the worst week of my life every year. I am sure I am not the only one who has this issue with traumatic events or pictures."
42,Ace Peelman,"June 5, 2018",3,"Miss the old version I LOVE the concept of this, and check it every day because I love walking down memory lane. I wonder, though, why comments that other people have made on my past statuses and photos have disappeared? Now it looks like I‚Äôm talking to myself in the comments section, and I have to piece together what the previous comment may have been, and guess at who may have said it....it‚Äôs just weird that all comments other than mine have been removed. Seeing those comments only enhanced the experience. Bring them back!"
43,AppleHeart4,"July 9, 2018",5,"Please fix bugs and other issues I love Timehop but after the new update (updated in the last 24 hours) my app keeps crashing. The first time I used it after update, it did not crash but it got disconnected from Facebook. And then refused to reconnect to Facebook. When it finally half-reconnected to Facebook, it did not show photos from half of the posts. Please fix this issue. And Dropbox have been dropped it seems."
44,_onlyamy,"July 9, 2018",1,If I Could Give No Stars I Would I used to love this app. In fact it was one of my favorites but with each update I've liked it less and less. This last update is the straw that broke the camels back. Horrible. Worst app ever. I'm not sure who thought setting up the new design this way was a good idea but they clearly are not in tune with what your target market likes. Why are each of the photos magnified? Why can't we see where they were posted and comments made? Why the ridiculous function of having to scroll sideways to see the next post. I'm about ready to delete it because honestly I don't think I enjoy the app at all anymore to keep it.
45,Massey B.,"August 30, 2018",5,"Spoilers I love everything about Timehop except for one thing. On the last page, where it tells you your streak, there is always a saying up at the top. I think they‚Äôre clever and cute sometimes but occasionally they have Harry Potter spoilers. Now, I understand the Harry Potter books have been out for a long time but, I‚Äôm just in the process of reading them now. I would really appreciate if you took those off. Thank you!"
46,jedavis1984,"November 27, 2018",3,Love this app but.... I absolutely love time hop. 
47,jhenjoy,"January 5, 2019",4,"Big fan but.... I‚Äôve been using this app for 707 days straight now (thanks for keeping track!) and I‚Äôm a big fan. I like seeing all of my past posts and cringing at how awkward I was in high school, when I first got Twitter. My only real suggestion/complaint is that I wish Facebook status updates linked to the Facebook app so you could see the original post. You know, like how you tap on past tweets and it redirects you to the post on Twitter. Adding that feature would really push me to a 5-star rating!"
48,inorganik,"December 4, 2019",4,"Retrovideo needs to be muted I scroll through my Timehop, enjoying it, and I might see a video of my kids so I unmute. It is mostly quiet. Then I scroll silently through some tweets and pics, and finally I get to the dreaded retrovideo, and the record scratch sound is pretty jarring. "
49,melissadlugatch,"July 6, 2019",4,"Doesn‚Äôt change till 5am The only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars. They have a dumb explanation of why they change it at 5am and not midnight (like fb and all social media does). But it makes no sense to me. I rarely take photos after midnight, but I‚Äôm often up past midnight and check on fb memories. "
50,Waf123456789,"November 21, 2017",1,"Put it back I'm not usually one to write a bad review. I've loved timehop for a long time, but the new update has ruined it. This isn't snapchat and it doesn't make sense to use the same interface. The photos aren't the right size/orientation, it's annoying to zoom out, and I want the captions and comments back! That's half the fun! I also prefer to scroll because it helps demarcate years more clearly. PUT IT BACK."
51,Pippersarah,"December 29, 2017",5,Love it but it has gotten too many adds I love this app. They fixed the glitches. I've been using this app for almost 500 days in a row and many months previous to that. It has added a lot more adds to each day. Each day I have to lunch last 3-5 screens of adds. I hate that part. Other than that I like this app. I wish it brought up more of thing that I shared on FB and not just uploads.
52,Another girl11111,"January 5, 2018",4,"Loved it- but had some glitches Was one of my favorite apps to check everyday. I‚Äôve had it for over 3 years now and I love it, but I haven‚Äôt been able to use it for 2 weeks now because it will not load when I click on it. For the first week, I would delete it and then re-download it just to be able to view my daily time hop just once for the day, but I got tired of the process so I haven‚Äôt used the app in over a week. Sad to see my streak and the app go."
53,Rsigcfdg,"February 3, 2018",4,"I don't get the references.. Overall, I love this app! I use it everyday (in the 1 year club üôåüèª) but I don't like that the new retro videos don't actually say what they're talking about. It used to have the title of the show/movie/whatever at the top and also say it out loud, but now it has neither and I don't know what it's about most of the time ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø also, I'd like to be able to read Facebook comments on my old pictures, but it usually doesn't allow me to open it."
54,rweeeeeeezzzzyyyy,"April 20, 2018",3,"Almost there This app is great and I love the idea behind it... however, it‚Äôs frustrating that you can only add one account from each social media platform. Nowadays many people (including myself) have multiple instagrams and have had them for a few years now. I want to see those photos from that account as well but unfortunately only one account can be logged in with Timehop. In addition, now that Snapchat memories have been around for over a year, it would seem only logical to have those saved photos in Timehop."
55,bmc2020,"July 11, 2018",4,"Bug fixes I‚Äôm not sure what you did with the last update but not too happy about it. I have had to re connect to all my apps every single time I go in And it still doesn‚Äôt show me anything I have posted, and on top of that I haven‚Äôt been able to see my comments in a while so the last 2 updates have not worked in our favor. I‚Äôm going to try and re download and hope that fixes it I really liked this app hope It can be fixed"
56,pikacece,"August 5, 2018",5,"Deleted posts still appear Hi timehop! Love the app, but every now and then I see an old post/tweet that was deleted and yet it still appears through timehop. I‚Äôve deleted old posts I know I never want to see again, but I still love the app."
57,smithfamily5k,"August 19, 2018",5,"Love! Love this app! I just wished it saved memories year after year. My phone broke and I lost years and years of photos, I wish the app had it saved so it would still show those lost pictures. And I also wish it had a personal journal where you could write what you did that day. Some memories I would love to remember but not necessarily post on social media (which is where the app pulls info from)."
58,Amyncosolo,"November 12, 2018",2,Was good I absolutely love Timehop. I keep my streak going and never miss a day but I went down to a 2 star because lately I haven‚Äôt been able to view a lot of my stuff. If I could post a screenshot of what it‚Äôs doing I would but all of the videos just sit there and spin and spin and never load. My internet connection is perfectly fine so it‚Äôs not that. I miss a lot of my videos and some of my pictures bc of this. I don‚Äôt know what the issue is but until it‚Äôs resolved I will stay at a 2 star unfortunately. It really is unfortunate to miss my videos every day. Please fix this whatever it is
59,Clear0illusionz,"October 28, 2019",4,"Can I go back in time? I can‚Äôt go back in time in real life but thanks to this app I can go back in time down memory lane. I love this app and I literally go to it everyday just to check out what I was doing on this exact day each year previous. I love this app and thank you to the creators of Timehop for coming up with an app that allows me to go down memory lane. Also, thank you for each little clip of your own to inform us on what went on back in time on each day."
60,Ayellalot,"February 24, 2018",1,"The Update :( I used to LOVE timehop but now I am much less likely to use is due to the update. I put off updating the app for a long time, but then my posts on timehop started getting cut off and I couldn‚Äôt read the entire post on the app. I was forced to update it and I cannot stand it. I am much less likely to use the app every day because of the tap-through format."
61,nib113,"June 16, 2018",4,"Like it I like seeing the memories however I don‚Äôt like that it reminds me to look at the app twice a day. Once in the morning, that‚Äôs when I typically look at it, and then again in the afternoon. Just need one push notification! I would kind of understand if it gives you another notification later in the day if you haven‚Äôt looked at it yet but I always look at it and don‚Äôt need another reminder for something I already saw."
62,mschwart,"July 11, 2018",3,It‚Äôs working now I used to love this app. Since the last update a week ago my photos are filling 1/3 of the screen. They used to look gorgeous. Now they look horrible. I emailed support and received no response. Disappointing.
63,Sugar Hunny Bunny,"September 20, 2018",5,"One of my favorite apps Having trouble with the most recent update. The app won‚Äôt load at all. It freezes right at the beginning when Abe plays with the pin wheel that loads all of your time hops . No amount of quitting, changing my connection, or restarting my phone fixes it. I love this app otherwise, it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be working with the update at the moment."
64,MichelleO19,"November 1, 2018",3,"Love the concept I adore this little back in time app. It has sooo much potential. I might not delete it as I do look forward to the pictures everyday,  but it has its flaws. With my new iPhone XS Max, you cannot see how many years ago the picture was taken now. It‚Äôs blocked at the top. Real bummer. I have to guess. Also, since I have so many accounts with google, IG, FB etc, so many duplicates come across all at once.  Minor things that can be fixed for sure, I‚Äôll wait it out for now. It is that good of an idea! :-)"
65,Onequistiiam,"November 2, 2018",5,"I love this app! It is the first thing I look at in the morning. I have lost some ver dear people over the last several year and the best thing about Time Hop it is catches the comets from all your post. I call them message from heaven, it is so great to see a note from my mom or my best buddy. I know this is not what they had in mind but it makes my day. Along with reminding me of great memory‚Äôs. Keep up the good work guys!!!"
66,Chglsv5,"February 19, 2019",2,"Would be great, if it worked. It‚Äôs a great concept, and when it works, I love it. Unfortunately, 90% of the memories don‚Äôt show because they‚Äôre stuck ‚Äúloading‚Äù which I know is not right. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I am, what WiFi or network I‚Äôm on, they sit ‚Äúloading‚Äù yet NEVER actually show up. Even my own photo gallery doesn‚Äôt show up. I‚Äôve restarted, redownloaded, reconnected all my apps, nothing helps. It‚Äôs been going on since I started this app a few years back but at this point I see almost NO memories. Ready to delete, which is super disappointing."

It always randomly disconnects from my Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. for NO APPARENT REASON and I can‚Äôt ever reconnect because I can‚Äôt remember my passwords on the accounts they disconnected and I can‚Äôt reset my passwords on those accounts because I CAN‚ÄôT REMEMBER MY OLD PASSWORD EITHER. I will take accountability for my poor genetics and lack of memory, but time hop needs to be accountable for randomly disconnecting from other apps. I know there are bigger problems in this world, but I am deleting the app for good. Thanks for absolutely nothing, time hop."
68,fisher/lane,"February 29, 2020",5,Loss of streak 3 rd time Sorry time hop. This has been an obsession for me to reach 2 years looking at my time hop!!  I was at 600 and now you are showing a negative 1. I‚Äôm hoping it was due to the extra day in feb.  I will wait till tomorrow and see if my streak returns to 601. If it does not this will have been the 3 rd time I had an issue. I will have to delete the ap. Very sad day if this happens. I used up enjoy seeing things. Oh well.

71,MidnightMogwai,"January 6, 2018",3,Why. I was really excited this year when I realized that it‚Äôs been 6 years since some horrible life stuff that won‚Äôt be on my timehop anymore because it only went back 6 years only to see today that it also can go back 7. It never has for me before so it must be the update. I think a setting where you can choose how far back you can go would be nice for those of us that don‚Äôt want to relive some horrible things. Fix this and I‚Äôll make it 5 stars. :)
72,BayMcp,"January 9, 2018",5,Hasn‚Äôt worked the past month I keep deleting and re downloading the app and it won‚Äôt work. It won‚Äôt load every time I open the app. Not sure what the problem is because it used to work fine before the last month. I think it needs something fixed and needs improvements because it doesn‚Äôt work right anymore.
73,Jule Roe,"April 8, 2018",3,im still unhappy with the new format.. it‚Äôs been quite a while having to swipe/click through my timehop and i told myself maybe i‚Äôd eventually get used to it but i‚Äôm STILL unhappy with it. but the real reason i‚Äôm here is just because it used to show me the weather on a given day in years past and it doesn‚Äôt anymore and i liked that. like why not do that if u COULD do it. Such a great app but so many dumb things are done to it in the updates for the past year or two. i‚Äôm sorry.

79,sanfranciscocashcat,"April 4, 2020",4,"Love the app but... Love this app as it helps to remind of of special events that have taken place or precious video reminders of people in my life who have passed away. However, I should not have to log in twice a day for their memories. The app will remind me, I go through the memories and I should be done for the day.

This seems to always happen when I‚Äôm getting close to a long streak, leading to deleting and reinstalling the app, which, then, doesn‚Äôt register my streak in spite of checking the app every day since I discover it.

Wrong...now, perhaps even MORE annoying is the fact that all of those deleted images are still in my feed, but not as images, as blank placeholders. Contacted the developers for help, didn‚Äôt get what I needed, and they haven‚Äôt responded further. Deleted the app and started over, same issue. So disappointed because I loved my daily Timehop.

Everyday I would go back in photos to search up date to find photos of that day. That was a year ago or more. This app does it for me. By looking through photos, Instagram, and google photos, and more. Love this app. Saved me soo much time. üß°‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíöüíôüíúü§çü§éüñ§"
120,sommanita,"October 22, 2017",2,"Great idea, not so great execution I‚Äôve used Timehop since it launched and I love the concept. The trouble is that the app doesn‚Äôt perform well. Each big update brings the promise of better performance and more features but what I‚Äôve experienced is a lot of error messages, extremely slow load time on photos and confusing interactions. I care so much less about a streak or the cutesy graphic call-outs than just seeing my actual memories. That is the point, after all."
121,THomps8,"October 23, 2017",4,"Texts/iMessage I love this app and how it shows me old Facebook comments/posts. However, I‚Äôm not sure it does all of them which I wish it would. I also wish that it would show me all my old texts/pic. texts I have received in the past... it‚Äôs so hard to navigate and remember conversations in texts. I would rate it 5 star if it did all that!"
122,Tyrannosaurus-Matt,"November 5, 2017",4,Swarm Check-ins I‚Äôm really glad that Swarm Check-ins are back! Only one thing I feel is still missing from them though is that on some check-ins you can choose if you are at a place for an event or not (for example what movie you are watching) and that info is absent from Timehop. I think it used to be there though. Please add that if possible.
123,ssahli,"January 18, 2018",5,A review The only reason why my rating is so low is because for the last few months none of my pictures from last year have been showing. It would show they were there but wouldn't show the picture:(
124,Saaabriwh,"June 3, 2018",3,"Auto play on ads The loud auto play of the video ads is obnoxious. Also, when you share a video to Facebook or save it to your camera roll, it doesn't save with any frame. The whole point is to let people know you're sharing something from a year (or however long) ago, so having it just look like a regular video is pointless. Please change this. Thank you."
125,Njayek,"July 8, 2018",5,Very upset Was working great I loved it....was actually on a 348 day streak. Than you do this update and now I cannot even get logged back in.....this is so very disappointing as I loved seeing my past posted and look coward to it everyday. Why would you mess with something that had NOTHING wrong with it? WHY???
126,T_zeigs,"July 10, 2018",2,"Ruined my streak I have been using Timehop for some time now, to the point where I had a nearly 50 day streak. I went to get on it this morning, & I couldn‚Äôt log in to my Facebook. I tried to log in with my phone number, and it all worked, but once I got logged in, it took me back to the log in screen, and I couldn‚Äôt look at my timeline. This new update ruined my nearly 50 day streak, the ‚Äúeasier‚Äù log in made it impossible for me to log in, thanks."
127,Chloyybear,"August 12, 2019",5,"I really like it, but I wish there was a feature added I wish that there was the option to add multiple twitter/instagram accounts onto Timehope! The app is great otherwise with no bugs that I know of, but I would love to be able to add my business account to it as well!"
128,CAT2995,"August 9, 2019",4,"Keeps crashing I‚Äôve been using this app for over a year now and it has been working perfectly fine. Now after numerous updates, it has been crashing at random points when I‚Äôm just swiping through the photos/videos. This has been happening for at least 2 months now."
129,Forest00021,"August 5, 2019",5,"Great for all! You get to see moments in the past you had forgotten about. Pictures you had taken, photos, screenshots, and posts you shared that made you laugh. You can just about relive moments you shared with loved ones who‚Äôve passed! Laugh, cry, and smile again on past memories with this app!"
130,monsj1122,"November 6, 2017",5,Images fail to load Timehop worked great until recent updates...both images and videos fail to load. Used to check this app religiously but now go on it every once in a while in hopes that it‚Äôs fixed and realize it‚Äôs not!
131,Need NLT or NIV or NASB!,"December 25, 2017",3,Good app...get rid of the extras Love the Timehop portion where you see your own pictures from years past. That‚Äôs what I have the app to see. I‚Äôm not a fan of all the extras - the music is loud and not timely in the pictures with no way to turn it off. The retro videos I skip through to get to my pics. I would love it if it just went back to having your own pics on there with no added extras.
132,fangirl76,"December 31, 2017",3,"Disappointing I used to love this app and I had a streak of over 500 days, but a week ago it stopped working. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app several times and tried restarting my phone, but all I get is a blank yellow screen then the app closes. I‚Äôve sent several emails to the app support team, but have never gotten a response. I guess my only option is to delete the app permanently."
133,Shawny Brow,"December 31, 2017",5,Issue The app should not play music automatically when my volume is turned off. I hope this is an error. It still plays when I click the home button to get off the app. I had to close the app to get the music to stop. Unacceptable.
134,Brandrand,"July 17, 2018",3,"Awful update I used to love my Timehop app, seeing days gone by and pictures and comments, etc. Now I hardly ever use it and I'm going to delete it. Why would you update something that worked great and replace it with something that doesn't? I just don't understand the logic behind this. I'm so disgusted with this update and not really sure I'll ever re-download it. Thanks for ruining what was once my favorite app!"
135,chrismeansbusiness,"August 24, 2018",4,"Delayed notification I make a point to check this every morning, and every morning without fail it sends me a notification to check it about 30 minutes after."

137,Saroskita,"February 28, 2019",3,"Love it but cannot use more than one Google account This app is fantastic. I have had it for years. But the fact that I cannot add 2 google accounts, makes me only see new pics. I need to add my old google account AND my new one. I open this up every day and nothing pops up. So it‚Äôs no fun anymore. I don‚Äôt really care about what happened 34 years ago on the radio. The idea was to see memories. Oh well."
138,MB107,"May 2, 2020",5,"Love you I have a 1315 day streak. I‚Äôm a normal healthy boy. Is there a way for us to see the privacy settings of our Facebook posts up at the top?? I would love that when a photo from youth comes up, and I have an anxiety rush that everyone can see 14 year old George Harrison if they scroll down far enough. ThANKS"
139,J_troxell2000,"June 17, 2019",3,Stop the ads! I loved this app until recently when now in the middle of the whole thing an ad comes up that you can‚Äôt mute or stop. Then when you try to swipe back it goes to internet explorer!! WTH is that about? I don‚Äôt want to see an ad but at least I should be able to X out of it or mute the thing!! Not overly happy with the app anymore & I have over 900 days checked in!
140,Ddog620,"February 8, 2018",4,Just change it back Edit Feb. 2018:Not so bad anymore. I still like the old format better but I‚Äôve gotten used to this one. Great work with the fixes! June 2017: Please just change it back to the way it was. I will change my review to 5 stars but for now I hate the way it is. We all just want the scroll not the tap crap
141,Mapleleafboy2012,"February 14, 2018",4,Much better Edit: Thanks for fixing the app Timehop! Also love the new Chart Hopper music throwback at the end of the retrovideo! 
142,rmrrose820,"March 25, 2018",4,"Love the app! I really enjoy how Timehop surfaces pictures and posts from my past. The only big critique is that sometimes the photos or videos won‚Äôt load. This has happened on different WiFi and cell connections so it does seem to be a bug on their end. I still check it everyday, though!"
143,sincelastdecember,"July 10, 2018",2,"Last update broke my app It disconnected me from Facebook, and would not reconnect despite many attempts, so signed out to sign back in but now it will not sign me back in. Facebook is still unable to reconnect and using my phone number takes me to the notification authorisation screen, then it goes back to the login screen and will not progress. I am really disappointed as I was one day away from a 300 day streak when the issue began! üòû"
144,CNH1992,"July 10, 2018",5,"Logged out and not allowed back in I updated my app yesterday. As a result it has logged me out of my Timehop account and not being allowed to log back in! I‚Äôve tried multiple times, had three texts sent with codes and nothing. Super disappointing üòû"
145,Jesusgirl1000bc,"July 25, 2018",1,"Needs major changes I liked the old timehop - where I could share an old post and it would share all the words - and not cut half of them out...but what I‚Äôd like even more is a way to delete memories from the app...it‚Äôs not rocket science to realize there are some things that you DONT want to be reminded of....seems like a pretty simple fix...until you add that basic setting (which again, should be a NO BRAINER for an app about memories), I won‚Äôt give this app more stars....quite frankly, I‚Äôm tempted to delete it!"
146,Tejndbeheh,"August 7, 2018",4,"I really like the app! Just a few things I would like a little more This is a great app and so much fun to look back on old memories! However, I would love it if you could sync it up to your Snapchat memories, and have a way to get rid of the slides that don‚Äôt really have anything to do with you. Other than that it‚Äôs great!"
147,Ahshole,"October 8, 2018",5,Essential. Fantastic app that has been a part of my every day routine for many years now. The devs were on point when a glitch would not allow me to log in. Many thanks to the Timehop crew for their assistance and hard work throughout the years!
148,"Was good, but no more","October 29, 2018",2,"Wish it worked like it used to All my friends and I used to love this app to reminisce our old memories but the last year and a half at least 80% of my videos, posts and pictures are just gray screens that never load or fail to load. All my friends have just deleted the app. I keep it in the hopes that you guys would fix it but it‚Äôs not happening by the looks. Oh well, definitely not worth the download anymore sadly."
149,637489,"April 9, 2019",5,One of my favorites! The best time of my day is getting the notification I have some memories to look back on. I always love seeing what happened over the years and being able to share those memories with others. Absolutely love this app!
150,Kellieandrandy,"January 19, 2018",4,Love the Timehop! I look forward to seeing my memories! I especially love that you can still see some from past days in case I missed it. I wish when you say something about the post that posted too. That‚Äôs the only thing I don‚Äôt like so sometimes I have to use On This Day through Facebook to do that.
151,Malorie Heart,"March 16, 2018",3,"Please Fix! When I have a Timehop memory that includes something attached to it, like a movie or event that I had gone to or seen, I can‚Äôt see it in the memory.. whatever I have commented about it comes up, but not the movie. I.e, if I had seen Harry Potter, I probably commented posted that I loved this movie, but I have no idea what movie I‚Äôm talking about when I‚Äôm looking back at it 3 years later... Please fix! Thnx"
152,Aylurr,"June 30, 2018",3,"Loved but frustrated Loved this ap, but now all it does is crash once I open It. I can‚Äôt share or save any images because it immediately crashes. I‚Äôve tried it off and on WiFi. Doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve deleted and re downloaded the app. Doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve updated the app. Doesn‚Äôt work. I have plenty of space on my device. Not sure why I can‚Äôt get this app to work."
153,Hullo Cupcake,"June 30, 2018",1,"Bug I used to love the app but I‚Äôve been experiencing what I assume is a bug where none of my content loads. I open the app and instead of seeing pictures or videos, it‚Äôs a blank grey screen. Sometimes I was able to make the picture appear by hitting the share button but even that isn‚Äôt working anymore. Im missing out on memories and it‚Äôs made me stop using the app. Hoping someone could fix the bug :/ I‚Äôve tried updating and that doesn‚Äôt seem to change anything."
154,piplup24 pokemom,"July 9, 2018",5,"Awesome app but.. I love this app so much and I love learning new facts and love seeing what I posted 5 or more years ago! I just wish it could connect to snapchat too because I use that social media app wayyyyy more than the other ones. Oh well, I still recommend downloading it!!!"
155,Larryc508,"July 9, 2018",4,Very good This app is a great way to see old pictures or tweets u might have done in number of years ago. Some of the features that I really like are gone but it is still a great app! Also you can have a streak on how times you go on the app I‚Äôm up too 345! Have fun and some of your memories will be full on laughs and embarrassment

157,DanielleDestroy,"October 23, 2018",4,Issue with Instagram connection There‚Äôs an issue right now with the connection to Instagram. It doesn‚Äôt allow me to see my actual post when I click on it while in timehop. It just takes me to the log in page of Instagram when I‚Äôve already logged in. Just a heads up!
158,Shenzaii,"April 25, 2020",4,"A little buggy I love this app. Had to knock off a star because for the past months, the reminder started going off multiple times a day, as if I didn‚Äôt just view my Timehop for the day. I ignored it once thinking it was a mistake, and ended up losing a four year streak ‚òπÔ∏è. Other than that, the app is pretty cool."
159,SammiJeanGal,"February 18, 2020",4,"Great app. One problem The only problem I have with this app is that the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button covers song and artist names during the RetroVideo. If there‚Äôs a song that I like, it‚Äôs hard to look up because it‚Äôs missing that info.... could those go at the top left/right of the video instead???"
160,Abberdean,"January 4, 2018",2,Doesn‚Äôt work anymore I‚Äôve used timehop for a few years and in the past few months it won‚Äôt work at all. The app fails out usually not letting me see any of my photos. I reached out to customer support a week or so ago and never heard back. I‚Äôve tried deleting and re downloading but it didn‚Äôt improve so I‚Äôm just deleting it for good. Maybe it‚Äôd work better if they didn‚Äôt add all the extra stickers and crap.
161,m_austin,"July 9, 2018",1,"Reset Not having the ability to choose which Facebook page Timehop will connect to makes this app worthless. Last year I was at 400+ Days on my streak. Lost it all with your upgrade. With your security glitch I again lost my almost 1 year mark. I cannot get it to recognize my personal FB account, and even tried deleting the app on FB so Timehop would hopefully give me the option. Nope. I am deleting this app & just going off of FB memories. Timehop you need to work on your app!"

With the new updates I can no longer view the pictures in my gallery from that day & year . It jus shows up as blank screens . So I have to swipe through a million blank screens jus to get to one memory . This problem needs to be fixed ASAP or I‚Äôm jus gonna delete the all because it‚Äôs kinda no pony if I can‚Äôt view my memories

165,Hamandjams,"October 20, 2018",1,I will fix my review if you fix your feature I updated the app yesterday and am currently trying to send a picture to someone from two years ago. Somehow the app thinks that this is the appropriate time to ask me for a review. And I can‚Äôt exit that while I‚Äôm trying to type the message. I‚Äôve closed the app and tried again 3+ times and I‚Äôm just so frustrated. I get that you want reviews but I imagine you don‚Äôt want this one. Fix. It. 
166,JHagan777,"October 21, 2018",5,Wonderful Memories Our family absolutely loves sharing all the memories together.  We send them to each other every single day.  Moments that may have been forgotten as a few years pass are brought back to life!! Thank you

I restarted the app three times and I still got the same error message. I really do not want to create a Facebook account just to have the app. I know this is a good app, but it does not work for me."
176,CindyCrowley,"February 11, 2020",5,Timehop is awesome. From the very stylish way they remind you of memories to their little cute notes to remind you to look into it and their educational entertainment and history trivia they are a totally awesome app. I am so glad I have it as it appeals to all age groups which is also fantastic.
177,uh-loner,"October 10, 2019",5,"Amazing Every time I look at this app, it reminds me of the past, the days I slowly forget about getting older.

180,Intra_Nelani,"December 6, 2017",2,I would love it if it didn‚Äôt keep crashing Timehop is definitely the best part about waking up most days and taking a look at where I was years ago today can be very inspirational. However if I have photos from over 5 years ago it starts to crash. I mean I have photos from over 8 years ago so it crashes almost every time I use this app. Such a brilliant app I just need it to stop crashing !!
181,Epon1306,"December 29, 2017",1,Not working On Christmas Day the app froze up and then I could get on it for two days. I decided to delete it and re download it. It worked for a day and then yesterday it did the same thing where it was frozen up and wouldn‚Äôt work. All i can see is the settings symbol and an arrow at the top but it can‚Äôt click on anything or pull anything down. I messaged the support thing and got nothing back. I love checking this app everyday so I hope this gets fixed.

200,AcrylicAngel,"December 31, 2017",4,"It was good but then.. I‚Äôve used Timehop forever and I love it. However, after the last Timehop update (on iPhone) I have not been able to use it. The app will open but get stuck on the yellow page. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but it doesn‚Äôt work. Please fix this"
201,Bvlcw,"June 13, 2018",3,Better but not great I still can't repost videos. What happened to seeing all the comments on my posts??? I have to go to ‚Äúon this day‚Äù in FB if I want to read the comments. The posts are great but a lot of what made looking at posts the best is reading comments from a couple people no longer on earth. Please revert to previous version!!!
202,Chkns r us,"September 20, 2018",4,Timehop. Loved this app till today‚Äôs update. Won‚Äôt go past the date and loading.  Why update if the app can‚Äôt handle it?  So I won‚Äôt be able to see anything till it‚Äôs fixed and of course will start from the beginning again.  
203,JSilvia619,"September 21, 2018",3,iPhone photos saved to the cloud Please fix! I have a reoccurring issue that almost renders this app useless in most cases. I store all of my photos in iCloud and unfortunately the app does not speak well with this format. Most images take minutes to load or do not load at all. Is there a known fix for this or will it be addressed in an upcoming update?
204,Justin Boucher 123,"October 24, 2018",5,More control My only complaint about time hop is I wish I could pick a day to view. You can‚Äôt go back and see yesterday or you can‚Äôt go ahead and see tomorrow and you can‚Äôt say see what‚Äôs happened on your birthday.
205,Zoe :P,"December 6, 2018",3,Cool App! I like this app but it‚Äôs a little hard to get into my social media accounts (especially Instagram) because I‚Äôve forgotten my password and the password reset is so complicated. It would be nice to have a feature that connects to social media accounts I‚Äôm currently logged into on my phone!
206,KendallEatsYou,"August 7, 2019",3,"Upset & deleting this app. The new privacy agreement requires you to share information with ad marketers... I feel like I can‚Äôt get away from that. I really loved Timehop, I enjoyed looking back on the dumb things I‚Äôve tweeted. "

I would look at my old pics before checking Facebook, my emails, and everything else. Now I went on yesterday, and my ""streak"" is gone. I'm back to 1. I'm really irritated. I have over 175 Timehops in a row. I don't know what you guys did, but you messed it up. I feel x m like deleting jk the app. I used to think it was worth a five star rating. Not anymore. I wish that I could leave 0 like"

I have updated to the latest version, I have deleted and reloaded the app, and I have done everything else that I saw in the help section to do. I am very frustrated that most of the memories won‚Äôt come up. If it weren‚Äôt for the long streak I have, I would not even bother checking everyday."
209,sierranyquist,"July 18, 2019",1,"No customer service. I was logged out of all accounts randomly, losing my streak. Saw on the update to ‚Äúcall them‚Äù if this happened, and how do you call? I go to twitter and tweet them directly with no response. So I sent them a private message 3 times to no avail. I deleted the app. Trash customer service, I had over 700 days on my streak and the fact that I‚Äôve been ignored is what caused me to delete the app. I won‚Äôt support a company who screws up my streak and refuses to acknowledge it."

Not that I‚Äôm opposed to it, I just don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs saying. Maybe a caption in your preferred language can be used. I wish I knew what the other lingo said, that‚Äôs all."
211,Face one,"December 26, 2017",1,"Increasingly terrible product I used to love this app. I have small kids and enjoy the reminders of how much they are growing from year to year. The format has gotten slightly worse with every update, making it harder and harder to use. I have gotten used to the adds, but no the majority of things one even load. The age or source doesn't seem to matter, most things don't work. Ok about to stop trying and am very disappointed about that."
212,Liz24624,"January 2, 2018",5,Obnoxiously loud adds cannot be shut off The loud in app adds need to be taken off. Horrible advertising. Makes me not want to open the app...  cannot even shut them off without completely closing the app.
213,Dgfgirl,"February 12, 2018",3,Miss the old snap chat version I would give it a better rating but miss the old snap chat version. Wish they would change it back to where all the stories were on one page again separate from regular snap chats going on. But do like the option to mute a group chat that comes in handy!
214,elyse221,"May 8, 2018",4,Mini time machine on your phone Love this app! Gathering my memories from all my social media accounts of every day of the year and having them in one place is an easy fun way for a quick trip back in time. Love seeing how many years have gone by and sharing with friends a good TBT!
215,Nocket,"September 17, 2018",4,"Great app! One request Is it possible to have the option to make a grid of the timehops? So instead of timehopping one pic at a time one year at a time, you‚Äôd be able to timehop pics from multiple years or multiple pics from the same year. That would be a great add!"
216,starfishali,"October 25, 2018",3,"Needs one major feature added Most of the time I love this app. That said- there should be an option to skip or remove a memory without having to find the old tweet, post, pic associated with it.  I‚Äôd really like to not be reminded of a dying family member or other scenarios I thought were hopeful at the time and turned out tragic."
217,Muph Diesel,"November 14, 2018",5,Thankful Thank you so much for this app. Every day I‚Äôm able to access tangible memories. Most often wonderful and sometimes sad but none the less I‚Äôm grateful to be able to be reminded of them. Please never go away.
218,Pbarone2000,"May 27, 2019",4,"Nice but can be improved Quite addictive indeed, have been checking out every day for more than 2 years but I am missing a few things: OneDrive support, now and then crops images in a way that makes it unusable just to name the top two that come to mind"
219,Taste! Gaming‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,"September 21, 2019",4,"Pretty cool but layout is annoying I love this app but I wish the layout was different, like if it had icons for each thing that you would tap on instead of showing them on the same thing. It‚Äôs hard to explain what I‚Äôm trying to say but there you go!"
220,JoeandAnn,"October 31, 2017",1,Multiple Photos Crashing App God forbid you have taken more than one photo on a day! This app has been crashing so bad when I have a group of photos taken during the same timeframe like Halloween. I tried 20 times to look through all my Halloween photos of my kid and crashed every time halfway through. This has been happening for the last few months once they started adding all the ad space between every picture.
221,Iamspartachris,"December 3, 2017",1,"What have you done? The addition of sponsored ads that cannot be skipped has ruined this app. Every third or fourth image, you are confronted with a 15-30 second ad that you are forced to watch in its entirety, so if you have multiple images in your daily Timehop, you might have to sit through three or four of these. Nothing destroys the flow of scrolling through memories more than this. What an awful change to what used to be a delightful experience."
222,TrixieMercury,"January 4, 2018",4,"Love what it does, but not how The swiping is awkward. Originally, users could scroll and it was much easier to see each post, the attached comments and to share on other platforms. I believe giving different viewing options would help."
223,MaxPower72,"July 9, 2018",1,"Deleting app I really liked Timehop when it first came out, but it seems to be going downhill. Not all of my ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù from fb make it into Timehop and now, the fix to be able to see the comments on pictures and posts is taking me back to the fb app. So, what‚Äôs the point of even using Timehop?"
224,lilbabyv85,"March 4, 2019",3,Missing phone photos So as amazing as this app is and I love seeing things that you forgot about! Since the last update I‚Äôve noticed that I don‚Äôt get any pictures from my phone anymore. It shows all the social media things but not the ones saved to my phone. Kinda sad. Still love the app though.
225,Last minute snow skiiers ‚õ∑,"November 3, 2019",5,"I love this app!! Especially that utilizes my camera roll back so many years to 2004!  So sweet to see places you visited, pets you miss, life‚Äôs milestones with friends and family without having to dig thru looking!  Many times it‚Äôs reminding me of days I‚Äôd forgotten!"

227,Manda-Bear7946,"August 24, 2019",4,"Love it! Love time hop, the ability to see pics and videos, and the back in the day summary.

228,Maddie0086,"July 18, 2019",4,Hi It‚Äôs a pretty good app the only thing I would like to be fixed is I would like to be able to see my instagram content even if it‚Äôs archived. I am however aware you are all working on that and it is just instagram trying to protect our privacy. Keep up the good work!
229,popsie berry,"June 26, 2019",4,"More accounts I wish we were allowed to do more than one Instagram accounts on this app. I have to pick and chose which account I keep it on!!

230,MazzieNicole,"December 21, 2017",5,Wish could add multiple accounts I love this app dearly and use it everyday but I find myself wishing I could add multiple instagram or twitter accounts so I could activity on all of them. Other than that things are great !
231,247Mohney,"July 9, 2018",4,"Please Fix This I am really frustrated, I love this app it‚Äôs so fun, but it randomly logged me out and so I tried signing back in and it continuously tells me ‚Äúoops something went wrong try again later‚Äù and it has been a full 48 hours and this still continues to happen."
232,Eworth222,"July 13, 2018",5,"Lost my streak after the update After the recent update, I had to log all my apps back into Timehop, but I lost my streak.  I want to know why I‚Äôm starting over. I open the app everyday. I tried the Support@timehop but it doesn‚Äôt work."
233,OClady1125,"October 19, 2018",5,Suggestion It would be great if you could share a previous picture that was posted on social media would carry over the actual verbiage of the post as well.

235,amazingmelisa,"December 28, 2018",5,Suggestion Add a response tab for all your finishing comments..... that would be fun. Or at least a like button...  the ending comments are one of my favorite things. I‚Äôve been opening this app for almost 900 days!!!!!!
236,smaysy,"January 13, 2019",4,"What happened? I have had this app for years, but it no longer pulls my memories from Facebook.

237,KER's Mommy,"January 15, 2019",4,"This Day in History Video I enjoy looking at Timehop daily. I like watching the video at the end of Timehop, however, I wish there was more space between the end of the video and it re-starting. Overall, it is fun to look back on memories of years past!"
238,Col.fragger,"October 3, 2019",4,"1 complaint Love the app. Have used it over two years straight. My one complaint is that if I open the app and go through my Timehop before the app sends its daily reminder, I still get the reminder for that day. Just a small annoyance in an otherwise enjoyable app."
239,KLFCF,"September 10, 2019",5,Memories I love this app!!! It shows me pictures sometimes that I have forgotten about. I like seeing my pictures from years past without having to go back through my photos!

241,Lord Petrus Steele,"March 1, 2018",2,"this app is incompatible with iOS11 ever since i had iOS 11 beta, timehop has slowed my phone down immensely."
242,Jkmfr3,"March 17, 2018",5,Disappointed I love the idea of this app it‚Äôs just a shame it doesn‚Äôt work most of the time. It freezes up and takes forever for the pictures to load. So disappointed.
243,jjara47,"July 1, 2018",5,"A favorite still, but my links don‚Äôt work :( I use Timehop daily, and I enjoy the new frame feature, but I‚Äôd also like to review links in old tweets if possible. Is this something you might bring back?"
244,kaitlyndcarter,"August 3, 2018",2,Half the time it doesn‚Äôt even work Most of the time it won‚Äôt even load well enough to show my pictures. Usually it just shows how long ago it was and is a blank gray screen. I love the idea but Photos and Facebook at least let me see what happened. The only ones that work are the back in history ones and I don‚Äôt even care for those.
245,longgg time userr,"October 21, 2018",3,Use to be better but it‚Äôs ok now. The banners use to let you put the years in multiple places to not be in the way of the photo.. not anymore. 
246,StaceyWellborn,"December 28, 2018",4,"Re download- please fix skip button Love the app, think I had a 500 day streak on my old phone. But now downloading on my new phone the button for skip is WAY too far up on the right and you can‚Äôt effectively hit it. It‚Äôs quite frustrating!"
247,mitchmatch18,"December 29, 2018",3,Awesome but need an update I just recently got an iPhone XR. I love the phone. And I love Timehop. But since I got this new phone the app hasn‚Äôt been working like it used to. Videos don‚Äôt play. I can‚Äôt see how long ago the post was. It‚Äôs just really frustrating. So until they update the app to make it compatible with the newer iPhones don‚Äôt download the app.
248,Jlc526,"November 5, 2019",4,Years missing? I love time hop. The only thing I feel like is I don‚Äôt see anything from 2-5 years ago. It goes from 1 year ago to 5 years ago. I know I have stuff bc when I go on Facebook it‚Äôs there. I‚Äôm also logged on to everything. So not sure what‚Äôs happening.
249,catkapfhammer13,"July 31, 2019",4,"Recent Update I love Timehop, but the most recent update makes it so I don‚Äôt see any memories! :( It goes straight to the retro video and that‚Äôs it. I double checked to make sure all of my accounts were still linked and they were. Hoping this is fixed soon.."
250,Ashykins8809,"March 27, 2018",3,Needs improvement The older format was so much easier to use as far as referring on the image and its contents. It‚Äôs difficult to read the post (if Timehop was via social media) and the tap to change the screen as opposed to swiping is ridiculously annoying! I still enjoy seeing my history on this cool app.
251,Hello Kitty is awesome,"April 23, 2018",5,I love this app I love timehop. There is never a day that I don‚Äôt laugh at my past self. The only problem I have is that I have 2 Twitter accounts and I can only connect 1. If I could connect both I would give this app 6 stars.
252,JenJoyR,"May 23, 2018",5,"It‚Äôs Awesome! I love looking back at all the memories that I have! It‚Äôs so cool to see how things change in 1,2,3,10 years! And it‚Äôs cool to see what I was doing on this day 1,2,3 or 10 years ago today! I really enjoy this app! And I recommend you get it!"

256,thetish5,"November 18, 2018",5,"Remembering Mom Timehop was initially a thing that I installed for fun, but after my Mom passed away it is a way to daily get little reminders of Mom from her Facebook comments to me over the years. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for that glimpse of her."
257,MdotKat,"August 14, 2019",5,"It was awesome until big tobacco got involved I loved Timehop until I started getting addd for vape pens.

258,tonnimarie55,"July 31, 2019",4,"Timehop can‚Äôt count 1 year club and so on, they‚Äôre not on the correct dates. 365 days in a year. 730 marks 2 years, not 770.

260,afatgreekcat,"November 28, 2017",1,"Forced ads after new update After the most recent update to the app, it now forces you to watch 45+ second ads every 8 or so slides. For someone who has a lot of things on their hop (100+ daily) this turns checking my Timehop into a half hour affair. Before you could just swipe right past. I understand why it would be this way, but it should be 1 video ad a day only plus a bunch of photo ADs, OR a 10 second cap."
261,Daveb1970,"February 21, 2018",5,"Great but We love this app, our daily trip down memory lane!  We (and our friends) wish there was a way to chose dates in past on any given day.  Just something to think about!"

263,Spoonertexas,"October 31, 2018",3,"Great idea, poor execution Timehop is a go to app for me. It is fantastic. But the constant waiting for anything to load on a cellular connection is a huge detractor. If I am not on super fast Wi-Fi, I basically only see spinning wheels while Timehop tries to load pictures from my past. Not sure if it is their fault, but the experience is far short of satisfactory."

I saw others were having the same problem for a few days. Help?"

Over the past couple years it had become part of my routine. Then they introduced auto play ads, complete with audio.

Lately I can‚Äôt just swipe left to see the next photo because it freezes after every photo I view.

285,Timehop Fail,"February 16, 2019",2,Lacking Memories I‚Äôve been doing Timehop for years and the last few months have been showing me nothing from Facebook or any other social media. Every once in a while I get something. It‚Äôs upsetting because I enjoy looking back at everything. It needs to be fixed. I literally open the app daily to not lose my streak. Figure it out...
286,ellenmariet61,"April 28, 2019",2,"Not happy I am no longer able to access my photos or Timehops more than 5 years back, when before I could access my memories form 10 and 11 years ago.  I have reached out to customer support 3 times and all I got was a response than my inquiry was received and they would respond when they had time... it‚Äôs been like a month"
287,Ihjhhmhyu,"December 26, 2019",5,The best app ever!!! A friend of mine shared this with me a year or so ago & it is my favorite app ever!

290,Raii1946,"February 28, 2018",3,Retro video glitch I love the app all the memories that pop are cool but retro video glitched extra hard today one of the sections of the video commentary was playing over another section of the video and like it better when I didn't have to tap to the next part of the retro video.... go back to continuous retro video please
291,Bvurachel,"March 1, 2018",5,The pros and cons I love the idea of this app-it used to be 5 stars but now there is so much advertisement and retro videos that make it unpleasant. The retro videos play loudly even when I have my phone silenced which really is irritating!
292,Teenahpea,"May 9, 2018",4,"Duplicate accounts I love Timehop. But we live in a world where social media is basically our lives. Many of us have multiple social media accounts. I‚Äôd love to have the option of adding both my twitter accounts in the future! Otherwise, great app!"
293,Elyse Mo,"May 27, 2018",3,"Doesn‚Äôt show past 1 year In updates past TimeHop has shown me what I‚Äôve posted 2, 3, 4, etc. years ago as well as 1 year ago. It no longer shows me any of this and I am disappointed and feel like I‚Äôm missing out- I want to be able to see more than 1 year past again."
294,MoodyZ4,"July 1, 2018",5,"My favorite app! This is seriously my favorite app! I look forward to looking at my day in Timehop every single morning when i wake up. I‚Äôm a picture fanatic, so of course this app appeals to me. I‚Äôm on day 605!! I can‚Äôt wait to hit 1000! üéâ"
295,BabySwim,"August 10, 2018",3,App is great when it works! I love checking the app and seeing the pictures/videos of years past when they actually open but half the time they do not. The wheel just spins so I close app and go about my day bc I don‚Äôt have time to sit and wait and wait and wait and still nothing.
296,Catchnwaves,"October 22, 2018",5,"2 year club üëçüèª I mean who doesn‚Äôt love looking back 10 years to see what you were doing?! Such a simple app, easy to connect all your social media apps to creat your daily time hop feed!"
297,Mimimimi21,"November 30, 2018",2,"Photos not loading Since the most recent update, the issue has started to reoccur where photos do not load. I sit and wait for a few minutes only for the picture to never load. It‚Äôs pretty frustrating when the whole point of the app is to see photos and this isn‚Äôt the first time it has happened."
298,kelley_elaine,"December 14, 2018",2,"Not good for iPhone XR I‚Äôve never had a problem with this app until I upgraded my iPhone 7 to the XR. The videos won‚Äôt load, top of screen is cut off, if there‚Äôs more than one picture in the group it won‚Äôt load and I had over a year streak of checking daily and that doesn‚Äôt load at the end anymore either! Please fix this, I love my daily Timehop"
299,Mo_B2011,"December 21, 2018",3,"Okay but not great The app rarely loads all the photos/posts and if it does, it takes 10 minutes or more! This is not a connection problem. I‚Äôve used my WiFi and 4 bars of LTE‚Äî the outcome is the same. I love seeing old photos of my little boy, just don‚Äôt have time to wait for them to load."
300,Flameo,"December 9, 2017",1,Don‚Äôt let others sign into your Facebook A friend of mine need to use Facebook and so I let her sign in well it signed me outta my Timehop and now when I log in as Facebook it just logs her in and not mine so now I can see all her timehop stuff but not mine. I‚Äôve tried deleting it and signing with my number than sign in to Facebook but still does her stuff. Ugh I have no use for this app anymore if it doesn‚Äôt sign in my Facebook
301,danceislife1206,"December 19, 2017",4,Other Social Media I really like the app. It brings back memories and some pictures i don‚Äôt even remember posting. I just wish I could connect SnapChat to it because I use SnapChat much more than any other of my social media accounts.
302,Wwwggf,"March 26, 2018",5,Love this app! I love this app so much because I forget to save a lot of my pictures and videos and time hop allows me to see them again and now I can save them and keep them forever!!
303,Chelelaughs,"October 24, 2018",5,I check it daily! It‚Äôs fun to look at each day and see what I was doing this day... in the past years. I‚Äôve had the app for 5 years and still check it every day!
304,RL123455789,"April 16, 2020",2,"Too Slow At least one picture from each day, if not more...(usually it‚Äôs more pictures than one) doesn‚Äôt show up. The little line is there on the top as if it‚Äôs trying to load, but the line never moves and the pics never come up. I rated a 2 because the status‚Äô and pics that do load are nice reminders."
305,Jdeviese,"February 13, 2020",1,"Could be loads better Looking at memories is fun. However functionality is really annoying. Would be better to divide simply according to year, or give the option of skipping years. Sometimes people have loads of photos from a family event and it‚Äôs difficult to scroll through one photo at a time to get past it. Give us a skip function or something!!!!"
306,78hldivorce,"January 1, 2020",3,"Time Hop I have used Time Hop for a few years now. For two years now it has not reset it self at the start of a new year. I am now on day 777, I think. What I would like to have the ability to do is delete some things. Multiple pages of the same thing when all I really need is one."
307,Hearlson,"December 10, 2019",5,This app is one of my favorites on my phone I have over 700 days in a row on my app right now. I love getting to see all my memories. It‚Äôs a nice moment to get to look at pics of the past years!!
308,Detdeb,"October 7, 2019",4,"Love this app....but I love this app and have been using it for about two years. All of a sudden, it won‚Äôt display any of the pages. I hope there is a quick fix because I love the daily reminders of how things were."
309,yippeekim,"July 11, 2019",2,"Loved until ads that freeze I have loved this app, I‚Äôm over 1000 in a row. But lately, on the pages with an ad, it freezes. I thought I just had to wait so many seconds for it to ‚Äúplay‚Äù, but it freezes every day and I have to go out of app completely and reopen for it to work. I won‚Äôt keep doing this, so hope it gets fixed."
310,Lew1604,"December 14, 2017",4,Love the app but... Since the last update of the retro video it takes forever to load and sometimes it won‚Äôt even play... :‚Äô(
311,K7Marshall,"December 31, 2017",4,"Loved it, until recently! I absolutely loved this app until it stopped working on my iPhone 6 Plus about 2 weeks ago. The app opens, but never advances beyond a blank yellow screen. Hoping a new update is coming soon that fixes it!"
312,joejoe721,"January 2, 2018",5,"Interesting Although I am new to this App, it has allowed me the opportunity to see photos I no longer have in my phone and recapture them. That is the best feature of the App"
313,K.246817,"January 19, 2018",5,Love it! I love this app! I connected it to everything and I get pictures from a long time ago that I completely forgot about! I would recommend this to everyone!
314,musiclover33333333333333333,"March 26, 2018",5,Love I love seeing this stuff and I guess making myself feel old lol. I‚Äôm now on a 90 day steak and don‚Äôt plan on ending it any time soon. On VSCO I have a journal with my screenshots that I take. It is called Timehop Discoveries. I continue to add to it regularly.
315,supergreatgameahdksm,"April 28, 2018",4,Snapchat Memories? I use timehop everyday and love the idea of it. But I take most of my pictures on snapchat and they save to my Snapchat memories. You should be able to connect timehop to snapchat. If that‚Äôs already possible then does anyone know how to do it?
316,~ABE1991~,"December 14, 2018",2,XR I love Timehop!! Although ever since I upgraded to the IPhone XR it no longer works..I don‚Äôt get all of my pics to load and not one video will play. I emailed and they said it‚Äôs a known issue and they‚Äôre working on it.. good news is even though it doesn‚Äôt show my 5++ day streak it‚Äôs still safe as long as I still open the app everyday! Hope they get it fixed soon!!
317,Scott Killian,"December 17, 2018",4,Love the app but... Could you please put the bar with the ‚Äúhow many years ago‚Äù at the bottom of the screen vs the top center.  New iPhone with full screen can‚Äôt see how long sho a pic was due to the space for the earpiece and front facing camera.
318,sebs180,"January 20, 2019",3,Bring back the zoom feature on then and now. Would be nice to be able to zoom in on images in the then and now again. Now it‚Äôs just the stupid frame images that can‚Äôt be turned off and it doesn‚Äôt let me zoom in on the image any more.
319,Zachary Massung,"May 28, 2019",4,"Great App It‚Äôs really cool and nostalgic to see all of the  stuff I did on the certain date and time. I love checking this app everyday and I love how it keeps track of how many days I‚Äôve checked in a row. Probably, my favorite feature to be honest. All in all, really great app."
320,Sally Bananas,"October 19, 2017",5,Hop To It~! No problems here.  Love this app as it's fun to see photos basically from your time capsule.....and what's free this day and age! üòç

322,Cece812,"May 6, 2018",1,No photos Update: I deleted this app & reinstalled. It still doesn‚Äôt work. 
323,PinkWrench84,"September 19, 2018",5,New update??? The update from today locked me completely out of TimeHop!! I‚Äôm having withdrawal and my 3 yr old daughter won‚Äôt stop crying bc she can‚Äôt see her pictures before bed. Ugh. What happened??
324,abalittletime,"October 19, 2018",3,"Loved it and am now mostly annoyed I love seeing my old posts and social media activity. But the daily reminders to check the app are annoying, when all I am shown is pop culture history. I want to be reminded if I have something to look at from my history, not the world‚Äôs."
325,Bmerck,"October 19, 2018",5,Stacy Merck I look forward to seeing what comes up on my Timehop everyday.  I usually check it first thing before getting out of bed because it gives me a smile to start my day.
326,cmk3748,"January 15, 2019",3,Where did FB go? I haven‚Äôt seen any of my FB posts for a solid month or so now - and I know they exist because of the memory feature FB also has. They also aren‚Äôt hidden because you just rolled out that feature and I don‚Äôt know where that lives in the settings...
327,rayellemarie,"April 1, 2019",3,"Someone else‚Äôs account? I‚Äôve had this app and my logins all done for months now, and I opened it today and it was all someone else‚Äôs posts/accounts?

328,Stumps13,"April 10, 2019",5,"Adding Venmo I would love to have see TimeHop contract with Venmo so that over time we can see hilarious transactions that took place in our lives. Also, Google Calendar would be a great addition to add for the next Update! PLEASE ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
329,skaaahhhh,"May 26, 2019",3,"Forever wishing! I love this app! But, I have multiple facebook accounts and I‚Äôd love one day to be able to sync all accounts to one, or even have access to see my other two pages because right now I only see one and don‚Äôt know how to even log in the other two."
330,Christylc,"December 14, 2017",3,Like but inappropriate ads! I‚Äôve had TimeHop for awhile now but lately it seems the ads are 1. After every picture now and 2. Inappropriate! I‚Äôve seen a condom ad everyday for the last week & it is very GRAPHIC. I‚Äôm an adult but I‚Äôm sure there are many teen & pre-teen users on this app. Not a good judgement call at all.
331,Banana Happy,"December 19, 2017",1,"New phone I love this app, honestly its my favorite. But I changed my phone (iPhone X) and since the move I haven‚Äôt been able to use the app properly. It‚Äôs telling me that twitter is connected but I can‚Äôt see any tweets. I tried to re-upload my archive and it won‚Äôt work and I have been waiting for their support to get back to me for nearly a month now. What‚Äôs the point of keeping an app that won‚Äôt work anymore."
332,manduhhhX,"January 1, 2018",2,"well, that‚Äôs annoying the recent update has adds starting to pay even when your sound is off. I don‚Äôt mind adds, but I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to hear them and without warning. twice now i‚Äôve opened the app, forgetting about the very loud update, and had to quickly shut down the app to avoid it playing loud adds."
333,Kelsyl83,"May 28, 2018",3,Crash city!! For the last two months if I try to send anything from the app it either crashes or freezes my phone so I have to restart it. None of my other apps are like this and my phone is up to date with new software! Super annoying!
334,Coolgirl 1,"July 18, 2018",2,"Needs a fix Timehop needs to fix itself. Every time I go on the app to look at the past years‚Äô pictures, the app crashes. Even when I exit and open the app again it crashes again on the same picture. It‚Äôs getting really annoying and I can barely get through the pictures now."
335,Countryguyjc,"September 20, 2018",5,Update worked Thank you for fixing the crash/freezing.  I love the app and always enjoy when I see what happened in yrs past.  I‚Äôm on a 616 day streak so thank you for fixing.
336,AderaTheChosenOne,"October 21, 2018",5,"Love this They need a forward version of this app. But I won‚Äôt say that because that‚Äôs my intellectual property... anyways... Timehop is amazing. History always repeats itself, even if only in more technically savvy and decorated ways"
337,angelcritter76,"November 16, 2018",4,Love it!!! I love seeing all the memories I have with my family. 
338,Layleebug21,"May 9, 2019",4,"It‚Äôs great, but.. I love this app. It would be soooo much better if it including other social media‚Äôs like Snapchat, though. Other than that. It‚Äôs an amazing app. Gives you a glimpse back into the past which, more often than not, warms the heart."
339,TheRealTripp,"April 23, 2020",5,Game changer This app helps the user reflect on their past with picture and video evidence on a daily basis. I can‚Äôt think of another service like it in human history. What a time to be alive!
340,Current me,"October 26, 2017",5,I have a suggestion This app is really great and I love it but you guys should maybe include Snapchat memories because some people have a lot of Snapchat memories and maybe you could include that

346,BAD OR GREAT,"April 1, 2020",3,Enjoyed to broken Really enjoyed the app and it worked great for a couple months. Last week or so the app seems to be broken. It will send me notifications like it has something but when i try to open it says fiddle sticks. Been doing it fir almost a week now.
347,kamespayne,"March 21, 2020",4,"Love it, BUT.. I wish there were a feature so I could plug in multiple instagram accounts. I have one for my art and one for my personal, and it would be cool if i could have them both in there! Otherwise, love the app."

351,your-guardian-angel,"September 16, 2018",2,Missing Memories I used to use this app all the time. I reinstalled in when a got a new phone with more memory. I have no idea what happened in the updates but things I‚Äôve clearly posted that are on Facebook in my memories only show up here half the time and usually the ones that don‚Äôt are the ones I‚Äôd like to use.

487,NecieFarr,"March 17, 2019",3,"Annoying top banner The banner at the top of the shared photos takes up too much space. It used to fit around the photo, now it takes up space on the photo itself and you can‚Äôt adjust it."
488,Mrs.Desrosiers,"April 8, 2019",3,Too many ads So far I‚Äôm rating 3 stars because I went through my daily time hop & literally passed by 5 apps. Very annoyed that there isn‚Äôt an option to not have adds. Didn‚Äôt download the app to scroll through ads.

I don‚Äôt know who makes the face hop for the new year but when it‚Äôs still showing up as come back tomorrow to see your 2017 and it‚Äôs January 7- just do away with it- clearly time hop dropped the ball and didn‚Äôt get them all done in time and they should have just never released them.
493,adognamedOliver,"July 12, 2018",2,Picture borders I wish there was a way to remove the Timehop borders from the pictures. It‚Äôs ugly and interferes with my photos. Also it usually blocks copy or a portion of the photo. I wish we could at least pay to have them removed so I could share the photos I‚Äôm remembering through the app.
494,Emilee Gargano,"August 3, 2018",4,add Snapchat :)! I think adding Snapchat would be a great idea because so many people use it and it‚Äôs one app I use a lot for taking pictures as well. I would love to see it added to the app

1810,ijustgetbored,"October 2, 2015",3,"Hopefully temporary oddities? I'm not a long-time user of this app, so I really can't refer to how it worked in the past. I'd been enjoying it for the time I'd had it, though: it was clean, simple, and easy to share or not to share a particular thing. That's really all I wanted (and still all I want: too see whatever is popping up from the various social media accounts that I'm supposedly connected to). "
1811,melissavee,"January 24, 2016",3,"It's okay but needs work It's an amazing idea. Especially for moms. It's so cool to see how much your child has grown and have the ability to do a side-by-side then and now. I like the new frames but sometimes it just doesn't work. Especially when you want to share a status and it's particularly long, it doesn't all fit right. "
1812,Shellbunbun,"December 28, 2016",1,Why fix what isn't broken? I have honestly never written a review for an app before but this recent update pisses me off so much that I feel I need to take the time out of my day to rant about it. I just don't understand the thought process behind this update at all. I used to enjoy checking out Timehop everyday but now it just irritates me to even open it. I don't understand the layout at all. Why in the world would every photo be automatically zoomed in? On top of that you can no longer see the time stamp or the caption of the post which basically takes away half of the meaning of the memory. Also I understand the whole tap through thing may seem popular because of Snapchat but it does not work for the purposes of Timehop at all. I used to enjoy scrolling through Timehop and seeing the progression of my past memories but now it just seems  like all the memories are so singular and isolated that it takes the fun out of it. I seriously hate this update so much it's insane. The update did nothing good for the app and from the looks of all the negative reviews I'm not the only person who feels this way. There's no need to try adding all this fancy nonsense to the app that it doesn't need in the first place. Timehop is supposed to be about enjoying the past so why don't we stick to that theme and change the app back to the way it was?
1813,Chrysanthe Tan,"December 31, 2016",1,"RIP Timehop Looks like everyone else has said it. This new update makes Timehop unusable. I no longer check it everyday, because it stresses me out too much. "
1814,adidas4287,"January 2, 2017",1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I barely write reviews and would've given 5 stars before the update, but I feel it is necessary to contribute my feedback to the numerous reviews that already state exactly how I feel. Please bring back the old format or the option to download the previous version on the App Store. I literally HATE this update! I am no longer excited to look at TimeHop. Every photo is automatically zoomed in so many photos do not look good because they are not all rectangle (in fact, most of them are all squares because of Instagram). It is extremely annoying and inefficient to have to hold down to zoom out just to see the photo. I can't see the number of likes or comments, which made some of the memories more memorable (i.e., most liked post of a certain month). The fact I have to click through like SnapChat is also extremely annoying and inefficient. The scroll-down setup of the previous TimeHop was much better and user friendly. To have to scroll up to share a post is stupid. The button to share should already be there under the photo like the previous setup. I appreciate the effort to update TimeHop to try to keep up with trends, but TimeHop needs to stick to its own identity. What wasn't broken shouldn't have been fixed. Once again, please give us the option to download the old version. I loved looking at TimeHop everyday, and now I hate it."
1815,reidnrae,"February 7, 2017",1,"Old version better- listen to your users We've been through a few minor fixes since the major update to this app a few months ago. I've been dealing with issues I don't like- and 'timehopping' less frequently because of it.  But I truly believed they would get it together and fix what they broke in that update- especially since they were so willing to 'fix' it before when it wasn't broken. However, I was fed up enough to come and write a review because, hey, maybe they aren't aware of just how terrible this update has made the formerly funderful (fun/wonderful) experience. Then I began reading reviews and it became apparent- the developers are not interested in losing users, or at least, not interested in listening to the feedback of the many people who have voiced the same displeasure I have.

I've been using the service since it was first named 4SquareAndSevenYearsAgo and it is my go-to app for journaling and documenting each day. Since they have expanded the app to include everything from Twitter posts, to Instagram, to every single photo on my computer, the robustness of the app can't be overstated. "
1821,Chelsea D. - PA,"November 26, 2014",3,Buggy I've been using TimeHop for nearly two years and have loved the nostalgic aspect of the app! I feel that I am experiencing far more bugs now than I ever did. 
1822,Shutterbugorama,"September 27, 2015",2,"App needs to be updated My only ""complaint"" used to be that it couldn't reach back and magically help me remember things from before digital photography! I LOVED this app!! Time Hop was (and sometimes still is) great for helping me notice how much my children are growing and changing each year, remembering  important events from the past... However, I must say, ever since the new update of iOS the Time Hop app is not working very well anymore. It almost always says ""looks like someone's trying to get a job in politics, this photo has been deleted"" that was funny at first but now it's making me sad because I know I didn't delete any photos. App developers, could y'all please fix this? I honestly miss seeing the awesome little photos and videos from years  in the past. Additionally, when I have tried to share recently from Time Hop to Facebook the thumbnail on Facebook doesn't look right at all. It isn't even my photo or video clip -- it's a portion of the Time Hop logo which is not even correctly fitting into the size of the photo Square determined by Facebook. In other words, Time Hop needs its app developers to get busy and fix it again because this was (and still could be) the best app ever. Right now though it's a bit frustrating."
1823,Kellydepalma,"December 24, 2016",2,"Please fix the update I've had timehop for a very long time and always enjoyed using it. I get that you need to get used to updates, and as humans it's in our nature to get upset when something changes. I'm sure the developers were trying to give people what they want/are used to by making this more like a snapchat story type layout, but this update has some really confusing components that I can't understand. The fact that every picture is zoomed in by default seems really crazy. Who would want to see only part of your picture? The ability to zoom if necessary is a nice feature, but having it automatic doesn't seem sensible. Second, you can no longer see the captions or comments on Facebook and Instagram photos. This takes the memories and chops them in half, in my opinion. Doesn't always do me much good to look at a pic from 8 years ago with no context. Last, the flip through style doesn't work for this app in my opinion. The whole fun of this app is seeing the progression of years past and this new update takes that factor away and instead isolates each memory. It seems like a lot of the update components are not popular with users. Hopefully developers will listen and keep some of the new and bring back some of the old!"
1824,tlvman,"December 26, 2016",1,"New update a no go This is perhaps the most ill-conceived update of an app I've seen in almost 9 years of using an iPhone. Tap and hold to zoom out? That's backwards and ridiculously unintuitive. And why would we need to tap left and right to go forward and back when you can also swipe left and right? Essentially it saves you a .2 second animation. This update is heavily influenced by Snapchat, so it makes it much more difficult to see any images that are not taken vertically. Pictures taken in landscape, screenshots, etc, are so zoomed in, you can't see them unless tap and hold, and once you let go, you lose the big picture. The old version had it right. Scroll up through the years, like a proper photo app. The update information says that some of the best features will be back in 2017 (I asssume being able to see comments, so that there's some context for things you dont remember), but why get rid of features just to roll out an update that clearly didn't give any thought to user experience? I don't understand why they changed something that worked. Timehop is not Instagram or Snapchat. This identity crisis is likely going to lose a lot of people, so I hope they revert. I'm one update way from adding a new Facebook memory: ""On this Day, you deleted Timehop."""
1825,KEMM09,"December 30, 2016",1,"New Update is Awful I don't normally write reviews just because of an update I don't love. I get that it takes time to adjust to new features and things, but I don't think I'll be adjusting to this new TimeHop. Nothing about the new update is user friendly or conducive to the way that most people used the app previously. I don't understand why the default for pictures is to be zoomed in. Why would I want to see just someone's eyebrow or just a portion of whatever the picture is?  I miss being able to do side by side Now/Then pictures. I have two little boys who are exactly 3 years apart and one of my favorite things about Timehop was being able to compare the two of them at the same ages. I can no longer do that. Also, it's no longer possible to view an entire album from Facebook or to read the comments that went along with pictures.  If I posted an album of 60 pictures 5 years ago, why would I only want to see 3 of them now? And then not even have the ability to go look at the rest.  All in all, this update has been so frustrating for me that I am considering deleting the app altogether and just sticking with my Facebook reviews. I just keep hoping that one morning I'll open TH and all the issues will be fixed.  If that doesn't change soon then you've lost a user."
1826,The_BOL,"January 4, 2017",1,"Good app but terrible update I have literally never written a review for an app before, but this new update is so bad it deserves one. Timehop used to be one of my favorite apps to use;  it lets me go through all of my past memories and relive them each day. It was a great idea that I really enjoyed until timehop came out with it's new update, which I honestly hate so much I can't stand it. Now all of your photos are automatically zoomed in so you can't even see the whole thing. Why would you want to see only part of a picture? And now on your posts, you can't see the likes or comments, which I think takes away a lot of the excitement at seeing your old memories. Scrolling through the app used to be easy and didn't take up as much time, but now I have to sit and click through each post individually. This makes the memories not seem as interesting since they're so separated. I know timehop is trying to be similar to popular apps like Snapchat, but the old version was extremely better visually and easier to use. With the new format I'm not ever excited to look at my old memories. I really hope timehop can listen to my and others' opinions and change the app back to its older format. It's a great app, but right now I just don't like using it."
1827,joeuph,"January 6, 2017",1,"Didn't fix it, now I'm deleting it! I already wrote a 1-Star review for the last update, and I see that you have not truly followed the feelings of your users. So now I am deleting this app and my Timehop account. Why? It is still almost impossible to access the settings. I don't know how to do it, so I just try swiping in random places and hope I get lucky. It's tedious, annoying, inconvenient, and everything else a serious app shouldn't be. There is still no way to easily refresh the app, like there was before the first disastrous update. This means that I have to exit and force-quit the app every time I adjust a setting, to see if the change was accepted. No app should have to rely on users force-quitting it to adjust a setting. Lastly, despite changing the ""connect"" settings for the Camera Roll multiple times, the app is still pulling pictures from my Camera Roll. There are pictures there I don't want to see or are superfluous, there's a reason I didn't post them in my other social media apps. This clutters up the timeline and diminishes the fun, not to mention the fact that your settings options don't even work! That's enough for me, I'm out. After nearly 4 years of using your app, I am extremely disappointed. Fix your problems or your app will continue to receive negative responses and less downloads!"
1828,thecat2016,"January 16, 2017",1,"Why haven't you gone back to the original version yet??? If I could give you 0 stars, I absolutely would. Just like EVERYONE ELSE has already said, why fix what wasn't broken?! I'm sure we can all agree that the old format was the best and was perfectly fine the way it was before you tried to make it all modern. This isn't Snapchat and we don't want it to be. If you want to have this version then fine, but PLEASE make an option to go back to the original version of this app. The photo frames, horrible zoom on photos, and click-through features are the worst. The scroll down method was so much simpler. I used to wake up and look forward to checking my timehop, but now I can't stand how this app works. All of the features we fell in love with are gone. We can't do ""then & now"" transformations anymore, save all photos (or even fully view all photos for that matter), or go to the original post in the app it's from. I really hope you actually read and take note of these reviews like you've been saying because so far it seems like you haven't fixed any of the problems we ALL feel need to change. I rarely write reviews, and I've already left a poor review with all of my concerns weeks ago, but yet I still have all the same issues with this app. I just wish I never would have updated it."
1829,JillReffett,"January 31, 2017",1,"1 now, 5 before update So, did you seriously just bring back the little frames that we can't get to the pictures to share??? Whyyyyyy??? You had them, they sucked, they were taken down, now they are back. Thank you from blocking me from memories of, first, Christmas, and now my daughter's birthday. What in hades are you thinking?? Does anyone know of a better app for memories. I'm over this. The whole point was for you to mine my photos from history do i can peruse and share, etc, if I like. Pretty simple. If you aren't going to perform your function, I'll mine through my own stuff, and cut out the middle man who isn't do what he committed to do... "
1830,mconk,"February 19, 2013",5,"Great App, Amazing Service! I've been using this app since it was first released and have been a Timehop subscriber via email since their early days. Before the app, you'd simply get daily email notifications. With the app, you still can opt to receive emails (which is VERY useful if you forget to check a day on the app or ever want to revisit a day - simply setup a filter in your email to send all 'Timehop' emails to a separate folder.) The ONLY feature I would love to see implemented is allowing you to re-visit a specific day, or even a specific date range in history. That's the only current limitation with the app. As I said above, you can still save your Timehop emails, so it's not a huge issue, but would just be a nice feature. I emailed this suggestion to Timehop and received a response in under 24 hours, to which they agreed and mentioned the engineers were working on a way to implement such a feature. Great service, great support as overall a great company! I've suggested Timehop to everyone I know!"
1831,TonyRush.com,"December 23, 2016",3,"DO NOT UPDATE This is a really great app that I look forward to checking everyday. However, the most recent update enlarges all of your memories, which is nice but can also be very frustrating. The app allows you to swipe left and right through your memories, which is convenient, however, if you tap on the picture it also will skip to the next photo or status update. Although this is a minor inconvenience it is not the most agitating feature of the recent update. VIDEOS CAN NOT BE SHARED. No matter how I try I am not allowed to share a video of friends or family with anyone. The app does not even provide the option to share on videos. This is most frustrating seeing as which I am a college student trying to share good memories with distant family members around this holiday season. "
1832,zootmajor,"December 25, 2016",1,"Miserable New Update Timehop, are you kidding me? Have you seen this new update you've released? Please roll back and re-design the overall layout and intention. The new update has removed and distorted so many great features in the place of zoomed/cropped photos and clunky swipe movements. You've taken away comments and likes, removed dates and created overall confusion. Did you get bought out by Snapchat, because no one was forcing you to have a story like layout and it's only created a very poor experience for the users. Timehop was something I liked to incorporate every morning waking up, making me want to post bigger and better pictures than then the years before, to be able to reflect on my years and see just how far I've come and all the memories I might've forgotten. But now its frustrating, absent and unusable. Please fix these updates. If anything attempt to merge with the old layout with new ideas and not take away from what was initially setup to do; which is present our previous memories in a fun and lighthearted way. Please fix, obviously users are not happy and at the end of the day that is solely who it's for. The idea is to build on top of ideas, not throw it in the microwave and nuke the heck out of it."
1833,Tmh6586,"December 27, 2016",1,Terrible update I get it. You have to do updates to stay current. However it feels like after this was designed not a single person tested it before it was released. Such a bad move for Timehop. The stupid zoomed in pictures are one thing but VIDEOS TOO?!?!?! When you want to watch an old video you have to hold your thumb on the screen to see the whole video. Kind of defeats the purpose if your thumb is likely in the way to be able to even watch it. Also there are no captions on any photos or videos. No idea what I said about a picture. Can't see what anyone commented. The app is listed at 4 stars for all updates and was probably much higher before this update. It is now listed as a 1 star app. The people have spoken timehop it's time for you to adjust. Make it user friendly again or else be prepared for a lot of people to delete the app which will eliminate all of your sponsor $$ coming in because no one will pay for an add on an app that no one uses. You better fix it quick because facebook already has memories and if Instagram creates a function like that before you fix this app  timehop is toast because people will go into two user friendly apps to see historical posts versus one non user friendly app.
1834,Jfhehd,"December 27, 2016",1,"You're an App solely about the past- stop trying to look like the future. Like many here I'm not one to review unless something really strikes me good or bad. I have always loved Timehop and seeing where I was a year, two years, even seven years ago on that specific day (I realized a few weeks ago I was wearing the same shirt and pants I wore exactly a year before, which I found amusing and wouldn't have known if not for Timehop) but man this update just kills any desire to open the app. Considering how a good portion of photos being shown are from Instagram, the fact that every photo is zoomed to fit the iPhone screen drives me out of my mind. Seeing as how Snapchat is literally the only thing that takes photos the full size of the iPhone screen (even the iPhone camera doesn't do that) and adding on that Snapchat doesn't save photos, so no previous snaps are going to show up on Timehop.. it really makes zero sense. This along with basically every new feature added really make this update a waste. Hoping they either go back to the old format or someone steals their thunder and creates a new Timehop style app that doesn't try to be ""hip"" and stylized for what is currently popular. This is an app solely about the past, stop trying to look like the future."
1835,KQuinlan,"December 27, 2016",1,"No longer worth having Before the big update, I really enjoyed scrolling through old memories and sharing things that were especially funny, cute, sweet, etc. I'm not opposed to updates and making things better, but there's not one thing that is better about this update. I hardly even use it anymore. Several times photos have shown nothing because of the auto-zoom in the new update. Not once have I liked the collage it puts together. It doesn't choose the best pictures, places the photos too far apart, and makes the photos too small to really even see (and offers no zoom for those photos!). Sometimes it will show a Facebook update but leave off the picture or other attachment that went with the update, so that the update no longer makes sense. Not all updates and photos are included anymore. The Facebook memories has offered better ability to see more. I'm not sure what algorithm Timehop uses for choosing what to show, but it's rarely what I would have chosen to see/share when compared with what shows up on Facebook. "

1837,acey l,"January 3, 2017",1,"Like everyone else has already said...bring back the old timehop! First review ever written because the ""new"" timehop is just that bad. Absolutely hate having to click through everything, hate not being able to see captions (which are often just as, if not more, important than the pics themselves), hate the full screen default of pics, hate not being able to scroll up and down and screen shot if I'd like to...I just hate it all. Please, listen to your customers and change it back. You can incorporate aspects of the ""New"" timehop (ability to make pics full screen etc) without changing the foundation of the app. I understand the desire and need to keep innovating and changing things, but quite frankly, this one just didn't pan out. I hope your developers take this as a lesson learned, and appreciate that we are all big fans of the app and love what you've done so far before this. We want to keep using the app; please let us do so with the traditional timehop layout."
1838,Clara M.,"March 11, 2017",1,"Scrolling was so much better--and now sharing is super buggy NEW REVIEW: I keep hoping one of these updates will make the difference, but ugh. Even the ads this change was obviously made to encourage and accommodate are ugly--and way too numerous. It feels like half my flipping time (which is already longer than scrolling was) is spent flipping past ads. If they made a version that cost a couple bucks that gave us the scrolling format and no ads, I would be happy to pay it. I like the trip down memory lane but the interface is just so bad now. "
1839,Netsie1,"April 7, 2017",1,Crappy update and App!! 0 Stars! Well..... updated again!!  Trash!! Your description in your update is inaccurate!!  Still crappy!!  STILL slow! STILL crashes!!! Still FULL of bugs!!  Still can't share a photo. It crashes EVERY time!  Had to restart my phone after trying to share a photo!  About to delete app. It does no good because I can't share a photo!  So frustrating that you people DON'T listen to longtime users!!
1840,Mcdonaldh05,"November 2, 2015",1,"I used to love timehop. The new version is awful. I used to love timehop, and apparently a lot of other people did too. If you look reviews of all versions, versus the current version, it's a complete meltdown of timehop - it used to be mostly 5s and is now mostly 1s. I'm not sure what happened with the newest version, but it is useless. One of the reasons why I loved timehop was its ability to be able to share my old pictures, and I would do that almost daily on Facebook. With the inability to share ""shared pictures"", the app doesn't do me much good. It also doesn't seem to be syncing the pictures well. I'm not sure why they changed it, but it's awful. And who are the pictures being shared with? It's pointless to comment on my own pictures within the app, because no one sees them. And Instagram already has the market on that, so I don't need another social media account to do the same. Also, I don't know why there is now square cropping. It completely ruins my pictures - it cuts off heads, cuts off limbs. While I'm sure timehop doesn't care about me as one person, hopefully if enough people complain, they will change it back. Otherwise, I think a lot of people will be deleting the app."
1841,JJK41,"December 12, 2015",4,"Great App! I've been using this app since the beginning, originally giving it only two stars because I had issues with it almost every time I opened the app. But that was a while ago now, and the app has been improved tremendously! It's one of my favorite apps, and I look forward to traveling down memory lane everyday."
1842,Jennyjoy88,"December 26, 2016",1,"New Update is Miserable I never write reviews for apps. Ever. But the most recent update has rendered Timehop extremely frustrating and removed many of the best parts of the original app. Many people have been commenting on the inability to view likes and comments on old posts (which *is* upsetting), or the new ""swipe"" format (which is hella annoying), but the thing that I'm finding the most aggravating is the way in which you can no longer view the captions for any Instagram posts you've made. Often that is just as important as the picture itself, and now it's been divorced from the image. Plus, they haven't maintained the square composition of Instagram posts; instead, they have weirdly blown them up to fill the screen, which means that parts of the image on the sides are being cut off. (You can see the full image if you swipe down or something, where you would share the image from, but honestly, who has time for that?) "
1843,Lily & Noah,"January 5, 2017",1,"A step backwards in TIME, I'm afraid I've been on the photo-app launch side of things, and I am sure so much work went into this update to the new version.... so for that know you are recognized for your hard work. I also know what it is like to receive negative feedback , so you are not alone there :) "
1844,P.J. Young,"January 16, 2017",1,"Still not fixed. The issues I was having still are not fixed, if anything the performance is worse. The majority of my time hop didn't even load today. There were about 30 pictures from my iCloud Photo Library that wouldn't load, just grey pages and infinite loading wheels, and it is not an issue with my connection. I still despise the UI, it's miserable and trying too hard and doesn't provide a pleasant user experience. I was hoping that after receiving so much negative feedback, you would jump at the opportunity to give us the changes that we want (revert to the previous layout), but it seems as though you are stubborn and sticking with this Snapchatish nightmare. I guess that means I'm deleting the app now. After years of using it, loving it, and recommending it to everyone I know, it's no longer fun or interesting to use. I shouldn't have to feel like I'm doing charity by continuing to use it even though it really annoys me, just because I wanted to keep supporting your studio. You have demonstrated that you care more about the whims of whatever insane designer or producer came up with this horrible UI rather than the feedback of your loyal users. Good luck with that!"
1845,jll37gulc,"January 19, 2017",1,"Ruined a great app Timehop was a daily must-check for me, but their most recent updates have ruined it. I loved scrolling down my feed, seeing the pictures and videos and text updates from this day in past years, clicking through to any I wanted to look closely at and/or share. Now, instead, you are forced to view your history one item at a time (occasionally in groups of three that you don't appear to be able to share or review individually). I loved this app particularly because I have young kids and it's fun to skim through dozens of pictures of them 1-2-3 years ago and pick out a few gems. But now I can only see them if I click one at a time through at times 30+ pictures from a given day, the overwhelming majority of which I don't want to see. I'll give timehop a few weeks to fix this, but if they don't revert to the original or at least restore the old functionality, I'm deleting my account and relying on similar features that are now done better by google and Facebook."
1846,Case713923,"January 24, 2017",1,"Video Sharing I would like to share my videos exactly as I am able to share my pictures. My fianc√© now is not the father of my elementary school child, and I have always shared my timehop videos of her as a newborn and a toddler with him by simply clicking share and he would get a link to view in a text. It's allowed him to get to know the life my child and I had before he entered our life and we love that. Now, I don't have the ability to share the videos to him, and so I have to wait until we're together to physically show him and in most cases he never gets to see, because life is busy after work and school. Please enable video sharing again. No sense in having a timehop account if I have to sift through years of facebook updates ANYWAY to find the content I want to share. "
1847,ShellyMom616,"February 5, 2017",1,"Loved the concept, not the newer versions I loved Time Hop when it first came out. I'm not liking the newer versions. Some of my pictures are full screen size so forcing me to crop into a square on some of the pictures cuts it off, and not sharing the original captions like in the earlier versions is annoying. The custom frame and captions are cool but takes up a big portion of the picture too. How about we have options to crop or leave the original picture intact to share, the only way I can do that now is to take a screen shot."
1848,Brittini Sisneroz,"February 7, 2017",1,"Your update literally ruined my day. I woke this morning feeling very fed up with the ""updates"".. or I guess I should say 'downgrades' Timehop has made the past few months. I had my coffee, & gazed out into the distance with so many questions... why? Why won't you just got back to the original format? Why are you trying to whitewash Timehop into exactly what other platforms look like? Do you know how tedious it is to flip through things 17 year old me said one by one? How many emo lyrics can one person stand? "
1849,A2zWhit,"February 21, 2017",5,"Please fix soon! Please just go back to the way things were. Get rid of the swiping to see photos. It is torture. All of my friends have commented on how Timehop is garbage now. You are fixing and updating the things no one cares about. I'm constantly going to the App Store in hopes there is finally an update that gets rid of all the changes you've made, and Timehop is once again fun and functional. I understand this may take time, but it feels like your company is blatantly ignoring the users. How can you ignore such low ratings and scathing reviews? Sometimes companies make mistakes that thing you spent a lot of money on and thought would be amazing just isn't. Admit when you are wrong. Stop trying to claim your beta testers have come to ""love"" the changes. Take the time to contact some of the people leaving reviews here and on Facebook, and REALLY listen to what they are saying. If I could give zero stars I would."
1850,Middy45,"July 17, 2013",3,"Good idea but needs work It's fun to look back at the things you posted over the years, however there are a few flaws with this app. One, I've had a problem with some pictures not loading, either there's just the little spinning wheel or it's just all white (even when I have full signal and wi-fi). Two, it doesn't show all of my tweets. I have a twitter archive and looked at this day four years ago just to check and saw I tweeted a lot but only one tweet showed up on my timehop, even after I imported my twitter archive like they said to. Another thing, it says that out of my 500 Facebook friends, only three of them have this app and therefore I can only connect and share with those three people. However since downloading the app I have had other friends download it too so I can connect with them, but they don't show up on timehop as having the app. So basically it seems like it doesn't ever refresh your friends list.

1851,A_M_Y C,"February 19, 2015",5,"Happy Time Travler I love this app. It's so much fun to relive moments of my life. I have found on occasion something I totally forgot I ever posted and in that discovery it never fails to make me laugh. Another reason it's great is Im a first time mother & my little boy just turned one. Seeing pictures of him as a tiny baby brings back great memories and even seeing farther back in my life is a happy adventure too. This is one of the best apps I have ever had and I love that each day is a chance to be reminded of special and or funny moment in my life. It's exciting to get on each morning and relive good times in my life! If I were to suggest anything for this app it would be to have the feature to ""select time travel"" which would enable a user to type in a date of their choosing and see what was posted that day in their history. Otherwise I have no complaints! Thanks for giving me my own time machine!!"

While I tend to research apps by reading user reviews, I have never before actually written one as I have yet to come across one that is just THAT good that I had to sing its praises!  That day has come!  This is my favorite app EVER and I use it daily!  It's so awesome that it pulls photos from everywhere including my laptop!  It is so much fun to see blasts from the past, particularly of my kids - long forgotten special moments are truly a treat! It's like a little surprise waiting for me everyday!  The app itself is well designed, easy to use and very stable.  Just as an FYI...initially I was annoyed because photos got cut off inside the Timehop frame it puts around your photo - however, in short order I realized you can reduce or enlarge the size if the photo (by pinching the screen) and/or move it around so the frame fits around everything you want it to in the photo itself.  Enjoy!!!"
1853,Rwrich30,"January 13, 2016",2,"Creepy, borderline stalker, losing interest For starters, the ""Facehop"" feature gives an error when you try to save or post to Facebook, loads a blank page to Instagram as well as Twitter. The new tagging feature not only cuts off the photos now but it is creepy. There are people that have walked out of my life that is tagged in some of my photos and it's weird and kinda uncomfortable when it shows they have seen it. It brings back a lot of hurt as well and there is no option to disable this feature!!!!!!!!!  I miss the old version of Timehop back when it was fun to open and see memories, taking me back to great times. It was nostalgic and it's now like a bad horror movie with stalkers and I am one of those stalkers against my own will or choice! Just like many others, I am on the border of removing the app out of frustration. I also looked forward to the ""In history on this day"" part of the app. Now it's like a placeholder for laziness and nothing worth reading or looking at. "

I don't know if I'll ever find out, because timehop isn't even showing you all of your posts anymore! Everything I loved about this app has been taken away and replaced with features that made me quit previous social media in the past. I would spend more time in the mornings going back in time reading my silly banter with my silly friends. I would giggle again at the ridiculous hashtag I came up with that no one has ever used. I would reflect on the friendships I have had over the years and think about the journey they have been on since. Now I click my way through, wondering why I even uploaded this and what kinds of conversations were held through the comments. I would delete the app if only Facebook would give me access to On This Day. But alas, I suppose I will suffer through in hopes they listen to their users and replace those features we all loved. Hope they're listening!!!!"

It has really captured my growth as an adult from 10 years ago when I was raucous and crazy through now, when I'm amazed by how much my two year old son has changed over time. In this new update you made things confusing, took away my ability to see progressions of time at a glance, removed the Now/Then feature (which I used frequently  and find unforgivable at Christmastime, when it's a natural feature to use), made sharing in general more difficult, removed captions and comments (and therein context) from memories, and require me to glimpse at ""slideshows"" instead of albums while tapping and holding to zoom out on any picture I want to see more of."

I honestly cannot say anything good about the update. And I'm sure everybody has expressed their utter disdain with all aspects of the new update, so I will not reiterate anything besides the fact that it is simply just awful now. And actually, timehop took a dive when it updated before this one and made it way more difficult and uglier when it came to viewing who liked and commented on your past posts. Seriously I cannot even stand to look at my timehop anymore which is an absolute shame because of how dedicated I was to view it every day. "

Now (seven years later, when I have no interest in those subjects) I'm supposed to tap and scroll through Each. And. Every. Comment. It's just not fun anymore. I want to be able to see my old tweets, but not have to exhaust so much energy just to get through them. The old format was much more user friendly.

1860,Megan Ann Van Dam,"December 24, 2016",1,"Two thumbs down on the new update I've been checking Timehop every single day for almost a year now, and I have loved it so much! My favorite thing about it is being able to see how many likes and comments a post received and then being able to go in and view the likers and read the comments again. This most recent update, however, doesn't allow me to see any of this information. And it also makes each picture huge and puts each post in a big colored font that was not used the first time around. I'd much rather see things the way they were the first time, and I'd rather not have to tap through multiple full screens to read/view a multi-picture post. Please fix these issues with the update, or I'm just going to delete the app and save myself the daily frustration. I'm sure you had a team working really hard to dream up these new formatting ideas, but they overshadow the actual memories (which is why we all come to the app in the first place) and provide significantly less information about each post than the pre-update version of the app."

I can't see any text at all and the pictures look awful being blown up automatically. Sad. Please don't ruin a good thing. Simple is better. I want to be able to read what was going on - like going back and reading old journal entries. That's what made this fun. I'm disappointed enough that I might delete the app. Please fix it!!!

So since Timehop has already ticked me off so much today and I don't have time I'll just say that everything users say about Timehop's update is on point. The stress factor, the way all photos are zoomed in (what the actual F?), the way you have to go through each memory individually... I could go on and on. Also, the colored bars around old quotes is so blinding, no one will ever read them. So goodbye to old lyrics, movie quotes and book passages that mean so much to me... I can't post them again because attempting to read reverse text is so offensive. Additionally the privacy issue is horrendous. I have a different Facebook name than Instagram and Twitter for privacy reasons. Timehop chooses my Facebook name by default with no option to change it. Of course this means I can never post Timehops to any other platform again because my private Facebook name will be plastered across the bottom in huge letters. This is an abomination.

What I really hate about it is that there is no way to see comments that were written on past Facebook pictures or Instagram pictures.

My streak was reset & I have not missed a single day since July! I did love this app, but I am having all of the issues that others have mentioned in their reviews. "
1867,joellawesome,"January 19, 2017",1,"Needs a lot of improvement My timehop has not loaded for 3 full days and I was on a 275 streak. I've been using Timehop for over 3 years now. It never gave me any issues until this most recent update. In the previous versions we would swipe down and be able to read all of the comments and see who like the posts. Only recently in the newest update was it optimized to view the comments and likes. So for about 2 weeks you could not even view the comments. This type of interface is better for apps like Snapchat. Can you imagine how annoying it would be that you had to tap to view everyone's posts on Facebook and tweets on twitter?  Scrolling allows us to see all of our post without having to swipe back and forth. This application has one star for a reason. All of the users hate the newest version. The developers of timehop have failed to notice that people have stopped using the app altogether because of your ""updates."" Listen to your users and change things back to the way they were. Don't fix what's not broken."
1868,Em7777777,"January 31, 2017",1,"Disappointed in last major update I waited awhile before writing a review to see if this last major update would grow on me, but it hasn't. It is awkward to scroll through your photos. It's impossible to see the entire photo or video without a huge amount of it being cropped unless you go to share it, which is frustrating. Even more frustrating, it is difficult to share photos unless you use one of their top four sharing platforms. Sometimes I want to share via something else besides facebook or instagram or iMessage and I can't, it just acts like it didn't even recognize that I chose another app. This used to work! Even local save takes way too long to process. It has also seemingly clipped similar photos together and made a ""video"" of them but then doesn't offer the individual photos so I can save just the one I want, I don't understand why someone would think I would want a choppy video of four photos thrown together. Please fix this app, revert back to what it was like prior to this major change. I used to love it, now it is painful."

I wish there were more options tho, some of us that are using this app are not teenagers and I can't stand all the ""yolo"" and other silly caption options.

My biggest complaint is that recently, when I repost an old picture, it posts very differently than what is shown in the app, moving the center of the picture over significantly to the left, which causes the people on the right of the photo to be cut off. There is no option to shift or zoom the photo in the Timehop frame on the framing page to correct this. "
1873,serickjr,"December 29, 2016",1,"WORST BIG NEW UPDATE EVER! This new ""Big Surprises"" update is awful at best. The previous format was much better, why not improve on that?! There's no more Then & Now that I can find and more clicking into a photo to read the comments of when it was posted on Facebook. You gave us no options to do anything except he zoom (big deal) and to share (again big deal) why take away the interactive part of it and just leave us with bigger photos to look at... big deal! I've always been big on supporting the originator of an idea and have refused to use Facebook memories because of that, they weren't the original, you were so I've always supported you and strictly used Timehop to share past memories, but with this new update I just don't think I can do that anymore. You've forced me to use the Facebook Memories knock off! Sorry, but not sorry! Bring back some of the original features that were great and I might consider using it again, but until then you've lost a loyal, daily user from the beginning!"
1874,Luna follower,"December 31, 2016",1,"Fix the update!! I have never written a review of any app, however the horrible changes need to be addressed. I have loved Timehop but this new update has completely taken the fun out of this. The new layout is okay, but it would make more sense to see all the photos from one year instead of having every single photo separate but accessed the same way. The zoom feature is just dumb. Photos are not always centered, so to make an automatic zoom regardless of where the subject of the photo is I'd just annoying. Literally every photo needs to be zoomed out to see the full picture. Also, where are the Social media comments!? This feature was so cool to see who said what years ago. Why would you take that away?I also don't understand the cluster photos. Today, I have three photos that I took at the same time. In this case there is no zoom feature, so I can't see the photos! Why would you do that! You literally can't see the photos up close. In short this is a very disappointing update to a cool and useful app."

But I just can't! And I know there are thousands of other people who feel the same way, and have also written their first review here... so I figured to join them. It can't hurt to have another person commenting here, because maybe the more people that give Timehop a 1Star rating, the more pressure they will feel to change it back! Everything about my Daily Timehop experience feels inconvenient and frustrating! It used to make me feel reminiscent and happy when I read about my past. However, now it's just another app trying to change their ways into Snapchat. I don't want my Instagram to have ""stories"" like snapchat... why would I want my time hop to become exactly like snapchat? It was much more useable and enjoyable before! I don't want to start my day out using something I hate... I hope they change it back soon, because I might just have to delete my Timehop if they don't."

Anyways, using timehop after the update has become confusing and frustrating. My pictures are too large , some of the pictures are put into frames and I can't even view them or save them as I was able to before. I'm constantly tapping lol like just tapping and one wrong tap could send me in the wrong direction. Simply put I really enjoy timehop but I would prefer it to be like it was OR make the new update easier to use. I loved Timehop because it was fun and easy to use.

1880,Jrmllns,"November 4, 2016",4,Temperature I really love this app because it lets me see the stuff from the past that I had forgotten about. I like being able to look back and compare pictures of my children from then and now specially pictures that I thought that I had lost that accidentally got deleted off of my phone. The only thing that I wish that they would've kept is where you could share a post and it look like it was written on notebook paper and where it said what the temperature was on that day so many years ago. Especially since I live in Alabama and today it is November and it's 85¬∞ knowing that it should be about 60 are in the high 50s it kind of helps you see how the weather is changing I wish they would bring back the temperature as well. But overall it's a very good app and I love it I'm so glad they worked out all the bags.
1881,nintendokid7300,"December 23, 2016",1,"Unfortunate Update As someone who used Timehop every day and looks forward to it, I was so disappointed by the newest update. The full screen photos and tap-to-continue feature are decent for tweets, but all photos look blurry unless you hold down (and continue holding down) the screen. An update that I assume was for convenience only made the app harder to use. You also cannot see what you captioned a photo as - there are no words alongside the photos. You also cannot see more than one post as once, as opposed to the old scrolling format, where you could often see three or four posts at once, sometimes even simultaneously across years if you posted sparingly that day. This ability to see many posts in one screenshot has been removed by this update. I think a top-to-bottom scrolling format is way more productive, and if some one would like to go into a full screen mode then that should be an option; however, full screen mode should not be something everyone has to use."
1882,SRart1234,"December 29, 2016",1,"Not well thought out at all Like others, I've never written an app review either, but I feel that this update is lacking in so many ways. First, the photos filling the screen despite their original proportions is annoying and requires extra steps that shouldn't be necessary. Second, where are the photos original captions? If they are there somewhere, I can't figure out how to see them. Third, there's no obvious visual break from year to year. This is just a poor choice in design. Forth, why was the original social media platform removed from the photos? I also don't like that the day of the week and even the weather temps have been removed. While not a huge component to the original app, it was a nice extra feature located in a good spot. And last, but certainly not least, why have all the fun graphics been taken away? I understand that change is necessary and we all have to get use to it, but this update doesn't seem like it was well thought out before launching."
1883,APOPxxG0D,"December 30, 2016",2,"Why? I love Timehop, it has been such a pleasant part of my day especially when I was having a bad one.  I could open the app and see my past memories - photos that made me smile, old FB postings that would either make me laugh or think what the heck was that about.  Most importantly, it helped me see how much I have grown as a person in the way I communicated via social media.  I think this new ""version"" is maybe supposed to represent a book perhaps....  it's not he worst thing ever but some of the photos it will scroll over quickly (I hope you understand what I mean, because I'm not certain how to say it) and how do I ""share"" those memories.  Maybe there is a way and I haven't figured it out yet but in all honesty I think the old way was better.  Just my opinion.  I'll keep the app because I still enjoy seeing past memories but maybe the creators would consider finding a solution to some of the issues mentioned throughout others reviews...."

Because of that, I've decided to up my review to 2 stars. However, they've still yet to address the main issue here. The new ""Snapchat"" like format is almost universally hated by users. We've been extremely vocal in reviews for the past 2 months about this. Yet, they've shown zero interest in listening. This app has gone down from a 5 star app, to a 1 or 2 star app. Obviously from the recent reviews, I'm not the only one who thinks that."

This app was honestly one of my favorite apps, but now it's practically unusable thanks to its usability and horrid appearance. The Eggner it and smog developers of this app have completely ignored their user base and have sacrificed something that used to be good to be ""advertising friendly"". They have all but stopped listening to any piece of criticism whatsoever. For some unexplainable reason I have not stopped using this app yet... perhaps in hopes that it will get better, but it's been months now and they're not going back to the way used to be. This app also has had many of bugs since this complete overhaul and they are very slow to fix any of its glaring issues. I tried keeping the streak going but one of the recent update has completely broken mine and I tried contacting them on three separate occasions and they still have not gotten back to me. Don't bother with Timehop."
1889,JainaMichelle96,"July 31, 2017",1,"Copy-cat attempt is garbage I don't write reviews often at all but this deserves it. The new update is absolute garbage and very obviously copied from Snapchat. The success of snapchats tap to scroll through images is unique and isn't easily transferred to another platform. I miss being able to scroll through my memories like a Facebook feed and see my photos not cropped terribly and arranged in weird collages that make no sense and don't show what the picture is actually of. I liked Timehops last update, it was sleek and easy to use, and wasn't confusing or frustrating to look at. This one is difficult to go back to a memory once you have already passed it as you have to tap and tap and tap until you get to it, versus scrolling a little bit. The only reason I continue to use Timehop after this idiotic update, is to keep my streak going. If that streak feature had been taken away, you can rest assured I would not be using timehop anymore. Why fix what was never broken?"
1890,PietteA17,"February 11, 2015",5,"Love this! I look forward to checking this app everyday. Some days, depending on the pictures it shows, I visit the app multiple times a day to see those smiles again or laugh about the funny status again. As a parent there is nothing better than seeing an old pic of the kids from 6 years ago pop up. Brings an immediate smile, reminds me of that great reason the photo was taken, and really makes my entire day brighter. Some of the pictures I had forgotten about. It provides a great trip down memory lane:) "
1891,Brenda Puccetti,"September 7, 2015",5,"Great for reminiscing, love this App! My only problem as far as functionality is I have noted at times videos won't load, and when they do I can't tag people on Facebook, I have to post, leave the post and return to edit so I can then tag people. "
1892,Mairella,"August 4, 2016",3,"Still a little buggy I love this app. As a mom of a small child it's fun to see what we did last year or the past couple of years. My friend always has her Google ""hangout"" conversation come up on her time hop but I never get mine even though I have it set to look back at those. When I open videos to watch on the full screen, they never load and seem to be buffering but never fully load, so I always end up going back to the main page and watch it and click the volume icon to hear what is going on. The ""story of the day"" option that comes up with preset pictures should be allowed to edit and choose from a couple of pictures because sometimes those aren't the best! But other than that it's a great and fun app to look at memories. Thank you for fixing the option of clicking on the picture to be able to see the full pic."
1893,Shilex1,"December 24, 2016",1,"'Member when Timehop was useful? I don't usually review apps, but when I do it's either because they've done something really right, or really wrong. With the new update, Timehop has become completely pointless. It used to list out all your past social media posts in an easy to scroll down timeline. You could then click each post and see what comments were left on those old posts. Now we get some kind of weird swipe right zoomed-in photos. You can no longer read old comments. Some pictures are just a collage, and you can't click on individual ones. It's completely baffling to me why they would change the format to something so completely useless. What's the point of ""time traveling"" now? I'm thinking this new format is so that Timehop can somehow monetize their app better (by slipping in full page ads in-between swipes). More ad space = more revenue, for a free app. Beggars can't be choosers, but we CAN just delete the app. Which is what I'm doing. Say goodbye to my ad views/revenue."

I've always enjoyed it because I don't have the Facebook memories function available. I was looking forward to the Christmas posts especially because my aunt passed away this year and she would always comment on my pictures and statuses. Unfortunately, with the new update, the likes and comments have disappeared from Facebook posts. I posted a picture to twitter four years ago, but I can't see it in the Timehop post. Every picture is zoomed in, and you have to hit the share button to even see the full picture. There was nothing wrong with the old Timehop, so if you haven't updated it yet, I recommend you don't. I want to continue using Timehop to keep my streak alive, but until some major things are changed back, I'll be deleting. "

I miss the old format, and a lot of the old features. I miss ""then and now"" (and if it's still available, it's so hidden and confusing that I can't find it.) I miss the frames. I miss having comments and context with my photos (seriously. A photo came up today without any wording at all. No idea the place or movie we were seeing, and I know I would've put that in.) And I miss being able to share individual photos, because now if I uploaded groups, they appear tiny and in frames and unshareable. I have a wonderful photo of my grandfather reading to my kids on his last Christmas with us, but because of the stupid frames I can't see it properly or zoom in, much less share it.

We as ushers are telling you that we don't WANT an UPDATE to the poor new design, we want it back EXACTLY the way it was.  Fixing the picture zoom was good (thank you), but wake up and smell the critique we're giving: it's about the layout.  We don't want it to be swipe left and right, but how it was, scroll through your memories like it was on any other social media site (and don't even think about just changing the orientation of how the new format scrolls, we want it how it was).  Everything about the new format and layout is unappealing and confusing. These responses aren't because we hate Time Hop, but because we love it :). So please, put it back how it was.  The only thing making me hang on to the app is the goal of reaching my 365 day streak (which, for the dedication I've put in, the phone better shoot fireworks and confetti).

Those things that didn't make it over are very important to an app like this! First of all, remember the update for whenever you saw a photo from Instagram and clicked it, it would send you to Instagram? Nobody liked it, so you changed it back to opening likes and comments on the app. WHY WOULD THIS NEW UPDATE REVERSE THAT AGAIN?! Also, you still can't see who liked your photo, and those frames on your photos that you can't view individually are not convenient. I wrote a review previously and was so excited for you to fix that update. I was ok at first, but now I dread opening this app because of how terrible it is. Please please please just go back to the old format. Everyone loves the scroll down because it makes sense. We like seeing both likes and comments. We like the before and after feature.

And that's when the app actually decides to load. Most of the time, I just get a bright yellow screen with the date on it, and that's all that happens. It's not my connection, because every other app I have runs fine. I was happy to see you updated the app, because I thought you would have at least fixed the crazy zoom and the problem loading the app, but that's not even fixed. I'm honestly not even sure what bugs you did take care of in the last update. If this doesn't get fixed soon, I'm done with the app. It's not like I can even look at it anyway.

Sometimes when sharing a photo right from the app to Facebook, the photo gets cut off in odd places; but I can work around that by taking a screen shot on my phone, cropping, then sending.  My one REQUEST is an update wherein I'd be able to share my whole day-in-history's timehop with someone.  My husband and I often like to show each other our timehops, but in our busy lives we don't always get around to it, and then it's impossible to show again for 364 more days.

I thought this would be an awesome app to use to look back to all the awesome things I've done years ago. But instead I'm stuck at the sign up screen. A lot of people don't have Facebook, and a lot of people only have iPods, or iPads. So they don't have a phone number. From looking down at this app, I realize you should never judge a book by its cover. Plus, why would you say if you don't have a phone number, sign up with Facebook. I mean, who has Facebook, but not a phone? No offense. Just saying. But please let people sign up with their Instagram or email. It would make this app a hit and a lot more enjoyable to people like me, because, again, I'm stuck on the sign in screen.

I particularly like the ""then and now"" feature, with one caveat - the only thing stopping me from giving the app 5 stars. Sometimes, I would like to be able to use a picture I took earlier in the day or perhaps even the day before, for the ""now"" picture. Sometimes I want to do one comparing what my dog or cat was doing today to what they were doing 2 years ago, but I won't see them today, or we won't be able to go to the park where I got that good picture - but if I could use the awesome pic from yesterday morning to compare to a year ago - it's close enough for me and adequately conveys what I was trying to do with the then/now feature.

But as it stands now, I can't justify any more than a 3 star rating and it only gets that because it pulls in my Instagram, Twitter, and iCloud stuff, in addition to Facebook. Otherwise, facebook's built-in 'On This Day' feature is working much better. Timehop is only pulling over stuff from the last two years--then it says 'no activities found' for 3 years, and then displays it's little comic. This despite the fact that there is activity 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 years ago. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it but it didn't work. Doing that only helped the notifications start working. Fix this, please. The past two years were some of the worst of my life; if that's all you're going to show me on Timehop, I won't use the app anymore."

Also it's absolutely terrible that the caption from any photos can't be seen. I will see a photo and have no idea what the context even was because there's no caption. Having to zoom out on any photo to see the whole thing is also a terrible addition.

They completely change the entire interface, making it blocky and more complicated than it should be. One of the features that I enjoyed was a ""then and now"" feature that allowed you to compare a photo from before with a photo from now. I don't know if this feature is gone or if I just can't find it but the new update is made things much more confusing. Along with a fun decorating feature for sharing abilities that was taken away. The ability allowed you to decorate and customize your time hops before you share them again. Depending if any of these features comes back will dictate if I keep this app or not.

They're just that bad. The scrolling feature of the old app was one of my favorite aspects of TimeHop. I loved being able to scroll through multiple posts from one day and see them as a linear timeline. Having multiple things appear at once made it easy to screenshot and share with friends. Seeing a picture above a tweet or Facebook post made everything read like a story. This latest update just makes everything feel like a disjointed and incongruent collection of too-zoomed-in memories devoid of any sentiment. I honestly have never seen such an atrocious and ill-received update to an app and would love nothing more than for a return to the original formatting where I was actually able to see my days and years as they'd happened, rather than a jumble of posts lacking any clear connection."
1908,rlsmyrick,"March 18, 2017",3,"Wish the pics were the same... I love TimeHop, and being reminded of what I posted and the pics that I took not only last year, but 7-8 years ago.  With that said, in the last few updates, the pics are totally different.  It stretches some, shrinks others, it's very annoying!  I loved being able to save pics off of TimeHop, especially having had several different phones since some of the older pics were taken, because I like having them in my photo gallery.  But with one of the more recent updates, you can't just take a screenshot or save a pic, because all of the TimeHop garb covers half the picture.  Please fix this - I have pictures of my now deceased brother, with my young children, that are no longer on my phone but DO show up on TimeHop, that I'd like to be able to save without the ""8 years ago"" stamp covering half his forehead!!"
1909,P4ndybear,"April 5, 2017",1,"Used to be my favorite app... ... but this last update destroyed it. It used to be a compilation of images and it pulled from iCloud, which made it far superior than Facebook timeline memories, but now you have to go through every image individually and the single images take up the whole screen. When I take a picture, I'll take 10 or so to get just the right shot, so seeing all of them grouped was great. But now you have to go through every single duplicate image and I just don't want to swipe through 25 of the same images of my cat or a wine glass from a  restaurant. Also, the images are HUGE (take up the whole screen) and you can't see what is going to appear next. I used to open this app at work and now I'm afraid to because I can't tell if a private image will appear and a coworker might see it. I guess all good things come to an end. Farewell Timehop, I was an extremely loyal user, but now the poor user experience has turned me away."
1910,Tango67,"January 16, 2013",4,"Love the concept! Can't wait to see how they develop the execution of it... Right now it's a little buggy. I have over 5 years and 50K tweets that haven't easily transferred, 5+ years of Facebook too. Instagram doesn't seem to be working and neither does foursquare (I'm connected but no content is coming over), Flickr wouldn't link up at all. not sure how to resolve that. Also wish the invite friends feature was WAY more intuitive. It only seems to allow invites for FB friends, not Twitter, 4sq or IG. And you basically have to manually input names because it doesn't ""grab"" all of your friends (500+), just a select few and the names it does grab aren't folks I interact with daily. Weird. But again, the idea of Timehop is GREAT... Looking forward to future updates & will hang in there to see where it goes. Cheers!"
1911,Caroline771122,"August 5, 2013",2,"Fly Through Time...But By Yourself Every morning I have a routine - read the news and check my social media. Timehop is no different. I love to wake up and see the funny (or embarrassing) things I've posted in the past. The earlier version of this app allowed you to share what you wanted of your posted items onto a stream with others. However, now to share your memories, you have to post to Facebook or Twitter. I don't check Facebook for Instagram photos. I don't check Twitter for new photo albums. In the same way, Timehop should have kept the stream so that I can see past items others have  shared all in one place. In the end, it's a great way to look back on the past. But if Timehop doesn't think it's important enough to have its own stream, and must use other outlets for posting, why should we? The idea of social media is that it is social - enjoyed with others. The version now is lacking that aspect."
1912,RickRMortis,"October 26, 2014",3,"m0ar, pl0x! The whole concept of this app is amazing!! The reminiscing it has put me in has really put A LOT into perspective!! I love the nostalgia! :) I just REALLY wish there was something that would allow me to go back a few days (very least). Either because I wasn't able to check my Timehop that day, or really liked it and wanted to go back for the nostalgia, or even just because I decided I DO want to share the post I made 3 years ago. Maybe, we could have a built-in app file save system? where you can ""save the day"", come back to it and see your ""favorite days"" whenever you wanted. If someone were to stay on top of it, they could see all the positive and negative they have had in their lives for the year! I don't know, I really think the nostalgic, reminiscent properties of this app are amazing. It's my favorite part about the app."
1913,Jeanniebelle7308,"March 1, 2015",3,"Not a fan of the changes I was one of your biggest fans, but I'm not at all pleased with the latest changes. I hope you'll listen to us and improve things. I don't like the fact that I can't adjust my photos so that your ""x years ago"" banner doesn't block important parts of my pictures. I don't like that, if my post was too long, there is no way to see the whole post when I share it. I also don't like that the original text from a post no longer shows up. Completely defeats the purpose of reposting many of these things. I've lost count of the number of times I've given up on trying to share my Timehop findings on social media because they would just look silly or they wouldn't work. You all do want us to share these things, right? To help spread the word about your app? If so, then make it easy for us to do that."
1914,Nana2AJ,"October 12, 2015",4,"Love the memories, not the glitches As others have mentioned, the latest update introduced glitches instead of solutions! The pesky phrase over a supposedly deleted photo saying someone must be playing politics. Who? The NSA? And then the wait for pictures to load, when they are displaying as groups, but you see them as singles too?! To sum up, the photos and memories are there (except the stolen ones). The app doesn't run as smoothly while going through photos as it used to. It does seem strange that the description doesn't stay attached when you post to Facebook. However, without TimeHop I'd never have these fun reminders popping into my day. Bugs can be fixed. Hope you do that. Looks like you have a lot of fans. "
1915,Shaun Dewitt,"October 14, 2015",3,"Recent update is awful A few months ago, I loved this app! I've been using it for a couple of years, and recently things changed. If I posted a photo to Facebook and tagged someone else in it, I can't share it (which happens to be most of them). The 'then and now' feature is gone, along with all the fun frames and stickers (I never used those, but it was a nice option to have). Back to 'then and now': I have children and enjoy seeing side by sides of how they change over the years, especially if they're doing the same thing. This app allowed me to capture those photos. Now, I have to snap the current pic, then dig through Facebook for the past one and screenshot it, then stitch them together. Please bring this feature back! And please fix how we contact you, because as of right now, you can't from an iPhone."
1916,FraikenClayzy,"December 29, 2016",1,"Why, Timehop? WHY?! TERRIBLE UPDATE. I HATE this new update. For one, I don't think the past years need to be viewed in a Snapchat Story-esque way. This is Timehope; not Snapchat. Second, why are pictures zoomed in?! I get that I can tap for it to unzoom, but that doesn't work every time and it only unzooms for a second. Who wants to view their pictures cropped in a way they didn't crop them? Finally, I can't even tell how many past posts I have from each year in this format. Today it was one from each year. But was it really, or was Timehop just choosing what it thought was the best from each year? I can't trust it! "
1917,Mystinamarie,"January 5, 2017",1,"Unnecessary changes The changes to this app are so unnecessary, that it's baffling why a company would do this to their own product. They are clearly trying to mimic Snapchat or Instagram stories, but given they are an entire different genre of content, it just doesn't make sense. "
1918,Nostalgic Prime,"January 12, 2017",3,"I miss the old format but improving Update: I like the improvements from the previous update, now I can read comments and see how many likes. I still preferred the original format, but Facebook went through this when they changed their format and we got used to it. So I'm improving your rating but still wish it wasn't tinkered with.   Old post: I liked the old way better, and it's not just because most people dislike change, the set up way better. I spent every morning scrolling through pictures of my daughter, and I could see comments and how many likes those pictures would get, I miss that now. I miss the hilarious back and forth my friends would have on post. I doubt anyone at Timehop will read this but I can only hope enough people feel like me and our dissatisfaction is heard"
1919,Rescues sled dogs,"January 13, 2017",1,"App update fail... The zoomed in feature is still on and nothing changed. I can't share videos if they even load. I am not the only one that misses the way it was and the ability to just scroll down and see everything at a glance. I get wanting to update things but these updates and new formats aren't working and didn't improve the app. I've started sharing from facebooks on this day as opposed to timehop because it actually works (for the moment). I liked the cute frames to add to old photos or statuses, although those needed to be updated...now they are gone. I keep hoping you guys will really improve this app and do it for the better with these updates but the fact that I've looked for an update to the update every day this week, is pretty disappointing. I'm holding out for an update soon so I don't end up deleting the app. I've had it for so long, I would have to delete it since I thoroughly enjoyed it previously."
1920,SweetPeaKittyXO,"November 7, 2014",5,"Everything seems to be in order... But wasn't there a previous update where you could look at previous days? For example, if I wasn't able to check TimeHop yesterday, it had that option of clicking a little arrow and going back a previous day or two. I'm pretty sure you could go as far back as you wanted, although maybe not. I never went as far back as maybe a day or two. Anyway, I think that's a really good idea to bring back because I don't always have time to check my TimeHop everyday. Maybe once you pass the day, you lose the ability to repost something, but I think we should still be able to at least view a previous day in case we missed it."
1921,MoreHart33,"May 24, 2015",4,"Good, but could be better. I would recommend this app to anyone because it's a great idea and it's a lot of fun. However, I think it could be better. I understand it's supposed to be a somewhat simple design and easy to use, but I think it could be better.  I think it would be nice if you missed a day to be able to to go back the next day and see what you missed. I also think it'd be cool if you could have friends and see what their Timehops are each day. This would allow more activity and more communication between users resulting in a better app. I know there's more opportunities too, just nothing off the top of my head right now. Like I said though, great app and I recommend to everyone, but make it to its fullest potential, and then you get the 5 stars."

1923,Bellehanz,"December 18, 2016",3,"Glitches Recently it's only showing me the first line of whatever post or tweet I had. That's pretty annoying because I don't have the time (or the will, to be honest) to click on every old post to read what I actually said. Also, I often have to check timehop twice a day in order to keep my streak. I like to check it in the morning and I make sure to scroll all the way down to get the new number, then later in the afternoon or evening I get a notification saying something about how it's my last chance, or timehop is waiting, or come view whatever my old stuff is for the day, even though I already have. And I have to make sure I scroll all the way down again to keep my streak, yet there have been times when I lost my streak anyway even after checking it once or twice a day. Pretty annoying."
1924,Pyorick,"December 23, 2016",1,"Terrible Redesign Usually I'll give any redesign to an interface a chance to grow on me. Sometimes we get so set in the way things HAVE been done, we struggle to understand the new vision. That being said, this is an awful redesign that makes zero sense given the nature of the platform. For instance, today I have 5 years worth of post history. Not all of that is worthy of looking at. In the past, If I didn't care about year 2-4, I could fast scroll right to year 5. Timehop had all the ease of a twitter feed. Now I'm forced to tap & swipe, page by page through 5 years of content. How is that better? I understand you wanted to design ""beautiful full screen"" pages...but come on. I don't need a full screen tweet. It's annoying & gets in the way of what made the app fun to use. I used to open the app every morning, but now I may just wait for future updates & see if the new design concept improves. Right now, it's not fun, just annoying."
1925,sugarnspicegirl603,"December 26, 2016",1,"The worst of the worst I'm glad to see from the MANY previous comments that I am not alone in my extreme disappointment in the new update. I NEVER write app reviews but for this nonsense I am happy to make an exception. The previous version was great! Sure, it had its bugs and maybe a flaw or two but at least it was user friendly. There are so many issues with this new version I don't even know where to begin! Why should we have to zoom out of every single picture instead of just seeing them as they were meant to be seen? How come we can't see captions anymore? And for the love of God, can we even make side-by-side ""Then and Now"" pics anymore because I cannot for the life of me figure out how. I understand that change is inevitable but this seems like one of those cases where the old ""if it ain't broke"" adage certainly applies. If these major issues aren't addressed I'm sure Timehop itself will become a thing of the past."
1926,BethG143,"December 27, 2016",1,"Is this a joke? Okay so I have never reviewed an app before, and I'm someone who enjoys getting new updates on various apps because usually they're what that app needed, but whatever happened to Timehop is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I've been trying it out for the past couple days to see if I can get used to it but I just cannot, so here I am. It's so impractical! If the app doesn't go back to its original layout within a couple weeks, I am deleting it. I don't care how far I am on my streak or about seeing my memories (I'll just use a different app for that). I'll miss Abe of course, but the practicality of this app is just non-existent now. It's a memory viewer app...it does not need a crazy ""stylish"" layout like this. This of all the poor older people using this app that just wanna look back on their memories but can't figure out how to."
1927,Nic8688,"December 28, 2016",1,"Worst idea ever I'm very disappointed in this new update. You can't go back on pictures, videos, or status memories to see comments people have made previously (and if there is a way, it's terribly designed which is very likely because this update is terrible). It zooms in on every picture, video, etc which of course distorts the picture quality. News flash! Majority of these pics are taken from years ago. They aren't meant to be adjusted in any way. Leave them as they are! And the swiping left and right is not simplifying the app. It makes it more difficult since you have to resize/zoom out on every picture, and then you are more inclined to accidentally tap the wrong side of the screen and it move on to the next memory. These issues need to be addressed because I can guarantee any new users will hate this app when it has been wonderful for the longest time, and current users will delete it like I'm about to do."
1928,Becca P üòä,"February 6, 2017",1,"Please go back to old layout *Update* the performance and loading time of this app is just awful, even when on a good wifi network. The old version at least let you scroll through all photos to see which ones had loaded so far, but the new update is still extremely frustrating to use, letting them load one at a time - and the app automatically skips loading a photo after a few seconds. Please go back to the original format."
1929,MynameisAC,"March 31, 2017",4,"Advice from a fan. I love this app, one of my favorites actually! I try really hard not to break my streaks, but the only thing I don't really like about the app is that you can not save a phone without the Timehop frame around it. I understand having Timehop around the picture if uploaded to another social media, but saving it to our photo album should be a choice if you want it around it. Sorta ruins the picture for memories when it's no longer seven years ago but the only picture you have ten years from now says so. "
1930,Apokilypse,"March 25, 2015",5,"Makes Throwback Thursday, Wayback Wednesday & Timehop Tuesday... This is a great app which when integrated with your social apps (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ETC) will show you posts/photos you made in the past (1+ years) and allows you to share it on your social media websites. There is a photo effects editor which allows different photo effects. Also you can set up email notifications to alert you when you have ""TimeHop"" moments to share. Recently they added a now & then which allows you to take and add a now photo for comparison. I love it! It's fun to share old memories with friends & family. Also Timehop has other fun facts from that day in history. If you're looking for a fun app that's free, TimeHop is a keeper!!!"
1931,iTzNesha¬°¬°!,"May 26, 2015",3,"STAY ON TRACK There are a few things that could be changed. Like how it'll send me my notification for the day but still has the previous date and pictures. It doesn't show me half the pictures once I click on them. I've even tried deleting the app completely and redownloading it, but the pictures just won't show up. It's almost to the point where I'm going to delete the app all together because although it's nice to see things up to six years ago I can do that on Facebook and my stuff actually shows up. These are one of those ""bugs"" that could be fixed anytime now. I like how it's not just another social media site and no one can see my memories but me unless I choose to share them. I think it's a great idea. Just has a long way to come before I becomes a great app."
1932,Hay_clay,"December 20, 2015",4,"Love it the old version I take pictures and post them all of the time. Pictures are my way of saving that memory and being able to reflect back at a later date. I loved being able to look back at my pictures each day and see what we were up to two, three, and more years ago. The new update has some annoying features though. I don't like that each photo has snow falling down on it, because for one it's annoying and who cares if it is winter time. I can look at the date and see what season we were in. But I also don't like that it friends see when you viewed a photo you were tagged in or you can tell them you like the memory. I liked timehop the way it was before the update. Wish I could go back."

I used to love this app but I am on the edge of deleting it because of the new feature that lets you know when another person tagged in the photo has VIEWED it. Talk about creepy! The last thing I want is to know that the person I haven't talked to in years is looking at our old pics and knowing they got the same alert about me. And there's also this giant graphic covering part of the photo that says who's in the picture and if they've viewed it or not. Why would I care? Obviously I know who is in the picture. I don't want to know if they've viewed it. And now I can't see the full picture! Timehop needs to stop trying to be something they're not. Don't we interact enough with people we don't want to talk to on other social media outlets? Timehop used to make me feel nostalgic and happy, but now it makes me feel uncomfortable and weirded out. Could you at least make this feature optional? Because it's very unnecessary"
1934,ClimbingMama,"December 29, 2016",1,"New version is awful I used to love this app. But they recently updated it and the new features are awful. You can only see one picture at a time and they zoom in to the pictures so you can't even see the whole picture as you scroll through. If you want to see the whole picture, you have to touch the screen and keep your finger on the screen. Tapping takes you to the next picture and as soon as you take your finger off, it zooms back in. It's also really difficult to get a video to play and sometimes, I can't get the audio for videos at all. This was never a problem previous version of this app. Seriously, don't even bother with this app anymore. Just use Facebook memories or find some other way. It's a shame, this was previously one of my favorite apps, I used to check it first thing in the morning most days. Now, I never use it since it's so clunky. I'll probably just delete it."

There is NO reason to have it set up like Snapchat. This is not Snapchat. I'm not looking through hundreds of peoples snap stories and need an easy and convenient way to scroll through. So that format makes sense for Snapchat but not for timehop. I no longer read or open up my Timehop story and don't plan to keep it at all if it stays this way. Everything is zoomed it, I can't screenshot the photos, the sharing option isn't much help and I can't see the likes or comments anymore. Half of the point was seeing what dialogue was exchanged on my social media to enjoy those memories with my loved ones. This update was very disappointing. Please change it back or at least change it to something that caters to what the users of it want."

I used to enjoy opening Timehop every day, now I don't even bother. Layout is awful, no longer user friendly. The written description sounded great- full size pictures, easy sharing..... but the interface is awful. The frames on the albums are useless, and why doesn't the whole album show up? Doesn't make sense. Also, when clicking through memories, the zoomed in view is not appealing. Users shouldn't have to zoom out on each photo or memory. Also, posts from FB show up with strange highlighting? Also useless. Text is just fine on its own without the flare added from Timehop. (Hello, I didn't post it with high listing or fancy colors, so why would you add that when it's a flashback/memory...?) Last word...please go back!! Full screen pictures- yes, all this other garbage? No."

It was so nice to look back on sweet moments from years prior and compare how big my children have gotten from year to year. I could view which year my pictures were from easily by scrolling up or down. The new update is terrible I can't see all of my pictures from that current day. It's just a slideshow of pictures that goes so fast. I can't even tell which year anything is from. It's super annoying. The original set up was so much better. I won't be using this app unless they switch it back.
1938,Abby Ro,"February 8, 2017",1,"I'm confused... The previous updates were less than stellar, but this last update I can't seem to figure out. When I open the app, it's a yellow screen with today's date. I tap, nothing happens. I tap everything and I don't get anywhere. After seriously trying EVERYTHING, I think I may have figured it out. When I swipe up I see a picture, but then I have to close it, swipe to maybe see if there is another picture then swipe up to see the picture. IS THIS A JOKE? I don't have enough time in a day to play around. If I wanted to solve a puzzle I would get an app for that!!!!! This is supposed to be an exciting app to use but it's so beyond frustrating, I really don't understand how to use it, and frankly I really don't care to use it anymore. I used to love opening this app with my daughter (she's 10) so she could see pictures of her childhood each day, but now I can't even get to the pictures. What a let down!"

It is annoying and cumbersome and I don't want to see Snapchat like gifs of my photos. I want to see them organized by year, with Facebook posts showing the text with the photo or video, and the likes and comments that went with it. I still can't figure out how to ""swipe up to share"" on the random images that are apparently linked together in a little gif, and why do the images have to be all zoomed in so that part of the photo is cut off?

One morning I checked my Timehop and saw that I had a great Christmas photo that I wanted to do that with, so imagine my surprise when I got home to take the ""now"" picture and saw this update.  No more ""then and now"", photos zoomed in to the point where I can't even recognize them, no captions under them, no frame options...? Why is it trying so hard to be Snapchat? his update absolutely ruined the app for me.

The update is so difficult to use, when I try to share something the screen doesn't respond. Also the pics are so darn large when you open the app you're only able to see a tiny section of your photo unless you want to take the time to zoom EVERY SINGLE PHOTO out, and who has time for that???? If your photo is vertical you might be able to see most of it, but if it's horizontal, forget it, you're missing more than half the people in the shot.

Not only that but now you can't even see you full post that is on timehop, and this update has made the use of timehop now way too difficult than it should be and way too frustrating for people to use.

Timehop needs to go back to the previous and original setup that it has had since it first came out, it is nothing too fancy and that is perfectly fine because fancy is not always the best thing to have, it's better to have something simple that is easy for people of any age to figure out and use."
1946,little phoenix,"January 8, 2017",2,"Updates in the wrong direction I'm writing this review after you've fixed some of the more obnoxious problems like photo zoom and removing comments/likes. As others have mentioned, I really dislike this overhaul to Timehop. Scrolling down chronologically made a lot more sense than swiping left/right. Twitter posts look terrible; half the post is cut off so you have to swipe up to see the whole thing...why?! It's only 140 characters. We don't need huge font in blue highlight, it looks hideous and childish."
1947,Blackpuppy15,"January 8, 2017",1,"New update is better, but still stinks. I never ever write reviews and I've now written two terrible ones because this update has been so terrible. Before I would have given a 5 star rating, but I greatly dislike the new update. My favorite part is always reading through all the comments on my old posts, so thank you for bringing that back in the second update. However, this update still doesn't give me all my past pictures. Today I had three of a large group of pictures I remember posting available to see, but they were in small frames and couldn't zoom or see details of the pictures. There were also three Facebook posts that I could see the captions and comments to, but no pictures came up with said captions. I'd prefer to have both, but if you are only going to give us one or the other, give us the pictures. Please bring the old version back!!"
1948,Rightcoast7,"January 12, 2017",1,"App is laughably bad after ""update"" It's hard to imagine that any sane person could design an app this horrible, compare it with the previous app, and think, ""oh yeah, this is so much better."" Using the new app is akin to a bad acid trip, but less fun. It's absolute garbage, nothing works. I can't view individual pictures, share pictures, save pictures. Nothing. I will keep it on my phone for now in hopes that they have a team of people working around the clock to fix this abomination. I have an even better/cheaper idea, just put it back exactly the way it was a month ago, because THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. Someone should lose their job for having spearheaded such an absolutely terrible update. It's difficult to imagine how they could have screwed it up worse. Maybe if they made it so the app erased your entire phone and also kicked you in the groin? I'm sure they're working on that right now."
1949,Kpitbe,"January 16, 2017",1,"Terrible update The update is still not ""fixed"" and it very annoying to use. I can't save pictures and I really find the swiping format difficult and unnecessary. Like others have said, put everything back into one page where you can choose what to focus on. "
1950,PineappleStarKiss,"June 10, 2015",5,"The best app. I'm obsessed. I love seeing what's in store for me every morning on time hop. My favorite feature is the iPhoto connection (I hope this will work when apple gets rid of iPhoto and replaces it with their new ""Photos"" app)!

1952,PrincessA674,"January 2, 2016",3,Losing enjoyment I have had this app for a long time now (even on 2 different phones). Since the more current updates I'm not pleased. 1) I don't care for the fact that my day to day history is no longer showing up. For 5 plus years I said nothing on several social media sites (Not True). 2) I don't need the friends tag. 3) The random fact at the end I use to share and it shared the entire fact words and picture. Now it just post the picture. The picture doesn't mean much without the words to give the history fact.  
1953,ajprice1994,"March 12, 2016",2,"Really? Making fun of dyslexic people? I'm giving this app two stars instead of one only because I enjoy having it and using it now and then. But today when I scrolled to the bottom to read the joke that is there everyday, it was a bit upsetting to see that the dinosaur was making fun of people with dyslexia. I get it though. Whoever wrote it probably doesn't realize that a close friend or family member of theirs most likely has it. It's something that is way more common than you think because people are ashamed to tell others of it. I've been in awkward situations where strangers at a bus stop or on a ski lift are cracking jokes about as I stand quietly next to my friend who is dyslexic. It is never acceptable to make fun of a disability, no matter how mild it may be. You wouldn't make fun of people with Down syndrome-please don't do it to people with dyslexia."
1954,RK Webb,"December 27, 2016",1,"Hate the new update This is my first app review. I dislike the new update so much that I felt the need write the review and rate the app with 1 star. This is coming from the person that rolls their eyes when everyone complains about updates on popular social media sites. They're free, so I don't see how we have much room to complain. That being said, with the latest Timehop update, they've made it so user UNfriendly that I would never recommend the app to my friends. I hate having to hold down my picture just to zoom out and see the whole thing. I also hate not seeing the captions along with the pic. My posts are often more than just a picture and the captions tell the whole story. Also, I don't like that I can't see a whole album like I used to. Only a few pictures show on the screen and I can't zoom in to see the small pictures better. I am begging you to fix these issues!"
1955,Sgwilkinson86,"December 29, 2016",1,"Get rid of the update I have never written a review before but this update deserves one. A bad one. I've never found an update so ridiculous. I like change, and new features but not when they get rid of half the features I enjoyed about the app in the first place. Where did my captions go? That's half the memories attached to these photos. And why in the world would you make everything zoomed in so you can't see you photos easily? Talk about not user friendly. I can see how tapping through the years worth of photos would be great, but let me see my whole photo and the caption attached. And while you're at it, let me share my captions again as an option if I want to. I know that changed a while ago but I miss being able to share the whole memory easily. Your app used to make looking back fun, but now it seems rather pointless. Please fix, would love to continue using."

1957,Michael Lepien,"January 4, 2017",1,"Hate the new format I loved the old version and can't stand the new one. I don't like how every photo is zoomed in and you have to hold it down to zoom out. You can't just click it and see the entire image. Nor can you read any comments about the picture. Yesterday I had some pop up from my camera role that weren't on Facebook. They were several snapshots back to back of my kids at my best friends wedding and in each picture everyone was making different faces. On this new version of timehop, it played them all like a quick slide show and I couldn't look at them individually or zoom them out. It's terrible, not an enjoyable experience. I understand wanting to update and change in order to stay relevant and maintain your success. You have to understand why you're successful first before you can maintain it. Timehop literally changed everything that made them successful."
1958,NikTrus,"January 8, 2017",1,"(Still) Absolutely awful Update: I was hoping for a complete revert to the old UI but instead I got a hot mess that flips through similar pictures from my phone's photo album at a high rate of speed that makes me nauseous. And I still have to swipe through, which seemed to be the bulk of the reviewers' problem with the update to begin with. I've stopped checking this daily and will be deleting if this doesn't go back to normal. It is still completely unusable. "

1961,MelissaSchoon,"February 10, 2015",3,"Not happy with the logo that blocks photos. Time opposite pretty cool app however, I do not like the most recent update. It is a bit clunky and can use some improvements, such as how it shares the chosen time hop photo now to Facebook and other sites, the Timehop logo blocks out some of the lettering or pictures including people with the little orange bar at the top left-hand corner. It's tacky and I don't like it. I liked it better when time hop would show the entire photo from last year and not put its label over top of your photo blocking out important letters/words/images. I am very unhappy with the newest update. "
1962,Tollie Williams,"January 20, 2016",1,"Suffering from annoying ""feature bloat"" The most annoying of the feature bloat is - whatever it's doing, it's killing any playing audio when the app opens.

I would've given this app 10 stars if I could! But then I got an iPad and decided to delete the app off my phone and just download it to my iPad. It wasn't working on my iPad so then I got it back on my phone, and it still doesn't work. Notifications don't show anymore and it'll show me one MAYBE 2 things everyday. Then everything else comes up as ""no activities found"". Which is bs because stuff used to pop up everyday even if it was the tiniest thing. Now hardly anything comes up. I don't think it deserves any stars at this point. I am very disappointed and wish I never switched it to my iPad:( Please fix this, I miss my timehop!!!"

I understand you're probably trying to compete with Facebook's ""on this day,"" but honestly you used to have a product that I would check because it was fun and easy to use. Furthermore I would share memories from Timehop across other social platforms, because of how I could edit the memories was much more interesting."
1965,anotherweasley,"January 17, 2017",1,"Went from great to terrible in a single update I have held off writing this review because I had faith you would come to your senses and fix what you broke. But alas you have not and you've actually proceeded to make things worse (if that's possible). I used to love checking this app on a daily basis and now I'm debating deleting it. You killed the Facebook connectivity and I can't even disconnect and reconnect to try to fix it. It won't let me!!  I only get Twitter messages from 5 years ago or more and I've definitely used Twitter since then. It picks and chooses from the photos and never shows anything from Instagram. So this has gone from a once loved app to an annoyance I don't even know why I keep. Do you not read these reviews. Do you not care that your rating has plummeted because of your ""improvements"". Go back to the old style. It wasn't broken why did you try to fix it!"

Like, do you guys read or even skim through these reviews? the ""tap to scroll"" feature doesn't need to be something that everyone needs to copy. It's a snapchat feature that works on snapchat but when every other social network wants to copy the feature, it becomes redundant, as if people can't think of original ideas. We don't like the update, no one does, how do you not see the extreme drop off in ratings? The app is rated at 1 1/2 stars, how is that not a big red flag for you?"

It's like, well how many more in this year do i have to swipe before the next year starts, oh i don't know, but keep swiping.. ugh how annoying.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go back to the old way of viewing each year it was so much easier.. Seeing a group of photos from that year you could click and select if you wanted to make it bigger... this isn't tinder, no need to keep swiping left.. i miss just scrolling up and seeing each year in its entirety.. i hate not knowing how many more pictures i have left to finish that year... i would have given it 0 stars if possible, that's how disappointed i am with this app.."

My favorite part of the day is when I get to check my timehop and share all of the funny memories with my friends. But this update just isn't good. First off it's very hard to learn how to use it. When I first opened it I was so confused why everything was so zoomed in. It doesn't make sense for all of your old posts to be zoomed in my default. I don't like that one memory takes up the entire screen now. It used to be so fun to be able to just scroll down and see all of your memories and it made sense how it progressed. It just doesn't make sense anymore. I also don't like that you can no longer see how many likes/comments you got on a specific post, because this was half the fun. I still love timehop but I just don't think this update was smart and I don't like many of the new features."

The thing that irritates me most, is that you can't even see the post anymore or actual comments that came with the post. It used to take you right back to Facebook but now once you tap the photo it just takes you to the next photo. üôÑ very annoying and honestly it defeats the purpose of going back in time.

I used to look forward to opening my timehop and never looked at my Facebook ""on this day"" section because I much preferred my TH. That is absolutely not the case anymore. Now my FB shows more than what I'm getting on Timehop. Plus the new formatting is garbage. I agree with all of the other terrible reviews about this update. Why mess with what isn't broken? The old format was so much more user friendly. I used to brag about and encourage people to use Timehop - sending old pictures to friends almost everyday. I have even been rocking an almost 300 day streak. Now I only get on to see if it's fixed. If I doesn't change soon I'm just going to give up on it. I hate to do that because I really did love it but not anymore. Hopefully you fix it before a new guy comes in with a better format."
1977,Crystal Smyth,"January 23, 2017",1,"What happened? This is my first time writing a review, but I'm so disappointed in the new updated TimeHop. This app had previously served as a wonderful tool for me, ever since losing my dad. I looked forward (everyday) to waking up and seeing photos/videos/FaceBook status updates, of what was taking place a few years back. I actually rely on some of these (in particular videos) because Timehop seems to pull some out from places I was convinced were lost memories. Everything has changed with this new app. I can't even figure out how to save/share an old video now. And I hate that I can't view every photo independently. Please make some necessary changes. After reading reviews, I can see I'm not the only one who is disappointed. I'm Hopeful you will consider your power to make the change & be pleasing to those who have started out with you from the beginning. :)"
1978,Ochoa4640,"January 29, 2017",1,Terrible Update This is the most obnoxious thing. You guys were so busy trying to keep up with the design trend you ruined all of the features the people loved about the app in the first place. I hate that I can't see comments from my old Facebook posts or go open the posts in the original app for any of the social media sites. Sometimes the tweets are so out of context that it's impossible to know what was happening without seeing the post in twitter. Not to mention the swiping crap is such a nuisance. If I wanted to skip through my old posts to get to specific ones I could just scroll and didn't have to tap or swipe a million times to get to older posts. You guys really screwed up here and should give us the ability to go back to the old version if we so choose to do. But from the looks of your reviews no one likes this update in the first place.
1979,LadySkellerman,"January 30, 2017",1,"Bring back the old TimeHop I used to love checking Time Hop every morning-- it was engrained into my morning routine! Now, I dread it-- this update (the one that completely changed the layout) is one of the worst app updates I've seen. It's slow, and it's not visually appealing. The swiping to the left is terrible, the zoomed in pictures look terrible (even though they changed that in the most recent update), along with having to swipe through EVERY SINGLE PICTURE, and the statuses look huge and ungainly. They also took away some of the most fun parts of the app-- the then/now feature, the ""most liked of the month/year/of all time"" aspects. Overall, I really hate this app now-- I have avoided deleting it because of my love for the old version, but if this is how it's going to be from now on, it won't remain on my phone for very long."

Brings back some great memories from high school, to an old relationship-(some good from it and some bad lol) only problem I have is that early in the morning, it seems to take forever to load, or it doesn't say I'm logged in and has to retry with Facebook then completely fails. Some days it just never loads up, and I have to wait till mid afternoon to actually go back and look. Other then those 2 things, I love the app. I would try and add a way you can go back and look at everything so far instead of just 1 day and then it's gone the next. Even if it's a per month thing.

It's great for people that use their social media often as it shows you the old posts and pictures you've posted on FB, Twitter, etc. any of the ones you select. I sort of wish they would make it so we can see our old MySpace and MyYearbook pics/posts. I understand that hardly (if anyone) uses those anymore but it would be neat to see our posts from them since our timelines would go back even further! Then again, I probably don't want to see any of my lame posts from then... Well I do for a laugh actually!!"

I love that over the course of its life the creators haven't updated it in anyway that takes away from its core purpose and it has stayed fundamentally the same. I also love the inclusion of one big event that happened unrelated to you, it's always interesting to know and sometimes creates a good conversation starter. Also, I love the quirky little references they have Abe make at the bottom, especially because I see Doctor Who ones a lot and I'm a big Who fan.

I can't see the captions I wrote on the picture. This app used to be the first thing I would look at in the morning, sounds crazy but I was excited to see memories. I've had Facebook for a very long time so I even have memories from 10 years ago. Now I will be deleting this app for it is useless for me. I don't see the point in any of the changes.

I also hate that I can't see the captions of the pictures, especially the ones I've retweeted on twitter.

It's not user friendly at all, you can't see the full pictures, you need to minimize the screen, it's not easy to share/save/etc. people loved this app because they were able to scroll through and go back and fourth between the photos/videos. Now you have to backtrack and it truly just not as fun. Also it's odd that pictures aren't fitting on the screen and you have to minimize to see the entire photo. Judging by all of the other comments this is the general consensus of your users. While I appreciate you trying to make this app the best it can be, I think you may have to go back to the drawing board or at least back to the old format.

I don't care for having to look at them ALL full screen (which awkwardly crops most of them), and sometimes see them strobing at lightning speed through a short series (which it seems to choose them at random to flash through and it gives me a headache!). I enjoyed scrolling through to the end previously to see the oldest memories and to continue my streak, but when I'm met with 100+ vacation photos (many of which are similar) that I have to click past, I tend to give up before the end.

In the final update of 2016, they not only took that all away, they destroyed it with their ""improvements"". A later update that ""fixed"" it left me unable to see part of some posts, and unable to ""catch"" others as they speedily ran through the posts of that day. I'm convinced! I'm uninstalling Timehop and will be perfectly satisfied with ""On this Day""! Bye, Timehop!

It would be nice to have an easy way to save them every day, if there is please let me know hehehehe.

This app is unusable now, I used to love checking it everyday, I'd wake up and it'd be the first thing I click on, now it's unbearable. 1. Everything is zoomed in which absolutely makes no sense. 2. I can't watch my old videos!! That is a deal breaker in itself. 3. I can't see the CAPTIONS, which takes away ALL of the meaning, what's the point of even looking anymore? Finally. 4. I can't direct myself to my (twitter, Instagram, Facebook), I used to love being able to click on the icon and be able to direct myself to the actual tweet, that was my favorite thing about the app, I'd be able to click it and tag my friends in it, showing them memories, and this update has truly taken that away, this app is ruined, something needs to change, please."
1997,MommyJay,"January 7, 2017",4,"Each update is getting closer to ideal! I love Timehop. Every day for the past few years it's been a highlight of my day. The latest update is pretty good, but I'm missing two things. First, what happened to Then & Now? I have kids and I love doing years-apart side-by-sides to see how much my kids have grown over the years. Also, what happened to the custom frames for sharing Timehop memories? Other than that, I think the revamp of the program is really lovely. It's higher quality, it's streamlined, its intuitive, and I really appreciate the thought and effort that went into taking the experience up a notch. If these small things could be added back, I think Timehop would be absolutely perfect!"
1998,StackhouseScorpio,"January 10, 2017",3,"Really not really I loved this app when I first got it but now they've made changes that don't make sense. We use to be able to see the likes and the comments and was able to delete post that we didn't want, now we can't. Pictures from my google and the picture gallery don't have the option for me to save them anymore. The pictures and post are blown up so that you can't even barely see what they are. It wasn't broke so it didn't need fixing. I really don't care for this app anymore. I liked being able to go back and delete old embarrassing post on fb but it doesn't give you the option to  do that anymore. Now they show you the likes but you can't see who liked the post. It's just so annoying now."
1999,EmilyAnn128,"March 6, 2017",2,"New update is still not great First review: I loved Timehop for a long time and checked it every day, then sort of fell out of the habit and would only check it now and again. I just opened the app for the first time in a while and am probably deleting the app due to the changed layout. Each post needs to be reviewed individually, and being forced to tap through every single memory from the last 7 years is obnoxious and tedious."
2000,Stupid 4 buying,"March 30, 2015",5,Love it Love it! Been using for TimeHop for years. Can't complain or say anything negative. There has already been major improvements since the beginning of this app. Good example is getting to add text to your Timehop pic which is a great feature now. If I had to nitpick I would say I would like to have more time to be able to post Timehop pics. Sometimes when I'm preoccupied and notice that there is a TH notification. I'll look at it and since I'm busy I intend to post later on. Then When I remember usually the time allowed has expired to post which is usually after midnight. Wish we could back up a few hours sometimes.
2001,Kaitlynb777,"July 25, 2016",5,"Come on Now I love this app. I went to go on it just now and it keeps crashing! I only have a time hop streak of like 8 days so for me that isn't too bad, but what about those people that had so much more! Before the update it was perfect I loved the set up. I loved the tracking. Everything was perfectly fine. Now that I updated it it's all messed up. I will change my review when I can actually open the app again. This app is truly five stars. There WAS nothing wrong with it, so I don't see why I would give it one star. Like I said fix it and I will change my review."
2002,Vannleigh,"December 17, 2016",4,"Love this app but... I love this app. Works great. I love the little dinosaur guy & the little facts at the bottom each day. But, there's only one problem I wish they could change... I wish there was an option to delete certain memories from coming back up. There might be certain pictures or posts people really don't want to be reminded of. Or maybe it's just not special memory really, like a screenshot of something that's not important. Or multiple repeated photos in one day & you'd really only care to see one. I don't know, I'm sure there's many reasons for that option to be of use. There should just be an button/option you can choose to do so. Other than that, love it."
2003,mlyrich34,"December 22, 2016",1,"Version 4.0.0 is terrible I just opened my app and was shocked at the change. I think it was extremely unnecessary and just makes me not want to use the app anymore. I love the scrolling and I feel like it was a way easier way to read my old posts. Also feel that the new app lacks information. On the on this day in history page we no longer get information. I have no idea what the history is about it is just a picture. This also happens with my retweets or tweets with pictures. And also with instagram pictures. I just see the picture and no caption Or information. This update is overall very time consuming and did not do good for the app. I'm so disappointed in this app now. I HATE the new Timehop and do not think that the memories got better. This was a horrible, unneeded move on the creator's part. Wish I could undo this app update."

It's nice to see I'm not alone in the hate for this new update, and I'm hopeful that the drastic change in timehops ratings will make the developers reconsider. I have never written a review on an app ever, but this one ruined my favorite app so much that I felt it was needed. I get making updates and cosmetic changes, but you've now lost functionality that made this my favorite app. PLEASE bring back being able to view the original posts/comments!!! That was half the fun of the app and I don't understand why that feature was taken away. Also WHY do I have to zoom out to see everything?! The zoom feature is nice, but it's so backwards to have it start out that way and half the time I don't end up seeing anything. I would delete this app, but I'm hopeful for a fix of these problems now seeing that no one else seems to like it either."

FIX IT!!!"
2008,malnar,"January 14, 2017",1,"Used to be fun This new version has completely destroyed the fun this app used to be. It's just annoying to use. Why does it scroll side-to-side rather than up and down? It's harder to go sideways than up or down. Microsoft figured this out when they did the same thing with Windows 8. No one likes side scrolling. Why is everything either zoomed in to fill the screen or tucked away in pointless ""frames""? Why don't Facebook posts show the entire post and the comments? I can't think of a single thing about this update that is an improvement on prior versions and the result is that I simply don't use it anymore. I keep it installed hoping for a return to the sensible, fun old version or something very similar, but I don't know how long I'll bother keeping it around when the updates show that Timehop just doesn't seem to care what its users think."
2009,LoriValenz,"March 27, 2017",1,"What Did You Do??? I don't think updates are supposed to break the app! TimeHop is my favorite app but now I can't even see ANYTHING!

I can't see ANY posts or pictures I've done...NONE! Can't even get it to load them. At first it started skipping over my videos but now I see nothing. It's bad enough that if I want to share a picture from last years that the caption never went with it...I shouldn't have to re-write what I said about said picture 8 years ago. And what's with all the lines of text being highlighted in different colors? Makes it super hard to read anything! Come on TimeHop - get it together!

2010,Tammynic,"October 3, 2015",4,"Fun app! I enjoy seeing things that show up from the past several years. I sometimes get a nice surprise when something that I totally forgot about shows up. I love seeing how my children and grandchildren have changed from year to year. Yes, I could look at old photos, but this gives me a quick look without having to go get the albums to look at, and doesn't take as much time to do. It would be nice if the recent issue of pictures not showing up due to politics would stop happening, especially since this only started happening to me recently. Other than that, it's a great app. To those that are complaining-it's a free app; delete it if it bothers you."
2011,Julianna1129,"November 5, 2015",2,"Major glitch for me This is a phenomenal app and such a great idea. I love being able to look at what I was doing on this day 1, 2, 3 years ago or more. It's wonderful. However. Sometimes my timehop will go through long bouts of not showing me any of my photos from my phone or computer!! I take many pictures every day so it is very noticeable when that huge chunk is missing every day. The facebook, Twitter, and instagram consistently is there. But the most important part (to me) is very often just not there at all. And I have gone back to my iPhoto library (which is still has told me is synced) to check that there were in fact many photos that were supposed to be on there. I have tried unsyncing and resyncing (which I should not have to do) and it still does not work. Please fix this."
2012,Beauty and the beastttttttttt,"December 12, 2016",1,":/ I specifically got this app in hopes for it to allow me to see my old tweets from twitter but the app told me to ""request an archive"" and when I tried, it said that not all people can achieve an archive as of right now. I didn't see the point in keeping the app if it doesn't allow me to see my tweets. Facebook already has their own version of Timehop with their ""memories"" feature. Instagram doesn't take too long to scroll through to find posts. If Timehop can adjust this broken feature and allow people to see tweets from however long ago, given the date, instead of only going able to go back a certain number of tweets, or not go back at all (archive not being able to be requested), then I'll download and recommend the app. But as of right now, my friends and I are thoroughly disappointed and we all deleted the app."

I have looked through the App Store trying to find something like time hop so I could delete this one but have no luck finding anything similar to the old and better time hop. I will give it a few more weeks and pray you guys listen to all of the reviews you have gotten on the update and then if there is no change back I sadly will have to press delete. If it does go back I will gladly write a new review with 5 stars. Please go back to what you were."

I can only see just the middle of each, and even when I zoom out it only lets me keep the photo there while my fingers on the screen. I have always loved this app, and I am almost 200+ days in checking it on a regular basis. But now I can't even really enjoy the photos that come up. So please keep working at it!"

I hate that everything is zoomed in (and I don't have auto zoom selected, so what gives?). I hate that I can't share videos and that to see a picture again I have to flip through everything all over again. Bring back the old version with the fun frames, the quick scan by scrolling up and down, the easier ability to view without it zooming in and the easier ability to share. Keep Abe, he's funny. "

The new format doesn't bother me as much anymore however the old format is highly preferred. In addition any videos or comments I commented on that show up can't be seen if I click on it. What's the point of seeing a 1 sided conversation or seeing a picture of a video??? I lasso suggest adding the feature of connecting to your Apple Music. I know for a fact everyone forgets the name of the song they use to listen to constantly and would love to be reminded of it. In all timehop seem kind is pointless because half the users can't see their photos or videos because they can't load or because you simply can't watch or view anything. The other half hate the new updated version."

(Also, my time hop doesn't go back passed 4 years? I have had a Facebook for roughly 8-10 years, and only ONCE have I gotten a post from 5 years ago, but never before that. What's up with that?

I don't know if this is a technical issue, but I would love to see the comments that go along with a facebook or instagram post from years past, the same way it can show likes. I sometimes am confused by what I had posted in the past, and comments may give it context or at the very least enhance the memories. Likewise, if my twitter memory is a reply tweet, i would like to see what the tweet that i replied to was for context, if it hasn't been deleted. If it has been deleted, I would also like for it to tell me that so I don't have to go searching for it."

As much as I hate to admit it, I've been posting to Facebook every day for the past 7 years [Yes, I'm aware that's pathetic, stop judging.] Also, sometimes I'll tag what I'm watching and Timehop doesn't seem to understand that. One status will say, ""Catching up on season four..."" And it won't show what I'm catching up on. "

It didn't look AS bad and wasn't as difficult as to maneuver anymore...here is the big issue- I can't get past 2-3 memories now without the entire app CRASHING! Agh...--------------The new update is pretty awful. Not sure why they decided it needed to be changed. It was much easier to just simply scroll down to see past memories, but they have now decided to over-complicate the process of the application by having to tap, hold and swipe to navigate to view memories. I will most likely be removing this application from my phone if they do not return to the simplified and efficient version in an update soon. Remember, sometimes less really is more."

I always accidentally tap the picture and it jumps to the next thing, super annoying. I feel like I'm seeing less content than before. When it shows like 3 pictures in a frame, there's ONLY 3 pictures when I know there should be more, and you can't see any captions or zoom or even share. It's pointless. Before, I liked the continuous scroll, now everything seems so separate and closed off.... claustrophobic as someone else put it. Basically, stop making updates to the new version and just go back to the old. You have a 1.5 star rating right now, clearly you're not listening to us and people don't like it. I get that you're trying to please everybody but you can't so please the majority."

2030,This is not a keeper,"June 16, 2014",5,"Satisfied Customer I absolutely love this app. Every time there's a time hop, since there isn't one everyday, I get a notification so that I don't have to check everyday. Sometimes the timehop is two or three meaningless pictures or it's a lot of pictures from an event or something, but it always brings a smile to face to see these memories. For example, my timehop today is of my 8th grade graduation, and I saw pictures of me with all my friends who I haven't seen in forever. It really made me happy and it absolutely recommend this app. To get the most of it, connect it to all of your social networks and upload iPhoto pictures."

I do like the update I just think scrolling should still be an option. ALSO the BIGGEST PROBLEM I have with the new update is that you can't see the captions for pictures or videos posted on social media !!! And you can't click a tweet / picture to view on twitter / Instagram! It's nice to be able to see it on the app as well to see the rest of a twitter conversation, etc."

This new zoomed in feature, no ability to see what was posted with the picture and the Snapchat look of the app has ruined it.

2035,Lepee,"December 30, 2016",1,New update is horrible! Fix it please I don't usually write reviews on apps but I've been using this app for about a year and a half now so I feel it's important for me to say something about it. With the new update this app is not the same. Previously we were able to go to that tweet on Twitter or that post on Facebook and see other comments that went with it that day it was posted. Also the whole picture zoomed in is inconvenient and a lot the pictures don't have a stamp of where it came from. I don't think that the tapping method like used in Snapchat is for this app. The scrolling down was much more easier to connect with our memories. I hope to see positive changes in the future for this app because I appreciate what this app does and it's purpose. Just stop trying to fix a problem that was never there. Thank you!
2036,Kaymuss,"December 31, 2016",1,"Update is terrible I can see I'm not the only person who is reviewing Timehop with its new update. I'm not usually too picky about this sort of thing because updates happen, we get used to them after awhile but, this update is just irritating and horrible. Pictures are always zoomed in and half of them I can't zoom out of, then I can't look at them. Videos can't be shared or saved (which was a problem before the update also) and statuses/posts aren't with the pictures. I thought that was the point of Timehop? It's now hard to navigate through, half the time not even fully working. We understand changes happen, but please make Timehop the way it was. And add in the feature to save videos. We all get new phones and sometimes things are lost. That's why I like to use Timehop, to remind me of things and to save them."

Not only does it take me longer to maneuver my way through my social media posts from past years; I also can no longer view the actual posts I made. For example, in previous versions, I could click on the little twitter bubble and go back to a tweet found in my timehop. Not anymore, I guess... so much for going back and deleting old, embarrassing tweets. The whole system just makes it seem like the creators are trying to emulate the current features of Snapchat, which really doesn't seem to translate over well. Interesting experiment, but I think almost everyone agrees with me that the older timehop format was much more convenient."

If I could make a suggestion though? It'd be cool to be able to go back on previous day's you already had in case you miss a day or want to reference a previous post.

The app continually said ""time travel failed"" and I'd refresh and refresh and close out the app and reopen , turn off and on my phone I even deleted the app and reinstalled it. Nothing works. But then the next day it'll work fine. So aggravating . Additionally, the other day I had something on my time travel I wanted to share SO bad but couldn't. It kept giving me errors . I was very upset because I tried at various times through the day and it never would share. So I missed my opportunity on sharing it.

There are some things that I would love to see improved, but at this point, I'm not complaining, since the app has been very enjoyable! My only real issue so far is connecting it to the photos on my computer, as the Timehop sync app for the PC keeps crashing, but that may be my computer's fault for all I know, so I won't dock the app rating for that!"
2043,White1234,"September 10, 2015",3,"Great memories, but not a good app for the iPad I love opening time hop every morning and looking at year's past, and although it is great on my iPhone, this app is terrible for the iPad.  Hard to maneuver, does not share pictures although it says it can and if you tap a picture to make it bigger, you have to close out the app to get back to the normal screen. Also, now there are icons (like a thumbs up, etc) that you can ""add"" to the bottom right corner of the picture.  I say ""add"" because on the iPad app, YOU CAN'T GET IT OFF.  This option works fine on the iPhone. I never share with the iPad app because everything about sharing it is just way too difficult if you can even get it to share.  Love it on my phone though!"
2044,hullogrl,"December 20, 2015",2,"Used to be great I used to love this app, but the recent updates have made me not even want to use it anymore. It used to be so convenient the way that they grouped together photos from Facebook and my old albums, but now this ""shared photos"" features makes it impossible to scroll through and see things in a cohesive way."
2045,Heat21a,"December 24, 2016",5,"Love the flashback, hate the update Current review: update is TERRIBLE! You can't see the text on the pics, have to scroll through each individually (which could be a bunch you want to skip) and now way to kind of preview them (like seeing it all before and could always click to zoom).  Unless they revert back I'll be deleting because it's no good. Sorry! Went from 30,000+ giving 4 stars and down to 1.5 stars with this update "
2046,rmw1983,"December 28, 2016",1,The new update ruined Timehop I have used timehop every day forever but the new update that was released just ruined the experience for me. It honestly makes me so frustrated to use it now it's no longer worth it. Why do all the pictures start zoomed in? This is so stupid and counterintuitive. Who wants to have to hold their finger down on the screen just to be able to see the full picture?? And why did you get rid of the captions that go along with the posts? Many of my posts are pictures of my kids with a caption of something funny or sweet that they said or did. But now all of that is gone too. Do yourself a favor and DON'T download this app unless they decide to make an upgrade that actually benefits it. I never write reviews but I'm just so surprised they took a good thing and ruined it trying to make it better. Try again timehop.
2047,ech136873367733,"December 30, 2016",1,"New update I have never felt the need to review an app in my life until now. I have been using timehop for years and throughout the years there have been updates I didn't care for, however never until now has an update made me want to forget about using the app at all. I've always enjoyed seeing my memories everyday and would be genuinely upset if I missed a day. NOW, it is worth it to miss memories if it means not getting on the updated app. It's HORRIBLE. I hate the automatic zoom and the click through format. It works for snapchat, but not for timehop. I feel like it's a mess. I enjoy scrolling through my memories, easily moving through the years. Now it's too segmented and hard to see. I can't even see my old captions and comments. A picture I tweeted showed up, but without the tweet... pointless!  Timehop, PLEASE, fix this app."
2048,Byackley,"January 3, 2017",1,"Terrible update! I never do reviews but this update is so terrible I feel compelled to join in and voice my irritation. Ditto to what everyone has already said about the annoying zoom of the pictures and time wasting swiping as well as the missing comments and such for photos. I'm also noticing that not all of my posts and pics from a particular day are showing up, which kind of defeats the point of the app. Also, I haven't seen anyone else mention it, but I really liked the ability to take a past photo in the app and repost it with a current picture so there was a little ""Then-Now"" picture to compare....if that feature is still in the app, I have no idea where as I have searched in vain! This app needs to go back to the functionality and features it used to have or it is going to my trash!!"
2049,devonairTV,"January 6, 2017",1,"The redesign turned a great app into pure garbage This is a great app/service for looking back at what you've been up to over the years. Unfortunately a recent update brought a complete redesign that makes the app practically useless. They took a great UI paradigm of scrolling through your memories leisurely, and replaced it with a nonsensical design that requires you to tap through each and every post. This is incredibly tedious if you've been using the app for a long time and have years and years of memories to ""tap"" through. Also when you get to a photo post, it is zoomed in for no good reason -- forcing you to tap and hold on the photo to zoom out and show the entire thing (ditto for videos!!!???). "
2050,Slacker1022,"January 24, 2015",3,"Not a fan of the update I LOVED this app until the recent update! It was so easy to share an old post to several social media sites in one swoop. Now it's a pain because you have to post to each one individually, and get transferred to each social media's app to do it. (Before, it was only like that with Instagram.) It doesn't keep any comments I added, so I have to type them out for each platform I share to."
2051,Sunshine & Love,"September 2, 2015",5,"Great fun to peek into windows at the past! I must say, this app has easily become one of my favorites. It is so fun (and yes, often pretty embarrassing) to be able to easily peek into windows to the past every day. Sure, you could do it by scouring through all of your photos and social media accounts, but timehop does the work for you. I do, however, wish it would be possible to go back a few days at least. Quite often I have a busy day and notice that I didn't get a chance to check it, but then it's gone by the next day. Overall, thanks for the fun blasts from the past, timehop!"
2052,Zsjb13,"November 26, 2015",4,"Love the idea, but the execution is lacking I freaking love time hop.... When it works. It's amazing to look back in time and see how far your life has taken you. Sometimes though, timehop fails at providing me an accurate description of what happened a year or two or three ago. Sometimes I go for days with no previous activity; which I know is not true. Take today for instance, it compared today, thanksgiving day, to the previous thanksgiving days. I only had one year from the past that pooped up. But I know that I have posted on several thanksgivings over the years. So, as I said, I love timehop, but some of the glitches need to be worked on. Thanks!"
2053,Sakihh13,"January 4, 2016",4,"Put the facts back! I like the concept of time hop and its new friends feature is great because now I can reminisce with my friends without sharing the photo, but the best part of the app has been ruined for sometime now. The ""this day in history"" section gives a daily fact about something that happened in the past. I want to share these things on Facebook like before but the facts are always removed. What's the point of sharing the photo if people don't even know what it's for? Put the fun back in fun fact. If I share the photo from this day in history, include the fact and the website where you found the information."
2054,Papatud,"July 22, 2016",5,"Fun Aop I love these daily walks down memory lane. Unlike Facebook's similar ""memories"" utility, Timehop pulls all your pictures from this date not just the ones you've posted. "

2056,Kcampbell1390,"December 26, 2016",1,"New Update is Awful The new update is awful, I hate how you navigate through the app now. It's like Snapchat almost and I don't use Snapchat for the same reason, it's annoying to navigate through. So, I will probably stop using Timehop as well unless the update changes. Doesn't necessarily have to change back to the way it was, but what is current has to go. "
2057,em_la,"January 7, 2017",5,All fixed!!! You listened! Let me clear...I love timehop! Totally and completely. But the new update is not good. I can't share videos or even see them fully without holding my finger down in them. I also can't see any original comments made or complete stories! I'm tired of looking at my pictures all blown up and huge. Go back!!!
2058,ASUEK,"January 7, 2017",5,Awful update! What is the point anymore if we can't see likes and comments on photos? First I thought I was missing something or doing something wrong but NO! Stupid update. I'm not even excited to look at Timehop each day anymore. I can't figure out what some of my FB posts meant when I can't see the comments. I'm sure you meant well but this went from a 5 star app to barely a 1.
2059,Eulera,"January 15, 2017",2,"Please fix the notifications Like pretty much everyone else, I hate the new version, too. But my gripe to report actually comes from farther back. I like that Timehop reminds me to check it each day, with a popup and badge icon. I also like that it gives me a buffer zone beyond midnight to see the previous day (as many of us don't end our days at midnight). The thing is, I usually check Timehop shortly after waking up, sometime between 6-9am depending on the day. Typically, it has no icon badge. But then almost immediately, or at some point later in the day, I get the reminder and have to go into Timehop again to clear it. Is there really no way to make Abe smart enough to know I've already been there in this 24 hour period? I decide when to use the app, not him!"
2060,pinkbabii1212,"March 27, 2013",4,Fun! This app is so much fun because it allows me to see how weird of a person I was just a measly year before! It always give me a good laugh.

I love sharing with the friends that I've had over the years. The only suggestion I would make to the creators is being able to favorite a particular day, and save it so you could look at all your favorite days! Or be able to scroll through past days. Sometimes there are days that I don't want to forget or would like to screenshot and keep! Other than that I love this app, it gives me some laughs and is just all around an incredible idea!

2063,alexamck,"October 27, 2015",1,"0 stars if I could I used to love timehop. now it's some booty cheeks because it won't finish installing no matter what I do. in addition to that, before I updated, my Twitter posts would not show up when I know for a fact I tweeted because I tweet like a mother buzzer. What is this bologna? I used to love checking this everyday and reminiscing and now my mornings are ruined because I can't see what the flip flop I was doing a year or two ago. Get your horse manure together timehop or else I'm going on a mission to create a knock off version of this app that everyone will switch to and thus end the timehop dynasty. seriously though, I just want to know how drunkenly obnoxious I was on social media a year ago on Halloween so you have a couple days to figure your canoodles out before I talk to corporate and hopefully land a job there so I can fix this bird seed myself."
2064,Me01223456789,"December 26, 2015",2,"The new update is creepy I've enjoyed Timehop. Used to look forward to checking it daily, but the new photos with friends feature that tells me who else has looked at the photo needs to go. It's okay-ish if we are still friends, but let's face it, it's awkward when it's someone who's friendship has since expired. The memory of better times can be nostalgic but knowing that they have viewed the same photo and they now know that you have, too...that's just creepy and unnecessary. Sometimes memories should just be memories. If I want to make sure someone has seen a memory, I'm more than capable of reposting and tagging them in it. (Isn't the the point of the app anyway?!) Until it goes away (or becomes optional) I'm putting Timehop on the cloud and forgetting about it."
2065,Avery Night,"December 22, 2016",1,"It Was Perfectly Fine Before This new format is horrible. It was fine the way it was. I liked being able to scroll up and down, and compare things quickly, and just tap to see the thing in its own screen. The full screen is too in your face and I can't see the captions of my photos. The swiping is also too sensitive and it's way to easy to accidentally swipe or tap the wrong way and have to navigate out of the share menu or swipe twice as many times to go the direction you meant to. Also, because you can't swipe up on the last screen, the pictures for the streak are rendered irrelevant and disappointing. Also, the picture frames for albums is kind of tacky and you can't select individual photos, which kind of defeats the purpose of showing all of the pictures."
2066,DDADUDE,"December 30, 2016",1,"Hate this new update I read app reviews, so thank you to those who post them regularly. I do not write them myself.

2067,Mkail15,"January 23, 2017",1,"Where's the loyalty to your long time users? I know that someone on the TimeHop team worked really hard on this update, and probably all of you felt like it was going to be a ""revolutionary"" update, but your users passionately disagree. I'm sorry that this hasn't been received positively, but it's pretty clear how most of your loyal users feel about this new update. One of the updates after this disaster and drastic changes said ""we appreciate and hear your feedback,"" but you've pretty clear y'all don't care and have no intention on going back to the old layout because probably the biggest complaint from most of your users has been about this full screen ""Snapchat"" crap that just isn't functional for the type of app y'all say you are.

2068,SaraLavaun,"April 29, 2017",1,"Mother Effing TimeHop I'm not one to usually leave reviews, but I HAVE to come give this a 1 star. I literally do not like a single thing about the new UI. I haven't had any glitches to mine like some of the other users, but that doesn't make things okay. The new interface is awful to use. Clicking and swiping through memories somehow takes the nostalgia out of it all. TimeHop was such a cool app because it was its own thing; now it's just a snapchat wannabe. "
2069,lyyynnzzz,"June 14, 2017",4,Bring back the weather feature! With the recent updates I have lost the ability to see comments on Facebook posts or look and the thread of comments on twitter.

I don't think I've ever gotten an sort of ""automated email"" that I routinely opened up every day until Timehop came along. While the email was cool, the glaring thing that had been missing was an app. Now unsurprisingly, it's here! Granted, I've only played around with it for a day, but it seems like it's all that you would hope/expect it to be. Smoth interface, easy to navigate UX, simple sharing, and obviously more full-featured than an email could ever be. Good stuff. Cheers, Timehop Abe and Co!"
2071,ThisMilitaryMama,"May 4, 2015",4,"More like 3 1/2 stars. I LOVE this app!! However, I have cropping issues. I don't like how I have to crop the photo BUT I have also had times where TimeHop post a photo cropped differently then I cropped it, making the photo uneven or cutting this out that I wanted shown. "
2072,Sarah_es,"June 18, 2015",3,"Just one fix While I enjoy TimeHop for the most part, what's causing me to take off 2-stars on the rating is the ""save to camera roll feature."" It simply doesn't work. Sometimes I'll have success and the picture will actually save to my camera roll but 98% of the time, I have to take a screenshot of I want to get the whole picture and not have the square version in the ""share"" frame. Please fix! While it isn't the most serious problem, when I share the photos with older members of my family via text or email I would prefer just having the image to save versus having to screenshot the whole thing and have to explain the picture is so small and explain what TimeHop is!"

2075,Anome20,"December 24, 2016",1,"Terrible update At one point, this app was my all time favorite. But update after update it's just gotten worse. This one, updated the 23rd of December, is by far the worst. It's very similar to Snapchat or Instagram stories format and I'm really not a fan of it. I imagine, like most people these days, most of my photos are square. Since they are trying to mimic the stories format it zooms in and crops the photos trying to force fit them to be portraits, resulting in pixilated and often awkward cropping of photos. You can press and hold to zoom out, but still, I'm really not a fan. I also loved reading comments on old posts, which appears to no longer be an option. If this clunky, copy cat layout is not changed, I will likely delete the app. Be original! Not everything has to be like the stories format."
2076,mgalpin,"December 30, 2016",1,"New Update is Awful It seems I'm not alone in thinking this new update is awful. Every memory lacks the context of what it actually was. One the great things about Timehop was being able to look back on comments and likes; it made the memories funny and meaningful. Now it's basically as simple as scrolling through your own twitter feed or camera roll - I don't need an app to do either of those. Also, every picture is zoomed in on and it looks silly and creates extra work to actually view the memory. No more time stamps and no captions so again what is even the point of having a separate app when I could basically scroll through my social media pages myself. Quit trying to be like snap chat and be your own app. Be useful for what users want you to be. I wish I had never updated üò≠"
2077,jessecolec,"January 4, 2017",1,"Upsetting - Please Listen To Your Users! I never write reviews for apps, in fact this is the first review I've ever written for an app - that says something. This is by far the worst update I've ever received for an app. So much so that I find displeasure in even opening it, whereas before I was excited for my Timehop. The app itself is now so disorganized and repugnant that it gives me literal nausea trying to navigate through it. It's as if no one actually tested the app update before releasing it and anyone who did clearly knows little about design and functionality. This update seems like a downgrade from the previous - a dumb-downed excuse for staying relevant while in turn aging the app and it's capabilities. The old design was simple, but worked very well, please bring back the old Timehop before you lose every one of your customers."
2078,edjmurphy1,"January 16, 2017",2,"Used to be good This app used to be good and I loved being able to see all my history for the day and for years past.  Love the throwbacks.  I also loved the challenge of daily reviews.  I was on my 81st day in a row when something happened.  There is a bug that, when you review your day in the morning, there is a reset of that same day later.  On my 81st day I 'checked in', in the morning and the next day I had an email stating that I had just a little bit more time to check in for the day.  I looked at the app and when I got to the end.... I lost my 81 Day streak.  Every day I have to review and check in twice and there is no way to notify the developer or send feedback.  I'm about done with this app because Facebook now does the same."

The recent updates though have not been good. I appreciate that they are trying to make it more streamline and modern, but they've taken away a lot of the features I liked. For example, I don't know what day of the week it was in those years. They used to have that at the top of each section. Also, if you posted a lot of photos on Facebook, they only show you three of them and there's no way to share them from timehop. Yes you could go to on this day on Facebook but timehop is the main on that I look at. I appreciate that they are trying to make it better, but they need to bring some of the old features back."

I know it's annoying having to take the extra steps, but at least it's still an option. Idk what in the world they were thinking when they changed around the sharing pic options..

When I first got it a while back I wasn't sure I liked it because I often had days with no activity found. Now that I have had social media for a while and a smart phone with a lot of photos on it I love it! With technology these days I often take photos, upload them, and then never see them again but with this app you can relive moments and compare where the years have taken you. How fun! I also love sharing the memories with friends and seeing previous posts too!"

This app is truly amazing and can bring anyone to much joy seeing an old post from years in the past and see what was going on in their lives at that point in time. But what key piece of social media is missing? SNAPCHAT!!! Timehop needs to make an update and converge with snapchat allowing Timehop users to see ONLY THEIR STORIES from the year prior. I mean come on, how awesome would it be to see all of the funny snaps that you've made throughout the year?? I personally use snapchat each and everyday and wish I could see some of the stories I have made in the past. It's stupidly possible just hook it up Timehop."

Having to tap to see each new memory is annoying and inefficient. I enjoyed scrolling down the phone and seeing the progression of memories. Each photo being zoomed in automatically is also strange. Being able to zoom in on a photo is a nice feature itself, but having the photo automatically shown as zoomed in makes no sense. That's a lot of extra work for the user to have to zoom out on ever photo. My tweets and four square check ins are missing. I've checked the settings, and I'm logged in to both accounts like I was before the update. All I see now are photos. Please bring back the old layout. I'm about to delete the app since it's no fun anymore."

I thought, at first, I was just against change, but it's been a minute now and I still feel the same way. Today I wanted to read the caption from an old Insta post. Is there a way to do that? I couldn't figure it out! The caption of that picture was the most important part! And, of course, the weird zoom feature. Why have the pictures auto set to the ratio of my phone when the ratio of an Insta post is usually 1:1? That makes no sense! And I loved being able to scroll through my old posts (the same way I scroll through posts on the actual media sites). I still love the idea of the app and I still use it daily, but it is so annoying now! Please change it, Abe!"

And yes, with the most recent update, my 'Hops' were down for a few days, but now the app is back up and running fine. This is a very fun 'social' app that helps me remember and share what's gone on in my past, and I will certainly continue to use it. Things change, I don't always like change, but it happens, and sometimes it brings amazing things with it. Thank you for your hard work, I hope your app continues to grow with us."

So then I look at it again so as not to lose my daily streak. I'm afraid to not check again!! So why oh why can't timehop suppress the notification for those who already opened for the day??? So frustrating. Update June 20th: although swarm is connected, I've never once seen a swarm memory. Frustrating because I use that app very frequently with pictures and comments."

I like that the app goes further back than one year from today (reminded me to wish my friend a happy anniversary, as iIhad posted three years ago that I was at her wedding!!). The pictures take a while to load, so there is room for improvement in that regard. Otherwise I like the simplicity of the app. "

Somehow I got my twitter archive on there after awhile of not knowing how. Well, recently, I'm not sure how it happened, but it stopped showing my tweets. It told me I was still connected to twitter fine, but I went weeks without having any tweets and I knew for sure that I tweeted last year at least once every day. I disconnected twitter, deleted the app, reinstalled, did everything they told me to do but it still wasn't fixed.  Well this has been going on for almost 2 months and I still haven't figured out what's wrong. I've tried many times to reupload my twitter archive but I can't remember how.

Yes then and now is cool but also you changed the pictures with the 2 years ago on it and now it covers faces. And I know this isn't a big deal but it is to me, we cannot share to our timehop album anymore. And I'm a little ocd about my pictures. I love time hop. Love being able to see everything from years past. But I have an issue. All the pictures I have taken do not show up on my timehop. However they show up on my husbands timehop.

When it finally opens and I can see the whole app, it won't let me scroll normally! I have to have my finger on a post, swipe up and swipe down for it to move and that doesn't even always work. I have tested it multiple times and ways and I cannot scroll normally. I cannot scroll if I'm not on a post, white space doesn't let me scroll. I have tried completely closing and reopening the app and I have restarted my iPad. Nothing. Guess I'll be taking a break from timehop until this is fixed."
2094,BigoteLeal,"March 28, 2015",5,"üë®‚ù§Ô∏èTimehop! This app is truly amazing. It gives you perspective on what your life was really like back in the day, since history tends to get blurry as the years go on. It's also nice to know when significant events in your life ACTUALLY happened; not just when you think they happened. "
2095,Completely random,"September 20, 2015",4,"4stars cause 3's not enough and 5's too many This app is cool if you like to be reminded of all your bonehead status posts. I enjoy seeing the pictures of kids from way back when. what I don't like, is that not every picture loads, most time I want to repost a picture and half of its missing due to timehops monicker plastered on my photo. I get ya's took the trip inter dimensionally (algorithmically) to acquire the photo but what good is it to me if words or faces are covered.  And yes, I'd like to resave it thank- great feature, again can't do that with the logo covering half the photo. So it's nice if you're isolated and nostalgic but not so much if you want to save and share."
2096,Cola86,"November 26, 2015",5,Love the app but.... I really wish you could go back to previous days. For example today is Thanksgiving but since Thanksgiving doesn't fall on the same day every year you can't see all the photos from the holiday on the same day or use them as then and now. For example I would love to grab a picture I took of my son on his first Thanksgiving and do a then and now picture with that one and one I just took of my daughter for her first Thanksgiving. Other than that I love seeing pictures I posted years ago that I've since forgotten about.
2097,Brom24601,"September 15, 2016",3,"Fed up Up until recently I have had no issues with this app, aside from it constantly asking me to reconnect to my Facebook and then when I go to do it it already says I'm connected, but that's not a big deal. What is really bothering me at this point is that I'm getting notified to check my timehop every single day, and half of the time there isn't even anything for it to show me, it just shows a video that has nothing to do with me. I only want to be notified when it's going to show me something from my past, and I'm getting really annoyed by it. I'm considering deleting the app for this reason. Thank you and I would really appreciate any changes that are made"
2098,Jrd_1093,"January 10, 2017",4,"Updates Aren't User-Friendly As you can see by the MONSTROUS one-star review count above, TimeHop is not doing too well. I assume that majority of those reviewers are here because of the recent update, just like me. Don't worry, we aren't just complaining because of change; we have good reason to complain. Photos are zoomed in and confusing, Tweets are cut off after a few words (rendering them useless because you have to leave the TimeHop app to see the rest of the tweet), nothing shows the exact day it was shared/posted, etc. etc. etc. TimeHop, please recognize your mistakes and revert to the classic layout that we all knew and loved."
2099,Snez13,"February 12, 2017",2,"Ugh While I enjoy seeing the past photos (and I really do!), I miss the scrolling format that shows all of the photos. I used to be able to zoom in and easily share. This latest update that now makes you swipe is horrible. It crashes and freezes. It doesn't allow me to see all of the memories (which is what I thought was the sole purpose of the app).  I can't zoom as the pics are frozen in size or they are stuck in frames and are so small I can't see anything. Scrolling was much easier and keeping the pics separate so I can view and zoom was awesome. Now.....it's just meh. On the times when I can actually see the detail in the pics, I like the app. More often than not, it's aggravating. Fix this please!"
2100,MarMoMar,"July 23, 2016",5,"Calm yourselves I have had Time Hop for about a year, maybe two. And I absolutely love it. I did the recent update and it is crashing like everyone else's. This is the first time I can recall having a major issue. Compared to other apps I have, that is really good to only have one major issue. I deleted it and reinstalled it and it works just fine. To the people giving the app terrible reviews because of this issue: please put your phone down and go pet a puppy or eat a taco or something to calm you down because you don't need to stress over a phone app."
2101,nicityy,"December 25, 2016",2,"No I've had timehop since a little around a few months after it was developed. Over the course, updates got better, and app was easier to use. However, this recent update is the crappiest thing ever. It does not let me log out of any of my accounts, it used to let me click on the twitter or Facebook badge and bring me into the app- it does not that that anymore. Everything is already zoomed in, and since I never  posted 1 thing once a day (because who does??) I have to click like 50 times. It's pointless to zoom in/zoom out, save any of the posts (I never did anyways). It's only a 2 star review for applause from the past. Change it back. -incredibly unhappy goer. P.S. Thank you for wasting 200+ days of my life!!!"
2102,SimonDMB,"December 25, 2016",1,"Worst. Update. EVER! This recent update is complete garbage. Problem 1: All the photos are zoomed in by default so that you can only see a tiny part of it. If that's all I wanted to see if it, I would have posted it that way in the first place. Problem 2: It shows the comment I made on a link that I shared WITHOUT SHOWING THE LINK THAT I SHARED! Now my comment has me scratching my head and wondering what the heck it's in reference to. Problem 3 (and the worst problem of all): Where did all the likes and comments go? Half the fun of looking back on what I posted is reading the reactions to it. But then that makes sense since it seems like the entire purpose of this update is to remove all of the joy from the Timehop experience. I won't be using the app until those three issues are fixed. Way to blow it, Abe."
2103,Wiscogirl21,"December 25, 2016",1,"New update is completely AWFUL! If I could give this update zero stars I would. I'm not looking for a snapchat layout when I'm trying to look through my photo/post history. If I wanted that I would go to snapchat. On top of the completely crappy update is that it constantly freezes, loads extremely slow, and closes out causing me to start all from the beginning. I don't want to see my ""year ago"" 3 times just to view my two years ago. I gave this new update a few tries and I will not be able to get used it. I don't know if I'm the only one that does this but I do not click on every single photo that has been posted on that day. I will not be using this App until they fix this monstrosity of an update. Because of this I will be loosing my 400+ day streak I was on."

2107,emmusee4,"January 23, 2017",3,"Better, but not the best Look, after a month with this new layout & its subsequent updates I don't mind it so much anymore. Now I actually do enjoy having the ability to zoom in on my pictures, especially since they don't auto-zoom anymore. I just want to know what on earth is up with those weird little collections of photos that flip through each picture every 0.1 second like a GIF, yet you can't view each photo individually in any way without digging back into your camera roll. I know it's not for bursts because I've had these pseudo-GIFs happen for totally unrelated pictures before. I just want to be able to see ALL my photos!"
2108,Falingleaf999,"June 18, 2017",3,Still not great but better I see that everyone else hates the update so I won't spend time going into too much detail. Awful. The scrolling was way better. I also hate that I can no longer see what my likes and comments were on photos/statuses.
2109,colinlord,"August 8, 2017",1,"Terrible New Direction Timehop's new app reminds me of when Foursquare decided they knew better than their users a few years ago. Rather than focus on the check-in game people liked, they threw all their weight behind recommendations which people weren't as interested in. They killed their user base and have never fully recovered from that mistake."
2110,Tattoodwaitress,"October 28, 2014",5,"Greatest app EVER Seriously there are so many apps out there that are totally useless and irritating, but this isn't one of them. It does what it says and more.... The more is.... it brings me not only memories, but can tug at the heart strings, make me laugh, bring me joy and motivate me... All depending upon the time we hopped to that day. It also educates with a bit of trivia. There are so many ways to connect to your memories and the sharing ability is a plus. THANKS for fixing the ""bugs""... And for not having any stinking ads that ruin the experience. I'd give it ten stars if possible... I love it!!!"
2111,Whitneyc103,"May 4, 2015",4,My favorite app! I love waking up and checking my time hop before the kids wake up and seeing all of the sweet things they said or looking at their once tiny baby faces before all hell breaks loose for the day lol. My only problem is when sharing I only have the text option at the bottom. And I think you should be able to move the timehop logo to another spot because a lot of the time it covers a face or something else important in the picture so I can't really share them. Just a suggestion. I did the newest update since he said it would fix sharing bugs but it didn't seem to fix mine
2112,Brwnhrdblnd,"December 28, 2015",2,"Great app for a stalker I genuinely used to love this app. Until it gave me this new option where all photos that are tagged with others appear at the top and it tells you when they've viewed the photo as well. WHO CARES. I also finding exceptionally irritating that the app can be Creepy McCreeper, but if I open it before a certain time I still get a notification that my ""timehop is ready to view!"" I've literally closed the app after viewing my memories to have that notification pop up. I thought I outsmarted it by turning notifications off, but no such luck. So this app is perfect for keeping track of your friends' activities and viewing history and for being incessantly persistent about making sure you view it."
2113,lsg1,"April 2, 2016",3,"Get rid of the banners! This app is not bad.  It is set up to do exactly one thing and it does that, not too badly.  However, the puerile banners that periodically appear are really off-putting.  On a post about reaching a destination ""That'll do Pig, that'll do"".   Really?   One post labeled ""Shortest post of 2010 - it wasn't , by a long shot - and then at the end - ""Well that was enlightening.""   I would suspect a 6-year old got at it but really reads more like teenage boys, especially with the comments from other users about offensive terminology.   I like the dip back in time and I will continue to use this, but I don't need their brand of humor attached.  Let me opt out of that and I'd give it at least one more star."
2114,nataliee23,"December 23, 2016",1,"Why? If I could rate no stars that'd be my vote. The new update is ridiculous in the worst way possible. The functionality is atrocious. The swiping and large font for each status is overkill. You can barely figure out if your past status is from Facebook, Twitter or what. Also picture tweets don't show the text that went along with it, just pictures. And Facebook statuses/comments used to show if people commented or how many people liked them which was nice to look back on. Mostly every tweet I've seen about this new update is negative and I'm glad I'm not the only one. I really hope they take into consideration these reviews because Timehop is a special app I want to keep, but this update makes it extremely difficult and extremely likely I will end up deleting."
2115,lauramarie_21,"December 26, 2016",1,"No foursquare? Wish I could un-update I don't still use foursquare but I did, religiously, for years and I LOVED that Timehop gave me almost a glimpse into a diary. Seeing my check-ins over the course of a day enabled me to remember quite vividly where I went and what I did on a specific day. No longer supporting foursquare seems pointless. The only thing this app now gives me (since I deactivated my Facebook) is my one and two year old photos in my phone which I can easily access without this app. I also dislike the full screen photos, tapping to get through everything, not viewing in a list... pretty much everything about this new update I detest and unless foursquare is given back I will be deleting this app that I have had on my phone (and enjoyed) since it very first came out."

2117,BMruth,"January 12, 2017",1,"Please go back!!!!!!! I loved using timehop before, but with this new update, I struggle to see even the simplest of memories. For starters, all of my pictures start out super zoomed in, so for every one, I have to zoom out just to get a clue of what it is. Also, for pictures that are longer than the length of an iPhone screen, I can't scroll through the picture. How does that make sense. I get that apps have to update over time, but why try to fix a layout that wasn't broken at all? Please go back to the old layout, because you struck out with this one."
2118,Ash-eh-lee,"January 13, 2017",1,"Do not update!! I would have given it 5 stars before the update but this update is garbage so 1 star it is. It's crazy difficult to navigate. It's frustrating to use. It sounds simple in concept because they're trying to be like Snapchat, but the new format doesn't show full Facebook posts unless you try to swipe up to save (which is so temperamental and takes 5 minutes just to save a freaking picture) and it's so easy to accidentally click to the next page and get stuck in a crazy cycle where you are just flipping through everything and not able to read it! Not to mention they took away all the cute filters and add ons for when you do save it. Love timehop, but honestly I wish I could go back in time and uninstall this update. Such garbage."
2119,Snomom6,"April 6, 2017",1,"Update Ruined App The zoomed in pic and needing to tap and hold to see the full pic is ridiculous. Text is separated from pic and blocked in color...terrible.  New scrolling and way of posting...terrible.  It's all terrible and has completely taken the joy out of checking and using this app.  Did the developers actually open the app to see what their update did to the app?  I used to look for to checking the app daily, but no longer care to."
2120,madimiles,"April 8, 2014",4,"I love this app! I'm one of those sappy nostalgic people, so I love being able to see my old social media posts. Sharing those old posts is super easy, too. The one thing about the app that makes me sad is the gap at night that the feed doesn't show anything. I'm abroad now and often find myself checking the app in the middle of what would be the night back home and the next day hasn't been published yet. My one improvement suggestion would be a time zone awareness that makes it easy to check your old posts no matter the time of day. Overall, though, this app facilitates my sappy nostalgic tendencies!"
2121,ZainKho,"July 28, 2014",2,"Facebook Only?!? Okay so I got this app after hearing all the buzz and I was, well, kind of disappointed. The first screen asks you to sign in to Facebook. I, being a person who refuses to abide by the rules of society by getting a Facebook, searched if there was another way to log in. The FAQ for Timehop says that they are a startup company (not anymore if you ask me) and only go through Facebook. I don't want to seem like I'm complaining or anything, but they will lose some people as users if they can't integrate other services for logging in (you can integrate other social media, but only after you sign in through Facebook). I hope the developers really change this rule and allow other social media integration for logging in."
2122,Vdjsk,"December 21, 2014",4,Most looked at App! I really do look forward to seeing what's on my TimeHop everyday! I don't think that there has been an app that I actually do look at on a regular basis!
2123,PleasedPicturePoster,"March 17, 2015",5,"A blast from your past! That's what you will get when you use this app. Sync it to your FB or IG accounts, as well as several others, and see posts from your past. I have 2 young children and post lots of pictures of them but after after a while forget the pictures I've posted of them over time. So I really love to open up TimeHop and see pictures of my babies from previous years. It's so fun to see how much they have changed and thanks to TimeHop I get to see that on a daily basis! I love this app and would recommend it to anyone."
2124,Aduelist,"July 27, 2015",5,Love going back in time This app is one of my favorite apps. I love going back in time and seeing things that I've forgotten and even the things I wish I had forgotten. I think you learn more from your mistake than your successes. It's also great when you have little kids you can see how much they've changed and then show them. This is like having a family album in your hand at all time. It's so much easier than the old family albums that I grew up with. Plus you're able to share them with friends and family.
2125,Willsmomma102,"September 6, 2015",4,Worth the space I really like this app. I am not sure it is always accurate with the dates. I think sometimes it is off by a day or two.

2126,EmilyUCF1,"December 23, 2016",5,"New update/format changes are horrible Every picture is arbitrarily WAY zoomed in, so you have to zoom out of nearly everything.  The text is white on white background but highlighted in a light teal which makes it both look bad and hard to read.  They also took away the ability to see the Facebook comments & likes on pictures and posts, which I always greatly enjoyed reading.  I have always LOVED this app, but I'm not sure I'll be using it anymore unless they change things back/for the better."

It was easy to use, had a nice, clean look, and was a simple way to remember what I was doing on this day in past years. But this new update is absolutely HORRENDOUS! Pictures are blown up and don't contain their corresponding text or captions (at least that I could find). The new way to move through posts is hit or miss. And every time I launch the app it insist on giving me a tutorial on how to use it. I'm hoping for an update to clear some of these things up. Otherwise, bye-bye, Timehop."
2128,saradems,"January 13, 2017",5,"Great app ruined by a mysterious update I will never understand why developers take perfectly good, functional apps and then decide to release ""updates"" that destroy usability and remove features. It just makes no sense. Was the company bought by an enemy who decided to destroy the app in revenge? Or what? This used to be a fun, cool app. Now it is barely usable and a bunch of my photos won't even show up! How about including an option for people to use the ""old"" view or ""new"" view and look at what people choose when they have the option?"
2129,Briana_joe,"February 27, 2017",2,"New timehop I like that it gives you the option to view the whole photo instead of just the square one cutting out half the photo. However, I do not like the new version. I wish now and then was still there, that it would bring up all my photos. I preferred the scrolling to go threw memories rather thing sliding threw one big photo at a time. I also upload a lot of pictures at once, when it come to these where it usually shows them as a little clip show where you can't save or share individual pictures which is a bummer. Once in a while it puts a few pictures on one page in little frames with the same deal as well... over all I just preferred the original timehop."
2130,Docbar803,"January 30, 2015",3,"The update dropped it at least a star. Great idea. It works with very few bugs. However, the update is frustrating. It asks you to crop the photo, and it won't post in the original size. So, often the photo is missing parts. Also, it places a little banner over the photo, proclaiming it was however many years ago and time hop. Awesome, except it obscure the photo. Why not just keep putting them in the timehop album created by the earlier version? Then and now is ok, could take or leave it but can see why some would like it. Also, it's a pain that it opens the fb app instead of posting right from timehop. Please restore the earlier version."
2131,Capt nitro,"February 10, 2015",2,"Quit screwing up my pictures!!!!! It's fun to see what happened on Facebook on this day in history, but this app does a crap job of it. It's more convenient than constantly scrolling through my Timeline looking for this day a year ago, which is why I still give it two stars. But the things it does to my pictures annoy the hell out of me. Sometimes, it doesn't even post the picture, sometimes it cuts off part of the picture, which may contain something important. "

The change you have made is causing pictures that we share to FB to have to be cropped and this is NOT a good feature. I do not share as much because we are losing most of our pictures. We should not have to crop them unless we need to. It should be OUR choice to crop, not made too.

This app fills a gap no other has gone for, and I think it's frickin awesome. One suggestion: make it possible to adjust how far back the app reaches? Some friends of mine also love the app, but were in a very different place, you know, five, six, seven years ago and would rather not be reminded of those times. "

With my ex... No thanks! I'm about to delete the app because it continually shows me pictures of me and my ex lol... I don't have time to delete all of those posts on Facebook so it would be an awesome feature to be able to block people tagged in your posts/photos from appearing in your time hops."

The first major thing that needs to be added immediately is so you can see on your Timehop how many favorites (or likes), or retweets you got on a tweet. This feature would be beneficial because then I can remember how popular the tweet is and I think everyone would like that. "

Each morning I catch up on emails and look for the latest news before getting out of bed, Timehop is a part of that routine. I can honestly say I enjoyed reading old comments and seeing old photos (especially of my kids). It has also been a great reminder of exciting times in my life (most recently college graduation). But sadly, all photos now show in portrait, even when originally taken in landscape. Commentary is gone and while a picture is great, having the reminder of why you took it is sometimes needed, not to mention the banter that may have occurred as a result. "

Then the next day I'll have the notification just like in the last bit I'll have lost my streak and was not able to see the previous days memories.

Firstly, since the latest update, you can post a picture, but can no longer post the original text from the caption unless you retype it. That's frustrating. Secondly, you guys have GOT to develop a version for iPad, or at VERY least work out the bugs so that the iPhone version is usable on iPad. Thirdly, the timing of the daily refresh is weird. I can log on at 2 am or so, and my Timehop from the previous day will still be displayed. Again, I truly love this app.  It just is occasionally frustrating to use."

The app has always loaded very fast for me, I've read reviews of people saying the app is slow but I've never experienced it being slow. My only complaint is that it will show I have pictures from a year or two ago that I shared or took with iCloud, but the picture doesn't show, it's just a big blank white square & no matter what I do I can't get the pictures to show, not even sharing the timehop thing makes it show. Other than that I've liked the app a lot."

Timehop is a simple app with a simple premise, yet it offers so many ways to use, customize and share the data that it easily stacks up to the more immersive apps on the market. The UI is intuitive, easy to use, and beautifully designed by a team with an obvious attention to detail. Extras like frames, stickers, side-by-side comparison, and historical trivia keep the experience fresh enough for daily use. The sharing functionality never feels coerced. Overall, this is a fun and useful little app that I see myself using for years to come."

I know there are apps specifically for that, but I ask you- do those apps have adorable little dinosaurs acting out what's going on??? Nope. Time Hop does though. "

Went and checked facebook since it shows you ""memories"" for the day in the past and I had posted TONS of things. I deleted and reinstalled the app and it worked fine for the next few days, got the new update and it worked for two days and now it's back to telling me I haven't posted anything but if I go to facebook there's at least 10 posts."
2145,DrewbieQ,"July 9, 2016",4,"Options I'd like to be offered the option to pay a small yearly fee to opt out of seeing ads within the app. The Weather Channel app has this feature and it's the best $3.99 annually I've ever spent. I absolutely LOATHE ads in this app. It's almost enough to make me stop using TimeHop altogether and focus on Facebook's built-in ""This Day in History"" feature."
2146,Guillermo Esteves,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible UI I'm not one to have a knee-jerk reaction to app updates, so I gave the most recent update a chance to grow on me, but this new Snapchat-like UI just doesn't work for the kind of content in Timehop. It really doesn't work for anything other than portrait photos; for things like landscape photos you can only see a small blurry fraction of the photo, and then you have to tap and hold just to see the thing you're trying to look at. That, and tapping to advance makes it so it takes so long to look through the content, especially when you have over 7 years of it, that I just can't be bothered with it. It was so much easier when it was just a long list you could quickly scroll and scan. I'm really disappointed by this update."
2147,Stupidnickname57,"January 9, 2017",3,"Hate the update This new update makes Timehop just awful! I loved that I used to be able to read old comments from Facebook posts, pick out neat frames went I posted something, do 'Then and now' posts, now I can't do any of that and the update just feels so impersonal! Please fix this! I have an over 200 day streak because I love going and seeing my memories but this new update has me wanting to delete the app!"
2148,GigiPotts,"January 11, 2017",3,New update is terrible! I loved my Timehop but the new update is very unfriendly. There are pages with multiple pictures that are so small you can't see them and you can't share or zoom in. 
2149,Cray Z,"January 18, 2017",1,"Update is STILL terrible! The new update is absolutely terrible. Now, I can't see captions with pictures. The format is terrible. Whoever came up with this idea should be fired because you're losing users with this poor design. Change it back to the way it was!"
2150,DLM-Gir,"August 21, 2014",5,"Goes above and beyond So I downloaded the app, after seeing some friends use it on Instagram and Facebook, and I understood the gist of it; Seeing old stuff you posted on that specific day. However, it's done in such a cute and endearing way, with a loveable mascot who also gives you a history fact, included with artwork, and motivational expressions or cute one-liners. The app also is set up really nice and looks great. The only improvement I can even suggest is being able to see comment and likes on old posts, but otherwise it is fantastic!"
2151,Piscesxloner,"September 7, 2014",3,"It's okay... I've deleted and re-downloaded this app a few times. It's very awesome, and I love the concept; however, I wish I could change the date to view because I don't check this every day so if I don't have time I miss out on a lot, and I think that's unfair. I want to be able to see things from the past without being so restricted. I also don't like the fact that they email you every single day to remind you. It's spammy and I don't like always having a notification that I have a new email when really it's like 10 of the same from companies who like to email the crap out of you over an app you got rid of weeks ago."
2152,TheUnicornFairy,"November 27, 2014",5,What an extraordinary app to have thought to create! Who would have thought that this idea could be so awesome and useful! It's a way to keep your ideas alive years later! It's a way to reflect on your past and see how far you've come- how different it is now! There are many things about this app that make it so cute! The dinosaur with his little sayings and how he includes me in stuff he says is just too adorable! Not to mention the animated scroll-down refreshment of the page! This is a great app and a great idea! I look forward to each new day!
2153,Em R.,"January 12, 2016",3,"I love the concept but there should be changes made. As I said before the concept of looking at what you did a year+ ago is truly awesome! I've had Instagram since 2010 so it's great to see it in one place. However, I have two Instagrams so it would be cool to see what I posted on both. Second I enjoyed the ""this day in history"" fact, it was neat to know major history. Third I have a Flickr account that I upload images to (sort of like a Dropbox) it would be great to have that included in time hop! Over all I enjoy this app but it would be great to have suggestions answered! Especially since us, the users, are in fact the ones using the app!"
2154,Dagan2278,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update brings more bugs After my phone automatically updated Timehop I was excited to use it because there was so much wrong with the old version that I figured, it can't get much worse, right? WRONG!! I can't even open the app now because it won't load. It's perpetually staying on the load screen and failing every time I tap ""Retry."" And that's not even the beginning of the problems I have with it. Apparently now every picture or video memory is extremely zoomed in and you have to flip through everything individually? Who thought of that terrible idea? I liked the layout before, but I just wanted the bugs to be fixed. This is a terrible app, and if I can't get past the load screen in the next few days, I'll be deleting it."
2155,mani whaaat‚Ñ¢,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update ruining app for me I'll preface with the fact that I am a longtime user and NEVER rate apps, but this app really ruined the app for me. Every morning I love looking through my Timehop, but noticed in the last update, my tweets and comments were cut off. I was eager to update it today when it said bug fixes will be dealt with but I was so disappointed to see that everything I had loved about this app has changed. I hate how the photos are zoomed in, and how you can't see the captions on them. What is the point of the photo if you can't even see the caption?! I hate that tap to go back and forward feature that Snapchat rolled out...leave it to Snapchat honestly. I'm hoping that this will go back to its old features - it was much more enjoyable and organized."
2156,NatashaR7,"December 24, 2016",1,"Hate new update The new update is the worst!  Having to tap through to get through all of your photos, especially if you take a lot, is very annoying and time-consuming. As a mother, I would want to go back and see events such as first Christmas eve, however, by the time I'm halfway there, I have already given up and quit.  With the last version being able to scroll through and see the photos was easier and more efficient. Also having to pinch down the photos to see the entire image just stupid. Apparently your coders have nothing else to do but to mess with an app that was already user friendly as it was. I doubt I'll be using this app anymore in the future. Way to go!  I'd have left 0 stars if possible.  Very disappointed."

2158,Scallawag939,"May 3, 2017",1,Ugh This used to be so simple. The app would pull my posts from various social media and I would have a nice laugh. Now I just cry. 
2159,Minispiney,"June 15, 2017",5,"Bring back the old version! More updates and some small improvements, but it's still 50% of what it used to be. I have Facebook connected. Looking at Facebook ""On this day"" today shows four entries. Timehop shows one of them. Biggest issue: where did Swarm/Foursquare go?  It's connected , but nothing ever shows up. Just roll back to the version before the ""improvements"" and try again. No one likes new Timehop. Even Coke abandoned New Coke before it sunk the company. Are Timehop too proud to admit this has been a horrible mistake?"
2160,Lisaboston33,"February 8, 2015",1,"Used to love it I've had this app on my 4s for about a year and always loved it. It was a simple app, not trying to do too much. Yes it would cut off added comments to pictures so when i posted to facebook i would just add a comment through fb instead. That was until recently. Somewhere among their many software updates, it became a requirement to have the facebook app to share on facebook. I do not have, nor do i want that app. I was always able to share just through my account and that was fine. According to timehop im still connected to my fb account so why cant i just share?? Very frustrating that in order to continue using one app its forcing you to download and use another. I'll be deleting timehop, its off no use now if i cant share."
2161,Panda_x_Lover,"February 19, 2015",4,"One thing. My pictures is not in the date I posted a year ago, I went to the settings to see if I could fix the date but I couldn't. My timeshop is in October and December but I'm sitting here in February? I'm not sure if it's a bug or not but I normally post humor and I can rember when I posted that. But today I noticed that my Mamaw Carrens funeral was one year ago. NO!! It's not it even says on the card Died December 11th 2013 and that the service was December 16th 2013. Also it has different post I put on a different times that wasn't 1 year ago. It's got my photos mixed up... I'd like the next update to fix this PLEASE!!!!"
2162,Appreviewghostwriter,"April 27, 2015",5,"Memories are like the wind! In such a busy world we live in, we tend to forget the important things in life. Memories are there but we often forget to look back on them or don't make the time to do so.  This app brings you back to some of the happier times and perhaps some of the not so happy times in your life; but nonetheless- it an awesome reminder at showing you some really fun times passed. (Why wouldn't it, you took the pictures!) I look forward to what this app shows me everyday especially since losing someone very close to me!"
2163,RainyaMosher,"May 20, 2015",4,"More Control for a 5 star rating Finally jumped on the timehop wagon a couple months ago and it's been great fun to look back, especially as I've got 6 years of social post an a 10 year old daughter. The pics of her from age 4 do my heart good!"
2164,Pbadkins,"June 26, 2015",4,"Fun, yet slightly annoying. Timehop is fun, and it's a good trip down nostalgia lane. It even warned me on Valentine's Day of potentially dangerous past valentines. Plus everything is formatted well. No issues there. "
2165,JuicyJor,"December 5, 2015",5,"I love it, but.. when I deleted my Facebook he continued on showing me my old posts that I would've posted X amount years ago from that day which was pretty awesome but when I deleted my Twitter it only gave me a few days after I deleted my Twitter that it would show me my old tweets but once my Twitter was deleted for good it no longer showed me my old tweets I reacted my Facebook so it still shows me all of my old posts on there but I'd also like posted on Twitter. so don't get your hopes up if you plan on deactivating any of your social media"
2166,0325sarahmarie,"December 25, 2015",3,"Photos with friends I love the idea of timehop. I used to really look forward to seeing it. But I could really do without the new photos with friends feature. I don't care if my friends saw the picture. If I do, I'll share it and re tag them. It only creates duplicates to scroll through because the same pictures are then below all the tagged content. I like the album view where I can scan a handful of pictures at once and decide if I care to look at any. I don't want to scroll past every stupid drunken photo ever taken 7 years ago. Hint: 20y/o girls post a lot of useless pictures they won't care about tomorrow. Let alone next year. Or five."
2167,Mekababy89,"October 19, 2016",4,It's a great app. I check this app faithfully every single morning around 7:30am when I get home from work. I look forward to the things that Timehop has to show me from years ago that happened on this certain day. I just wish there was a way you could browse through all of your archives from all the days you've checked your Timehop. Like when you've checked it 100 times in a row I think it would be cool for you to be able to go back to say like the 30th day and see what you were doing. Just a suggestion other than that I absolutely love this app üôåüèæüòçüíï
2168,Thisgirldana,"December 27, 2016",5,Update has ruined the app Timehop is the only app I use every day and I've always looked forward to it. The last update however has turned a bright spot in the day to an annoyance. The pictures are so zoomed in and I feel like I have to fight with the screen so much to see one picture that it's not even worth it to scroll through my entire history for that day. The whole structure of the app has changed in a very bad way. 
2169,og95,"April 30, 2017",1,"no Awful, been awful since the update around christmastime... If I upload 100 photos to Facebook, I don't want to have to swipe past 100 photos... So I swipe really fast and it starts freaking out and locks up my phone, it's done this 2 times now. The ads are annoying as crap, I'm not looking to buy something every second of my life. Maybe if you went back to the old version, you wouldn't need the ad revenue to pay your employees overtime to fix  bugs and come up with more pointless updates every week. But you probably still would since every time you release an update, it gives you a clean slate and reviews are reset. You're never going to get past 2 stars with the crap you've pulled the last 6 months. Fix it now."

I know you guys round dates, its never EXACTLY said amount of years ago. So clearly, you should be able to find SOME POST from 1-3 years ago to post on my timehop. What's the point of this app taking up my phone storage if you're not showing me anything, the majority of the time? This has only begun recently as well, which makes NO sense because I started posting A LOT of photos within the past few years. So why don't you show me any of them? All I see is boring crap I posted when I was a child.  "
2172,Themba's mom,"January 8, 2016",1,"Year in review needs to go The year in review thing needs to go. It is not friendly to those with migraine and/or seizure disorders. There is no way for people to avoid these posts on social media. The pictures move so fast in these posts that to a brain with the above mentioned disorders it is equivalent to a strobe light and triggers medical conditions to occurs. Depending on the severity of the persons condition will depend on the severity of the response to seeing on of these posts. I personally have some conditions that these posts trigger and I've had enough of suffering, getting sick, being sick for hours/days, all because your company thought they made some cool thing when in fact they are hurting the disabled.

I can just go through my camera roll, scroll back on my twitter or Facebook account to see pasts statuses or pictures. There's no reason for the wasted space with this app. I do not want to feel like this because Timehop has been a favorite of mine but trying to ""keep up with the joneses"" is ruining everything Timehop stands for. I'll wait for a new update where we can view comments and likes again but I'm only giving it a week....."
2174,Lee Loo,"January 4, 2017",5,"Zero stars I'm a UX designer and know how it is to release a new version of an app and have the users hate it at first. Best practice is to have tons of user research and user testing that backs up your decisions when making changes to an app. I honestly couldn't see anyone wanting the features that have been added to this update. Listen to your users, get rid of pain points, and at least offer a way to use the old app. "
2175,Cheflady00,"January 7, 2017",5,"New update is horrible!! I use to love opening my Timehop app every morning. It was so awesome to see pics of my (now grown up) babies and all the crazy comments I made over the years. This new update where you scroll over pages- I find it terrible. I can never reveal my whole post and it blows the picture up so large, it doesn't fit the screen. Sadly, I'm getting better ""this time in history"" pics when I open my Facebook page. I really liked your app before the update. New isn't always better..."
2176,momof2gitls,"January 13, 2017",1,"What Happened!!! Loved the app up until this last update.  I don't know why they thought this would be easier or sleeker.  It is horrible!   When you open you can't see the whole post on the page.  It is a hundred percent bigger than the page and when you try to move it down or zoom out, it turns the page.  Also instead of seeing all your post from the last few years on one page, you have to swipe over and over again. And it is so touchy that it bounces back and forth between pages.  My last complaint is that you can see the original post but if there was a picture attached, it is no where to be found.  "
2177,BertaWhite,"March 29, 2017",3,"Fiddlesticks The app hasn't let me collect memories in a few days. It keeps saying ""collecting memories"", spinning then I get ""Oh fiddlesticks"" pop up, basically with error. I don't know why, I've tried turning off and resetting my phone and logging out then back in to the app itself and still nothing is working. I was on a 100+ (almost 200) day streak and began having issues shortly thereafter. I'm a little confused because I love getting my memories on Timehop better than just the new ""Facebook Memories"" because it provides more- showing Twitter, Instagram and my pictures on my phone itself. Any suggestions? Other than that I love Timehop!"

Maybe a picture from iCloud, but that would be it. No IG stories, FB posts, nothing. Still can't get it to work. Now, some days I will get iCloud photos, which I take every day, but yesterday there were none, today I can't see anything because it's constantly trying to load. The ads are fine, but they can't load my photos. I used to think it was fun to see how many days streak I could get. I'm up to 140 but with nothing to see..... tried contacting support, no response.

2179,Purdue4321,"July 30, 2017",1,"Why bother updating? You all continue to ignore your users with these useless updates. Why even bother. When you're continuously receiving the worst ratings in the App Store, it's time to reconsider and go back to square one. The scrolling version of the app was way simpler and more streamlined. Now it's a clunky, complicated mess that isn't enjoyable to do. I used to love looking at timehop, now it's a tedious task. If your goal was to get users to stay on the app longer to see more ads, congrats you've all succeeded. What used to be a simple scroll through now takes too long.  Too bad in the long run this will lead to more unhappy consumers and less users. I'd rather pay a small some for a streamlined, clean, ad free version of this app than the crap we have now."

I sync'd my timehop with my external hard drive where we store all our photos BC timehop made it so easy to do that with their desktop app, so occasionally I get a 10yrs ago and 15yrs ago. My only grip is that with the most recent update they removed the ability to do a then and now option. I loved this and used it often to show how my daughter was growing or pictures together with long time friends. Please bring it back."

It's clunky, confusing, unnecessary, and it makes scrolling through your ""memories"" unappealing. Everything is zoomed in, the fonts are huge (it's almost like I'm viewing it on accessibility mode). I don't know why they changed it from a list option, where I could scroll through all my memories at once and easily compare the years prior. This makes the ""On This Day"" Facebook option more appealing now. Please change it back, or at least give us the option to choose whether we want a list view, or this clunky view which I'm pretty sure is incredibly unpopular based on the 1-star rating. Thanks."
2182,Mancyd10,"December 31, 2016",1,"Fire the team or whoever came up the the most recent update I am normally not one to write a review good or bad, however whomever (individual and/or team) came up with this current version AND everyone who approved and applauded their creation needs to be relieved of their duties immediately. This is the absolute WORST ""update"" I've ever experienced. It's one thing to continually improve an app, but to just completely mar it beyond recognition and function is beyond me. This app absolutely defeats the purpose of itself. Why on earth would you exclude ALL of the likes and comments from pictures and status updates and have them defaulted to be so zoomed in?! I understand trying to rip off SnapChat and TRY to emulate their success, but please stop and update this app again."
2183,heatherable,"January 2, 2017",5,"Timehop update I'm so sad that this app was ruined. I used it every day--it was my guilty pleasure to check in every morning. For me, it's not that you now tap to go forward. I'm ok with that. I don't understand why anyone would ever want to zoom out on a photo. That's weird. But perhaps the worst for me--I'm literally not seeing my photos or memories. Probably 70% of my moments are gray screen, almost as though the photo won't load...I've been patient and waited (and waited), and still the photos won't load. Please fix this. I loved Timehop!!"
2184,Jen_X82,"January 4, 2017",1,"Zero Stars. I don't normally do the whole ""review"" thing. But I really needed to see if I was alone in my thoughts about the recent update. I'm pleased to see I'm not, but it's sad to see so many 1 star reviews and yet nothing has been done about it. The only reason I haven't deleted the app altogether is because I still use it to see Twitter posts. But now I use Facebook's feature ""on this day"" for all Facebook posts. Like people said, the best part was seeing the comments and likes, why do away with those? Why make the pictures from FB & Instagram SO zoomed in? It's obnoxious. The whole thing is incredibly stupid and not as user friendly as it once was. I get that it's a free app but clearly this change was not needed and has angered a lot of your users."
2185,The-Goof,"January 19, 2017",5,"No More Auto Zooming Pictures! While I am not the biggest fan of the new layout and how the app works, I'm happy that in the most recent update, Timehop doesn't auto zoom on my pictures from my camera roll which forced me to zoom out with my fingers every time. With the newest update, the pictures are no longer auto zooming in! My Timehop has not loaded a couple times but glitches are expected with a new layout update in my mind. I definitely wouldn't mind going back to the old layout."

Please go back to the old simple version of just scrolling down, it was way better and easier to share. There were times where if there was a group of pictures it would only let me share the first one but now it just does the weird flashing thing between them and I can't share either of them. Very disappointed and looking for another better app."
2187,Mrsbacon06,"January 24, 2017",1,"Horrible Updates I have never written a review for any app ever before now, but the recent updates to timehop have left me with no choice. I used to love this app. It was so much fun to scroll down through pictures from years ago and have the option of sharing them with my friends. Now I have to see each picture individually? If I was that dedicated to finding an old picture to share I'd just look through my phone or google drive. Not that it really matters because I can't share anything with this app anymore. Every time I try the stupid thing just crashes. I've been unable to use the app for days now. Pointless. If these issues aren't addressed I'll just delete it. Right now it's just using up storage space on my phone."

I want to send an individual pictures but this stupid gif feature of photos taken at the same time won't let me even look at one without it scrolling nonstop! I can't even put fun filters on my shared photos anymore. Whenever I try to zoom in on a picture because half of it is cut off (I have an iPhone 6) it just flips to the next picture. I also used to be able to view comments and likes within the app...another great feature that's now gone. 
2189,Haileyusher,"June 23, 2017",4,"Just a thought I usually don't review on things but I love Timehop so I figured I'd give a little input. It's sometimes really difficult to see different pictures that were posted in twitter and that makes a lot of my throwback tweets hard to understand. The links to the pictures don't work 80% of the time and that's very frustrating. Also I think there should be a way to do a ""then & now"" on a picture where you can add to a previous ""then & now"". I'd love to see how certain things change from year to year rather than just once. Just an idea!"
2190,Wiznocks,"January 29, 2015",4,"Nice Nostalgia App Timehop fulfills that narcissistic niche of seeing what words and pictures of wisdom you graced the world by displaying all your social media posts on that day. Although most of the time you'll find your hand in your face looking at the silly things you've posted. But it is interesting to see how you've grown and changed over the years. As Socrates said ""know thyself"" and this app definitely helps with that goal. However, sometimes the notifications tell you to check your timeline for the day when you've already checked it, only reason I'm marking down a star."

2195,Uff-Da Shuff-da,"December 25, 2016",1,"Only Snapchat can be Snapchat All I can say is ""ouch"", this update really turned me off to using the app. One of the things I enjoyed was to look at all my posts and see how I have changed, however now this it is impossible to do this and it is a strain to view even one post as all of them are massive. The tutorial for the new layout is also shown EVERY time I open the app so i have to scroll through 5 pages before I get to my actual content. I went to settings (took me 5 whole minutes to find it again) and it looks like there is no way to turn it off. I hope that the next update, even if the style is kept, brings a more user friendly interface and now every time I look at the app I have no desire to open it."

Before, I could just scroll down past an album of 500 pictures, but now I have to swipe image by image, most of which fail to load and the ones that do are zoomed in an uncomfortable amount. Please just switch it back to the old format, or at least give a settings option to switch it back (I should also mention that it took me a while to find how to get to the settings). Everyone needs to stop trying to copy Snapchat because Snapchat's format works for Snapchat, but it doesn't work for other apps, and it certainly doesn't work for Timehop."
2197,BoomerSooner05,"December 27, 2016",5,Bad update I used to LOVE going on Timehop to see what happened on my social media on that day because it would bring back great memories. It would even let you see the comments from other people on those posts. At one point I had a 250+ day streak of getting on timehop. Now it's just frustrating because you swipe through the post back and forth (just like Snapchat and instagram story) but you can't see any comments. I give the previous Timehop 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è. But give this new updated Timehop JUST 2 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
2198,smmonfee,"March 2, 2017",1,Back in time... Your most recent update stinks. I actually give you no stars. Hate the huge pix. Hate the framed photos you randomly dump that I can't enlarge or share. Speaking of sharing I seldom can do that because it closes the app. I am enjoying Facebook's Memories a lot better and since I don't use the other social apps it brings up the same things you do but in a more readable and shareable form. I will be deleting this app if you don't change back to the previous format. 
2199,Kkitty113,"September 8, 2017",1,"I've moved on to another app, the ads are getting out of hand. ** Timehop had purchased memoir and is shutting it down. Doesn't mean I'm going to re download this. Ridiculous. "
2200,Megz0rz18,"November 12, 2014",5,"Abe, the Dino, makes this app! It's amazing to look back and see what kind of social media business I was getting into in years past. I was so bold! My friends and I, so young! It's awe-inspiring(and a little scary) to see that an app can collect all this data from all these different sites and compile it into one spot for our viewing pleasure. But that's not even the best part! It's that adorable dinosaur! He dances when you go to refresh the page and always has something quirky and clever to say. I love it! Plan on using this all for a long time!"

I'm giving it a 4 because I don't like the way it shares the photo.  The ""1year ago"" tag is always blocking someone's head.  I should be able to move it around.  (The workaround is a screen print.)  I wish I could manipulate the pic from the app to resolve this.  Also the comment that I typed 1,2,3 years ago does not show up when I share the photo.  If I want that to share the comment I have to screen print & post it myself."

2204,Jo1928,"December 26, 2016",1,"Horrible features in this new version The new update has some really great parts (the ability to scroll from left to right instead of up and down, the look of the app as a whole). But the automatically-zoomed-in pictures are a nightmare and the fact that there's absolutely no way to see the text that was posted with pictures is awful. The negatives definitely outweigh the positives, and I really hope that the creators of Timehop can fix these changes (especially since the changes seem to bother everyone else, too). I've never written a review on an app before, but I'm just so disappointed with this update that I felt I needed to do so. I used to use Timehop every day, but now I don't have the desire to use it. Please fix!"

I don't like anything about it. You can't do anything with the framed pictures, which defeats the purpose of sharing. This zoom feature is an insanely ignorant feature. And the fact I can't read the comments from the pictures takes away from the purpose of the app, memories. The swipe feature is not easier it's dumb. I'm not sure they are paying attention to the reviews, otherwise they would have noticed days ago that their once lovely app now has super low reviews and is rated as mush as a pile of crap.

Although app updates can sometimes be frustrating to learn, overall they almost always improve the experience. That is not the case with this update, it almost seems like a beta version of the original app. In an attempt to avoid redundancy I won't repeat all of the issues that are already listed in detail by other users, but if anyone actually reads these reviews, please consider reverting back to the previous version of Timehop. Like many others, this was something I looked forward to checking everyday, and that anticipation had been replaced by apathy as I no longer enjoy the interface at all."
2207,Carmelatta,"January 7, 2017",5,"TimeHop Updated my review because this app listens to your feedback. They made some funky changes, people didn't like it and they listened. I appreciate this. The app shows captions, photos, and statuses from the past and it's very enjoyable and enlightening. "

(Thank God) I opened Time Hop today on both phones to compare and the old version showed SO many more pictures! Post I made that day didn't even show up in the upgrade at all! The old version flows better chronologically and includes every photo I posted. It doesn't condense your post or pick and choose what pics to show. I HATE that I can't open a ""gallery"" in the new version or even open and share one of the ""framed"" photos on that screen. And it makes me so mad when I know there are more photos from that event than what the new Time Hop chose to show. I miss the old Time Hop so much... :("

One thing I think would be nice is if it could pull up comments on statuses on FB or even mentions from twitter. Don't know how difficult that would be. Oh yeah, and I want the emails back! Either that or some way I can look at yesterday's time hop. "
2211,Firstcatch,"March 16, 2015",5,"Updates have made the app worse, not better I enjoy looking at Timehop every morning when I wake up. But sharing has become cumbersome and that was the main point of the app for me. The pictures should NEVER be cropped when shared, which essentially wrecks the entire thing when you cut half of someone's face out of the picture. And the fact that the text from the original picture is no longer included when you share is also annoying. No one wants to retype it!"
2212,Ashley6victoria,"March 16, 2015",5,"Timehop! I love this app! It's so interesting (and hilarious) to see everything I posted on social media from Facebook statuses, to old tweets, to embarrassing photos from years ago. Timehop really lets you see how much a person and who that person surrounds themselves with can change in such a short amount of time. You can also dive right back into old memories that you didn't remember by it just popping up on timehop. Every morning I get a timehop notification and every morning I get to dive through time. Love this app!"
2213,Ez8ryder,"June 15, 2015",5,Awesome app I love this app. It's like a little trip down memory lane evetyday. It just notified me when it's ready each day then I click on the icon and see picture & post from that day each year back sense I got a fb. I can look through watch video see comments that were made and if I choose to share them on fb again I can (and it just a click or 2) and if I choose not to no one but me see them. With all the apps I have on my phone this is one of my favorites and makes me smile the most
2214,Msmorg,"September 21, 2015",3,"Getting Creeped Out I used to love this app! ... But since the update to go with the iOS 9 update, there has been a little badge/slider thing at the bottom of the screen that says ""Good Morning, (name)"" on my app navigation menu. (When you double tap home) It doesn't go away when you slide it, in fact it opens the app, and it doesn't appear to have any way to get rid of it. I have looked in the phone settings and the app settings and I can't find a way to turn it off. It's creeping me out! Please add an off switch for that thing, or I'm probably going to delete the app, which I have been happily using for years. It's so creepy!"

Really bad move on your design team's part - not sure why you thought the whole layout needed to be changed in the first place? People had some easily fixable issues with last months update, but that doesn't mean we wanted the ENTIRE APP changed! It's very clear scrolling down through the dozens and dozens of one-star ratings since the update that people do NOT like it.

I can't stand that you can't share videos anymore, that everything is now zoomed in and that you can't scroll through like before.  I used to check it every day and now I don't because it's too frustrating.  Please go back to the previous version! Thanks!"
2219,ALPhillips92,"February 12, 2017",1,"Great App....before the updates I NEVER write reviews but I'm hoping if I do it'll go back to the way it was because I loved Timehop before the update! It was great to be able to see past posts and see how much has changed but now it is so difficult to do so. I hate having to tap through every single post and half of them end up not even loading. Although they said changes have been made so the pictures aren't full screen, they still are and I can't see the whole picture. I also they changed that the pictures move and I don't want them to be gifs I want them to be pictures that's why I took them as still pictures and not a video. It would be smart for timehop to go back to the way it was."

That being said my Facebook account will no longer link to this application, which has drastically reduced its usefulness to me. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the application, as well as deauthorizing the application on my Facebook account. Neither measure has solved the problem. I have attempted to contact support, but have heard nothing back. I would love for this issue to be resolved so that I can start using the app again, as I really enjoy it."

What a dumb hassle that is.. Also my biggest complaint is that I can't even click on individual photos to make it bigger on my phone screen anymore. It crops the photo into a square for you to see and that's it. Half of the time it's chopping heads off and stuff because it's not the full photo. It's part of it in a square and now I can't even click on it to make it the full photo and save it if I want. So annoying to me, the new update definitely wasn't thought through very well. I hope you change these problems and then I will gladly give it five stars again."
2222,EatDrinkAndBeCherry,"August 23, 2016",1,"Only posts image, no caption?! When you post into Facebook, Timehop will only share the image, not the original caption, which provides context for other viewers. This is a decent app for viewing your own memories, but makes very little sense to share JUST a photo. The caption and the comments are what tell the story. I'm able to copy and paste a picture myself. I don't need an app to act as middle man. Basically, if the image AND - at the very least - the caption aren't shared, then it's stupid to share. Timehop is only good for people to reminisce themselves. It doesn't make much sense to share a random picture with no context with people. "

Y'all thought that everyone would be ok- perhaps even like- this pathetic excuse for an ""update?"" What? You can't see captions, you can't see comments, you're not showing all tweets, you can't share video! That's like half of what then app did before. You cut its usefulness by a ridiculous percentage!

The beautiful thing about the normal timehop is the fact that I can look in the past with ease. Now, I have to individually look at every single past post. I have reposted plenty of pointless posts and I just want to see my own posts. The best way to describe this update is me trying to find a a house in the middle of a thick wood. If you have an aerial view, you can look for smoke. It's quick. It's eazy. But now, the update is making me walk through the wood and it's impossible to find the posts that actually matter.

Oh, lets just stretch them so they're filling the screen. No longer can you take a quick screenshot of the image without the annoying ""x years ago"" overlapping it if you happen to not be able to find the photo on your own again. Timehop...

The second is that quite often I get a question mark as if it cannot retrieve a post that I had.  The third is I wish they would allow you to see several days that have passed instead of only giving you the 24 hours to see that post.

I tried ignoring it for awhile, but it just won't quit until you appease it.

Timehop was great because of the convenience, the simplicity, and the fact I didn't have to do anything to share an old post or photo just how it showed up. That's why I used it.

I do try to check it daily. I would like to have a glimpse of other social media that has been posted to, by my attached accounts, as well as some of the comments. This would make this app truly a fuller timehop into the past."
2252,soto_bianca,"January 20, 2015",4,Love the app. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Seriously this is such a cute and fun app. The fact that it shows me what I tweeted a few years ago is so neat. The only negative thing I have to say about the app is that I need to have my Facebook active so I can use it. I deactivated my Facebook and when I went back to the app it was telling me I need a Facebook sign up. I hate Facebook and the fact that I need to have it active to use the app is kinda lame. I haven't used my Facebook in years. Wish there was another way to long on without Facebook. That was my only issue. Other than that such a fun app! üòä
2253,Animosity4Quiet,"December 27, 2015",4,"I like it. I like it, because it gives me a quick (and fairly easy) way to look at my posts from 1+ year(s) ago. Then, if I want, I can share them. "

2255,Hgyjn,"December 26, 2016",1,"Bad update I really love timehop, but the new update takes away features like seeing what your captions were on pictures, and being able to go to your posts on other apps. I loved being able to go to my old tweets on twitter so I can retweet or reply to them to bring them back up, but the new update makes it so I can't do that. I'm fine with the new swiping feature, I would just like to see what my captions were and to be linked to the original posts through the other apps. (If that part is confusing, I mean the part where you can tap on like the twitter icon, and it would transfer you over to the twitter app and that tweet would pop up for you to interact with it. I really loved that feature)"
2256,CatDub,"January 2, 2017",1,It was perfect. Why the update?! This is the first time I have ever reviewed an app (though I read reviews all the time...I'm terrible)! 
2257,Britchet,"March 4, 2017",1,This update is the worst What is the matter with TimeHop!? Now I can even share things on any type of social media out let. But st least you get your ads in everyday so you make money - right. 
2258,ShadyZ42,"March 31, 2017",2,"What once was.... I loved Timehop in the beginning, before the dark times, before the new interface. I used to enjoy putting up the cool little Dino guy's pic with my memories. I only had it linked to Facebook, but all the daily posts were there and pics too. Now, I still have it linked to just FB, but only get the smallest sampling of posts over the past 7 years. I'll go on FB, see a memory for the day they posted, then go on Timehop hoping it might show up and I can add the little flair to it. Time and again, I'm disappointed. Rarely does the memory that shows on FB, appear in the meager TH offerings. Not a good update at all. Which is why I rarely use it anymore."

This was the main reason I use the app. Not sure why you would remove such a popular feature. Many of my friends often used this feature as well. I will now try to find an app that has this feature and use it instead. Also, many of the new frames are a bit childish. You are not catering to your entire audience with this update."
2261,Poiks,"September 8, 2015",4,"Nostalgia Junkie As a nostalgia junkie, I LOVE this app. It presents pics from my photo-sharing app as well as social media, and let's me share them again with banners like ""Four years ago"" and other graphics. It's great fun. "
2262,Alicia Lowry,"October 5, 2015",3,Love the app but... As posted b4 I too have been getting a lot of the notice that I deleted a photo when I know I didn't. I too have got a lot of Timehop logos instead of my posts. These are very frustrating. It also is weird to me that you don't ever seem to go any further then 5 yrs. 
2263,MmpJG,"December 8, 2015",5,"I love the app, BUT The only thing I would change about this app, is that I would make it so you could remove memories/entries that you don't want to see any more.  Several times now, I have logged into timehop only to see a memory that I really would rather not.  Some of them posted on my wall by other people, which I don't really have control over.  If you were to go back and delete something like that from your timeline on FB, would it disappear from timehop as well?"

I'm hoping someone at headquarters will read all of these reviews and make the changes we all desire...basically reverting back to what we all had and loved! I don't mind tapping instead of scrolling (whatever) but having the pictures already zoomed out is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I absolutely hate it! And where are the captions to the photos I posted? There are so many things about this update that I detest, I would give it less than one star if I could. I've loved Timehop...for years it's been one of my favorite apps...but I'm very disappointed with this new update. It was great. Don't go changing a good thing."

I have never reviewed an app before, but I'm so disappointed in this update that I had to say something. I do not like any thing about the new format. The pictures are all zoomed in, so I have to tap & hold to zoom out -- makes no sense. I can no longer read the comments from a post -- that makes me sad. I loved reading others comments from years ago. There is now no way to save to share a video -- I had an absolutely precious video pop up yesterday, that I had completely forgotten about. I couldn't save or share it, and now it's gone. PLEASE change the app back or fix these issues."

2269,Shovelboy,"February 14, 2017",2,"Loved it for years BUT now not so much Disappointing, frustrating; 2 words that sum up how I feel about the new TimeHop. I loved this app and still do enjoy seeing my old photo posts BUT it used to be so much easier when you could just scroll and easily share. Some of my photo captions are showing up as a separate post without the pic. Some photos do not have the option to share. If I had my way the app would return to scrolling, have editing options, and be more sharing friendly. Also a way to move the '_ years ago' would be great!!! "

2271,Elmanie,"February 14, 2015",5,"So fun! It's so cool to be able to see posts and pictures from the past, but Timehop doesn't just stop with those simple updates. It has a quirky, fun, silly dinosaur as well, which always makes things better! And their Valentine's Day special feature with the pictures of puppies and kitties was absolutely hilarious! I woke up on Valentine's Day completely dreading the day ahead, but opened Timehop which changed my mood to that of a laughing giggling lunatic. Love their creative ideas for such a simple concept! Keep it up! :D"
2272,Kbochon,"May 20, 2015",5,"Great app just for you Love this app.  It is really just for me, while I do occasionally share a picture (the then and now side by side photo feature is neat) most often I just enjoy strolling down memory lane each morning.  It is kind of cool to see a lot of little memories each day but be prepared it came sometimes blindside you with the big often painful memories.  (Ex Mother's Day when mom has died since, pictures w estranged loved ones etc) but nothing is shared w anyone else unless you chose to do so."
2273,ScooterJM3,"January 2, 2017",1,"Used to be good. Terrible now. The old version of this app was easy to use. A quick swipe to see everything, and easy to share or repost those items you want to. Now it's a hassle to use, it's impossible to see photos correctly, And there are far too many required gestures to remember in order to access all the functions. I haven't been able to share a single item since the new update because I can't remember how to do it, none of the intuitive gestures work, and I just can't bring myself to care enough to dig through and try to figure out how to watch the tutorial again. The best update they could possibly do to this app is to roll it back to the previous version."
2274,kyleemcd,"January 6, 2017",1,"No longer worthwhile Sorry folks, but the new update doesn't address the fundamental problems with your recent ""updates"". The UI is still broken. Why must I now swipe through every photo or video?"
2275,JayJBarrow,"January 9, 2017",1,"What happened?!? This version won't even work. I haven't used Timehop in a while, I'll admit. But the app was apparently automatically updated while I slept some time ago because it's now complete junk. It crashes every time I launch and start to scroll through my past posts. In fact, even the way you SCROLL has changed from up/down to left/right. Extremely aggravating. Instead of leaving well enough alone the brains behind this new version decided to remove everything that was easy and painless about the app and replace it with something that didn't even need to change or enhance the user's experience. "
2276,Cb13333333300003333,"January 12, 2017",1,"Went from 5 stars to 1 I used to love Timehop because I could see everything at once and pick through what I wanted to look closer at. Now, everything is enlarged and you have to swipe through every single post. You also can't see all the pics anymore, and when there are more than one pic they've now been put in pointless frames and the pics are so small and you can enlarge them. And what's with the color block behind the writing?! You also can't share videos, and I've turned the zoom off and my pics are still zoomed in unless I hold a finger on the pic. This is the worst update I've ever experienced and I'm just waiting for a third update to see what, if anything, gets fixed."
2277,emthebuse,"February 20, 2017",1,"Still Terrible I've given up on this app. I opened it up today just to see, and it's still awful. Not only do you still have to click through every little thing, they compiled a group of my pictures from one year into some sort of weird montage video and there's no way to change it. I guess it was a series of pictures taken all at once, so they decided to group them altogether. It's weird. And then the ADS!! I don't mind ads, but almost every other click is a stupid ad."

2280,An every day user,"January 24, 2015",5,"Changes how you view social media I've been on board with Timehop from very early on, and it has changed the way that I view my own social media. I've realized that this is my own history, good, bad or indifferent. It is me and I have changed how I interact with the world at large. Now, I do and post things that I want to remember, document my failings and post about silly little things that happens. Because I know that it's part of my personal history and I want to remember it. Timehop has changed my life."
2281,rayburnc,"June 25, 2015",5,"Great app I love being able to see my historical posts on social media. Without Timehop, posts to social media platforms die there never seeing the light of day again. Interesting conversations, great pictures, and great ideas (not to mention all the bad pictures, stupid conversations and really bad ideas) are all lost once they're posted.  Love this app. My only request would be to see more than one day at a time. If I miss opening the app one day, I've missed the update and can't go back."
2282,8tracks user,"April 29, 2016",2,"New update wasn't thought through. I've never had an issue with anything TimeHop. It's a simple app, that I certainly don't need but enjoy looking through. The new update including the ""Retrovideo"" is startlingly disruptive though. I've never met an app of their popularity that was thoughtless enough to override your sound settings and blast music. (Music you're not in control of no less--if we need reminded what we did a year ago ... No way we'll remember if we liked the music.) All that said. It seems thoughtless and if not adjusted, I'm not interested in using the app anymore. It's not quite worth the fear of scrolling down and having tunes of the past unexpected blared at me."

For example, putting a picture of my baby from last year to this year was An amazing feature! Yet you took it away. Sure I can save the old picture and get a new picture and then find another app to put them side by side but the multiple extra steps aren't necessary. "
2287,Bcoari,"December 27, 2016",1,"Bad update App was fine until recent update which makes it annoying to use. Bafflingly bad. Doesn't even work as advertised, often making me retry, and tapping doesn't always go to the next picture, sometimes I have to swipe... "
2288,JerBeers,"December 28, 2016",1,"Constructive criticism about latest update So it seems I'm in the majority here of people unhappy with the new update. So rather than just listing what I don't like, here's what I consider to be the high points of Timehop that are now missing, and I want back...whatever format that be in. You can have creative license (although I find it unnecessary), as long as 1) I have the ability to see the full picture without having to zoom out; 2) I can see the captions on my FB/IG photos again; 3) I can see the comments/likes on my FB/IG photos again; 4) the statuses from FB are full statuses, not cut off at the end. As it is, this app is pretty terrible, but I trust that with those features restored it would at least be reasonably enjoyable."

Why do I have to click and hold on a picture to zoom OUT? Why is it zoomed in in the first place?! Timehop isn't snapchat, so why is it formatted exactly like that? Not only that, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to share a video. I tried swiping up as instructed for photos, but it just scrolls to the next photo instead. I really loved Timehop, it was a fun idea and a cool way to see how far we've come in life. But with this new update, I'm sad to say I'll be deleting. It's not worth it anymore. Fix this god awful update and I'll consider re-downloading. You folks really dropped the ball on this."

I like that it's only available for the one day, it would be too cluttered and nostalgic if the posts were available for multiple days. The only thing that would make it better is if I could see the likes/comments that I got on each post; or if I clicked on it, the social media app would launch to that post. But I really like it overall"

It saddens me now that from the few things I have to chose from i now only have a select amount within one item to show. Such as yesterday I had posted a year ago a conversation between my husband and daughter. I was unable to share the whole thing, I was left sharing a snip of it which really made no sense. Prior to the update I enjoyed TimeHop much more. Overall it's a very creative App, it's fun to see what your younger you was like and possibly how much you have grown"
2293,thomasfruin,"January 28, 2016",4,"Fun app first I open every morning Timehop was the pioneer in the ""going down memory lane"" genre of apps and I believe it is still the best.

I've never written a review for an app, but this is the worst app update I've ever experienced. The zoom-in on pictures is a ridiculous feature that I can't imagine anyone wanting to use. And the original captions on my pictures are gone; the best part of looking back is seeing what I had to say about the images I shared. Why would you take that away? I find myself using the Facebook Memories feature instead of Timehop. I'm considering finding a replacement app and deleting this one.

What do you do? Ignore them and try to justify why YOU like the new interface when it was not only ugly and annoying to use, but broken. You pretend to listen, and an update comes! What do you fix? only what was broken, you don't even address the countless people telling you that the tapping is awful. Not only did you make a perfectly fine app extremely unpleasant to use, you've demonstrated awful customer service and an obvious unwillingness to make your users happy by ignoring what they are trying to tell you about this huge mistake of an update."

This app is great for laughs, because it goes back to the beginning of TIME to show you how far you've come.

Either way, it Also has a cute dinosaur at the bottom the always changes."

I always have to take snapshots of the pics, which isn't a huge deal but with the videos I have to copy the link and it doesn't show a preview when I post it and my videos aren't shared well that way. It's unfortunate. So the sharing portion is lacking in my opinion but otherwise, within the app, I enjoy the features."

Photos and videos of my grandkids I had forgot I had even taken.  Photos of reunions from 5 years ago. I'm always pleasantly surprised at the photos or videos that pop up daily.  Always something cute or funny to post on FB to share with family. It's like a walk down memory Lane each day.

I've never written a bad review of an app prior to now, but this deserved it!! The old Timehop was such a fun way to reminisce, but the new app changes seem to make the whole concept pointless! Without the ability to read comments and likes, you're missing so much of the point in looking back! On days when you uploaded an album of photos, you now only see the first 3, and they're zoomed in with poor pic quality! What is that about?? I enjoy and embrace change and technological improvements, but this has to be the worst ""update"" I've seen in the history of updating apps! Please, for the sake of humanity, go back!!!!"

I appreciate some changes being made in the latest update. However, I only see about half of what I used to see. Isn't timehop here to show us all of our activity from previous years on that day?  If that goes away permanently, someone else will step in to fill this need. And who thought the horizontal tapping was a good idea?  Facebook, twitter, instagram, even LinkedIn are vertical scrolling. That's what we are used to and that's what we can get through efficiently. I've been keeping my streak going (238 days) but if this isn't corrected, I won't. Come on timehop, you can do this!"

2309,Jeanettalinville,"January 16, 2017",1,Updates Ruined it! If I had done a review when I first downloaded this app a year or two ago I probably would have given it close to 5 stars. The last 2 updates that changed the way the app works and looks has absolutely RUINED the app. Before these updates it was so easy to read what your time hot for that day was and to click on it and see if people had commented in the past as well. Now I can't even stay on the screen long enough to read my Timehop because every time you touch it swipes to the end & makes it impossible to access settings or anything else for that matter. I loved this app but now I'm going to uninstall it if it doesn't go back to its original format.

2311,"Its not you, its me","September 6, 2014",5,Fantastic idea guys! I look at it errrday I don't rele do reviews but this one deserves it. Like I mentioned above I check my now favorite go to everyday app to see new things about my past. I'm now in college so I don't have a life but I love reminiscing on my past and this gives me pics to conversate with old friends to reconnect. I love it. 
2312,animechick2010,"February 25, 2015",1,Not working for me I've had this app for about a month now and at first it seemed great. I could see all my old posts and the interesting post they provide. However after actually sharing a post for the first time it didn't work at all. The screen is zoomed in so you can only see a portion of your posts to choose from. Don't click on a post that has a picture or you're just stuck looking at the pic and the only way to get out is to completely restart the app. The share button also doesn't work I've gotten it to work twice in the whole time I have had this app. It needs serious work or bug fixes. A lot of my friends use this app but maybe it's only iPads that cause issues.
2313,Wildguess16,"April 10, 2015",4,"Suggestions I love Timehop, I check it every day! I do have a couple suggestions though."
2314,MontanaGirl!!,"April 10, 2015",4,"Just realized I have liked this app a lot. I enjoy the memories I get from this app. However, I recently realized that not everything that I post shows up. Facebook now has a version of this and today I had 5 posts but on timehop is said I only had 1. Just wondering why you don't have the others. Also I was waiting for a specific picture to show up so I could repost it and the time when it was around came and went and I never saw it. So I love this app but I wish it had everything and not just half of the stuff."
2315,Greenley44,"April 24, 2015",5,"Cropping issue. I absolutely love this app, however I have lowered my score related to the app cropping the picture when sharing. The app generally cuts half the picture. I don't even share pictures anymore because I don't want to send someone a picture of my kids with half of my daughter's face missing and the top of my son's head gone. Will you please fix this feature?"
2316,shortstack120,"July 23, 2015",3,"Fun but doesn't work well Timehop is a fun program for looking through your old photos and posts. It only gets 3 stars because when you share photos, they get cropped (about the bottom 1/3 gets cut out even if you try to zoom in or move the photo), but in the preview in Timehop it doesn't show that, so you don't realize until it's already been posted to Facebook or whatever app. I've noticed this problem when sharing photos through messages too. Very inconvenient and makes the sharing feature somewhat useless at least half the time I want to use it."
2317,Danielle1354233,"December 25, 2016",1,"Awful Update I've been using TimeHop for over a year now and always have enjoyed it, but now am considering deleting it. The new update is horrible to use and has changed the app from one I love to one I hate. It is glitchy and difficult to share photos. The zoom is off, and so every time I look at a picture, I have to zoom out. When pictures were taken within a specific time, they are grouped together and flip through the images quickly, making it impossible to pick just one. I hate the update. I will be keeping the app for awhile longer, in hopes that the developers make big changes, but otherwise will be deleting and looking at ""On this day"" in FB instead."
2318,Whit~Lo,"December 30, 2016",2,"You're new update and platform change I used to enjoy looking at my time hop. I could see my past posts... pictures... AND COMMENTS. Now with its new update and it's format change, you have to slide screens to see past posts. You can no longer see who liked or commented on the post. And I personally have had issues with it posting like it should. I have to SS it most of the time if I want to post it to a social media page. It was much easier and enjoyable the way it was before. I will probably be deleting it and finding a similar app that actually does what this one USED TO. "
2319,thegimp71,"January 3, 2017",1,"No no no... App deleted. 4.0 is bad. Very bad. Timehop is no longer user friendly or fun. This nonsense that you have to swipe one picture/video at a time is lame. I liked scrolling through and selecting ones I could zoom in on. And what happened to the ability to do Then/Now postings? That was fun but now it's gone. I do like that a few pictures taken within a short time of each other are presented similar to an animated GIF, but you can't make a GIF so it's just a tease. Timehop has become an unenjoyable app. "
2320,Samsevilplantosavetheworld,"April 1, 2013",5,"Sentimentalist I don't write many app reviews but I thought I would for this one. Technically, it does what it says it does. I have not had any problems with it. But the reason I rate so high is because I think this app is a cool little guy that reminds you of where you have been (at least in terms of social media). Just like time capsules remind us of how we used to be and can be a good motivation to stay the path and keep our good intentions, so this app is. It keeps ya honest. It keeps ya humble. Download this fun little app."
2321,t3h_awesome,"November 17, 2013",5,"Love. This. App. Just wanted to share a little love for Timehop. I know a lot of folks are having login trouble. If you look at the app info page, Timehop suggests you go to Settings > Privacy > Facebook and toggle the switch off and on again."
2322,Verdell5182,"July 7, 2014",5,"The ability to time travel!!! I love this app. It is exactly what I've been searching for. It is exciting to see what I've been doing and posting over the years. You can see what you were up to in Facebook or Instagram and other apps in years past. Only trouble is if you posted something after the fact ie vacation photos,they are shown when you posted them not when you were actually doing them, however that is not the apps fault."
2323,chey67,"October 15, 2014",5,"Great way to reminisce! I look forward to checking my timehop every day! The only time I am dissapointed is when there is not much on there but, that's my problem, not the app's. If the could also manage to add myspace also to the networks this app would be even better. Personally my favorite feature is when they show you photos you took or saved to your camera roll. I have had this app for months now and I have NEVER experienced any bugs or problems."
2324,Hollyms26,"July 27, 2015",5,"Great App! I love looking through all the  pictures and past posts each Morning. Such a fun way to start the day. I do wonder what happened to the option at the top to post something about the current day? I enjoyed that, but ran out of space on my phone and had to delete all apps until I upgraded. Now that I have a new phone, I have re-installed the app and that option Is no longer there. Kind of a mini-journal which I enjoyed. Miss that but love the rest!"
2325,MrsMcClesk,"October 19, 2015",3,"Delayed update My time zone settings are correct but the app doesn't upload the next day at midnight, not even 2:30 AM yet has it changed over. Not that huge of a deal but I would be cool for that to get worked out. Also, some videos don't play for whatever reason. I'd like to see the posts (with the displayed message 'looks like someone is trying to get a job in politics') that have been deleted by others too just for laughs. Very minor complaints but this app is basically just simplifying you having to take time an scroll back thru your own past posts"
2326,Cool person2000096,"December 30, 2016",1,"I wish I could use timehop to go back in time and stop this update from happening. I used timehop every single day, but now I use it reluctantly because the way of viewing the posts is just awful. I don't know if you were trying to follow snapchat or what, but it doesn't fit for this type of app. Everyone loved it when it was what it originally looked like, so please revert it back to that for easier viewing. It is so hard to view posts anymore and I can't read what picture posts said I can only look at the pictures. I have a streak of 132 and I'm about to break that streak because of this update. I don't know how much more I can handle with this. Please go back to the way timehop used to be."
2327,KEL5191994,"December 30, 2016",1,"New update is a no go This new update makes me not want to use Timehop. I'm all for changes, but this formatting makes no sense. The details are no longer there. The way they put the pictures together like a gif is not helpful and neither is the zooming in of every picture. The point of Timehop is to see each picture and remember why you posted it or took it, not to see them for a split second or for it to be distorted. Plus, the Snapchat layout feels ripped off, like they just wanted to ride the popularity that Snapchat has. It just isn't functional for how I (and others upon seeing similar reviews) want it to be. Change is fine but not when it almost completely ruins the app's purpose."
2328,pcrosss,"January 4, 2017",1,"disappointed to say the least... i'm really never one to write a review, but with an update as awful as this and reading what they're going to do to ""fix it"" i felt compelled to do so. the team at timehop seem to only be focused on the minor things that were a great addition to viewing your memories, such as being able to see likes/comments on facebook and instagram posts. while that was a great feature on the old version and i enjoyed it a lot, i'd much rather have the old layout and not have that feature then to keep the new layout and have that added on. with the blog posts that timehop has posted about what they're doing to ""fix"" the new update, it's quite a disappointment that they don't seem to be considering going back to the old layout and are just going to be adding minor details to the new layout that everyone seems to hate more than anything. at this point, i'm considering deleting the app because now it just a waste of space on my phone when the only thing i go on it for anymore is to maintain my streak."
2329,Lsolomons,"October 3, 2017",5,"Spinning circles of timewaste I have a love/hate relationship with this app. I enjoy seeing past photos, but most of the photos and videos never download. I get the spinning buffering circles of death for most of my photos. This app is really annoying me. It looks like you guys would fix that bug instead of adding more things to download like ads and frames. Fix the app. I've deleted the app and redownloaded to try to see if it that was the issue. NOPE! This app needs a lot of work."
2330,timpsonl,"June 25, 2015",4,"Fun app, despite a few glitches I really enjoy my daily TimeHop. It's a fun trip back in time, and I like the ability to post then/now pics (although it is hard to crop effectively and still see both pics). One main gripe is that unless it is pulling from Facebook, TimeHop doesn't always get the date right. I've noticed on multiple occasions that it will pull a whole bunch of photos from my phone that actually occurred over a span of several days from the day when TimeHop thinks they are from. Not a huge deal, though."
2331,mklafavers,"August 4, 2015",1,"Leaves a lot of stuff out I used to love looking at TimeHop every day, but recently they haven't been showing me all of my old Instagram pictures (especially ones from a year ago). There have been some issues with images not loading, but more often than not they just won't show up at all. I figured this out because I was confused about why I hadn't seen any of my vacation pictures from a year ago. I thought it was because it just hadn't been a whole year yet, but when I looked back on my Instagram account I realized that it had been more than a year and TimeHop had just failed to show them to me. I don't see a point in keeping this app if it doesn't do what it says it does."
2332,Pintastic Princess,"October 3, 2015",4,Good; needs a few things tweaked I have enjoyed Time Hop for awhile now. I like seeing the pictures of my child from a year ago and the memories with my friends and family. It's a great concept to have my photos and Facebook linked to this app. 
2333,Lissakb,"March 7, 2016",5,"Last update stinks! Ever since the last update, I get notifications telling me to check it, BUT it force closes every time I try to open it. Haven't gotten to view it in several days. :(  Please fix it?"
2334,HoodPhoto,"July 24, 2016",5,"Uninstall/Reinstall fixes the new update crash glitch This app is fun. I love going back and looking at what I posted years ago. The latest update made the app freeze any time I opened up. I still got notifications reminding me to check for the day but it would not open. I finally just uninstalled and reinstalled and. Was pleasantly surprised to see that it opened without a glitch and best of all, I didn't lose my daily streak. Try yourself and don't give up on a great app."
2335,MikeBruh,"December 16, 2016",2,"Constant connection issues. I had a day streak nearing 200 (it really was 199), and to keep it, I fought through countless connection issues. It didn't matter whether I was on 4G or Wi-Fi. I would either have to force close, shift to airplane mode, even hard reset my phone to get rid of them despite the fact that other apps on my phone worked perfectly fine. "
2336,FritzyJ,"December 27, 2016",1,"""Update"" is actually many steps backwards This new format does not work for this type of app, and defeats the whole purpose. The point of TimeHop is to show your memories and allow you to share them. Not being able to see captions & comments on pictures and videos takes away a huge part of those memories. I miss the borders, and the ""then & now"" feature I loved so much is no more. Who ever heard of tapping and holding to zoom in? And why are you cropping things for me? Trust me to crop it myself if I want it cropped. I've used TimeHop for years and loved it, but this update is a big step back. I don't see myself using this app again unless some of these issues are addressed in a new update."
2337,Michaela Garand,"January 5, 2017",1,"Why can't I give zero stars? I've never written an app review before, but this one seemed necessary. I have also never had an update so drastically destroy an app."
2338,SlaughterDog,"January 10, 2017",1,"No longer good With the last couple of updates, they have ruined their brilliant app. You can no longer quickly scroll through your historical posts, seeing everything up front. Now, you can swipe thru screens that show you the first few words of your old posts. Want to read the whole thing, see the pictures, revisit the actual post on whatever platform it was on? Too bad; you might have an option to expand it a bit but Timehop is far from what it once was. "
2339,bao1k,"January 11, 2017",1,"New update is terrible Bring back the old Timehop and stop trying to turn this into something it isn't. Stop trying to fix things that aren't broken. Will be deleting this app soon if it doesn't go back to functioning the way it used to - this swipe and zoom out stuff is awful. And no matter how many times I try to unlink it to my camera roll, those pictures keep annoyingly popping up in there. Hate it. DELETING!!!!"
2340,Cassandra St,"April 6, 2014",5,"Great App There are so many times that I find myself adding various apps on my phone, only to delete them the next week. Boring. Complicated. Weird. The list goes on and on! But, this app is fun and very simple. It features the current day in the history of your social media accounts and it has provided plenty of entertainment for my husband and I. I love looking back, although when my 10 month old son's pics start showing up on the feed, I may start crying. :')"
2341,Jo[s]e,"April 30, 2014",5,"I almost forgot that... Over the years we post and post and post on the daily and if you're like me, your memory begins to run it all together. I think this app is pretty sweet! I find myself using it everyday to see where I've been over the years. These ppl who are complaining about it...maybe you should try to uninstall and reinstall it...it's not that crucial. I've never had problems with this app. Just thought if help this app out by highlighting its awesomeness. #hatersgonnahate #fwp"
2342,ascetic,"January 3, 2015",5,"Great app, hope it stays around! This app is fantastic, it's one of the first things I look at every single day, and it's great to see what I was doing every year before--it's especially fantastic if you have little kids, to remind you how much they've changed in a year or three. My only concern is that this company will go out of business and we'll lose this app we use and love! I'd happily pay for it, and there are no ads, I don't know how they make money. I hope they are somehow!"
2343,Shortyfisch,"January 24, 2015",4,"TimeHop! I love the idea of this app. It's brought a lot of laughs to my fianc√©, my friends, and I. But like most things, it's not perfect. It keeps telling me to upload my archives from Twitter and I follow the step-by-step, and it still doesn't work. Also, sometimes photos you share on Facebook just show up as broken links. The last glitch, it allows you to see conversations, most of the time. Again, sometimes the link to old conversations is broken. "
2344,SchwartzReports,"February 24, 2015",2,"New required square crop ruins the app I used to love time hop. I still like it for reminiscing, but this latest version has broken the share function. "
2345,Zaqataq,"January 7, 2017",4,"Glad to see they addressed the issues I don't typically review apps but I used Timehop a lot over the last few years and like many people was disappointed with the update. It made the app almost unusable. But I'm really glad the creators saw all the feedback and moved pretty quick to fix them. For me, the biggest flaw with the update was the lack of captions and links to twitter/facebook to view comments/conversations. It's a lot easier now to see the context of my photos and posts from years past."
2346,kalina34,"January 9, 2017",1,New update is awful Update 1-9-16 update said it fixed zoom-it appeared to the first time I went into the app then it stopped and photos are all screwy zoomed again. There is no place for user to adjust settings either that I can find anymore. Try again! If it's not fixed I will be deleting along with all the others.
2347,trayseemarie,"January 13, 2017",2,"PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW!!!! First update was AWFUL!!! This Second update is a move in the right direction by adding comments and captions back. You also fixed the photo zoom, thank you!!! Okay here's what needs to be next: the highlighted text on the status is just an eyesore and all of the status isn't seen because the text is too big. When u swipe up to share its perfect. Why not make it look like that anyway and just have a share button instead of a swipe? Also, go back to scrolling up and down. People like being able to see more than one status at a time. Thank you for listening to our suggestions!"
2348,Stephycpoo,"January 17, 2017",1,"New version is awful I loved this app and really enjoyed the previous version. The new aesthetic is ok but definitely not as user friendly. The app continues to glitch and tell me I haven't checked it when I clearly have. I will get like 3 notifications a day to check my timehop when I already did! Needless to say, have shut off the notifications entirely. Related to this issue is the fact that I lost a 200+ day streak when this new glitch started to happen. And now I've been stuck in single digits because it continues to think I never checked it. Honestly takes a lot of motivation away from opening the app. Lastly, I miss the little pictures of Abe & his quotes & the hidden graphics."
2349,CHI3F,"April 9, 2017",5,"Worse and Worse You put ads....in order to continue streaks...what the actual ef? You guys keep going downhill, keep selling out. Do you really expect your loyal fans to support you when you keep screwing them over? I have a 114 day streak and now I have to watch 20-30 second ads every time I use this app? Forget that. Photo/text ads that interrupt the timeline? Ok thats fair. Devs gotta make money. I get it. Videos that you have to watch to keep your streak? Pathetic."
2350,Noodlebear94,"January 22, 2015",5,New update not working I thought I would write a review since technical support normally doesn't help. The latest update has once again caused the app to not load when connected to wifi and I have no cellular connection at my home. When it has loaded which was a couple days ago it said I had no activity which I find hard to believe. Anyway just fix the not loading issue & the app is very nice to have to look back at the past.
2351,Fanojoel,"April 27, 2015",4,"Fun but frustrating The general concept of the app is a lot of fun. I enjoy looking at it every morning. However it's a little frustrating that it seems to skip years. I've been on Facebook for almost 10years, but after months of looking at time hop I've seen maybe three things from 5-8 years ago? I understand that I didn't post every day every year, but it's been pretty close to it. So I don't understand why those years are consistently missing. Also not thrilled with the way it crops pictures."

I also like the ""historical"" fact given by Timehop at the bottom. I may not share something every day-- but I check and smile.  Great to see the memories I wanted to share on social media.  The only thing I wish I could have a way to look at the day before or to have a ""bank"" in there where I could save an event to show someone later if I did not want to post on to Facebook.  Thanks!!"

I was able to block them on Facebook, but Timehop still will shove it in my face. I could delete directly from the app, but these are memories I don't want deleted, I just don't want to see them while the pain is still fresh. I may have to use the Facebook feature for a while, and I don't like it as much. "

I don't understand why it was even change because why does every app have to fix what isn't broken?? The old layout was perfect, and now I can't even see my old tweets or Facebook posts, which was the whole point of time hop??? I really don't care to see my photos saved to my camera roll because I can easily see those in my camera roll already, I just  want to see tweets and Facebook. Plus i don't understand why they have to be zoomed in, it's such a waste. Something needs to change this horrible update because I don't want to have to play hide and seek with my tweets of Facebook posts."

I understand that every once in a while you have to make changes and updates to keep the app fresh and new, but the new update is kind of confusing. In my opinion, it is a lot less user friendly and it takes away from why I like TimeHop. I like being able to go back and look at comments on posts from years ago. It makes those memories that much more special. I think I speak for many TimeHop users when I ask that you please go back to the scrolling layout. But keep the zooming in and out. I like that part.

I loved the app before and would spend several minutes in the app each day, taking the time to look at each memory, read the caption & comments, and share on Facebook. Now, I can't see captions or comments; I can't share my video memories (which is SO stupid, as they're often the best ones!!), and I now find myself quickly flipping through the memories instead of enjoying them like I used to, which makes the app pretty useless. I can't stand that everything is very zoomed in- and in order to see the full picture I need to swipe. I hope this app gets fixed soon because I love(d) the concept of it."
2358,Redhedz30,"January 6, 2017",1,NO NO NO NO NO Review of the current update? I guess you're taking baby steps? Hoping we'll give up and just deal with This awful app? As best I can tell the only thing brought back is the posts and captions. I still have to tap the phone to flip through the pics. The scrolling was WAY MORE USER FRIENDLY!!!!. No then and now. What's the POINT of the app then?. And the whole layout and look of the thing is still just awful.  I guess I'll delete it... AGAIN... And how for better next time. 
2359,CdW90,"January 7, 2017",1,"Roll it back Honestly, this release should be rolled back and taken as a loss. It happens. Sometimes designers need to step back from the current ""trends"" and realize they don't suit their product. Case in point is the ""new and improved"" Timehop. Not everyone needs a click-through ""story"" in an app. I actually dislike the clicking and swiping required in most story features across apps. This is no exception and actually causes greater frustration in Timehop. Remember, designers, sometimes simpler is better and fads fade. You had a strong product. Next time, try a little User Acceptance Testing before springing features upon your users which no one likes. Prevents a lot of wasted time and money."
2360,Misssschievous,"June 13, 2014",5,"Cute, fun, & happy experience The app does exactly what it says it does: it shows you what you posted on social media a year (or two) ago."
2361,Biesi,"January 22, 2015",5,"Daily Routine Let's you see ""what happened on this day in history"" according to what you recorded on social media and/or other items you linked to your time hop. Also, you must join for Abe. He's the cutest Dinosaur you'll ever meet!! It is nice to gain perspective on the past. You can even see the weather and what day of the week a certain date was in years past. On my phone I have been able to see as far back as 8 years ago. It's great! There's else nothing like it."
2362,anSullivan12,"April 23, 2015",3,"Great, but one thing that drives me crazy I love the concept of this app. My big issue with it is the cropping of the photos. The app shows you the image, you decide that you want to share it out and go in to make your edits. The image is immediately shifted over to the left, rather than scaled or centered) and you can't move the image over. Then you take it into Instagram and its cropped even more and you still don't have the ability to adjust the crop. I end up not sharing any photos because the majority of them have the subject either cut in half or cropped out completely."
2363,H unitz,"October 25, 2015",4,"I really like this app! I like the idea of this app, really great way to remember old memories. I take so many pictures and rarely go back so this is a fantastic way to reminisce. The sharing features are great because what better way to share nostalgia than with people who were with you? I have deleted some pictures from Twitter and Facebook with error on my time hop for those entries so I wonder for constructive feedback sake, can you update the way you gather the data input so that its up to date without errors interspersed?"
2364,Debcline,"January 5, 2016",2,"I use to love... When I first installed, I looked forward to seeing the updates everyday. Then, for about a week straight, it would not show anything. However, Facebook would show me updates from the past. I checked Timehop and I was signed in to Facebook and other social media sites but still nothing was showing. This problem was fixed by uninstalling and then reinstalling the app but the same problem occurred a few months later. I don't know if the updates make the app stop checking the social media sites you are logged into or what. It's just a pain to keep uninstalling the app and reinstalling."
2365,reeeeOWR,"December 22, 2016",4,"I love timehop but the new update/look is kinda terrible Please bring back the up/down scrolling, the snapchat story-style tapping left and right is a terrible way to view my memories, the pictures are cropped unless I hold onto them and it's kind of really annoying and definitely not a positive change. To give you an idea my streak is almost 200 days in a row that I've checked my timeline and I can honestly say this new change would stop me from using the app just because of how bad the new layout is."

Why can't I see the comments or the original link - or even tell if the picture is something from Facebook or Instagram??? I know the developers are seeing the backlash. I just hope they get this fixed soon. Until then, my love affair with Timehop is over."
2367,ExTimehopFan,"January 7, 2017",1,"The new version is awful and support nonresponsive I used to LOVE this app. But for some reason, they ""updated"" it and took away half of the functionality that made it cool. You used to be able to read photo post captions (which helps frame the context of the images) and the likes and comments given. You also used to be able to link back to the original post. Now it's just oversized pictures that you can't even see all of in the frame and no comments or context of the picture. I sent a comment to support over a week ago, but they didn't bother to respond. Guess they are going to drive this app to ground with no users. I will be researching for an alternative."
2368,Deleting my app now,"January 20, 2017",1,Update ruined the app This used to be our favorite app...we have 2 year old twins and it's become so fun to open it every day and see how much they've changed.  Your latest update has completely destroyed that.  The app is so frustrating I'd rather just throw my phone out the window than continue to use it.  Half the time it doesn't load photos at all or takes so long I give up...when it does it's not even close to being user friendly in terms of scrolling through.  There are some pictures that now flash quickly through and don't give you the option to save or share at all.  Such a tremendous disappointment.  Don't waste your time downloading it.
2369,[dot]Zac,"January 24, 2017",1,"If you're a developer, learn from Timehop's mistake This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to review something so negatively. Why did the developers behind this app feel the need to fix what wasn't broken? I realize that the new full-screen mode is better for selling advertisements, but come on. Scrolling through a feed is way more intuitive and less burdensome than tapping or swiping through endless arrays of pictures. Whoever came up with this ""redesign"" and thought it a good idea should be fired. I've actually deleted my account because of how unusable this app has become for me. I hope others do the same, and maybe the developers will learn from their short-sighted mistake."
2370,A&D&KMom,"October 20, 2014",4,"? I like Timehop and being able to look back 1,3 or 5 years back and seeing what i posted on facebook, but i don't understand why it always gives me a different day other than what today is? Example: today is Monday, so i would go to timehop and see what my pictures or posts are, and i see ""1year ago -Wednesday"" or ""3years ago- Tuesday"" and then on Tuesday, it gives me something from ""1 year ago -Thursday"" . I want it to be to the day! Not 1 year ago as of tomorrow or the next day. If i don't have anything for that day, then oh well!"
2371,theworldahead,"April 15, 2015",4,"So fun! Probably my favorite app, love the interface and the dino! It's always fun to see what happened, especially things several years ago. My only complaint is that sometimes I'd like to see the comments on certain posts! Sometimes I can't fathom why I posted something and the comments usually help. I just go onto Facebook to check, but it would be nice to do it all in one place!"
2372,bretwelstead,"December 26, 2016",1,"Can I Timehop to before the update? I used to love this app. I think my best streak was 181 days. Checked it every morning. But this new update is just the worst. Instead of my favorite photos and videos, I see  blown-up, side-cropped, blurry versions of some of my posts from yesteryear. Plus: no captions, no link to the original posts. The navigation (tap to advance, swipe to share, etc) is not helpful: it's annoying. I preferred the simple scrolling of the previous version."
2373,Shalott33,"December 26, 2016",1,"Update terrible This was a great app with no problems. Now there are several that I can't wrap my head around why they even thought it was a good idea: 1) every photo or video is automatically zoomed in. So I have to tap and hold, blocking part of the picture, to zoom out and actually see the whole photo. "
2374,HaleyBrooke_23,"December 26, 2016",5,"WHY?!?! Used to be my favorite app, now I HATE it!  I'm not going to take the time to list all the reasons why, I read over 20 other reviews and everyone else has already listed everything (because Hello?? They hate it too!)  You'd think after so many terrible reviews that they would fix it. Countless people have already stated they're deleting the app due to this stupid update.  PLEASE FIX IT or I'm sure there will be several more of us deleting it as well."
2375,Weronika Jeziorski,"December 28, 2016",2,"Very disappointed I'm very disappointed with the new update. I used to look forward to seeing what I had done in years past in addition to reading all the comments and captions. Now, however, you cannot read any of your captions, and you can only see a portion of your picture until you click/hold on it to zoom out, in which case my fat thumb tends to block most of the picture. I no longer look forward to looking at my Timehop, and now I just go through it to get rid of the notification. The best thing Timehop could do, is to revert back to the last update instead of this Snapchat like update."
2376,EllieRenee,"December 28, 2016",5,"Horrible I have loved using this app for the last year but this update is absolutely awful. The fun part for me was starting at the end and seeing the progression over the years. The Snapchat layout just doesn't make sense, photos are automatically zoomed in on and there are no longer captions shared. You also no longer have the ability to click to see the original posts or Twitter conversation. Switch it back!"
2377,Summetbabe3,"December 30, 2016",1,"WORST UPDATE EVER I have never written an app review before but this update has be so annoyed that I'm hoping all this uproar from users will just put it back to the way it was. I used to love checking my Timehop once a day and sharing old posts. Now it's a chore and takes three times as long to look through the most poorly designed update I've ever seen. It feels like a joke. They can't possibly have meant to do something that looks and feels so amateur. The design is so bad!  I'll stick around for a little while to see if they'll realize the mistake and go back to the way it was.  Otherwise, this app that made me smile and I've checked daily for a couple of years will be deleted for good."
2378,AshleeAmity,"January 25, 2017",1,The new version is just awful Update: I wish I could give this app zero stars. Why aren't you listening to consumers?! We don't like the new version! You have one star!!!!!!!! Please bring back the old version!
2379,TrinaUnz,"April 15, 2017",1,"Zero Customer Support I rarely leave reviews, but I'm so irritated with this app that I'm moved to. I'm one of many users who's experienced a problem with their streak. I had a streak of nearly 300 days going, and checked my app two or three times on the day that timehop says my streak was broken. I even got a screenshot of one of the events on the app on the day that timehop says my streak was broken, and I sent The screenshot to customer support. When I didn't hear back from them in a few days, I re-sent my complaint. Still haven't heard from them, and it's been a week. Lousy customer support and zero responsiveness to the bad reviews here. As soon as I find a satisfying alternative, I will delete Timehop."
2380,Swimmer075,"July 20, 2014",2,"Must have Facebook I love the idea behind this app, and a lot of my friends talk about it; however, once I downloaded it I realized you must have a Facebook account to use the app. For most people with Facebook this isn't a problem, but I was hoping to connect just my Twitter and Instagram accounts. One could always create a fake FB just to use this app and then sync their other social media accounts, but that is a hassle just to use one app in my opinion. Hopefully, the developers will eventually update the app because I would love if they would make a way for other social media users to use this app without first connecting a FB."
2381,Jessiter,"September 15, 2014",2,"Worked great , til it failed! I downloaded the app after seeing friends use it on Facebook, i thought it would be fun to see how I was posting a year ago when my son was born. The app worked for all of One day... And then it didn't work again.... I uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my phone.. The whole works, but it still won't load pictures, time warping or whutever it is called fails, and when I DO get to post to face book, the pictures don't post, just the description. It's kind of a waste of my time... But I wanted others to know how buggy the app is. Not happy at all... If it gets fixed then great....maybe i would rate it higher."
2382,Shamrock1979,"October 11, 2015",5,"Not so good... This app started out being great but has fallen off. I have had a lot of time hops that have pictures from Facebook that say""photo has been deleted"" when it hasn't. Today was my anniversary. My wife and I were excited to see our time hop, but guess what came up for our wedding photos... We are not happy campers. I will wait until my sons 1st bday to see what happens with those time hops but my guess is I will be deleting this once great app... So long time hop..."
2383,Bobsburgers11,"November 25, 2015",4,"Shared photos I love the app. It really makes me feel some type of way when I look at the old times. I can feel happy,sad,angry, and relieved.  The only thing I wish would change with the new update is to be able to share, shared photos. I have some picture I would love to share with my friends and family on social media but I can't share them if they are boxed in yellow and say shared. Other than that, I love looking back at the old times and seeing the people and places that made me who I am today."
2384,Kandt14,"December 1, 2015",4,"I love time hop I love having time hop, it's a great way to show you where you have been and how much has changed in life over the years. I know some people have experienced problems but I myself have not except once. The server was down so I couldn't see that days memories. That's the only part I don't like. you only can look at that day, in that day, and can't go back to it a different day. I now have 3 kids so it's fun to see how much they have changed and grown as well. Overall I love this app and am very satisfied. üòÄ"
2385,Jessegirl30013,"August 18, 2016",1,Extremely disappointed Got a new iPhone 6s due to a hardware issue and now timehop won't let me sign in through Facebook. I was running a 55 day streak and now I can't view anything. Whenever I try to sign in to Facebook it just keeps asking to sign in even though I put my info in correct. If I put my info in wrong it tells me but if it's right it just refreshes the screen and ask again. In the past (no matter what type of phone) timehop has just automatically signed into Facebook if I am logged in to on the phone. Super bummed that I can't view past posts because my little girl is now a year old and I was really wanting to see all those baby photos and achievements.
2386,DaniElizabeth23,"December 23, 2016",1,"Please go back I really don't like the new design guys. It's annoying to navigate and doesn't look all that great either. I had an issue with some of my posts loading before the update but now I just get fully blank grey screens. At least before I could see part of the post and click it to be taken to the actual thing but since that feature is gone I'm stuck with missing pages. It also disappointed that this feature was gone because I've been using it to clean up my account (get rid of posts I don't want to exist anymore) and now I can't do that either. Long story short, please go back to the last format and just fix the bugs there? Thank you."

2389,Pool boy711,"December 26, 2016",1,"New update is awful and not user friendly I see you already have a ton of reviews of people that are upset, I am very saddened by this non-user-friendly new update. If I want to zoom in the photos that's great but why are they automatically zoomed in and I have to zoom them out to see the whole photo? This is not user friendly. Also there are no longer comments or status updates that go along with the picture that was part of my favorite part of my memories. And now you can't easily get back to the first memory or scroll through them you have to go one by one side-by-side by side. I hope you take into consideration all of these new reviews of the update."
2390,S8192015,"August 1, 2015",5,They've perfected picture time traveling ! Absolutely love this app! It does a great job at finding pictures from different sources to give you   Sometimes unexpected pictures from that passed that you may have forgotten you had. Love that you can share the picture with how long the picture was takin and that it shows you the exact picture that were take on that given day. I also love the new now and then options. All in all .. GREAT APP !!
2391,Sexxy Lola,"October 15, 2015",2,"I like the app but.... I love being able to look at my past post or pictures but I do not like the fact that if I do not rate this app that message comes up every time I access the app until I rate it, but even when I do rate it I see it come back a week later...no one should need to rate the app that much. The other issue I have is the constant reminders to view the app. One reminder is enough no one should have to get five or six reminders a day to look at the app.....if I want to view the post or pictures I will go to the app if not so what. I use to love the app but these things causes me to slowly dislike it each day."
2392,ispy1337,"April 30, 2016",1,"Removing save feature and added auto play video - why do you hate us? This app was cool when it showed you your posts from previous years, and recently they added the ability to save your posts. They too that out of the recent update so the only option is to share. Then they added automatically playing video to the end of every post, which pauses your music and makes you go back to turn it on, even if you didn't watch the video (which I won't do on principle of you aren't going to let me choose when to start it)"
2393,K108854,"December 23, 2016",2,"No Thanks to the New Update I appreciate the enthusiasm over the new update, but I am sorry to say that I don't like it. Not at all, really. The layout is just too big, and it doesn't say whether my pictures are from Facebook or Instagram. And this may be a doll thing to whine about, but I do not like that the widescreen pictures are automatically blown up to full-screen, so that I have to tap to zoom out. It's a nice idea, and I still love Timehop, but the sliding, Snapchat-story-esque theme is just too much. Now it just seems like too much of an effort to slide through to receive my ""streak""‚ÄîI'd much rather go back to the simpler navigation. Thank you."
2394,Emily19373,"December 25, 2016",1,"New Update is awful Please BEGGING the people who created the app to go back to the way it was. Cleaner and more sensible and have the time the stuff wont even load now with the new update so I can't even see what I want to see and its miserable. Go back to the old update, this new update is such a fail. Even worse, theres no way to report a problem with the new update since theres literally nowhere to click except to share a picture That won't even load that would always load with the old update. I would have rated this app five stars until the new update. Dont know how else to reach the creators except through here since the app has no option, GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY BEGGING YOU"
2395,Abbbbbbbple,"December 30, 2016",1,"Hate the update I don't normally do this but the last update bothered me so much that I just had to rant somewhere. This update did 0 benefits for everyone. Pictures will show up on my timehop and I will be very confused with their meaning because there's no captions. I used to look forward to opening my timehop each day but now it just pisses me off and I only do it to keep my streak going. There was no benefit to this change at all and I feel trapped, being forced to go back and forth between posts rather than to scroll and look at whatever I want. This may work for some people and that's great but it does not work for me and I lost any sort of interest I had in timehop previously."
2396,Dj-jazzy-Dee,"January 5, 2017",5,Hate the new update. I hate the new update. Timehop has been hoe I start my day for the last several years. But the new one is ridiculous! You no longer have the text that goes along with the photo. And you don't have all the pictures from the day--just a few and you can't enlarge them. Today is the anniversary of my city's fire station. But timehop only gave me three of the pictures and I couldn't see any of them. 
2397,iMrSimonSays,"January 16, 2017",4,"Over all I can say I like it. I do slightly prefer the way it used to be. You got to see the photo as like the size of an instagram timeline pic, with the option to click it to see it full size. I did like that better. I like the new look of the way you can read the comments left from Facebook or instagram. The Snapchat style of going to the next picture is cool and modern. I guess only the I can say I don't like is the way you can't view the pictures in as many way as you used to."
2398,mmwitzke,"January 26, 2017",1,"Went from being my favorite app to unusable This used to be my favorite app and I checked it every day. Since they changed it from vertical scrolling to clicking for each image, it is TERRIBLE. The photos take forever to load, sometimes they never do, the videos are worse, the photos that do load are cut off OR are put in ridiculous picture frame mockups that are too small to see and don't let you zoom in. Plus the experience of clicking on every single 'slide' and waiting for loading means it takes four times as long to check this app, so I end up giving up after a few photos. Seriously developers, what were you thinking!?"
2399,ggizer,"September 4, 2017",3,"It was fine before the update I loved and enjoyed this app up until this last update. I got at least 20 people to download over the past few years. I have no idea why they changed the scrolling to tapping and swiping right. It doesn't make sense, you scroll through time. And I can pick and choose which ones I want to look at. I shouldn't have to look at every single memory before I see one from 5 years ago. I liked going back and forth. Now I give up after three taps to the past. Hope you change it back."

2402,Lo2028,"June 25, 2015",4,"Overall great app I love this app! It's fun to see pictures & posts from years past--especially the ones that I have completely forgotten about! I will say the only downside now is that it will automatically crop your photos when you try to upload them & it tends to crop people out. I have started to do a screen shot & crop it myself or save the picture to my camera roll & adjust it that way. It's just somewhat annoying to have to do this extra step, but I still really like this app anyways."
2403,Cierra Cherie,"July 7, 2015",5,Look how far you've come TimeHop is a great way to see your journey thus far. The story that we have is so powerful and having the ability to be able to look back to where you once were to where you are but most importantly who you are now is paramount in the human experience that we call life. For better or for worse I can reflect at the past but find power in the present because of the hope that lies in the future.
2404,tas81,"January 10, 2017",5,"Would give negative stars if allowed.. This recent update is AWFUL! I used to look forward to opening this app everyday and seeing the pictures that popped up but now I loathe it. You have turned a wonderful daily treat into a nuisance. Pictures and videos take forever to load (if they load at all, that is). Pictures keep flashing between images making it impossible to figure out what you are even looking at. GO BACK TO THE PRIOR VERSION!!!"
2405,Jess Slade,"February 28, 2017",1,Frustrating Update Update: Now whenever I open Timehop it automatically flips through all my photos before they even load. This app is absolute crap. Now I can't even LOOK at the pictures. Please do better legwork before releasing your absolute crap updates.

One, my pictures are always zoomed in and I have to zoom out to properly see them. Two, I don't like where you have to click to move on to your next photo, it often skips a few or accidentally I click and it goes to the previous one. And lastly I hate that any time I update the app I lose my streak for however many days in a row I had been viewing my memories. I will not update this app again and waste storage space."
2408,Shdjdndbsk,"June 2, 2017",1,"Ew The new version is gross. It is a nightmare of an update. It  made me want to immediately delete the app before I had even gone through the whole day's memories. Everything is huge and hideous. The swiping and tapping is too similar to my least favorite part of Snapchat where you have to swipe and tap the stories. That is a part of that app I will never use and if this app stays the same way, I won't use it at all.  It makes no sense. The only reason there are any reviews above 1 star is because some people haven't updated it yet. Put it back, dinosaur!"
2409,halfaheartx3,"March 8, 2018",1,Horrible interface makes app unusable I used to love this app until I was forced to upgrade to the latest version in order to even use the app. The upgraded version is awful. The paginated view is the worst thing to happen to this app. No one wants to swipe right to left to see one update per page. Even snapchat updated to a scrolling interface like every other social media app there is. Please bring back scrolling instead of one update per page and then maybe I'd keep this app. But right now it's not worth the inconvenience. You need to live by the KISS motto; keep it simple stupid. The simple layout of the old version was much cleaner and much nicer to look at.
2410,Tupelo1835,"October 28, 2015",2,Ummm what happened here?? Why can I not share pictures to FB like I could before?  Why are they only allowed to be shared within the app?  That makes no sense.  I can share old posts and status updates but not ypictures???  Why would I want to share pictures within the app?  Who would see that?  The whole point of connecting to FB or IG is so that you can share with your friends.  Where are the friends to connect to within the app?  I don't see that anywhere.  So who sees pictures?  Nobody from what I can tell.  But never fear they can see your old status updates and wall posts! Bring back the old version!!!

Why would you all go and change something that was working JUST FINE?!?! If it's NOT broke, DON'T fix it!!! Sure, you have to update to keep up with technology and the occasional bug fix, but why go in and completely change things so much so that I can't even share ""MY PHOTOS"" to Facebook anymore... Why would I want to share photos within the App?

You can't see what's actually going on in the picture and 2. Everything is grainy and distorted? This makes zero sense. Plus, you can't save images to your phone anymore without the app freezing up.

I never ever do reviews but being that one of my favorite apps is now horrible, bad enough to delete it, I have to write in hopes they will change is back. I loved the ability to scroll down, to see the full picture without the freakish huge shots you have to hold to zoom out. What's the reasoning behind that?  All text connected to pictures is lost. I liked being able to see what I had written with a picture. Now I have text on a separate screen that makes no sense!! I liked the feature of being able to see what other people responded. That is now lost. This is very poorly done. Why fix what wasn't broken? Please redesign this!"

I used to laugh at what I said and enjoy looking at my timehop and now I can't get into the depth of it."
2419,J4mull,"December 30, 2016",1,"Update made this app horrible to use! I tried to give the update some time for me to get use to the changes but it was to no avail. The update has made the experience of using this app frustrating and intolerable. WHY, for the love of God, would people want their pictures already zoomed in so they have to tap and hold each and every single picture to see the whole thing?! Also, I preferred seeing all my pictures grouped by year so I could scroll and choose which picture to view instead of having to tap, hold, and swipe through all pics to find out if there was another memory to see. I really hope these updates are reconsidered and changed."

But now that I have to swipe up to see the pictures and the person across the room can now read my tweets because they are so big in text is crazy.  I can see where Snapchat was going with this update but needs so adjustments. I liked how I could scroll quick through all of my tweets and pictures were easy to see. Now it's not convenient at all and is frustrating! Please fix this or just go back to the way it was, until it's fixed. I'm glad I'm not the only one that is upset with this. It's annoying! Please fix! Thanks!"
2425,Memaw Nalley,"January 4, 2017",5,Hate the new version and updates Please go back to the old version. The new version is confusing and hard to share. Sometimes I just get the written post and no photos. I even go photos that said it was 16 years ago. No way that was accurate. This is the worst. I enjoyed this app but not now. Like someone said in a previous review Don't Fix What isn't Brokenüòñ‚òπÔ∏è most pictures and videos I can't share why.. it is awful
2426,Lbs2,"January 23, 2017",3,"Only giving three stars for nostalgia I really wanted to give one star. My Timehop isn't even working anymore. The circle doesn't even spin to ""collect my memories"". It just opens and sits there on that yellow screen. I agree with all the reviewers before me. Why fix what wasn't broken?  I want to see my old thumbnails in order, not randomly picked ones scattered across my screen. Scrolling worked for everyone. The swiping doesn't. Also when I go to look at comments, it swipes half the time. Not very user friendly. Fix it!!  Timehop is in my morning routine!"
2427,Lsrao,"February 5, 2017",1,"Terrible!! UPDATE-  it got better got a while, no great just better, and now it's back to crap.  Why is everything so zoomed in???   You can't see the full picture.   The individual frames are horrible too.   Go back to the original version that WORKED! "
2428,Tommy.DiPietro,"March 15, 2017",1,"Disappointed Update 4.0.7: Can't believe TimeHop continues to ignore the 1 star rating in the App Store. Are you guys being held at gun point to not change the app? You delete any correspondence when asking on social media platforms. Just change it back already, I cannot find one legitimate reason not to. The new UI is NOT GOOD FOR US. WE DON'T LIKE IT. "
2429,Kk100315,"April 4, 2017",1,"Awful The new update didn't help at all. You need to go back to the original set up and show all content. It's annoying that I know I have Facebook pictures or statuses because of the ""on this day"" feature on Facebook, but when I go to Timehop it decides not to show those. I hate the swipe instead of scrolling. The one day I had uploaded an album of about 50 pictures to Facebook and on Timehop I had to sit here and swipe each picture. I like scrolling and seeing the year and being able to decide if I wanted to view each individual picture. Please go back to the other format!! All the reviews are asking for this, so why are you not listening?"
2430,cmmcguire,"February 18, 2015",5,"Love it! It's like opening a time capsule every day. For me it goes back as far as 7 years. I love it. Reliving moments and photos with friends, family, from school, vacations, it's great. I especially love to see all my silly tweets that I've forgotten about, and some that actually meant a lot to me when they occurred. Every day I'm excited to see what's gonna pop up. You can connect as few or as many accounts to the app as you want and that's what makes it so great."

2432,Lysbet,"August 4, 2015",4,"Great app to have to access memories I really would give this app 4 1/2 stars if that was an option. My only suggestions would be 1) that the app have the capability to hide pictures that were deleted from social media (rather than showing a spot & saying photo has been deleted by owner) & 2) adding the capability to look back a week in case we miss a day (maybe this already exists but I couldn't find it easily). However, those are minor points - this is one of my favorite apps."
2433,Carlanay,"September 8, 2015",5,"Selective Posting Let me start by saying I love the concept. Love looking back at the memories! However someone or something at Timehop is judging my posts. Consistently giving me a friendly message that my post has been removed because ""I'm trying for a career in politics"" when I look back at the post date it has all been religious not political. Asking for prayers, sharing a motivational quote or post. So hmm makes me wonder what's up with this app?? Who is judging my memories!!"

2435,Combsfam6,"October 23, 2016",1,"Disappointed I am actually shocked that Time Hop monitors what it chooses to show. This post was acceptable to Face Book. I don't use profanity, bad pictures or anything that would offend anyone other then a left wing ideologist. I guess TH only believes in the First Amendment for the left. Why are they in the business of politics?"
2436,Gnat62189,"December 27, 2016",1,"New update is awful I always lived Timehop and found it to be more comprehensive than Facebook's memories because Timehop looks at your many different accounts. However, I've highly considered getting rid of it since the recent update. I can no longer see the text that goes with a photo posting or who commented on it or liked it. The app presented a short ""guide"" but things are still not very navigable. I particularly hate how a photo posting first presents zoomed in and you have to zoom out to see it fully. What is that?? It's not pleasing to the eye at all. It's like they're trying to be Snapchat and it's awful. At least Snapchat makes more sense. Timehop's version is not great at all."
2437,ScandalousZebra3,"January 20, 2017",1,"I HATE THIS UPDATE STILL This is a disaster. I hate it. I don't want to only be able to see one post at a time, and have to zoom in or out constantly to be able to actually see what I'm looking at. And why can't I share videos? Only posts and pictures?? HORRIBLE JUST revert back to what it was before. If it ain't broken don't fix it! Seriously. This is the worst."
2438,VickiMac,"February 4, 2017",1,"HORRIBLE!!! Completely unusable!!! I hadn't used my timehop in a couple months but remembered how fun it was to look back on my memories from forever ago. Tried to use it this morning and they've turned it into this awful, completely non-functional Snapchat-wannabe thing. Let me see a list of my memories like before!! Idk why they changed the format but it is TERRIBLE!! I'm not the kind of person who writes reviews on apps or whatever but it's so painfully bad now when it used to be so cool and I have no idea why the timehop people would intentionally sabotage their own product. Officially deleting this app and never using it again!!! Garbage!!! If you're thinking about downloading it, DON'T!!!"

2440,Pegcoat,"February 11, 2015",4,"One thing The one thing I wish I was able to do is when there are a group of pictures or album from a certain day, that I could post more than one picture at a time. I do like your app. Some of my Facebook friends might be tired of me re-posting pics from the past few years, but I not only like to see my pics, but also see my statuses. They give me a good view of where my head was at then. Sometimes I'm like 'OMG, I'm still doing this?', and sometimes I think 'Man, I've come a long way'."
2441,TalkingFlowerDrew,"June 2, 2015",5,"Favorite Feature I love this app and I love being able to look back and see what I was posting about on the exact day that I posted it. I also like that deleted photos show up. Like, as long as someone liked or commented on the photo previously it has a record and it shows up. It doesn't show the actual photo, it just says it was deleted, but it has who liked the photo and what the comments were, which I like."
2442,Audbug,"June 22, 2015",5,"Love this! This is such a great app! I love waking up each morning and visiting TimeHop to see my own ""this day in history"". I really enjoy seeing how the children have grown and changed over the years and its fun to have those ""Oh, I remember THAT moments!""  (AS an unintended benefit, I'm now Very careful about writing vague posts.  Four years from now I won't remember the story behind ""some people need to grow up"". Highly recommend this app.  Oh yes, and I have no trouble with installing and running it."

2444,ANGRY CHRISTIAN MOM,"December 25, 2016",1,"So bad I had to say something I've never ever in my life wrote a review or given a rating for an app, but the new update has forced my hand. Please fix the update. The new layout is hard to control, you can't click on the memory to go to it, and it won't show you the caption so you are unable to see the context of the image. Plus, if there is a picture is zooms to fit the size of the screen and you have to hold down to zoom out which doesn't make sense. You can share a memory like normal but you can't share the caption that was with it previously. I'm currently on a 35 day streak and if it wasn't for that and for it being the holidays, I would delete the app."
2445,Tnrakm1213,"December 28, 2016",1,"Please release new update Just echoing what others have said about the most recent update, which is terrible. I would voice similar complaints about the default zoomed feature, the single photo (flop) versus continuous stream, and the loss of comments and captions, except that I have been able to view only about 10% of my memories the past few days. On both cellular and wifi (so not a service issue), Timehop has not been loading all of my memories. I flip through blank grey screens with the year designation up top. First time I've ever left a review on an app because this is the first time an app has really let me down. Please revert back to original user face!!"
2446,Creative nicknam,"January 1, 2017",1,"Update needs to change I don't usually write reviews but this new update is awful. I've tried to give myself time to adjust, but each time I open the app I find myself getting more and more annoyed and wanting to delete the app. The zoom feature makes absolutely NO sense and I won't even waste time explaining why. The way tweets are now displayed is jarring and displeasing to the eye. I can no longer see captions and conversations which makes the app all but useless. It is harder to save photos and videos- the list goes on and on. This was a bad update, acknowledge you messed up and do a new update! Nothing wrong with change but this is just silly."
2447,Yardpickles,"January 7, 2017",2,"Great at first, new design is awful I used to love this app but ever since they changed the design and everything really about the way it works it's been awful. I don't like having to tap through my pictures instead of scroll and you can't see what the caption was for the original picture. If you try to zoom in on any picture and slide your finger to look around in a big group picture, it just swipes to the next memory. I'll still use it for a little while to see if they fix anything, but I probably won't use it much after the next month or so if nothing changes."
2448,Slicksade5,"January 8, 2017",1,"Time hop update is awful The update for Timehop ruined the app. Not only does no one want to tap through the years like every other social media, but even worse is that you aren't even getting the full benefit of seeing what you posted! Only the first half of my tweets are shown, so I don't actually know what they say, when a picture tweet is on their with several pictures only the first one shows up, the picture tweets also don't have the tweeted text to go with them so they often make no sense. I will give this app maybe 2 more weeks to get the stuff together and make a decent update, but after that, it's bye bye timehop aka worst app since the soda pouring app."
2449,LizzieBug2015,"January 20, 2017",5,"Good app gone bad This was my absolute favorite app until the update came out it was so much easier to share memories, and now I can't even look at a picture without trying to make it smaller because everything is so magnified. I'm able to share pictures but when it comes to videos I can watch them but not share at all. I wish you guys would bring back the old time hop it was so much better!"
2450,TheClayfox,"October 24, 2012",5,"Beautifully designed and executed If you're reading this review, you probably already know that your favorite email to receive every day is from Timehop. Take that experience to the next level with the app. This is easily one of the best designed and executed apps I've seen in a while, and I design apps for a living (I didn't design this one, but I wish I could claim it). Sleek, simple, and powerful. Stop reading and start using this app. You can thank me later."
2451,Ashleyrfd,"May 2, 2013",3,"Pretty good It's an absolutely wonderful concept for an app. I love seeing back at the things I've posted several years back. However, I do not like the fact that unless I post the app posts for my friends to see then I can never relook at them. Just because I don't want to repost for everyone to see I would like to look back. Also, if I am not able to check it one day then I just completely missed out on any posts from that day. I wish that would be changed. Lastly, I just would like for the new day to be updated earlier. Otherwise, I love timehop :)"
2452,elSullivano,"February 23, 2014",4,"Fantastic and fun, but I miss the messages service I love getting my Timehop every day. I used to share it easily with my other friends who are on Timehop with the messages feature, commenting and chatting about each one shared. Now that it's gone, I have to copy the link to the Timehop and text it to them, even if they also use Timehop. It's cumbersome and a step backward. I rarely use it to share to Facebook or Twitter and never use it for Instagram (who would?) but I used the messages feature every day. Love Timehop, but I miss messages."
2453,Momof2Cs,"December 30, 2016",1,"I'd give it no stars for the new update!!! (But it makes me put one.) First, let me say I've never written a review for an app. But the update on Timehop is so awful that I had to state my opinion. I have loved Timehop for over two years now. I looked forward to seeing the memories every day. The layout was easy and it showed all my photos and captions. Now it is terrible! The layout, the swiping, the zoomed in photos, they don't show all the photos from each day, every part of the update is a disappointment. There weren't just a few tweaks, they completely changed the whole thing. It's like a bad new app that I wouldn't choose to use. Please bring back the old app!!!"

It used to be a favorite thing each morning to look at and now I want to cringe at the slow speed. I work in development. Did anyone test this?  Also who thought it would be good to randomly select a few pics to show smaller on one screen but then I can enlarge nor share these pictures?????  Ugh. Please revert to last version.
2456,cs740504,"January 4, 2017",1,"The new update ruined the app In my opinion, the most recent update ruined the app. I LOVED timehop before this update and now I'm thinking of deleting the app from my phone entirely. I would've given the app 5 stars before this update. I've never written an app review before but I felt like I had to because this new update is TERRIBLE. The most frustrating part is the automatic zoom on all photos and that you can no longer see text that was accompanied with that photo on the post (e.g., any retweets that had photos in the tweet only show the photo. This means nothing to me since it wasn't my original photo and I have no idea why this random photo is part of my memories). PLEASE FIX."
2457,CCuevas2,"January 11, 2017",2,"Used to love the app, new update is terrible I think the idea of the app is great and I used to love it. The new update makes it difficult to see the photos because you have to press down to see the whole thing. Now, the app doesn't give the share option on all photos which is the main function of the app. Also, if multiple photos were posted in previous years they all show up on the same timehop page which doesn't allow the share option for the individual photos. Will be deleting the app, especially since Facebook offers comparable history."
2458,ishii106,"January 11, 2017",5,Ouch I've been using this app for a very long time. The new update is flashy but not user friendly. I wish app gave options to which style we would like to use. Being able to use tile style views would of been great

I loved Timehop so much but I'm not sure ü§î what you guys are thinking or how the app works on your devices but it works awful on iOS 10 and I would suggest going back a couple upgrades to the older features but make the app stable in order to work with iOS 10. This was a app that did not need an overhaul but a app that was a classic that should have stayed that way. I'm deleting this app because half the time the pics don't show up and I'm annoyed.

I think that on each 10th day like 40th day and 80th day etc they should do something fun to the app. like the app changes to black and white or every time you tap something glitter pops up. I don't know something cool to keep me wanting my streak like ""oh what will happen next"" just saying"
2467,ocelot225,"December 23, 2016",1,"Please give a traditional UI option I've loved Timehop for the past two or so years that I've had it. I think it's a brilliant idea and taps into nostalgia nicely. That said, I don't like the new update. I don't want to scroll through each individual post, i would rather just have them listed out as before. Furthermore, having each post have a colored background around the text is very distracting and I can't seem to find a way to view the comments on old posts. If at all possible, please either revert the UI or at least give the option to use the old one. I appreciate your team's work, but this change feels arbitrary and messes with a well made app."

2469,paperbuildings,"June 14, 2017",1,"Why? When flooded with negative reviews, it's confusing to me why developers wouldn't take things into consideration. The update is cluttered, and when you're using it to look at past tweets, it takes so long if you tweeted a lot in a day. Not only that, but the lack of replies and conversations are missed as well. Luckily I had an older update of version 3 in iTunes and I was able to downgrade from there. There are glitches (tweets being truncated and issues with images), but it's certainly better than what's presented in version 4. Maybe it's time to listen to your user base and take a step back instead of fixing something that wasn't broken."

2472,katiecfife,"December 27, 2016",1,"Why? Pretty much the only reason I'm not deleting now that this update has happened is because Facebook won't give me access to their memory feature. There's no context to any posts, I only get weird upclose shots of pictures by default and it's annoying to have to zoom out every slide, and my streak count is all crazy. I've been on the same number streak since the update came out. I don't even want to check Timehop with this update anymore though so I guess that won't really matter anymore. Who came up with these changes and thought, ""Yes, this is a really good idea!""??? Cause that person needs to seriously reconsider their decision making process."
2473,swordfish133,"December 27, 2016",1,"New update isn't very good I get that sometimes new updates require some time to get used to, but typically updates improve the current service even if they make it different in some way. Viewing photos is now an annoying hassle because for some reason they are completely zoomed in. Same with Facebook statuses. You have to zoom out to view the entire thing and it adds unnecessary clicks and swipes to what was once a seamless experience. If you read any of the other one star reviews you'll see it being said many times and in many ways but it basically boils down to this new update is less functional than the old."
2474,Runhappy86,"December 31, 2016",1,Awful Nothing about this update made this app great. I didn't enjoy that you created a gif of two of my pictures. I couldn't enjoy looking back at either picture because it kept flashing back and forth between the two. I don't understand why everything is zoomed in. Full screen doesn't work for every picture. Why did the app only choose 3 photos out of 30 for a collage with no option of seeing the other 27? The only reason I know there were 27 other photos from that day in my past is because Facebook lets me see all 30. Scroll or swipe is fine but all the big changes are terrible and make me dislike this app.

I swipe and it shows settings with Facebook, etc marked but nothing happened. What in the hell were the programmers thinking? Let's make updates until the app becomes unusable - think of the ads we can sell! It'll be huge! Does Trump have something to do with this? It's true the whole world as lost its mind!"

2482,Proudmammaoftwo,"May 7, 2015",3,Fix I love this app I really do but it signed me out bout a week ago and I couldn't sign back in and it's saying that I need to grant access to my stuff which it does cuz I've been using this app for a while so I thought if I uninstalled and than reinstall it it would work but it's not even letting me download it and I've been trying to do it since last night I would love to continue to use this app if it would actually work the way it's suppose to be please fix the problem or I will find another app that'll do the same thing this one does
2483,Loysville,"July 11, 2015",4,"Time hopping with Abe! So far I like this App, I like that I can see pix I have not seen in a while. It also reminds me about people who I haven't chatted with in a while. And all of the cute things Abe does are just darling. Is there anyway to connect MySpace? I have so much stuff I haven't been able to access. It would be great to finally be able to access them again."
2484,Darkstarprojects,"October 5, 2015",2,"It's a good App, but has its problems. I don't write reviews often, but I felt I should do it for this app.  I like the app for my once a day time travel fun, but me personally, I don't use it but more than once.  My biggest complaint about the app is the little timehop icon on the lower left side of my lock screen when I first look at my phone in the morning.  The other issue I have is the notification in the multitask screen.  My biggest complaint is that I can't turn these off, I don't care or want a constant notification telling me to check my timehop.  If I could turn this off, it would be a non-issue."
2485,Sweetskst,"November 20, 2015",4,It's a nice app! Just one thing though... I really like Timehop; the one thing I don't like is that when it has videos and you share for example to Facebook it don't show so people have to click on the link so most won't even bother looking or if text message one they have to click on a link and usually don't want to bother with that. If it actually showed the video like it does when we see it on our app that would be a better feature! Otherwise it's a great!
2486,TheLoveOfTravel,"December 19, 2015",4,"Walk down memory lane for 1st year During the 1st year the app was fantastic. I rarely went a day without checking it to see my past 5+ years of posts; however, that magic fades once you've seen them. Now I get constant ""notifications"" (which I hate seeing numbers on my apps). Considering deleting the app due to the notifications but haven't yet because it's a nice app once in a while (except for when you try to post anything onto another social media...never works)."

2488,Daddysgirl9825,"December 30, 2016",1,DONT FIX IT IF IT WASNT BROKEN Like most of the recent reviews I don't review unless absolutely necessary. This new update is a waste of time. I do still get on it but I don't enjoy it as much! I hate how everything is so zoomed in. I also just noticed how it will show me about three pictures from a certain day that fb shows me about 50. And the ones it shows me aren't as important as the others where. It was showing Christmas pictures but that was the year I got a car and one of the last set of pictures I have of my recent passed away dog. It didn't let me view them or give me an option to view the rest. It is ridiculous. Give me back the old time hop!!
2489,Katatat64,"December 31, 2016",1,"New update is awful! Please stop trying to make it seem like Snapchat. The original format and layout of the app was great the way it was and easy to view the photos. I don't like how I have to swipe up to see the whole image, and it's super tiny to view. Also, what's with all of the ads?? I get that the app is free but there never used to be ads. Timehop has gone from one of my favorite apps to now a horribly designed one that I'm just trying to skip through so that the notification will go away. It's almost not even worth having anymore. Please go back to the original interface or find a different way to display the photos and videos."

2491,Hi Akuma [[Walking Contradiction]],"February 4, 2015",4,"Good...but should update the day a little sooner I look at this app everyday and laugh at how stupid I use to be with my friends. However if I happen to be around 4 in the morning and go to check it, I'm still looking at stuff from yesterday's time hop. And sometimes I won't even get a notification that it updated til almost lunch time. Also, if you do happen to check time hop and see all of the new stuff for your new day, why does it still send a push notification? Like really?"
2492,kobraklean,"July 6, 2015",4,"Very amusing, could improve It's always fun to see the things you were posting years ago. This app is definitely better than Facebook's copycat 'memories' feature. My only complaint is that the facts they post are often quite lame. An app that accumulates this much attention should pay their fans back by really investigating facts relevant to each day and being very selective in what they post. Make it truly interesting. Tease me with a crazy fact that I will want to share with people. Dig deeper."
2493,c yanch,"July 19, 2015",5,"Great app. The Dino asked if anyone's reading his posts at the bottom. I do! ""I CURR""!  Great app, it's like a throwback every day. Thanks for all you've put into it. Also, if I can throw in my two cents, it'd be really nice if we could look back even farther to like 10 years. That would be excellent. And I too would like to see the ability to share the original likes and comments that went with a Facebook post. That would be cool too.  Thanks for reading!"
2494,SDPicha,"November 27, 2015",5,3 years max and deleted pics I love seeing old pics but mine only goes back 3 years and I've had my FB for almost 6 years now and Twitter I've had a lot longer; I'd love older pics to start showing up. Recently it tells me 50% of my photos have been deleted this is not the case.  Seems there needs to be some work done here and quickly as FB and Google photos are starting to provide a similar service.
2495,Peanydfh83,"December 24, 2016",1,"Timehop needs to go back in time This update is awful! One of the features I used to love about this app was reading the caption that went with the photo. It was a sweet memory of why this photo was posted on this day, years ago. Now it's a bunch of blown up photos, with no possibility of knowing the caption. Speaking of blown up photos... what's with the giant photos? It's such a hassle to zoom out just to see the photo. Some of the photos that are already a closeup are now even worse. Click to zoom out?!?!? Why not- click to zoom in!! And the clicking! So much clicking! I miss the old Timehop! I used to love visiting this app.... the enjoyment is gone! Bring back old features!!"
2496,timehopper1219,"December 24, 2016",1,"this isn't snapchat... I absolutely hate this update. i don't like the concept of having to tap through my memories. pictures will come up in my memories that i know i put on Facebook or Twitter, but it won't show the caption or comments or anything besides the picture. i think the worst part is that you can't see comments on anything; that's the best part about reliving our memories! I don't want Timehop to be like Snapchat, the concept of tapping through your memories kind of makes it feel like i don't care about my memories and i'm just tapping through to continue my streak. I don't like this at all, I hope we get a different format in the next update."
2497,Upbisb,"December 27, 2016",1,"Latest update is awful!!! This is actually my first review. I've had Timehop for a long time but I'm considering deleting it after this update. The photos are too big for the screen and you have to click on each one to zoom out to be able to see the whole thing. It also looks like you can now only share pictures and not videos. The majority of the time I'm sharing the videos so that is super irritating. There's really nothing I like about this update. Im not one to complain and I always try to give new updates a chance, but I can barely bring myself to open the app to give it a shot. Please bring back the old format!!"
2498,Tayleerichelle26,"December 28, 2016",1,"Unbelievably bad Everyone has already said it, but this new version is terrible. How the app developers could think that this is superior to the old format and feel like releasing this update was a good choice is beyond me. This version is not at all user friendly, it requires extra steps even just to see a full picture without the terrible forced zoom. Plus you can no longer see the captions that went along with the photos. The dude scrolling makes the app feel less like a timeline (hello, timehop? Thats like... your whole thing?!) and makes it harder to tell what post was from when. It's just annoying, as evidenced by the flood of reviews."
2499,rlwivell,"December 30, 2016",2,"Recent update...really poor The recent update makes Timehop feel really unintuitive and not user-friendly. Not only can you barely see your posts now that timehop blows them up to full screen, doing a weird cropping job, but any context from the original post is gone. This includes captions, links, etc. so if you wanted to see what that picture you posted is all about...you can forget about it. All you get is the picture. I know you're trying to be like snapchat, timehop, but you're not snapchat. So why don't you keep being timehop so people can actually use you. This is kinda bogus."
2500,Bowenas,"November 13, 2013",5,"I take that back... I previously wrote a negative review for this app because it wasn't letting me log in and I got very frustrated with how many errors I have received (I just want to see what ridiculous things I posted 3 years ago!). Timehop emailed me and offered ways to fix the problem (which worked!). I am impressed with their quick suggestions and customer (?) service when I was displeased. Well played, timehop! Now back to ReMiNiSciNgzzzz."
2501,!TacocaT!,"December 23, 2016",2,"New update is :/ I really like this app! I love being able to see what happened on this day in the past, but the new update it pretty bad, in my opinion. I don't like how it automatically zooms in and you have to hold to zoom out, bc then you have to zoom out on every picture to see the full thing. I also don't like how you can't see the captions that were on the pictures on instagram - that was one of the main reasons I liked it. I don't really think I'll use it that much anymore just because I want to be able to know what I said that day but can't anymore. Please fix it :/"

I'm unable to use the zoom feature as well as the share feature. And if there are multiple pictures on that day the share feature does not even show up as being available. But at least I can look at what happened on this day so many yrs ago... Please fix this update or go back to the way it was, thank you for your time and sharing all of my favorite memories with me!"
2504,TFrenz,"January 2, 2017",1,"The death of Timehop This update could be the death of Timehop. Given a few bugs that were rarely anything too major, the app was good before. Now, it's just awful. I think the thing I hate the most is how I can't click on a status to jump to the original post on Facebook to see the conversations that happened after that post now. And the full screen photos, no thanks. The design before just scrolling down was great. Now I have to click on anything an extra time if I want to see the full view. Hope this gets fixed before it's too late and no new users come around seeing too many low reviews to bother downloading."
2505,Tudey1,"January 4, 2017",1,"Hate the Update I loved Timehop. It was such a great way to scroll through memory lane, and my kids and I always sat down and looked through it together, since most of my posts are about them.  Ever since the update, I have had maybe two pictures show up from my timeline, and neither of them have been accompanied by any text at all, so you don't get any context with the images, and they show up super zoomed in, which is irritating too, even though I know you can zoom out by holding the image.  All in all, you broke something that didn't need fixed.  If it doesn't go back to how it used to be soon, I will be deleting it from my phone."
2506,Foursquarefan,"January 6, 2017",2,"New update is ruining my trip down memory lane I used to really love being able to see pictures from previous years and see what social media platform it was posted to. Now that feature is gone and the experience is still nice but a bit boring. You can't link back to your Instagram through pics and see the caption you originally posted with the pic, or comments, there's no weather feature, no linking back to tweets, it's just so bare bones now. Please go back to how it was!! I think you've seen enough reviews to know you'll lose people who have downloaded the app :/"

I've liked this app much better than Facebook's ""On This Day"" but, until this app is brought back to normal I won't be using it. (I can see by other reviews that I'm not alone.) Please bring the old version back. Thank you"
2508,Mls2259,"January 7, 2017",1,"Why?!? I have never written a review before, but I am so disturbed by what's been done to Timehop that I wanted to add my voice to all the others. The current version of the app really deserves 0 stars. I used to check Timehop every day, but since the update it has been alternately useless (not showing posts for certain days,) and unusable (not allowing me to view all pictures, access links, etc.,) and I have just now deleted the app altogether. If there were a way to get the old version again, I would happily re-install it, but that doesn't seem likely. Terribly done, Timehop team. You've ruined something great for no good reason. Sign of the times, I guess."
2509,Aes7777777777788888,"January 7, 2017",2,New Update Horrible Why make something more difficult to use? Why do I have to zoom out to see pictures? Also when I looked at the app this morning I could see that a picture was part of a FB post. Now that I updated I just see the picture and not the post anywhere even when I have to zoom out. So will I never see my posts with pictures again? Counterintuitive update.
2510,_Marinela,"July 9, 2013",2,"Too much work I was excited to try and see old posts but was disappointed within minutes. It kept saying there was nothing on my Facebook account en though it had already connected and I've been on Facebook for 5+ years. When I tried to connect to my twitter account it said I posted too much and it couldn't load until I went and downloaded the archive. Could I have done that? Yea. But it has to be through a computer which I didn't feel like having to go and do and then to upload it to time hop.  Call it laziness, I call it time consuming, unnecessary, and annoying."
2511,KimmCoyy,"December 11, 2014",3,"It needs MySpace!!! I was so excited to get this app because who doesn't like looking back at what they wrote and just laughing at themselves and how far they've come as human beings, but I was very disappointed in the fact that you could connect with MySpace because to be honest Facebook didn't even become popular until 2010 so before then we had MySpace all the funny things are on MySpace that's where most of us had our ""emo"" phases or ""gangster"" phases! I would love for time hop to be able to incorporate MySpace into this app, I feel that is all that's missing."

Looking at over 8 years of digital memories, pictures, Facebook posts, tweets, etc. is something I never knew I needed, but I find myself looking forward to my daily dose of nostalgia with surprise and delight. Seeing my children when they were little and reminiscing on where the time went, is sometimes bittersweet, but always a precious few moments of my day."

However, there always seems to be an issue: one week my videos won't show up, my photos are duplicated (or not there at all), or the app won't even work. Upon all of these issues, I've sent Timehop at least 5 or 6 emails trying to fix these issues over the years and I either get an extremely delayed (2+ weeks) response, or no response at all (not to mention the lack of effort put into some of the responses). This stuff needs to be improved!"

I posted a picture on Instagram a year ago today. when I looked on timehop today I saw nothing about that post. I checked in my settings and it says I'm connected with Instagram.  I'm also annoyed with the ads. at least put them at the bottom. that's not the first thing I want to see. timehop has lowered in quality over the past year and a half since I downloaded it. unimpressed."

Everyone has to be like FB, IG, Snapchat etc... This app tried so hard to be like Snapchat instead of its own original idea of simply scrolling through pictures that it destroyed itself. You would think after EVERYONE hated it and rated it the way all of those before me have, they would change it back, but no. So don't even waste your time downloading this app... This used to be a great app that I checked everyday, and looked forward to. I had this for a few years and loved it until now. Goodbye to TimeHop."

2520,Sammyy14,"January 1, 2017",2,"Annoying Update I've always really liked Timehop because I was able to easily go through and see what I posted, when, and with what captions, but now it's so much more difficult to see what I posted. What is the point of automatically zooming in on every picture? And why can we no longer click on a link and be taken to the social media posts in their respective apps? The new update is annoying. I know Snapchat changed the way we view stories, but there is no need for Timehop to be the same way. It's a different app for a reason. They serve COMPLETELY different purposes."

Every morning I wake up, drunk my coffee, and check out the friendly reminders of years gone by. In all actuality, I'll probably continue to check my Timehop, but with a new found air of disgusted reluctance. The layout after the last update is inconvenient, the flow they were trying to achieve has missed its mark, and photo formats are hideously overblown. Timehop, please take a good hard look at the difference in layout before and after the recent update. It makes no sense. "

Since you have made the changes to the app I get so frustrated looking at it. While I love to see my life in pictures every day I'm at the point where I'm going to delete it if it doesn't go back to the old way. This platform should not be viewed horizontally! Put it bs l to vertical scrolling. There are days when I have 100+ photos in a day and it takes FOREVER to move to the next time period. You fixed the zoom issue which is great but there are still issues with some photos loading and showing correctly. Go back to vertical scrolling or I'm DONE!

Bring back the up and down stream and get rid of the auto zoom feature please!

The new one looks more sleek on first glance but is a pain to navigate, and every time I try to save a pic or message a pic, the whole thing crashes. And why remove the frames that made the app fun? What was the point of all of this? Borderline unusable, which is annoying because I had talked your app up to many friends who have downloaded and are now questioning my judgement.

I believe that you guys should add a ""best of"" timeline where we users can favorite a memory. Save the date and time of a glorious moment on a timeline. Like someone's nephew or niece being born or a birthday or just an accomplishment to save and treasure for future Timehops to come. What I'm saying is that I believe we should have an option to favorite or ""star"" a moment in our history."

Things that I did, for instance, last summer that I was doing this summer. And it also showed me areas where I have grown vs areas where I have stayed stagnant. I would never manually go back and review five years of tweets or FB statuses. This app delivers them and shows me exactly what I need to move forward."

So I deleted the app and re-downloaded it. To which it now won't connect to my Facebook profile so I can't actually see the memories?? Is anyone else having this issue or know how to fix it.

This means when I'm looking at Timehop I have a lot of photos from a series that I usually like to scroll by quickly, scanning for one or two good ones to look at and share. Showing me every single photo one by one doesn't work at all. It would take me a whole hour to check a single day. I'm sad I don't have this app anymore."

The whole point of Timehop is to enjoy all your old memories, and now you can't even see your overall years. It's frustrating because what if you don't want to go through all 162 pictures you took on this day, 2 years ago? You can't skip, you just have to keep swiping. It's making the app a lot less fun to use. And why on earth is the default to be zoomed in so much? Who always wants to see a picture zoomed into somebody's face? I loved this app, but now every time I open it, I get a little more frustrated each time."
2539,Jack Lutz,"December 28, 2016",1,New update eliminates most of the info about the memory. Don't download this version. L 
2540,scdhome,"September 3, 2014",5,"Sentimental favorite! This is by far my new favorite app! Such a fun way to remember what you were up to a year ago, or even 8 years ago! (I forgot I'd been on Facebook that long!) I had some tech difficulties that I wrote in about & never heard back, but the issue with the pics loading seems to have corrected itself.  Other than that, I look forward to my TimeHop notifications every day! Very cool :)) **the trivia bits at the bottom are fun too!"
2541,the jenni,"March 5, 2015",5,"Love it I use this app mainly for my own personal enjoyment. I haven't noticed the cropped pics and other things that people are talking about when they are re-posting. I mostly just love the concept and the fun, and I thought it was so cool that they gave the option to skip Valentine's Day because of exes and such. If there are bugs, I haven't really noticed them and think the benefits far outweigh any of the picky things that people may harp on. Great job, guys!"
2542,Manda404,"December 28, 2016",1,"New update is terrible I never review apps but this update is absolutely terrible. Why should I have to zoom out to view a picture? And not being able to see comments is ridiculous. That's the whole point of looking back on memories! I was looking forward to seeing pictures from past Christmas events but they only would show a select few pictures or statuses. Why did that little alert that pops up telling me to look at my Timehop today tell me I had 30+ pictures to look at but only showed me 3 total in a little collage? If this doesn't change soon, I will be deleting this app after the new year."
2543,jmerk85,"December 29, 2016",1,"Awful This update is seriously the worst. None of my one year ago pictures loaded today. Every one of them was a grey screen. Everything is super zoomed in when things do load, and there's no way to see the comments and likes on each post. You're not even showing everything from each day. Then when you try to share something to Instagram, the image the app creates is too big and is cut off in the Instagram app. Why do you guys keep changing something that doesn't need changing? Just put it back the way it was, let us scroll to see our posts. Stop trying to fix something that wasn't broken. Garbage."
2544,mstyne,"December 29, 2016",2,From Superfan to Oh Dear. I've been a huge Timehop fan and advocate for several years now. Unfortunately the most recent update has taken most of the enjoyment out of the app for me.
2545,Mills04,"December 31, 2016",1,"The new version makes this app pointless. First time review here, but like many others I had to because the recent update is so terrible. The point of Timehop is to be able to look at back at your past posts and pictures. It is hard to achieve that at all with the new update. "
2546,iitsmel,"January 11, 2017",1,Fix this app We shouldn't have to try to click the line of text just right in order to see the whole post. This app is faulty. Bring back the whole post or this app is useless. If people don't like scrolling through long posts maybe they should control what they post on line a little better.
2547,Zooer13,"January 25, 2017",2,Don't like the change I don't think the new update improved the app. It made it less desirable to scroll through. I used to be able to share all the pictures that were in Timehop but now for some reason random pictures can't be shared. They have also started to group pictures together in a sort of slideshow but won't allow us to share the group or the single pictures. Debating deleting it since they updated it really don't like the changes they made. If everything was shareable and it wasn't crazy zoomed in all the time I would like it much more
2548,Biglank41,"February 8, 2017",1,Go back to the old version!!! I loved the app before but the new update is garbage. People loved the app the way it was leave it alone!!! The new app is absolute trash. If it is not set back in the next few days I'll be deleting it. I don't understand why you keep doing this you have an app that people enjoy and then you go and mess it up. You totally changed it to crap. The big grip with the last big change was you couldn't look at comments and likes and you changed it back. Now you have gone and done it again. Are you dumb or just plain stupid? The people told you what they want but you are still dead set on changing it. Idiots.
2549,MidnightShadows,"April 7, 2017",1,"Used to be a favorite app, now I hate it Timehop is so unbelievably terrible now, I honestly can't imagine what they were thinking. Swiping through to see every picture instead of being able to scroll is tedious and unbearable. I take thousands of pictures, it is excruciating to be forced to swipe through 40 variations of the same flower or selfie. I usually end up closing the app before I even make it all the way through my memories. "
2550,‚Üñüîù8‚É£üé¶‚Üô4‚É£,"August 8, 2014",1,"kind of disappointed I saw all my friends posting old embarrassing pictures of eachother from timehop so I downloaded the app. after I downloaded it I realized you can only sign in through Facebook, I don't have a Facebook. but I had heard that other people had gotten their Instagram or twitter archive downloaded onto timehop so I googled how to do that because me & all my friends have Instagram so I thought it'd be funny. no one said a relevant way to download an Instagram OR twitter archive. so basically this app is irrelevant unless you have Facebook, & let's be honest, most people in my school delete theirs after a certain grade. so I highly request having an Instagram option?"
2551,Chauntie314,"February 4, 2015",5,"Loving Time Hop I love this app especially some of the crazy comments I use to make when I was younger. The pictures are refreshing to see because you don't think to go back and look at them, and the statuses from social media are priceless. I think that it would be great to be able to see them earlier like at 3 or have a period of days available in the event I wanted to still share the memories days later."
2552,Scorpprime88,"May 11, 2015",5,"A New Essential What a seemingly simple concept...show what you posted a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, and more on this day. But WOW if this hasn't become an essential part of my morning routine!"
2553,jackweebrown,"August 29, 2015",5,"I use it every day! Time hop is so wonderful. I love going back and seeing everything I've ever posted on that day! You can even see posts that were once there, but I may have deleted later. It's so cute. I check it every morning. The only downside, I'm not a huge fan of the wallpapers. When I want to share an old post, I don't like the cheesy wallpaper that goes along with it. Nothing that stops me from using though."
2554,TaraDodaro,"November 21, 2015",4,"We can share again When timhop did the update a month ago you couldn't share your memories. That was a bummer because I shared picture, videos, and status. Now that things are back to normal I'll give it a good rating. It's just a look back at what you were doing or feeling up to 6 years ago. I like that....I see stuff I posted 2 years ago and I think to myself ""omg, I can't believe I had said that on FB or posted that pic"". It's a fun app and one I look at everyday."
2555,vfranklin429,"November 2, 2016",4,4/5 Timehop is a great app.  I love being able to see my posts from the past.  The thing that frustrates me though is that they keep changing how you share and save. Today I wanted to share a video from last year to instagram.  I can't save it to my phone though or post it to instagram.  Also when you save photos to camera roll there's no option to save them without the timehop watermark and year stamp.  If these things were fixed I'd give the app 5 stars.
2556,Becsface,"December 24, 2016",1,"New timehop is awful I want to be excited about the new timehop, but I can't be. All my favorite things about using this app were taken away with the update. I can't see how many likes a status got, I can't read any comments that were left on anything (or even see if there are comments, which was my absolute favorite thing about the precious version). Having each post take up the whole screen? It's only the first day and it already drives me nuts. And I can't even see what I wrote about the pictures. I hate everything about this update. So much that, unless it gets a whole lot better, I'm not going to waste my time with it anymore."
2557,Shanntravs,"December 24, 2016",1,"Yikes New update is terrible. I never wrote a review before but had to because of all the features that have been taken away. It's hard to tell which of my memories came from the camera roll, it doesn't let you access the comments or amount of likes from each post, and the pictures are horribly zoomed in and I can't zoom all of them out. It also is super sensitive to any kind of touch so that when I'm looking at one picture and touch it the wrong way, the settings page or next picture will pop up when I wasn't trying to do that. Please bring back old layout.  Much cleaner and easier to navigate."
2558,Disappointed7988,"December 26, 2016",1,"New Update is Awful I NEVER review any app-but this new update left me so annoyed that I couldn't leave it alone. Sometimes trying to be like other apps; Snapchat, doesn't always work. The swiping and sliding takes 20 minutes to get back in time-which is the whole premise of the app. The pictures and status's used to be easy to look at and grouped together by year and now it's just a burden to get through. I can't believe people thought this was a good idea-whoever developed this new update clearly should go work for another app. After using this app for years it seems like a lot of people will be using it less and less, including me. ‚úåüèºÔ∏è"
2559,HiMeem,"December 26, 2016",1,"Cumbersome & Confusing Update Everyone else has already detailed the many changes in this app that have taken it from being enjoyable & fun to cumbersome & frustrating. I most miss the ability to quickly scroll through all my photos & then zero in on the ones I want to take a closer look at. Also, I absolutely hate that I have to zoom out on EACH AND EVERY photo to make sure that I'm not missing something/someone in the photo...which is often the case; and that I have to swipe through each photo one at a time.... too time consuming! Please do the right thing and bring back the apps functionality & fun. Thank you."
2560,Sarahizzett2,"June 22, 2014",4,Not completely accurate I have noticed that a lot of my previous birthday posts are showing up on time hop a day or two earlier than the actual birthday. At first I thought that maybe I had posted the birthday on the wrong day last year but then when I went back and check my FB I had posted on the correct day. So sometimes my TimeHop tends to be a day or two off of the actual day. Sometimes there are posts up to 3 yrs back and other times up to 5 yrs back.
2561,bayleebon,"December 28, 2016",1,"t e r r i b l e Love timehop as I'm a sucker for nostalgia but the newest version of timehop is awful. You can't click to see the original post, pictures START zoomed in and you have to hold to zoom out, if there's a set of pictures and you want to see more you're out of luck (especially because you can't go back to the original post???), captions on photos don't show up....being able to scroll through memories and see them all was great when you wanted to screenshot to share a set of memories but not you'd have to send individually if the memory is even with the effort. all around there has been no visible benefit to this change whatsoever."
2562,dawnmess,"December 30, 2016",5,"Went from loving it to hating it in a single update Please, Abe, I beg you. Bring back the old TimeHop layout or at least make 'old' and 'new' layouts selectable in preferences. Photos are 90% clipped incorrectly. I don't want another Snapchat!  The white text on colored bands looks terrible. Your folks need to admit this update was a disastrous mistake and at least give us the option to have the old view. This used to be one of my favorite apps!"
2563,My_xintiao,"December 31, 2016",1,"Truly horrendous I've been wanting to write my frustrations out about the new update since the day it came out but have been trying my best to like it. It's not working. This update was the most terrible thing you could do to timehop. This app is best suited in a scrolling fashion, having to tap to every single memory makes no sense. Also WHY ZOOM IN ON THE PHOTOS? MAKES NO SENSE. What's the point of showing a portion of the picture if I can't even see the caption with it??? I get having to keep up with new trends and stuff but whoever came up with this design should be fired. Do everyone a favor and go back to the old look. It was 100% more effective and efficient."
2564,Sk4910,"January 7, 2017",5,"Used to like it The app used to work great.  I received an update before the holidays and now I can't stand the app.  It doesn't pull from all my pictures even though it is linked, it automatically zooms on pictures even with the setting off, cannot share on the 3 picture collage, now and then does not work correctly, and the list goes on.  How can I revert back to the older version!?!?"
2565,ahhmeeeee,"January 8, 2017",1,"doesnt even work. my timehop doesn't even load anymore. also, the one time it did work with the second update, i noticed that while we now can see ""likes and comments"" there's no way to differentiate them until you tap and load whatever the source was. so when i went to check what i thought were comments, i realized it was /just/ likes. which is really annoying and a waste of time. kind of like the timehop updates. I used to look forward to checking the app every day, but now it's annoying and practically unusable (well, at this moment, it just is plain unusable)."
2566,Rachel23lea,"January 14, 2017",1,"App Destroyed You have destroyed this app by making virtually unusable. The way the text is in these colorful blocks is hideous. The fact that the whole status does not appear on the screen and the method for making the whole status show up is very unclear and difficult to execute is stupid. It's illogical that the pictures are zoomed in when they first appear and that it is hard to get them to zoom out. The only good thing is that the videos have sound automatically, or at least easily, now. But you can't share videos. Sharing anything in general is almost impossible. The app is basically, as I said, unusable. Fix it."
2567,Frustrated Buyer 12345,"January 16, 2017",1,"Horrible after the update I liked time hop before the update but now the photos are big and cropped weird. Sometimes the photos are in little frames which sounds cute, but you can't open them larger and sometimes the cropped portion in the frame is not actually displaying the subject of the original photo. I really enjoyed time hop before but at this point I'll likely delete it, especially since facebook has daily memories. If I could have done zero stars I would have. You'd think Timehop would change it back since their ratings for the current version are significantly lower than for the previous version."
2568,Bshults07,"March 11, 2017",1,"I don't understand why you're ignoring the reviews. I've hated this app since the major update back in December and I STILL HATE IT!!! I've left reviews, tweeted the team, even had a Skype session with one of the team members & it seems that the one single major issue (no more vertical scrolling) is going to be ignored & never brought back. NOBODY LIKES THIS USER INTERFACE!!!!!! It's a hassle, it doesn't make sense for this apps main purpose, and there is not a single utility of satisfaction from this app. I'm trying so hard to keep the faith that they will EVENTUALLY listen to their users but it's literally been 3 months now and the biggest issue still has not been addressed."
2569,LadyRadloff,"June 20, 2017",4,"Awesome but I have an idea to help I love being able to see past memories! However I miss some days. So, I think something that would be super cool is to earn like ""hop points"" or something every time you open a time hop. Like a daily reward. Reminder and all. And then if you miss a day, those points can bring you back. And maybe have the option to buy some??? But the app has to keep up with what days were opened and which weren't. Anyways., just an idea!!!"
2570,Thisyearsgirl285,"March 31, 2014",4,"Love it Sometimes I have issues with timehop only showing my tweets from 3+ years ago (when I know there were tweets on the day from 1 & 2 years before), and I have to disconnect and reconnect it, but it's not a constant issue. Facebook and instagram have been fine.  "
2571,April1187,"December 20, 2014",3,"Nice but no comments? It is nice to see all of my old posts but I do wish we could see the comments. That brings back a lot more memories to see what everyone had to say to you on that day. I think that's a pretty important feature! However, unless the app is crashing, which has happened a few times, it's a great app and a great idea!"
2572,48jj48,"January 2, 2015",4,Use it everyday! This is a very fun app. I do use it every day. Reliving past posts makes me smile- either at good memories or acknowledging that I'm now in a better place than those not-so-good memories. Always room for improvement- it would be nice to be able to read comments that were made on my old posts. I would also like an option to go back a day or two to revisit old posts I may have been too busy to see the right day. I highly recommend this app!
2573,Emarie153,"July 9, 2015",4,"Great for the most part. The app itself is pretty great. I like when it shows you the comments and ""likes"" on the photos or statuses that you've posted in the past. Sometimes I hate time hop because it shows me things I don't want to remember (deaths, ex's, etc..). But I thought it was hilarious on Valentine's Day when it made you confirm if you were ready to look at the time hop for that day. Overall I think it's an awesome app. I like remembering things I probably would have forgot about."

I have two kids and love seeing photos of them as babies or pictures from years ago that I no long have, this on that note it's a great app but recently I have been having problems with it saying my photos have been deleted and it's not showing my posts so I am contacting them about it but other then that I haven't had many issues with it like other apps!! :D"
2576,Shimysmals,"September 24, 2015",4,One of the first app I look at each day I absolutely love this app! I check it daily to see how much has changed over the years with my life. I love seeing the personal growth I have made in my life over the years. One of my favorite parts is seeing how big my son has gotten year by year in the posts or pictures I have taken.  The only reason this app doesn't have 5/5 stars from me is because it does not always load but when it does it's always worth it.
2577,Chelsea417007xoxo,"October 1, 2015",1,"Delete feature I have decided to no longer use the time hop off until there is an option to delete the memory. As much as I love to see the ways that my baby has grown over the years and the silly things I was doing seven years ago, it's too painful to have to relive memories of an ex-husband who chose to leave us. At times I will leave the time hop app to search for the specific memory or photo on Facebook but it requires a lot of digging and isn't necessarily an easy set up. I would really love to see a feature to go directly to the original post so that someone could delete if they wanted to. Until then time hop, peace out."
2578,TheWearer,"December 23, 2016",1,"New update ruined the app I used to love this app. But the way it's formatted now with the new update makes it soooo hard to see your stuff. The pictures are too zoomed in and sometimes the edges of text is cut off. I HATE that you now have to scroll left to right to see stuff, when it's natural reaction to want to scroll up and down (like on all social medias). This would be equivalent to Instagram creating an update where you now scroll left to right through your friends pics. Dumb right? Also, it was OBVIOUSLY a ploy to get you to see more ads. It looks so unnatural and makes me not want to use it anymore. Please for the love of God change it back."

Now, since the most recent update, this app is pretty much useless. Why are the photos zoomed in? And you can only tap and hold to zoom out to see the original photo but if you release your finger it's back to zoom? Who the heck thought of this feature? It's ridiculous? And where are my comments and captions? I hate the swipe right and left feature. I hate everything about the update. I hope they read all the poor reviews and revert back to the old version which had nothing wrong with it. Timehop, you have failed me."

I enjoyed opening Timehop every day to see my memories.. now I can't stand opening it.  I don't understand why the pictures are zoomed and has no connection to Facebook or when/where it came from.  Based on the other recent reviews I am not the only one disappointed.

Now I feel like I'm left hanging every time I check timehop. Hop back in time, Timehop!"
2583,brookiebug0113,"January 5, 2017",1,Worst Update Ever What is up with this update? I don't understand why every picture is automatically zoomed in so that I have to zoom out to view the whole thing. And what happened to being able to see the comments and likes on my pictures? That was one of the best parts to viewing my old pictures and statuses. And I hate scrolling right instead of scrolling down. It's like Time Hop is now competing with and copying Snapchat. The old scrolling and viewing method worked great. This whole update is very user unfriendly he and I find myself not using Timehop as much because I just get annoyed. They ruined every aspect of this app. Good job.

You can no longer see the replies to your old Facebook posts, only the post. I don't like the layout or anything about it. I'm deleting the app. I've had this app for a long time and have enjoyed looking back but the new version is so clunky. And to only be able to see what you said and not what your friends said back is dumb. You need to go back to the way it was. Deleting for now. May check back to see if you actually have listened to all the bad reviews. It appears I'm not the only one who doesn't like your update."
2586,Kgggggifudhxysysxj,"January 23, 2017",5,You're trying too hard. Keep it simple. One update changed the whole format which made it just another annoying snapchat/FB blah...   the next caused it to completely malfunction... All I get now is a Dino with a retry circle... Might as well be a dead Dino... Sometimes people just want a simple app they can scroll through quickly and makes them incredibly happy...You had that. Bring it back.
2587,cnshea,"January 24, 2017",1,An end of an era Sad to say Timehop but with a tear in my eye and heavy heart I must delete you. This update with the clicking is ridiculous. They say change is good but based the dramatic change in your reviews you should have Noticed by now this is NOT the case for your once great app. Once part of my morning routine I have to tell myself not to click on my previous very  beloved and anticipated Timehop app! Every morning without fail I would click the happy yellow box on my iPhone as you were part of my morning routine just before brushing my teeth. I regret to inform you I am deleting  the app now as after a few updates it is still horrid. Good day!
2588,topsykret,"January 31, 2017",5,"Why did you change the format?!?! I LOVED TimeHop and now I despise it. The old format was so much easier to use.

Most of my posts and pictures are fun, some were a little sad after my grandmother had a stroke and passed away. But even sad moments like that, it's good to remember. About 99% of the time, I really get a kick from the memories. And now it gives me options to post pics I just put on my phone & didn't post at the time, which prevents too much repetition. Still loving it!"

Time Hop would have gotten a 5 star review but I have a hard time scrolling down to see all my statuses and pictures. It gets stuck on pictures and the only way to get out is by closing the entire app. Sometimes when I go to share my status/picture it won't let me click on the share button. With the most recent update it won't let me choose which boarder I want, it makes me use the one it chooses."

However, I remember in its early days that it would send you and email digest of everything on your Timehop and I really miss that. It was great because I could look back in my email and find specific dates. But now, you're limited to the current day. And because twitter limits access to historical tweets by time, and content occasionally vanishes from social networks, this memories can't be preserved. Bring back full email digests!"

The ONLY suggestion that I have personally is to put in MUCH more meaningful editorials... Possibly make categories for them such as: romance, friendship, family, school, etc. Other than that ONE simple suggestion I HIGHLY recommend this app to any and ALL who do not have it already!‚ù§Ô∏è"

Sometimes Timehop doesn't have everything though. That's why I check them both so I can double check. I also like how you can design the memory with a border and decoration. I just wish there were more things to design the picture with."

I would check it every morning, and laugh as much as I cringed at my middle school Facebook posts. But now the developers decided to make it more of a social media app. I get notified when someone else has seen a picture I am tagged in. You can like a memory and your friend gets a notification. At this point the app has turned into a lame version of Facebook. I no longer recommend this app to people, and have been wanting to check it less and less with each new update."
2596,K. Mia,"December 23, 2016",4,"New update I actually really like this app but I'm not a fan of the new update. For one...the whole zoom out feature is weird because most of the picture posts don't fit in those dimensions so I'm literally always zooming out. Also, on pictures you can't see where it came from/was originally posted or the caption that went along with it when you did. Otherwise like I said I like the app, but how it use to be not this snapchat like version."
2597,gaunt123,"December 25, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE UPDATE, PLEASE FIX This new update is horrible. Please change it back. It literally makes no sense and there was nothing wrong with the ""old"" version. Most of my timehops were usually tweets or Facebook posts with a picture attached to them, and now all I can see is the picture. Not the post that went with it, not who posted it, not nothing. Just the picture. Like literally what is even the point of that? And why do we have to zoom out on EVERY SINGLE PICTURE just cause? There's no point in the zoom out feature, it's just there, making me zoom out on every picture for no reason. PLEASE REVERT BACK TO THE OTHER VERSION OR YOU WILL LOSE EVERYBODY THAT USES THIS APP, INCLUDING ME."
2598,Klwmbh2009,"December 27, 2016",1,"Hate the Update Have always really enjoyed Timehop, but the new update is horrible. It will group 2-3 images together and show them as a fast speed clip and not allow me to share any of them. I really wanted to share a special picture today but I don't have that option as it was grouped in those 3 images. Secondly, I don't understand the automatic zoom on every image. I have to minimize it a little just to view every picture I swipe to. And lastly the swiping is doable but very annoying, I prefer the old method of scrolling! I get things change and updates are a must in the technology world, but this new TH update might need some work!"
2599,laura43558,"December 29, 2016",1,"Horrible update I used to love Timehop but I hate this current version. Pictures look terrible, why would you zoom all the way in so you can't see the picture? And you can't see comments from your posts...again. If you had to bring that back from a previous update because people were mad, why would you take it away again? Considering deleting the app since it's no longer very user friendly. Definitely feels like they're trying to incorporate aspects of other popular apps to stay current...but failing miserably. And I never write reviews on apps but felt compelled to do so now since the update is so bad."
2600,AnnaClaire27,"February 2, 2014",3,"Great App, if you have plenty of time I love this app. A stroll down memory lane every day. ""Oh look at my hair three years ago!"" ""OMG this status I wrote...too funny!"" But you don't get to see all the memories unless you have plenty of time to wait for it to load. I stare at a blank screen for a good amount of time. Then statuses decide to populate. Want to see pics? Gotta wait five to ten minutes for that! Even though I daily get notifications that my timehop is ready, it seems like the app decides to collect everything the moment I click on it. Annoying."
2601,wave_jay,"June 4, 2014",4,"Cool idea, could be better I really thought that this app is awesome and I crack up at some of the things that come up from a year or two years ago. It is still a little basic however, I wish that i could see some of the things my friends said in the past, but I wouldn't want a newsfeed like twitter or Facebook where you see everyone's post. If we could have a list of friends and select one to see their past posts that'd be nice. Once again fun idea"
2602,Mac-uh-b,"June 20, 2014",4,Time I really love this app minus the one minor flaw which bothers me more than it should. I am currently writing this at 12:32 am. Which means I am on eastern time. But my app doesn't get that. It shows me yesterday's stuff until 1. I'm usually asleep around 12:30 so I just check this am as I go to bed for the current/following days pictures. But once I change the time zone in the account settings it changes them back and won't go to the next day! It's very frustrating to me!
2603,Surviv2020,"January 12, 2015",5,Amazing fun Just got app a week ago but so many options with photos and social media post on your phone and laptop/computer.... Enjoy the daily reminiscing of the past thoughts and pictures - lovely reminder of how far you have come over the years as well as the realization that some things never change.... It's a must have app for those that take and share frequently on social media!
2604,Melyadigg,"January 29, 2015",1,"Severely disappointed Every day I check my timehop. And then I became very annoyed when every day it would have tons of statuses and then say all of my pictures failed to load. So I deleted my account hoping to fix that problem and made a new one. Guess what. Some days I get pictures, somedays (like today) I get absolutely nothing! And I know there should at least be statuses. Timehop is really annoying me.. It's a great idea for an app but maybe it should be run by smarter people who actually know what they're doing. I would really like to see what I was posting two years ago. One star until it gets fixed. Only because I can't give zero stars."
2605,Andrea MS-SLP,"January 1, 2017",1,"Worse update ever! Imagine my disappointment when I opened this app after the update... I used to look forward to reading the comments people wrote on my status updates... especially from my sister who passed away in 2011. They are goneüò¢üò©. I've been screen-shooting them to create a memory book. Wish I would've read the reviews before updating! I wanted to review all of the pictures I had posted 5 years ago, but I'm left with 3 smaller pics on one page and no way to see the whole album or even the full images quickly (unless I search through my FB app. PLEASE bring back the last version!!!!"
2606,BasileusNV3,"January 2, 2017",5,Awful Update!  Should NEVER been changed Before the update it was perfectly fine. Saw all swarm check-ins which were great to see the years back but now it's gone an only shows pics.  I had the camera roll turned off yet it still continues to pull from it. I always looked forward to seeing what was coming up the next day but now I feel like what is the point!  SMH!
2607,SDR86,"January 5, 2017",1,"Beating a dead app but... It's really truly awful. Every photo is zoomed in oddly. Most have no identifying captions, or the captions are loaded onto other pages. The snapchat format feels clunky and not particularly useful for this app. I think the worst thing, though, is not seeing the comments on your statuses and photos. This was often my favorite feature, and (not to get maudlin) allowed me to see comments from friends and family who are no longer with us. I hope they are working on a quick resolution to this before I delete the app for good. Meanwhile, if anyone has a better app for this sort of thing, leave it in a review! Thanks!"
2608,irishchick_77,"January 31, 2017",1,"This is awful I HATE the single photo, non scroll option. I am starting to dread getting notified every day of when I have to spend several minutes looking at Timehop that I can't quickly scroll through. I have some duplicate photos that I didn't mind before, but now are incredibly irritating. If it weren't for the streak counter I would have given up long ago. "
2609,User 0675!,"April 6, 2017",3,"I hate the update I use Timehop every day and I'm currently at a 171 day streak, but with this new update it's harder to see the pictures and really annoying to have to tap to move to the next one or hold to see the whole thing. And what happened to text posts???? This app has been moving downhill for a while now, and now it seems they want to put the last nail in the coffin themselves. I'm disappointed."
2610,Jdrocker101,"June 6, 2015",4,"Fun App! I love this app because it is fun to see what I have posted before and some of the posts are interesting because some things have changed a lot and some things have not. I also love seeing the posts of when my kids were young. The only thing that bugs me is that I have to close out of the app every time I use it because I can't scroll down unless I have closed it out. If that bug can get fixed, I would give this app a five star rating."
2611,Kylekylekylekylekyle,"June 25, 2015",4,"Simply Nostalgic Great, simple app that executes pretty much exactly what it promises - a walk down memory lane through the years. "
2612,Isave1@atime,"June 26, 2015",4,"Love it, minus one flaw I do really like this app & love the fact that it can pop up whatever it was that I wrote, posted or shared that day in previous years."
2613,erweinbe,"August 5, 2015",2,"Worked fine for a bit, now too much hassle! At first when I installed and set up the app a bunch of months ago, it worked fine. It pulled and displayed all of my data, especially my Facebook which was most important to me.  Now every day I have to try a few things to get it working properly - namely loading my Facebook history.  I have to log out and back in again and/or delete and recreate my Timehop account and/or revoke and add Facebook permissions.  I have to do this EVERY DAY!  I'm going to delete the app if they don't get this fixed within the next few days."
2614,JoseXedgE,"August 15, 2015",4,"Great app It's fun looking back across all your platforms, it will show you up to whenever you joined that site, I see some people complain that it only shows up to 4-5 years. That's probably because you didn't have that social media site past 5 years. Haven't had a problem until recently, where my Instagram pictures were not loading. I've missed about a month already, but it's cool I'm not gonna die over it. "
2615,Cara June,"May 3, 2016",1,"New update is horrible So I have had this lovely app for like 2 years and I have loved it.. I love seeing my old post and my pictures I post so many but I take even more it shows me years worth I haven't forgotten, but I updated my app today and now I cannot even open it.. I have read everyone's comments about the video and the sound and that would be better than my app sticking on whether or not I want to review this app which was no but now I feel the need to.. Which is the new update makes this app useless.. I cannot even see anything on it.. Guess I need to go find a new one that I will love.. Get it together people seriously!!!"
2616,Scorrie,"December 24, 2016",5,"Thanks for ruining holiday Timehop memories I love this time of year looking at Timehop. But not this year. The app was fine the way it was before and now it's hard to use. My photos are all zoomed in and hard to view. It's hard to share photos and look at comments from previous years. This new format doesn't fit with Timehop. It might if you were just showing Timehop of people's Snapchat post, but not this. It's horrid."
2617,lu95,"December 27, 2016",4,"New Update = Too Much I have been using Timehop for years now, however this new update is probably the app's worst decision to date. It is very confusing to look at, I really enjoyed being able to scroll through all of my posts. This new update puts photos out of order and doesn't tell me where the posts are from. I can't tell if it is an Instagram, Facebook, or twitter post. Going through Timehop each morning shouldn't be an 10 minute ordeal."
2618,Mendezm7,"December 27, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE update! I never write reviews on anything, but this update was too horrible not to. As everyone has said, it's completely lost its functionality and simplicity. Not to mention - it's WAY more time consuming now. I have to tap through EVERY single post I've made on all my social networks for over a decade?! I should be able to scroll down and expand the ones I want to expand. Please fix this, it's practically unusable now!"
2619,Rdavis233,"December 31, 2016",1,"From love to hate Not one to review normally, but the most recent update prompted me to action. Time Hop was one of my favorite apps, I usually check it every morning before I get up. The new update is so terrible that I'm deleting the app. It doesn't work properly, the posts are split up and difficult to understand (captions and photos appear as separate memories, for example) and you can longer see comments or anything else on your posts. This was a terrible idea and I have waited several days for you to acknowledge or fix it since I'm clearly not the only one who feels this way. I wish there was a lower rating than 1 star."
2620,AlyGC1834,"June 21, 2013",3,"Wonderful App- Just Fix the Bugs. While I love Timehop, the app has some bugs it needs to work out. It usually takes 3-4 tries at opening the app before it will actually pull up your Facebook posts. It also has a lot of trouble pulling pictures and they will come out white most of the time so you can't see your post."
2621,Ginger076,"June 5, 2014",5,"Should make it sound more appealing in App Store I didn't expect this app to be this awesome. I teach, I also do photography, I'm a wife, mother, and friend therefore I stay busy! At times I feel overwhelmed in my day I find that clicking on this app takes me to a happy place! When viewing the app in the App Store it honestly doesn't seem as appealing as it is! Timehop give yourself some credit!!! You deserve it! Thanks for making life more appreciated!"
2622,Deb S.,"June 14, 2014",3,"Worked great until a few days ago... Really have enjoyed looking at social media posts from years past - until it randomly stopped working a few days ago. I still get emails and push notifications and would love to see the actual posts they reference, but I get an error message every time I try to open the app. Have tried deleting and reinstalling several times but still can't get in. Every time it says, ""could not find an object napping for keypath"". Hope this gets fixed soon!"
2623,Mochasmom123,"September 20, 2014",4,"Great app, but... It would be nice to show the whole post on Facebook especially if its a funny one I wrote and want to share again. I had a post from Facebook come on this app, a great story, but the ending was cut off. "
2624,BrocktonLady319,"November 10, 2014",4,"Loved since the beginning I have been enjoying TimeHop for about 2+ years now and as it has grown in popularity, the ease of use has also gotten much better. I love how easily I am able to share my timehops with friends through text message and on facebook. Have never have any major issues with the app other than occasional freezes which don't occur often. Would recommend to everyone who has been using social media for 3 or more years."
2625,Nicolequeb,"November 17, 2014",5,"Love, Love, LOVE. I love seeing what was going to on in my life this time one year, two years, however many years ago! It great to see how things can change in just a year. I wish you could swipe between each picture/video when you enlarge it and that you could select more than one to share in a message instead of sending them individually. Other than that, this was a GENIUS idea for an app!"
2626,Afrisco01,"January 23, 2015",5,"Pretty Cool This app is definitely pretty cool. It's really fun (and sometimes cringeworthy) seeing wha you posted on Facebook, Twitter, Insta, etc. years prior. Many statuses I don't even remember writing! Why someone let me have a Facebook in 8th grade I don't know. But anyway, it's really nice to see things in the past that would normally take forever to did through on the main social media sites. I don't get a TimeHop everyday, but when I do, it's always a treat."
2627,BoarderPW,"January 29, 2015",5,"So simple, yet so meaningful Timehop does a few things that none of my other (150) apps do...it refreshes my memory, helps me remember noteworthy events from my life, and give me a reason to connect with friends to relive these moments."
2628,JoeyRR,"March 18, 2015",5,"Neat App I only wish I had done more on Facebook and Instagram over the years, just so I could look back and laugh. It's funny to see how weird you were years ago.. Some of the stuff I posted just makes me laugh. Cool idea, although I can't see it being something that people consistently use a year from now. It's likely an app I will eventually delete from never using it. But for now it gets 5 stars!"
2629,LisaF(MusicFan),"April 17, 2015",4,"Great app! I love a great flashback and so it's nice to be able to reflect on things I said or posted over time, allows me to see how much I've grown. It brings back great memories for the most part and makes me sad sometimes too bc my son has grown so quickly and so fast. Where did the time go? The only down fall to the app is if you posted a pic (like a throw back pic) it will put the date you posted it not the date it was actually taken but other than that it's a great app, LOVE IT"
2630,Frenspanglish,"May 23, 2013",1,"Disappointing... I love getting to see my old pictures and posts, but as other reviewers have said, it is very frustrating not getting to go back a day or go to the original post on Facebook to see comments that were left. Also, In my daily email i receive today it was filled with curse words at the bottom of the page that is supposedly being spoken by Abe.  My 7 yr old daughter enjoys reading the daily emails but since there is that type"
2631,Hula22,"December 31, 2016",1,"Worst update ever I agree 100% with the previous review by Shellbunbun.  I used to love looking at Timehop but this most recent update is the worst.  I hate how every pic is zoomed.  And if there was more than one pic a day, they're tiny and I can't make them bigger.  Today I was looking forward to seeing the pics from NYE 7 years ago but it flipped through them for me at an unreasonable speed for anyone to see each picture.  I tried several times to slow it down, push on the screen, hold a picture, but nothing worked.  I hope Timehop goes back to its previous format.  Currently, I'd rather look at Facebook's memories than Timehop."
2632,Tmelt334455829056,"December 31, 2016",4,"Awful I used to really enjoy opening timehop each morning, but now I'm truly not even sure why I still have the app. The latest update is horrible. There are so many flaws. Who thought it was a good idea to immediately show each picture zoomed to fit the screen? Also, why is it impossible to see the captions and comments? I'm truly disappointed with this new update. Never before has an update caused me to delete an application."
2633,Mannequinhands,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible update This update took away all ability to enjoy photos from the past. It's also not showing anything from Swarm, which is one of the main reasons I use Timehop - to see where I was in the past years. In fact, the only reason I was still checking in on Swarm was because I knew it would show up on my future Timehops. The redesign is disappointing and makes me not care about opening Timehop at all. The full text of the single tweet you decide to show me (out of 8-10 tweets!) is cut off and the one random Facebook photo out of an album is zoomed in and blurry. I want to see EVERYTHING or I won't even bother."
2634,Gotalong,"January 2, 2017",1,"Bring the timeline back I've always really enjoyed using timehop to check my old tweets, and it made it easy to RT funny stuff I've said in the past but heres the thing - I used to tweet A LOT. On a good day about a hundred times. I've got no time to individually scroll through each tweet to maybe see a funny one and the loss of the 'timeline' look is really aggravating. I want to be able to check the app in 3 or 4 minutes when I get up in the morning, not undertake a whole journey that'll take a half hour for no valid reason. Please take the timeline look back or at least let us pick which way we want our timehop to look."
2635,montydad,"January 6, 2017",1,"Still Hot Garbage Even after trying to fix what they ruined, the latest update is still a steaming pile of moose excrement. I still have to tap through my history because they want to be Snapchat. The only benefit to this format is that it will allow them to serve interstitial advertisements and make more money. Greedy. They are clearly determined to stick with this format even though their users hate it. There is still no Swarm integration. I have also turned off the auto-zoom feature but the photos are still zooming in. This update killed the dinosaurs. This update sank the Titanic. If hate were people, this app would be China."
2636,SMR731,"January 8, 2017",2,"New update is awful As other users have mentioned, the update is kinda crap. I used to love looking through the timeline of my Timehop. I like that I could look at the comments my old post had and now I'm just left with this zoomed in version of less engaging content. I assume this is going to be fixed so I didn't completely rate you 1 star, however if there isn't a vast improvement I'll be back for the 1 star review and relying solely on Facebook Memories. "
2637,Molso7890,"January 27, 2017",5,"Last update is terrible Ever since the last update on this app, I have not been able to enjoy Timehop. The format is visually crowded and when I try to view my old posts, photos, or videos it skips me to the next item. "
2638,CrazyDaisy519,"February 7, 2017",1,Terrible Just please go back to how it was. I haven't deleted the app yet in hopes there will be an update to make it better but it just keeps getting  worse. Please just cut your losses and go back to how it was when we scrolled down and saw Year by year. I hate the way you highlight my text. It is unreadable. I hate having to click to go day to day. It's all annoying and not worth looking. I did the update and checked it out to see if it was better but it's not. I won't open again until the next update. One more chance and then I just delete it. I'm done. You ruined it!!!  I had over a 100 day streak. Now I don't care.
2639,heidijohanna,"March 19, 2017",1,Used to love it! I got timehop quite a while ago and absolutely loved it. I loved seeing all of my posts and pictures. Now it seems that timehop is trying to pick and choose what memories I would like to see - I only see about 25% of what I used to. The ads would be fine if it didn't mean I lost my own content. 
2640,Missmerenoelle,"May 22, 2015",4,"Really like the app, but... I love getting that notification in the morning telling me that my timehop is ready. But, recently, the app has been crashing and I can't see what I've posted that day. This has been happening for a few days now, and it's kind of getting annoying. Also, I hate that now we are required to crop our photo before we can share it somewhere. What's the point of sharing it if you can't even see the whole picture?"

It's amazing how I can always open the app and see all of the memories that have taken place in the past couple years! This app is amazing and it never crashes like all of my other apps! Timehop is the first app that I open in the morning when I wake up. I love looking at the old photos and being able to remember the memories that I have made with my friends and family!
2642,Maryabelove,"September 1, 2016",5,This app is quite useful This app is very useful in many ways. U may not realize it but u can look back on the old memories from each day from years ago. It's like looking at ur past. It makes u remember the good times and bad times. And it's not hard to set up at all. Even a baby could do it. A few simple clicks and I was set up. It's just wonderful. And u can share with friends and social media.
2643,abcdefkabBwid,"December 22, 2016",1,"HATE the update passionately this update is absolutely terrible and unnecessary. it took something that was effective and easy to navigate and made it extremely difficult to use. it doesn't say what day of the week it was anymore, it doesn't show captions on pictures, it doesn't even show the entire picture because it's weirdly zoomed and doesn't allow you to zoom all the way out unless you press ""share,"" there's no option to view the comments on anything, and the most annoying thing is that you can only see one post at a time. there is absolutely nothing positive about this update"
2644,Sameleven,"December 27, 2016",1,"Worst app update I've ever seen New update is absolutely horrific. It makes zero sense and is 0% user-friendly. The fact that you can't even see the full picture unless you keep your finger on it to zoom?? No captions, dates & times, no likes/comments? Why do I care about just the picture or status with no context? Also having everything on a screen of its own isolates everything and takes away all of the nostalgia. Plus the way the text posts are displayed with that horrible highlight over the text makes it extremely difficult to read. Please go back to the original layout of this app!"
2645,MusicalRose12,"December 28, 2016",1,"Update is HORRIBLE! The new update is nothing short of absolutely terrible.  I used to really enjoy this app.  I know that new updates always take some ""getting used to"", but this update is NOT user friendly. It malfunctions half the time, and I end up looking at the same two memories until it decides to move me forward.  I understand needing to freshen up the app but this was not the way to do it.  Please try again, Timehop.  Your app used to be fun and now it's almost too aggravating to open.  PLEASE fix the update - either return it to the way it was or come up with a design that is fresh. It is also much more user friendly."
2646,Hipthrustinghomos,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worst update of any app ever This update is awful. I have never written a app review, but this update is so awful and frustrating that I felt I needed too. I have been using Timehop for years and I really liked the version before this update because you you click and go to the actual Facebook or twitter post And if it was a picture posted x years ago you could see what caption you posted with the picture, these features along with many others have been removed on the current version and I hate it. Can Timehop please go back to their most recent format before this update. I hope they listen to these reviews."
2647,LotusBud74,"December 30, 2016",3,"HATE THE UPDATE!!! You seriously ruined a good thing. I HATE the new update for various reasons. First, why are all the pics zoomed in? Why do the collections of pics scroll through so quickly? You're likely to give someone a seizure!! Now I also can't read corresponding comments from past posts!!! Why? That's the whole point of reliving the past post, right? Congratulations! You've single handedly ruined one of my favorite apps in one single update. Go back to the old version or I will just delete it. Seriously!! Fix it!!!"
2648,sweetrayofsunshine,"December 30, 2016",1,"Incredibly bad update - unusable now I don't usually write reviews but after this horrible update and not being able to even use the app anymore I felt I needed too. I'm glad to see a lot of people also felt the same need, hopefully this will force someone to change back to the way the app use to be. Idk who thought the new app would be an improvement but it's rendered the app so useless that I don't even open it anymore. Why would all the pics be automatically zoomed in on you can't even see the past photos - please change it back to the old way sometimes you shouldn't fix what isn't broken!"
2649,jdschlieman,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible new format Your description makes it sound like you're al excited about this new update, but it's awful. Awful. The only reason I use this app is to look back on photos, read the captions I wrote and the comments others wrote. You can't even see the entire photo anymore on the screen. It's weirdly zoomed in to cut off the outside edges. Also, there's no longer any way to read the captions or comments at all. They're simply not available. I no longer have any reason to use this app. Bring back the old format and I'll be back too, but if you leave it this way, I simply don't need it and won't use it."
2650,Savannah S.,"April 1, 2014",3,So fun! When it works... I really love this app. It's such a cute concept and makes my day. And the dinosaur is so cute :)
2651,Gooch<3,"July 15, 2014",5,"Amazingüíï I absolutely love this app. The concept is wonderful and I look forward to checking my Timehop in the morning. It works great, and it has a simple, easy-to-use layout. The only thing I wish for in future updates is to have the ability to see previous dates. On busy days, I sometimes forget to check my Timehop, and It would be nice to go back a day or two. Otherwise, it is a fantastic app. Love, Love, Love it!"
2652,ddStroyer,"May 5, 2015",5,"Greatest App Ever My phone is cluttered with apps and other things including thousands of pictures a bunch of videos. This is the nicest thing ever, especially being a father of two. I get to see differences in my children, self and life over the years. I love this. I notice no bugs and even if the app was buggy I think that I'd probably still rate it 5 stars. I am thankful for TimeHop and would recommend it to your grandma."
2653,Hey_itsSydney,"December 31, 2016",1,"UPDATE RUINS THE APP why fix something that isn't broken?? The new update is a no go for me. I can't open up my tweets from there to twitter to see conversations on tweets anymore, can't go view my Facebook posts on Facebook, can't get my pictures that are sideways to zoom all the way out, I can't see captions or comments on any of my old posts anymore and that is a big part of reliving the memories to people, I could list so many things wrong with this update. Worst move you could've made timehop. This isn't snapchat, which is the knock off you have created. It worked great the way it was before, go back to the old timehop!!!"
2654,2girls3doxies,"January 5, 2017",5,Seriously......I used to love this app The new update makes this app frustrating and unusable. Opening this app used to be the first thing I did every morning.  Please please put it back The way it was before the update. Those full screens killed it - never see the full picture and when you try to resize it it's gifts to the next picture or the previous picture. Awful
2655,Niki BQQ,"January 7, 2017",5,"Disappointed Although I love this app, I am very disappointed with the new update/layout. It mimics Snapchat(which I love too) but it does not work well for this app. It cuts the pics off, it does not allow you to jump back the the other app that the memory refers to & that takes the fun out of seeing comments from that post. I hope you guys put it back the way it was or fix it. PLEASE"
2656,Sheila0866,"January 9, 2017",1,"Then and Now Timehop USED to be my favorite app.  The current UI is horrendous.  Not sure who thought it would be a great idea to overhaul to this extreme.  I hope the developers are reading the reviews and revert back.  I was excited to see the latest update thinking they had done that but nope...they did ""fix"" some of the worst updates but still lacking in my opinion. I find myself relying more and more on Facebook memories instead.  I miss the filters, frames and then/now features AND most importantly, the vertical scroll and seeing the entire post.  "
2657,Mage54,"January 15, 2017",1,"Remember a year ago?? Timehop used to be an amazing app that people loved, that was before the dark times."
2658,Summer-girl98,"January 21, 2017",1,"New Update is Awful!!! I would give 0 stars if I could!  I HATE this new version!!!  All of the photos are zoomed and look distorted, you cannot see any memories that are just text or see what was written and posted about the pictures. You can no longer see how many likes the picture got or read the comments. Before this terrible update, I would have rated more than 5 stars, but this new version makes me not even want to look anymore. I don't know who thought this new version was a good idea, but if something is not broken, you shouldn't try to fix it!  Please, please, please bring back the old Timehop!"
2659,Moogirl60,"February 8, 2017",1,"Love it, but needs changes I love it but it needs better ways to edit. I hate when I post a picture and the persons head is covered up with the ""One year ago today"" etc flag. That should be at the bottom. The caption for the picture should print also. But otherwise it's a neat idea."
2660,dranner63,"June 27, 2015",5,"Nice app, but difficult to use on iPad The app is very difficult to scroll thru the options for the day.  It will stop scrolling and you have to return to the top and quickly go Dow to where you were.  Frustrating.  I discover that if to go to settings and then return, the scrolling is just fine....however the share button disappears!"
2661,WriterGirl7,"July 30, 2015",5,"I use it every day! This is my absolute favorite app. If you're active on social media, you have to get it. Timehop is such a great reminder of past travels, photos, conversations, events, and more. It always brightens my day! It's also a good peek into the stupid kind of stuff you were writing on Facebook 9 years ago. Haha. I often screenshot my daily updates and reach out to friends I haven't spoken to in awhile and we reminisce."
2662,Nikonxnicki,"September 24, 2015",3,"I used to love this app but now... There was a time when I would check this app every day to laugh at myself from previous years. After the newest update however, it keeps saying that someone seems to have unplugged the Internet and time travel has failed. For a while, I thought it might be the wifi I was connected to. After countless tries with different wifi and using my phone's data, I realized that was not the case. Please fix this bug, I would love to enjoy this app again."
2663,Lala5590jc,"September 25, 2015",3,Used to love this app but... I don't usually review apps but it asks to review almost everyday even though I already left a review. I used to love this app but when I try to view my posts it says someone has unplugged the Internet. I have updated it 2-3 times & even deleted it and downloaded AGAIN but it's still doing the same thing. The update was supposed to fix this but obviously it didn't. If this would get fixed then maybe my review will change. Until then.. Here is your review you keep asking for.
2664,DDedubya,"September 29, 2015",2,"Great memories I've really loved using this app in the past. It's nice to remember what you were doing ,saying,or thinking last year or the year before. Little things that were meaningful at the time but long since forgotten. Since Facebook has been recreating memories, TimeHop has been deleting them and posting a smart remark about ""looks like some is trying to get into politics "". Really? A picture of a guy driving a tractor or a drawing of a grandmother hugging a child. No porn... No nudity yet still deleting. Well so am I.... I'm deleting this app ! Thanks for the memories that you didn't delete!!!"
2665,Kaity367,"December 21, 2015",3,"It's good, but... Timehop is great in the sense that you get to see your old posts; however, I'm very disappointed that it limits the amount of tweets that will show up on timehop. I have always been an avid tweeter, and it really irritates me that timehop doesn't show all of them automatically, no matter how much you tweet. I even went through the process they have to view my tweets - it did not work. Wish that they would change that to where it will show everything no matter the number of tweets someone has."
2666,MGM_Tiger,"July 7, 2016",5,Facebook options I saw in your update notes that people complained about the app jumping to Facebook so you went back to the old option of staying inside Timehop. 
2667,Bryan7877,"December 24, 2016",2,"Used to be great TimeHop used to be great, then the latest update happened. Each item is now on its own page and you have to tap to see the next. That isn't really a big deal, but it is not as convenient as scrolling. Pictures are also bigger than the screen. Sure, you can hold down on the picture to see the whole thing, but why should I even have to do that? The worst part though is that you can't see likes and comments anymore, which is part of the fun of seeing old posts. Right now, I think I'll be using On This Day instead."
2668,traiLion,"December 29, 2016",5,"Awful version No desire to open this app anymore. I understand why developers make drastic interface changes, which are often rejected by a resistance to change but this update is abysmal. We can't see the captions to photos anymore, the need to zoom out to see a photo is obnoxious and the automatic slideshow of photos is frustrating. This is worse than any New Twitter or New Facebook ever."
2669,Thunderstorm,"December 30, 2016",5,"Should offer a zero rating I HATE the update. The reason I enjoyed the app before is because I could see what my post was and who liked it. I enjoyed reading the comments of my friends and even seeing names of people I'm no longer friends with. Now, it's just pictures, and most of them mean pretty much nothing without the captions and comments. Bring back the old version! PLEASE!!!!"
2670,*BAM*BAM*,"September 7, 2014",5,"Loveeeee I love this app! It's amazing to be able to get a daily reminder of how much has changed over five years and see how far I've come as a person and how much I've grown. The only problem I've had is that over the last week, none of my photos will load and I've tried re-downloading the app and that hasn't helped. Hopefully they fix it soon so I can see my photos that I've posted!"
2671,Itsmekcr,"April 21, 2015",5,"Awesome App I love this app. Probably one of the best apps. I have.. I recently lost all my pics in my phone, knowing I will at least get to see them trickle in over the next year, is so wonderful.. If they would come back photo quality the same as when I took them, that would be even better. I have fun sharing old pics when they pop up, remembering what I was doing on "" this day "" 1-5 yrs ago.. Love love love it..."
2672,Kingman623,"May 18, 2015",3,"Cropping issue Several times I've posted a Timehop photo where half of the picture, or people in it, are cropped out. Also, it should be expanded to include a week. For instance if you want to show a previous child's graduation picture from one date three years ago and a current graduation picture of another child and the dates don't match up exactly then you miss the ""Then & Now"" moment. They should include a week's worth of days and list the specific dates below. It's a great app but it could be improved."
2673,Blovedxo,"January 16, 2017",2,"New update is horrible I used to love referring to Timehop to see past events but since their update a month or so back it's completely unusable. Can't click on past posts which then would link me back to the original on w/e social media app was used. Full text is cut off of long statuses. Doesn't show all old posts. Worst part imo is not being able to click on the individual photos to enlarge them and scroll to the next one. Now I'm forced to see them all cropped off on one screen, with borders, and unable to enlarge. Preferred the old Timehop for sure!!!"
2674,BeautyToo,"January 17, 2017",5,"I love Abe! Okay, so the latest update is not the best (I prefer the old format) but it hasn't really changed the way I use the app. I love the Time Hop check-in streak (well over 100 now!). At first, the sponsored content was annoying but then I realized that they could have moved to a subscription model but didn't, so the ads are necessary (PS. thank you all for keeping the app free!). And I just adore Abe! "
2675,ghostnerd,"January 24, 2017",1,"Still with this bummer update? No one was asking for their photos to be cropped to the dimensions of the phone. The tap and hold to show the full picture doesn't work. What once was fun to look at every morning is now frustrating and a giant let down. Go back! No one will care! I miss the dumb little pic at the bottom I could scroll past to see more of. I miss having photos and videos separated because there are WAAAAAAY too many photos for that to be enjoyable. I miss liking this app in spite of that rainbow changing-color table header / header thingy. Just chill out, lay off the color a bit, make it real simple and scrollable - vertically."
2676,vintagebeauty88,"January 29, 2017",5,"I love TimeHop! All 5 stars! A great way to remember memories :) You can share to Instagram, Facebook, and many more social network sites. It is perfect to reflect back in time on the exact same day in a different year. Easy to use and even shows the times you posted. You can click on every post and actually read all past comments and view all likes. This is a must have!!"
2677,the brain of j,"February 7, 2017",1,"Updates ruined Timehop The new layout is just plain bad. Photos are awkwardly zoomed by default, and then there are those awful tiny images in chintzy-looking frames that you cannot select or enlarge at all. "
2678,ajmarcott,"February 26, 2017",1,Used to be amazing - but awful as hell now. Seriously?!?! Now the videos don't load and I clicked through five - FIVE - sponsors before just shutting it down. I never did see past photos. They would not load. Just the sponsors. Maybe you need so many sponsors because you ruined an amazing app and stopped listening to those that USED it. 
2679,Bburrvol,"July 27, 2017",5,"Bad Old Timehop was better. Ads are fine, but the scrolling layout was so much better. I dont like how when you have multiple pictures on the same day or taken at the same time, they all appear on the same screen but flip through eachother really quickly and you can't look at the individual pictures. Just go back to the old Timehop /:"
2680,Christine aka c,"August 10, 2016",4,"Fun to look at everyday I love checking timehop everyday but one thing I hate is how it tells me ""celebrate your friendship"" with me and my ex boyfriend. If it was only once, fine, but this has come up multiple times. I understand he is in a lot of my timehop posts and we are still friends on Facebook but could there be an option to check off not to see it with a particular person? Other than that I think the app is great and the dinosaur is cute."
2681,TongTongTing,"December 24, 2016",1,"Wow... just, wooowww I have been an avid user of Timehop for quite some time now. Love being able to look back at my younger years and laugh. BUT, with this new update, it makes me feel like an infected infant with swine flu in a fresh produce store. I can barely see pictures, can't see comments/likes, hard to freely look through past. Not sure why everyone is following snapchat trends, but this is just horrid. I'm still going to use the app, but please bring back what ain't broke. For the sake of humanity and for all that is good, make this a Merry Christmas and return to whence you came instead of leaving a poor child with swine flu in a grocery store."
2682,Crystal Renaud,"December 24, 2016",1,Why?? Absolutely Horrible Update I started using Timehop over a year ago when everybody else got On This Day on Facebook and i didn't. I still don't have it which is why Timehop was so wonderful. I love being able to look back and see the pictures I posted & the people who commented on my posts and pictures. The new update make this impossible. The pictures are all blown up and half of them you can't zoom out on and the ability to read back on comments is gone. And just overall it is a terrible update. It's almost enough to stop using it. I hope they bring back the original design soon.
2683,Cosmic Badger,"December 31, 2016",1,"Update Ruined It I never write reviews, but I needed to add my voice to the chorus of users condemning this latest update. Timehop was an app that was fun and worked just fine previously, and this update made it practically unusable. Instead of navigating memories via a Twitter-like feed, the app now uses a bizarre and unwieldy Snapstory-like system where I have to click through each image to get to the next. To make matters worse, the touch controls are incredibly unintuitive and I find myself zooming in/out and skipping images when I didn't mean to. This update was completely unnecessary and took this app from 5-star to 1-star quality."
2684,Mrs. Clark T,"January 4, 2017",1,"Current Version is a Disaster! I love checking my timehop feed every morning but this latest app overhaul is a complete disaster! No more scrolling through posts, can't rotate the screen to view videos properly, square posts now fill the screen requiring manual zooming out (which is not maintained), and where in the WORLD did the captions go?! I haven't gone one day in over 200 without checking my feed but.....if these issues aren't addressed I won't even be using this at all anymore. If you don't use Timehop already, this is NOT the time to install it and start. It's no good at all. I sure hope they fix it. Very disappointed."
2685,Shredder8273,"January 5, 2017",1,"Horrible I have written a review for an app maybe 6 times since I've had an iPhone. The new Timehop update was so horrible that I just had to make sure that they knew how truly awful it is. The fact that you have to see every individual post/picture is very annoying. In the older versions, everything was on one page and you could scroll through and see everything in an organized way. Now, all of my photos are zoomed in straight to the center and I have to zoom out of every single one of them to see what it is. Please, make a better update. I no longer use Timehop because of this."
2686,Huntervrndvdbzksva,"January 6, 2017",1,"Wow. Just wow. I had no idea Timehop could get any worse for Instagram users. I used to be irritated that Timehop took it upon theirselves to collage a bunch of my Instagram posts together so I couldn't read them all or look at them individually. Now I'm just disgusted with this app. Not only is it so user-unfriendly that it took me 7 TIMES to try and hit the share button, but I can no longer read my Instagram captions at all. Quit trying to spice things up, Timehop, and just give us what we came for. I want to see every single one of my posts individually, and I want to be able to read the captions. I know I'm not the only one. How hard is that?"
2687,Lix Tetrax,"January 7, 2017",1,"Update to fix last update fails I used to use this app almost every day. After the last two updates I never open it anymore. I was encouraged by the new update, but I see that nothing has really been fixed. It was great being able to scroll quickly through my memories, and follow links if I wanted to see something more closely (or delete an old post). I don't have the time or desire to flip through individual photos, though, and it's no longer clear whether the pics are fb or ig posts, or just pics saved to the cloud. Bad job, Timehop! Just put things back the way they were."
2688,Olympix,"January 11, 2017",1,"Trying to reinvent the wheel. This is garbage, stop trying to invent ways to view pictures and videos.  Do you know how people want to see those?  They way they took them not zoomed in or in a fast montage!! Can't manipulate photos anymore.  What is with this zoom feature on each picture!?!? I don't want to see a zoom of it I want the whole thing!  I saved a long picture off the internet that is longer than my iPhone screen. In Iphotos I can pull it up and down and zoom in and scroll towards all 4 corners.  On timehop every fun I try and pull down to look at the top of the picture the settings come up."
2689,Omi307,"January 16, 2017",5,I HATE the update! If it ain't broke Then don't try to fix it. I never write reviews but since they changed the app it's been a nightmare. I look forward at looking at my pictures from the past but this update is annoying. Timehop do your own Timehop and got back to the old days when you scroll through the pictures and the app was simple to use and it worked.
2690,inkymama,"March 2, 2013",5,"I love you, Timehop! I love Timehop, I do! I've had it from pretty much the beginning--it's so rad, and keeps getting better. (I can't *believe* how much I used to use facebook, holy cow!) If it wasn't for this app, I wouldn't remember all of the awesome little moments I posted about during our youngest's first year. "
2691,Cheyisinthesky,"June 1, 2014",4,"amazing .. but needs something I love this app, it's amazing to go back and see what you posted a year ago or two. the only suggestion I'd have is to add a delete button. if a status or a picture is on a social network that you don't want, the app should have a delete button to make it easier to delete the status or picture. that'd be better than trying to travel years back to find the post and delete it manually."
2692,Michalthegirl,"September 19, 2014",4,"Fun part of the day This is great! I want there to be a way to see previous days' posts. Like if I miss it one day, I can go back and look. "
2693,justanotherbasicperson,"September 28, 2014",4,"Fun app, but one addition This app is great but a nice addition would be to get to view the week before or after of that day in your history. For many of us, I don't get on the app daily so I missed yesterday's post or the day before that. Also, I haven't put something on facebook and instagram every day for the past 7 years so somedays there is not much of anything on the app. A nice addition would be to add more days. But overall, it's a great and easy app to use."
2694,Window_Syl,"February 17, 2015",1,"still having problems!!! Still can't see any tweets from a year ago. Anything from Facebook or instagram shows up from a year ago, and tweets from two years ago and beyond also show up, but my tweets just won't come up from a year ago. (This is coming from a girl who tweets way too much, so I know for a fact I tweeted last year lol) "
2695,TizzLizzy120,"May 7, 2015",5,"Great app! I really like being able to look back at all the stuff I was doing a year, 2 years, 5years ago today! As far back as I have posted on social media it'll post that far back. The only thing I don't like is that you can only see today in history, so if you miss a day you can't go back to see it tomorrow. You have to wait till next year, but that's minor. Otherwise awesome!"
2696,Cheesed off big time.,"June 29, 2015",1,"Great idea, poor execution. I've had timehop for a few months and it simply doesn't work. Facebook offers something similar now and everyday it shows me posts from as many as five years back, while at the same time, timehop insists i posted nothing at all. I'd probably believe it too if it were not for these added features on facebook! They're eating your lunch, timehop!! They've introduced a product with your business model and are executing it nearly 100% better than you are! You need to fix this. "
2697,BrandyE78,"August 28, 2015",5,"Awesome Time Travel App! Super easy to set up. Ridiculously entertaining to use! So interesting to see the things I thought were ""so important"" and how much things, thoughts, etc... have changed. Love this app! Keep up the cute heart boxer wearing Dino with random comments. But dude seriously needs to change his undies they have got to be dirty as hell since he hasn't changed them since prehistoric times! (you need the app to understand)"

I have a iPhone 6 Plus with Sprint and I never have any issues viewing the app. I do with they would tell me that I posted a picture then deleted ""looks like someone is in politics"" or something like that. The curiosity kills me, what did I post?! I'll never know... Anyway highly recommend TimeHop"
2699,Dueylicious,"December 20, 2015",5,"Correctly named This app does exactly what it suggests...however, I'm not really a fan of going back and seeing my dead dog, exes and other random stupid stuff I've done in the past. Also not really a fan of reliving the past so I rarely share the posts. With that said, it is fun to see the weather related posts and I confess that now when I post things to social media, I am thinking of this app when I do so ;-)"
2700,Mcsquared47,"December 26, 2016",1,"Worst update ever I've never ever written a review on an app before, but this new update is SO BAD that I really felt the need to leave a review. "
2701,Emilykrow,"December 31, 2016",1,"Not worth having anymore This app was a fun and SIMPLE way to look back on old posts but now they decided to ruin it and make it 10x more complicated than it should be. They tried to follow this stupid ""story"" trend and that's how you have to go through memories now instead of scrolling. It cuts off pictures and you have to manually zoom out but then you can't see captions from those pictures and tweets and other word posts will just be cut off if they are too long. Absolutely horrible and unnecessary. No one had a problem with it before please change it back or I'm getting rid of this app."
2702,RB lover 101,"January 1, 2017",1,"The update is awful. I have never written a review because I've never had a problem before. I thought I'd take the time to write this one though because the update is terrible. First, I hate the fact everyone is trying to make everything like snapchat, that's stupid. Second, you can't read the caption you put to a picture? There is no point in the picture then, I already have it on my phone. Third, you used to be able to click the app emblem and go to the original post if you wanted to delete it or read the conversation. You cannot do that now. The whole update is just awful."

I don't like this update at all. It needs to go back to how it was or I'm going to delete the app. I hate tapping through to see not even a full photo I have on there. Then I'd better make sure I don't accidentally hit one finger on my screen before the other because it will just skip to the next. I also really hate that I can't see the comments on said post. That was half the joy of being able to see my old stuff. Time to review it and change it.
2704,LadyC71,"January 4, 2017",1,"Update WOW I thought it was just me. I HATE this new update and agree with the other reviews I've seen on this subject. I cannot share anything because it goes to the next screen. The zoom is so dang big now. Why did you feel the need to change it? I've always been told ""if it's not broke don't fix it!"" Why can't you go back to the old format or fix whatever this ""new"" format is suppose to be about. My Timehop does nothing like you said it would. If I could write a review without a rating I would. What use to be 5 stars is now 0 stars for me. Just glad to know I'm not the only one who is dissatisfied. Fix it please......"
2705,Tayterthot,"January 4, 2017",1,"If 0 was an option I would rate 0 Everybody has said it, but I'll say it again. I've never written a review before but this definitely seems worthy. The new update is terrible and makes Time Hop essentially useless. You can't watch videos, it doesn't show pictures that go with posts, it is overall NOT user friendly and I hardly check the app anymore because it seems pointless. You can't view half of what's on there and it just makes me mad and  frustrated. Please go back to the old version or fix these serious flaws because I would love to be able to use my app with ease again."

Most of the time those are the photos I want to share the most on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Yet there's no way for me to do that! If I could get a share button for those pictures too, I'd be able to give 5 stars instead of 4."
2715,Foxyboops,"February 6, 2016",5,"LOVE IT! I absolutely LOVE being able to look back at my kids when they were smaller & other photos from the past. It's not as simple as looking through a photo album anymore, because all of my older photos are on memory cards from older phones. I also love seeing exactly how long ago that photo was taken or shared & being able to add cute frames & icons as well."
2716,Ms. Elizabeth,"April 16, 2016",4,Fun looking back at old memories Had a little trouble syncing up twitter (you have to dl your archive for it to work) but since then it's been great! 
2717,airazedy,"April 24, 2016",1,Disappointing I hadn't been getting notifications for a while. So I just checked the app to see what was up and it always crashes. I can't get it to open. I've tried deleting it and redownloading it but nothing.
2718,Timehop tom,"April 28, 2016",2,"Saving pictures has become a nightmare The all over all functions well without any real bugs but the features they are adding in are awful. It's become harder to save your picture from different sources to your phone, sorry timehop no one wants you ruining their photos with dumb borders and hash tags. You can even see a picture in full unless you go to save it and pinch in to make it tiny. Go back to tap events on the pictures that would full screen it and we can screen shot them. Ugh watching them slowly ruin one of my favorite apps."
2719,HomeMeg,"December 22, 2016",5,"Bad update This new update is awful. Instead of seeing everything easily laid out in one list, they made it a flip book like Snapchat stories üôÑ which makes it very messy and hard to understand, and any pictures are extremely blown up/zoomed in. It's also nearly impossible to access the settings page now. Not a fan of this update at all."
2720,Thatttguy,"November 3, 2012",5,"TIMEHOP > I've used timehop for about 2 years now. I've loved it and used it since day 1. The email service was great. Rarely had problems, and when I did, i would simply email back and they would reply and get the problem fixed within a day. Great service. Rare problems. The app is amazing. Very clean UI, displays everything correctly, everything works. I've enjoyed this service so much. 5/5 stars"
2721,Amkksu,"February 20, 2014",3,"Great app but boo to recent ""updates"" Great app and I love seeing my old pictures. But the recent updates decreased functionality. The old messaging service was super easy to privately share memories but with the upgrade, it's not as easy. Also, the daily picture makes me not want to check the app as usually the times I am going to check the app are not times when I want to have a picture taken. You should at least be able to disable the feature or delete the picture."
2722,laprostitch,"July 9, 2014",4,"Sooooooo much fun!!!! It is like Christmas morning every day! I love opening up the app to see what I was doing on this day in the past! The only suggestion I would make to the creators is to see if it might be possible to be able to click on that picture and bring you back in Facebook to that time period. I find myself clicking the picture to read the comments that people wrote on it years ago. Other than that, it's perfect!"
2723,JoeyCrack92,"August 25, 2014",5,I never write reviews... It's a great design and easy to use.
2724,B Hh,"September 8, 2014",4,Love the app but... This is one of my favorite apps I love seeing pictures from the past but over the past week every time I sign in it says Time travel failed retry and all my other friends across the states are having the same issue. No updates in the App Store and we've even tried deleting and reinstalling the app. Would love someone to look into it please. Other than that I would give the app 5 stars but that's pretty aggravating everyday.
2725,MyNameIsSkid,"November 2, 2014",5,"Love I absolutely adore this app. I love it when you get something completely random on it because it makes you smile, or it brings back a good memory. I've noticed that if you set up push notifications, the app can mess up, however I normally remember to check mine instead of relying on a notification and every time the app opens it works just fine. Genius concept behind this app."
2726,FerrariWade,"November 16, 2014",5,App user This is great! So nice to see what I was up to this time last year. Whether your pictures are in fb or your phone or more time hop will find it and show you. 
2727,Marylnmonroe,"March 31, 2015",5,"LOVE this app! Only Only one thing would make me love it more would be to have the option to look at past posts from a couple days prior to the current day...sometimes I don't get to see them every day or forget to, even when I receive daily notifications, what can I say other than life gets pretty busy! Other than that this app is definitely on my faves list!"
2728,Tmayr1990,"January 26, 2017",1,"Garbage It was a great app. I used it all the time, everyday. But now it's impossible to share videos, some photos and a lot of stuff doesn't load. The Snapchat-esque style that was added with the recent update is a confusing choice at best. It doesn't make sense. I want to look at the thumbnails and pick pictures to enlarge and send if I want to. I'm willing to stick around for one more update to see if y'all decide to listen to almost everyone complaining about the changes but if it's not different with the next update I think you'll see a lot of people uninstalling and removing privileges. Myself included."
2729,Sfwbear,"February 22, 2017",1,"A perfect example of why you don't fix something which isn't broken I used to love this app. It was fun to see all of my old memories in one place, and also throwbacks from pop culture. It was easy to use and had all of my social media on one place. "
2730,Joel Joel big Swole,"December 31, 2016",2,"New update is trash First off let me just say this, I am an avid user of Timehop. My current streak is 167 days of checking in a row. Plan on reaching high numbers but WOW! This new update is horrible! You can no longer read the old comments and see who liked the old posts you've made. The snap chat feel is horrendous! Please for the sake of the regulars, change it back!!!! I wouldn't be surprised if people stopped downloading this thing and deleted the app from their phones. I'm holding on in hopes of a change back but will be gone soon if this doesn't happen."
2731,Required to use this,"January 2, 2017",1,Used to be my favorite app. I used to love checking timehop every day. It was part of my morning routine. It is totally useless now. All the posts now have no context without the captions that often make social media posts funny in the first place. The full screen is just stupid. Used to be a good system until a few weeks ago when posts would start to get cut off halfway and I would have to open the original post on twitter to read it. But instead of fixing that bug the whole interface changed for inarguable worse. If it doesn't change back very soon this app will loose me forever.
2732,JHKCS83,"January 5, 2017",1,"Miss old version! I've never taken the time to write a review before and don't know that the current version even deserves 1 star. Old version was 5 stars in my opinion and I'm not sure why they changed a good thing. I despise this version. I miss being able to see comments on old FB posts. I miss being able to add a ""now"" picture when I shared an old picture. I hate how it takes a handful of pics from an event and shows only a few of them with no option to actually tap and see full pic or see others that I know were posted at the same time. PLEASE go back to the previous version!"
2733,jesfrs,"January 8, 2017",1,"What the heck timehop This auto zoom is so incredibly bizarre. Why would anyone want that?? And I have changed the setting to off, force closed the app, but am still looking at half of someone's head. This is almost laughable. It won't fix. And I have no comments or likes showing. Tapping through posts has robbed the entire experience of the feel it had before of an overview of your past. I absolutely hate this. Where did the then/now stuff go? That was such a fantastic unique thing, and now it's gone. If an app update could be an episode of candid camera, this would be it. Joke's over. Bring back timehop."
2734,1078592ken112,"January 12, 2017",2,Awful If I could give this new update zero stars I would. I hate the new update and it infuriates me to check it now days. I often give up half way through checking it because it's just so obnoxious and difficult. Like why is every picture zoomed in an obscured amount? Why is there no caption on my photos? With out a caption it's just an average picture that has no meaning.. And finally why is there no longer time stamps on any posts? If timehop doesn't go back to it's old way/something similar to what it used to be soon I'm deleting the app.
2735,Yowza3,"January 16, 2017",3,"Need to have the option to choose viewing format I much prefer the previous list version. It was quick to view and navigate and easy to share content and refresh. Now, while I like the element of surprise with swiping, it takes too long sometimes and just the zoomed in photos just don't make sense. I know the developers probably want to innovate and offer a new experience, which is great. But if users could toggle between different views that would be better."
2736,Bryan0515,"January 17, 2017",4,"Sad I have to delete app I held off on giving up on the app or writing a bad review. I love using this app and am a tad addicted to the nostalgia but using it every morning is just to painful. I find myself exiting the app after just one year because clicking on each post is a nightmare. I hope to download this again in a month or two and hopefully it will be fixed. Extremely disappointed, can't understand why this happened."
2737,0/10Not_happy(pleasefix),"January 17, 2017",1,"Please bring back the old format I've used this app for a while now and I loved how I could look back at my old memories. However now I cannot see most of them because a grey screen takes their spot. I've read over your ratings lately and I can see that I am not the only one who really dislikes the new format made to be similar to snapchat, I can't scroll through my photos easily anymore- I have to tap back and forth. I realize this seems like a silly complaint- scrolling versus tapping- but please consider how many people hate the difference. We all loved your original app, please bring it back!"
2738,Errica616,"January 18, 2017",1,"Listen to your users!!! Rollback to previous version I used to love this app and look forward to checking everyday. Now I avoid opening the app because it's infuriating that you've completely ruined the functionality. The update has ruined every aspect I loved about this app. The only reason I haven't deleted the app is because I'm hoping they listen to the endless reviews requesting going back to the original version. If it's not done soon, I imagine you'll lose a majority of your users. Extremely disappointing!! I've never seen an app/company completely ignore all the feedback over their updates."
2739,AmyJLKM,"January 19, 2017",1,"old version was perfect I loved this app, until they kept updating it and changing things. It's frustrating to use now. All of the pictures are weirdly zoomed in, and you can't save them unless they have the ""two years ago"" caption on them, and some you can't even save at all. Rather than showing you a whole album like they used to, now they'll pick 3 photos from the album and show you small versions of those pictures that you can't even save. There were pictures of my dog that passed away and I couldn't even save them or click on them. I loved this app but now I hate it."
2740,Brimarie85,"June 12, 2016",2,"Please stop changing it! Why time hop? Why?! I don't want to go to another app or browser to see what someone wrote on my post in past years. I just want to click on the comments and remember. You have made this significantly harder. It doesn't even take me to the Facebook app, it takes me to safari which I have in private mode. I'm not logging in for every single photo. That's horribly inefficient. How about you give an option with the photo to view in Facebook app while still giving access to the comments in your app! Change it back!"
2741,bonniecharlie,"December 23, 2016",5,"New update Do not have word for how much I DO NOT like this new update. All of a sudden things are not linked and I can't get to settings to fix it. Swipe to share only works on certain pictures, some areas are too sensitive to the touch so you sneeze and it changes to the next picture and other options are not responding at all. Why did you change a good set up??"
2742,Topmike1023,"December 26, 2016",1,"New unusable update What have you done? Returned an app that was fun and enjoyable to use into something that honestly I will probably delete. The scroll style was much better than the new Snapchat style. I don't know why pictures are zoomed in, and if you want to see the whole picture you have to tap and hold so your finger is covering part of the picture. Yes that makes a lot of sense. If you have multiple pictures you can't see just one, you have to see them all. Comments and likes on posts are no longer available. And just to be nitpicky I don't like seeing posts highlighted in rainbow sherbet colors."
2743,Dkolodney,"December 26, 2016",1,Used to be good. Now is awful This new update is the worst possible update in the history of updates for any app of all time. No one wants to see zoomed pictures unless they choose to see them. Why only see some of the picture to begin with? Absurd! Now we can't see comments or twitter conversations anymore. There's no context to the posts without this. Who can possibly remember why a post was made 8 years ago without context?
2744,Flo O'Brien,"December 27, 2016",1,"Terrible new update I used to love waking up every morning to look at my Timehop, but now it's just become an annoyance due to the terrible new update. I know, some updates are just different and you need to get used to them, but this one has far too many flaws to surpass my love for the app. It's hard to see your pictures, and if there are multiple pictures from a day they play in a slideshow kind of mode which is even worse than cutting off half my picture. It's absolutely terrible and I wish so badly that I didn't have automatic updates on my apps for this sole reason. Thank you Timehop for ruining the app!"
2745,jayzee<3smusikk,"December 27, 2016",1,"Not a fan of the update I really enjoyed visiting timehop everyday, and one of my favorite features was the ability to click my old twitter videos and be linked directly back to that tweet from x year ago and I'm able to retweet myself/share. I can no longer access those tweets because timehop doesn't tell me what everything is being pulled from (also just another feature I miss in general). The auto zoom on every memory is also a bit irritating, and I'm definitely not a fan of having to swipe as if it's a Snapchat story. Please go back to the old layout, I'm sure many others agree!"
2746,Unhappy Timehopper,"December 27, 2016",1,"Horrible update - were the developers on drugs? Why oh why did you make these changes?  I get a ton of blank gray screens that I have to swipe to get to a weird zoomed picture that I then have to un-zoom to see the whole thing. I don't see the caption or post WITH the picture and no longer can see the comments on my post. Who thought this was a good idea?  Awful, awful, awful. I'm now stuck with FB's ""On this day"" feature to see what I've done each year on the same day. Please fire the developers who thought this latest version was an improvement and give me back the Timehop we had prior to this update. UGH."
2747,B. Win,"December 28, 2016",1,"UX Designer As a UX designer...I absolutely have such a hard time imagining the meeting where this redesign was established and everyone saying, ""this is brilliant"" because it's not. The user flow makes no sense. The usability is garbage. It's the least intuitive app layout I've ever seen. And this is someone who has used timehop religiously since it first came out. Like many others, I've never reviewed an app until this. Also, Facebook statuses get cut off, so not only am I not getting to see comments, I'm not even seeing the entire text post? Though I guess that goes along with only seeing part of a photo, right? Those were your intentions?"
2748,Adele D M,"December 28, 2016",5,"Don't like last upgrade I love Timehop, but the last upgrade took away the ""then and now,"" which was my favorite.  I also don't like the new additions at the bottom; please bring back the ones you had before, as they were simple and less obtrusive."
2749,Fat Ben Inc,"December 30, 2016",1,"New Update This new update is the worst one yet!! I've tried to give it a chance but I don't get it and it doesn't give us what the apps intended for and what we enjoy about it! The old format was so much better to be able to really TIMEHOP!! All the pictures are zoomed all the way in which makes it horrible, you had a great product and ruined it!!! Can't scroll back and forth only forward, I enjoy the options, plus being able to open a the whole folder of pics from that time period was awesome!! This was one of my most favorite apps and is now one of my least favorite... PLEASE fix the update"
2750,Eyes_So_Low,"July 7, 2014",4,"You should This app is really appealing and entertaining for me. Every time I read my old posts, I recall to actually have posting them, like D√©j√†vu. üòÖ "
2751,SMG55,"July 30, 2014",5,"Great for mamarazzi's like me! This app is perfect for someone like me. Those of us who love taking photos of our kids. I look forward to seeing what we were up to 1,2,3,4 years ago. I get to see how fast my babies are growing. I look forward to seeing my TimeHop every morning and it has encouraged me to take even more photos to document our great moments. Now, can we also have a Video TimeHop? That would be awesome!"
2752,xxxTHEZEROxxx,"October 12, 2014",4,Almost perfect This is a great app I love around Halloween and Christmas time getting to see previous years costumes and Christmas photos one thing this app is missing is Myspace integration I've only had a Facebook account for five or six years and a twitter account for two so it would be cool to see Myspace account photos and posts as well so instead of just looking back five years I can look back 10 years 4 out of 5 stars until Myspace is added
2753,jubileeparrot,"November 7, 2014",4,"Timehop is pretty awesome I like timehop a lot. It's fun to see what I was doing 1-7 years ago! I do wish you could just click on a date and it shows you everything. Once the day is over I can't go back tomorrow and check was was happening the day before. But otherwise great app, always brings a smile to my face. I also wish you could see what you were tagged in that day, rather that just your posts. But maybe that update is in the works!"
2754,Trybula,"January 2, 2015",5,Reminisce I love this app. It's too much fun to reminisce about everything that happened over the last five years. 
2755,Nomnomnombie,"February 12, 2015",5,"Excellent Helps remind me just how lucky I've been in life. Sometimes when swipe right to open the app from my notifications after it tells me 'your timehop is ready', it will give me yesterday's events. It works fine if I unlock my phone and open the app. But if I just try to open directly from my locked home screen it doesn't work sometimes. Nothing major! Love the app!"
2756,PalmerAvery,"March 19, 2015",5,"One of the best This is one of those, ""Aw, why didn't I think of that!"" apps. Guarantees a smile on my face every day -- if only to laugh at the dumb things I've posted online over the years. It also includes fun historical trivia, and the general tone is playful and clever. I have had difficulty getting it to sync properly with my DtopBox photos. That's a minor complaint. Overall, this is truly one of my favorite apps - ever."
2757,Thespianaf,"July 1, 2015",3,Time capsule in an app! Update 7/1:
2758,Js20620,"September 10, 2015",2,"Fix it & I'll be happy For the past few weeks every time I get on this app it wants to show me all these pictures that I have posted . the only trouble is , is that it tells me almost every picture has been deleted ! What I don't understand is why it would tell me that when I literally delete nothing on Facebook , & why would it even try to show me that particular picture if it had been deleted ? Why not show me a different picture or none at all ? It's irritating !!! I won't be satisfied with this app until that is fixed !"
2759,JKMommyto4,"November 15, 2015",4,"I love the daily reminders of past years! This works pretty well and I really enjoy the reminders. The one thing I would change would be that, when the cited previous post included a photo and text, to allow both to share or at least have that as an option. I cannot share or even copy the text. Also, do not shrink the shared photo size. Otherwise, I think this ap is great and works well and easily."
2760,DisneyCDW,"November 17, 2013",5,"Fixed! Thank you! So disappointed when this app stopped working for me after the last update. THANK YOU, PoopSchnoop, for the fix. Go into iPhone settings, then Facebook settings. Under Apps that use Facebook, turn Timehop off then back on again. Hard close Timehop, then when you re-launch it will take you through sign up and it works!!!"
2761,Rmzbchyska,"June 16, 2014",3,"It was great at first... When I first heard about this app I loved it! I loved opening it everyday and swim pictures of my kids from the last years and seeing how much they'd changed from that exact day 2 or 3 years ago. But then it started only showing my post I'd made and it wouldn't load the pictures. Then a few days ago when I tried to use it it says ""can't find object mapping key"" so it won't do anything. At this point is is wasting space on my phone. It's a bummer because I really enjoyed it."
2762,DavidT2026,"December 27, 2016",1,"Really? This was someone's job? As all the other reviews have stated this update is terrible. I've had the app for over 2 years have had multi month streaks going of checking what happened in the past every day with the app, but I haven't used it since the day the app was updated. It's clunky, I can't see my captions, you can no longer scroll and browse its a Snapchat style click through. Do not waste your time until they revert to the old format. But worst of all this was some how approved, beta tested, and somebody was literally paid o produce the worst major app update I've yet to see on any major platform."

I loved to be able to look back through the years and see pictures, tweets, and comments people left on my posts. The new update took all of that away. I'm no longer able to see how many people liked/commented on my past posts. The new update is terribly confusing and has frankly ruined the app as a whole for me. Because of the new update, I have deleted one of my favorite apps that I used to enjoy. Maybe I'll get it back if they ever restore the old Timehop and its past features."
2764,Blount:force,"December 28, 2016",1,"App has been ruined Time hop used to be one of my favorite apps. I enjoyed being able to see items from the past daily, and the comments that went along with it. However with this recent update, it's an app that I would no longer recommend to anyone, and I'll most likely just delete it myself. The interface is now HORRIBLE, and they have taken away the ability to see the comments from items in the past. I am extremely disappointed, and although it's a free app, they really screwed up what used to be an incredible must have app.. please just put it back to how it was."
2765,snare boy,"January 1, 2017",1,"Unnecessary and Irritating Seriously, this update is so annoying to work with. The pictures are zoomed in to ""fit the screen"", but trying to zoom out only works so long as your fingers are on the screen. AND WE CAN'T EVEN SEE THE CAPTIONS ON THEM. At the very least, fix this issue. At most, go back to how the app used to function, scrolling vertically through the years, seeing ALL the info for each post, including (especially) the captions on various photos. You don't even need to update anything (unless there's some bug or whatever). Literally just go back to one version prior to this ""swiping"" update."
2766,CallMeAngie,"January 3, 2017",2,"Please just change it back I loved timehop before this update. Granted I was having some loading issues but nothing compared to the intentional differences this update has brought. As many others have stated, the auto zoom in on pictures is weird, you can't see the caption with fb photos, AND if you posted more than one picture timehop makes it a collage where you can't share any of the photos. What's the point if I can't share the memory with others? Please, we beg of you, listen to your people and change the app back"
2767,ClareH1234,"January 9, 2017",3,Second update Thank you for actually listening to user feedback and bringing back features we love. I still have a huge issue with the snapchat layout because as multiple people have already said it does. Not. Work. For. This. App. Please roll it back. Also had an issue where I had to click on each of my tweets individually and go to each original post to see likes and retweets. It's getting there but still not a great user experience like it used to be.

2769,Arvid Ludfister,"February 12, 2017",1,Update is awful There needs to be an option to go back to classic setting because 1. i just want to scroll and (updated) now the pictures are framed right. Keep this if you want but then give us the OPTION!

Some of the memories are sad, but even so, it's great to see where you were and how far you have come. My only complaint, and reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, is I do not like the overall design of the posts. They aren't attractive at all to me, but I realize I am highly biased as I am a professional graphic designer. Anyways, highly recommend this fin app!"
2771,LehlaniTrinae,"July 5, 2015",2,"Update You all keep updating and nothing seems to change. I used to love this app when I had my iPhone 5c and as soon as I got the 6+, the app never wanted to open up. How can I enjoy the memories if I can't even see them? I would get the notification that my new timehop of the day has came, but can't open the app, because all I see are the loading spinners. And PSA for everyone else: let's say today is Thursday, obviously last year on the same date (not day) it would not be Thursday‚Äî it would be Wednesday... why your birthday changes DAYS every year, not DATE."
2772,Wyatt40,"July 27, 2015",4,"Love this application But I don't get to look at it every day so I wish I could look at the past week or at least enough days to compensate for the (pre-existing, before Time-hop and probably after it's gone)*fact that days and dates don't sync up from year to year. If these things change, I will give 5 stars. "
2773,Mblank13,"December 7, 2015",5,"Loving so far I've loved using timehop so far! This time last year I was pregnant, so it's been fun to look at the progression I made. I really loved this more than the Facebook memories, because it pulls memories from everything that you have linked to this app. I only wish you could look through previous days in case you didn't have time to look through it on *that* day."
2774,saritphoto,"December 30, 2015",4,"One of my favorites **the latest update allowing me to see when someone has viewed my photo feels voyeuristic and unnecessary. I like this app for the time traveling aspect and fun reminders of things past. I don't, however, care to see who viewed the image."

This most recent update I already hate. Don't zoom in on my regular 4x10 shape to fit into a portrait mode. Don't make me press and hold to make it look right. Why? Also I don't care of how I can't just causally scroll threw them but now have to go one at a time. I like mainly seeing the photos. Now I have to tap tap tap to get past some of the text. Really annoying update. I just don't get why they made these major changes. Don't fix it when it is not broken. :/
2777,Heathums,"December 23, 2016",5,Horrible Update New update is not user friendly AT ALL. I could barely even find how to contact Timehop and leave a review. Photo comments are not there any longer. I'm really disappointed. Not easy to navigate at all. Have to click 10 times to get through your day in history. I looked forward to my timehop each morning and I will find a different app now. Bye timehop.
2778,Shannie Lynn,"December 25, 2016",1,"Worst update ever I have been using timehop every day for the past couple of years because I loved it so much. I loved how I could easily see every single thing I have ever posted on social media. Now it's awful. It makes it way too complicated to see the things you posted from the past. Before the update you could see who liked and commented what you posted, now it's not even available to see at all? You can't even see the captions of your photos you posted. I don't understand how anyone thought this update was a good idea. I'm deleting it if it doesn't go back to how it used to be. It's awful!"
2779,Barish44,"December 25, 2016",1,New update is awful I hardly ever write reviews but this update is awful.  Today for instance I had about 40 pictures due to the history of Christmas and it took forever to swipe through each one. I liked the previous format where you can scroll down and see what memories you had and then you could choose to look at the pictures.  It took 5 min to go through my history. It used to take 2 min.  Also they took away the then and now feature. You can't see the previous comments and likes. Overall I hate this update and wish I could go back to the old way
2780,MikeCalGov2018,"January 17, 2014",5,"Manifestation of Nostalgia I love when I'm involved in an experience that reminds me of the moments of the past that I record. Everyday I get a happy & warm when ""timehop"" notifies me of nostalgic experiences everyday. "
2781,Mamslmkp,"February 6, 2014",4,Love & will more if... I do love how this app provides me with a look back and seeing some great memorable photos again however I will like it even better when they make it possible to go back and at least see the last few days again. What if I forget to look one day or want to show somebody without having to save them to my phone or email? I would like that capability. How great this would be to also turn into a book!
2782,ChantaleM,"June 17, 2014",4,"Blast from my awkward past It does what it says it is going to do and pretty successfully at that. I get excited to look at it each day. I have a 5 year old and it is crazy to see how much she has grown even from 3 years ago. I think from that standpoint alone this app is awesome. I also like how it let's you know about world events in the past and it also has a little quote. It's super cute, has a great interface and is full of great memories. It's a keeper!"
2783,oopooz,"September 4, 2014",5,"Love this app!! I found this app when a friend of mine posted her ""time hop"" I love that it goes back and gives me reminders/pics of what was going on 1,2,3,4+ years ago! Kinda makes me feel old, but it's fun to see my little boys pics from years ago! It would be nice to have the option of clicking on the memory and being able to see the ""likes"" and ""comments"" though :-)"
2784,Kortney Walsh,"September 7, 2014",3,"Too many failed attempts Everyday since I've downloaded this app I have at least two failed ""time hops"" I'm not sure if it's on the Facebook side or this app but what's the point of having if it's only ever giving me old Facebook status? I absolutely love the idea and concept of the app which is why it's getting the three stars instead of two. If they could fix this issue or someone please lead me into a direction to fix (if it is my Facebook app) then it totally would get a five star rating from me!"
2785,Shay Musical,"October 22, 2014",3,"Make more Time Hoppable please If the app were tweaked to enable the user access to view prior days the app would be five stars.  Love that you can save status updates as photos, that you can save the photos to your phone and/or share on multiple social media sites.  Sometimes I check my timehop but don't have the time right then to save/share, I'm just scrolling.  Well I don't always have time that day nor remember to go back on before the next day's timehop publishes and then that's it, I lost my chance."
2786,tineloh,"February 23, 2017",1,"Hate the new version I never write reviews but am compelled to in this case. This version basically got rid of all of the reasons I enjoyed this app. The new way of tapping through pictures is annoying and pointless. I still cannot share by swiping up and have updated to the most recent in hopes that it got fixed, every time I swipe up it just goes backwards or forwards in pictures. I used to love the then/now feature then, and now it isn't there. Please pleas listen to all of your loyal users and switch it back to the original!!! NEW ISSUES MAKE IT UNBEARABLE TO USE!! Please for the love of God fix this disaster!!!"
2787,Blueflamingo09,"February 24, 2017",1,"Eh I used to really love Timehop, and I'm not deleting it until I reach a 365 day streak but the recent updates make it hard to manage. I like being able to view things within the app not going to the external place it came from. For example if I captioned a photo and it's long I can't read the whole thing in Timehop it send me to Instagram or Facebook. Also in some images there are multiple images that are weirdly framed and I can't click on one to view without it just clicking forward to the next memory. "
2788,Moments on the journey,"March 9, 2017",2,"Say cheese! UPDATE: I am changing my previous 5 star review to a 2. I still love this concept but your recent updates the past few months are terrible! I am about to stop using the app because I am so disappointed in the changes. Hate the new format, hate how I can't see all the stuff I had been able to before. I've just been so disappointed. I keep hoping you'll listen to all bad reviews and revert back but you haven't. So sad. "
2789,joelzmole,"July 17, 2017",3,"If there's one hangup I do enjoy using the application, it's very nice to go back to old memories and enjoy the posts from back then. But I cannot stand the use of ads. I get you need to find this application but the way the ads litterally will not allow you to continue a streak because you ""have to watch a Video"" is bogus. It sounds silly but when you get to almost 200 days and have it reset to one and then two days later, reset again. I'm sorry that's a bit of a joke."
2790,Myshoesonfire7,"September 8, 2015",3,"Used to be great. I used to love this app.  Every picture used to show and now, some sort of update occurred and I only see about 40 percent of my pictures.  The rest say ""photo did not reach 88 miles per hour"" which I'm assuming means it can't connect to download the picture;  Which is dumb because I'm connected to perfectly good wifi.  I tried just using my data and it does the same thing.  It's an app problem and it's upsetting because I'm missing out on all of the good memories.  Please fix it."
2791,Srever,"September 27, 2015",1,"Go away! I used to love this app. However, the most recent update created a button on my lock screen and a banner at the bottom of my screen when I have all my apps showing what's open. You can't seem to get rid of them and it's fairly creepy. It's not like this is an app you look at multiple times a day like fb, ig, or even your mail. Totally unnecessary and weird. Also, it generally skips a lot of things that my Facebook ""on this day"" shows. It clearly needs to have an extra look to get back to the awesome app it was. If not, I'll probably uninstall. I really hate the button on my lock screen."
2792,iLoveyourGutsLP,"December 26, 2016",1,"uh, what? Like many in this reviews section, I've been using timehop for years and it's a fantastic way to see memories and share them with people, but what even is this new update??? Yeah it gives you a little 'tutorial' on how to use it but it still makes very little sense. I really wish good apps that I like would stop trying to copy Snapchat. Seriously, timehop is nothing like Snapchat and yet even this app has succumbed to the 'influence', after IG and Facebook messenger adding 'stories'? Like gaahhh, stop! I hope the amount of negative reviews gets the developers to change it back to the old style. Very disappointing /:"
2793,SallyDollx13x,"December 31, 2016",1,"New Update is Terrible!!! I check Timehop every single day, and before the new update I probably would've given this app at least a 4.  But the new layout is so frustrating!!!  I hate that the pics are automatically zoomed in, you have to hold the pic to zoom out, sharing is very difficult, plus you can't share videos anymore!!  The old layout was so much better, the only improvement it needed, before this new update, was a way to save your original posts in full size, and the ability to choose whether you wanted to add txt, borders, etc.  Timehop Please Bring Back the old Layout!!!"
2794,SHTarno,"January 1, 2017",1,"Garbage update Absolute garbage update. Ruined what was a lovely app. There is no reason to have pictures zoomed in by default. The swiping or tapping through the timeline is so much like Snapchat, Timehop should be embarrassed. It's now seemingly impossible to return to a previously posted article. Why would I just want to see the cover photo? The entire point was that a user could revisit articles. Now you can't even see the full post to know what the title was or what site it came from. The update also makes it impossible to see comments, dates, or Tweet threads, so basically it no longer serves any purpose at all."
2795,tamaritski,"January 2, 2017",1,"Can we just 'hop' back to an older version? In my opinion, TimeHop has always been a 'must have' app. I check it daily (often more than once), forward memories to others from it a few times a week and recommend it often. Now? It's the most frustrating app on my phone and it's an update away from being deleted. "
2796,kmp406,"January 3, 2017",1,"Update makes app pointless and unusable I checked the reviews to see if I missed something on how to use the app after the last update. I've never had issues with an app like this after an update. While I was relieved to see from the other reviews that I'm not going insane and the update did, in fact, turn this app into garbage, I'm also sad because I really enjoyed the app before. Now it's basically pointless. With no captions or context for the photos, why share them? I will likely uninstall unless it is made more user friendly or the features from before the update are restored."
2797,Mjacobic,"January 6, 2017",1,Could be a 5 star. Undo the update I haven't used it since we got the update. I cannot stand the new version. I hate how it's huge and you can't just scroll down. It's not user-friendly anymore and especially with them going through your photos it shouldn't be that way. I'm probably just going to delete this app anyways. I wish it could go back to the way it was a month ago. It was a very bad business move with this most recent update. If the update isn't reversed in about a week or so it will definitely be deleted I cannot stand the update it's very inefficient and annoying
2798,Relsisl,"January 10, 2017",3,New update needs to go Updated: Glad the comments feature is back and the pictures are no longer zoomed in. But wish I could see all the pictures in the album bigger instead of small. 
2799,Eddie Imparato,"January 27, 2017",2,"Notifications for facts is strange Timehop. Great app until the recent changes. I really don't want to see facts that are considered notifications. You're idea is awesome how you show our past images, but when I get a notification that I have an update and it's just a fact that is rather pointless, it makes me want to remove this app entirely. "

I still check it every day, however it's been glitching and having problems with photos. Also, there used to be a section that was a global historic post like the day the Beatles started touring or what have you. But recently that section hasn't shown up and I'm extremely upset about it. Get that fixed and I'd rate 5 stars!"
2802,abe_2010,"May 31, 2014",5,"Abe & I First off, Abraham is my name so me and the little Dino have a lot in common but as far as the app goes, it really makes you see how much you've changed within all the years you've had social networks. It pains me to see how stupid some of my post but then it makes me happy knowing I'm not the same. I love this app, definitely a life user. Can't wait to see next years stuff about this year."
2803,EvenStephen2000,"June 17, 2014",3,"Nice when it actually works... Just stopped working temporarily, for some reason? I'm sure this is a more complicated app in that it has to access Facebook - which has its own mountain of issues - so we have to give them that. I do like it's unique approach of recalling posts from the past, so I'll stick with it. I wish it were a little bit more stable, though. Again, I'll give them that Facebook is a pain to work with for users, so it must be hell for app developers that need to access it‚Ä¶"
2804,Raverrow,"March 4, 2015",3,"A once great app... I used to love Timehop. Unfortunately the current version is ""buggy"" and not nearly as user friendly. When you share it no longer shares the entire post and it crops your pictures. Often when I am using the app it will suddenly freeze or close out. I am sad because I really did used to like this app a lot. It was so nice to be able to see what you were doing 1 or 5 years ago...always a fascinating window into a different ""you."" Hoping the app gets fixed."
2805,Erinski99,"March 18, 2015",5,HORRAY For TIME HOP! I love this app so much! I love reminiscing and reflecting on things I've experienced throughout the years. I love have looking at photos from previous events and other important moments that are now in my past. It's so exciting when I have a new post from the past discovered through Time Hop and every single time I get super excited just anticipating what the new Time Hop will have in store for me each day!
2806,Kaitybeth,"May 15, 2015",5,"I love the App and their IT guys! I love this app so much but when I changed my settings for Facebook to be more private, the app couldn't access my photos. I changed the settings back but it still wouldn't. Wrote a short email to time hop, and in 5 minutes the problem was solved!!! I've never had such fast response from an App before! So thank you Abe, now I can enjoy my #tbt again! "
2807,RobinsonBunch2011,"July 1, 2015",5,"LOVE the update!! I like being able to share my memories and being reminded of things that happened or things I shared on this day in years passed. I can choose which ones I share and I love that there are now customizable frames for all of them! They're hilarious and now there's always one to fit the pic. Oh, and I DO pay attention to my prehistoric buddy at the bottom of the scroll. ;)"
2808,GlossyVeneer,"August 29, 2015",4,"I love the flashbacks I love the flashbacks and remembering things I shared years back. It's fun to make the ""then and now"" comparisons. I am frustrated that it thinks several Instagram and Facebook pics can't reach 88 mph, I haven't deleted them but I'm too lazy to dig through my archives to find them! It's like the app is taunting me, reminding me of the caption on something and all the comments but not the original pic! :-) Still, I am always happy to scroll through the memories each day!"
2809,Sir Precious,"March 20, 2017",4,"New TimeHop Update I hate what they did with TimeHop. It was easier to view before, being able to scroll up and down, and now it's left to right, and confusing with tapping on the picture to zoom in and out and view be next. Will most likely be deleting this app now that they ruined it. There are way too many ads now, and it's beyond frustrating. Time to delete the app for good. Thanks a lot for ruining a good app."
2810,PrincessCrabby,"December 26, 2016",1,Can't stand the new update. I don't think I have EVER taken the time to review an app until now. This new update completely ruined Timehop for me.
2811,ediesque,"December 31, 2016",1,"Garbage Update At best, this update is terribly misguided. It's just awful. What were the developers thinking?! Timehop is about the past, a TIMELINE. It should be a line of memories."
2812,chasemypaige,"January 6, 2017",1,"Worst update I am joining the ranks to say how disappointed I am with the new update.  Not being able to see the comments from old posts was the biggest draw for me. It added to the memory of the post. Also, having all the pictures zoomed in is awkward because you can't see the entire picture without sticking your finger in the middle of it and holding it down.  I hope with all the negative reviews some of the better features will be brought back in the next update which will hopefully be soon.  If not, I'll be deleting the app and going with the Facebook memories."
2813,TCUGIRLY,"January 8, 2017",5,"Bring back the old one The update is kind of annoying. I liked the old Timehop when you could scroll down instead of swiping through everything. Also one of my favorite features ""then and now"" is not available anymore. If any developers read this can you update and revert to the old app? I know I'm not alone on this."
2814,Sarah in MN,"January 9, 2017",1,New version is horrible! I hate this new version of TimeHop. Why zoom in on all the pictures and videos?!?! I don't get it. 
2815,MattyBoop,"January 10, 2017",5,"Horrible new version I have always loved the Timehop app, look forward to checking it almost everyday, but the new update is so so bad. I have no idea how they allowed this to happen. Who thought this interface was better than the previous ones??? Please please go back to the original format. My app barely works, keeps crashing and freezing now"
2816,solastsummer,"January 17, 2017",1,"Another ""update"" that doesn't fix the real problem Even after turning auto zoom off, my photos are still slightly zoomed in. I don't need the photo to take up the whole screen, I'd rather just be able to see the entire photo. Including the edges. When you have similar images, it just flashes through them, keeping them on the screen for barely a second... can't really enjoy the memories like that. I'm not opposed to change but the new layout leaves so much to be desired and Timehop refuses to listen to its audience. Hope they get it together before they become totally irrelevant."
2817,Button(s),"January 19, 2017",1,New update--useless So the current version on my iPhone 7 is basically useless now. Takes on average about 10 seconds to load each photo/video...there is no way to quickly scroll to a moment in time (you have to literally click through every photo/video) this went from my favorite app to the worse app I've ever had/wanted to use daily.
2818,JoeHall257,"February 24, 2017",1,"You're still not listening. Update: Finally gave in and deleted. Way to listen, Timehop."
2819,annasnabl,"March 16, 2017",1,"Rip Timehop I have come close to deleting this app. It was such an amazing app but I personally find Facebook's ""on this day"" 10x better. No one wants to side scroll each individual memory. The TimeHop team has ruined their interface. It's not intuitive. It's not fun to scroll through. It's annoying. I highly doubt they will go back to the original vertical scrolling (the most natural feeling for a thumb to move on a phone screen). It seems they *have* to have ads now because that's how the world works. They need money. I would happily pay a couple dollars to have the original app back with no ads."
2820,Lovethesenuts,"March 4, 2015",5,Timehop Cool app... Thought it was pointless when my girlfriend first downloaded it onto her phone... Eventually I gave it a shot & it's pretty cool... Funny seeing pics/posts of exactly a year or 2 ago... Some good & some bad memories. It actually has helped. We were on the verge of breaking up & she started going thru pics of a year ago when we first met. We looked so happy and she got a change of heart!!! Thanks Timehop!!!
2821,Jilly614,"May 7, 2015",5,Fun app This is just a fun little app to check once a day and see what you were up to on that day over the years. I have all of these pictures on Facebook but there's pretty much no chance I'll scroll back 8 years so it's nice to see some memories from college and how much fun it was. It's also fun to send a funny old picture to friends. Especially if it's embarrassing for them :)
2822,DJ OuterCore,"May 26, 2015",3,"Bug on iPhone 6 Notifications are daily and can get annoying to see on my phone over time. On my iPhone 6, when I swipe a notification from timehop in my lock screen to unlock my iPhone and open up timehop immediately, my iPhone goes to a black screen with the Apple logo on it (as if it were restarting) for about 5 seconds before re-locking my iPhone, this time without a notification. It's happened to me every time I've done it since about a couple weeks ago."
2823,Tyefyter,"May 30, 2015",3,"Great app, bad crop! Great app for ""time traveling,"" but you are forced to crop your photo by almost half, making it pointless to share with friends. Also, sometimes the share functions aren't the same for similar posts or photos, like sometimes instead of giving me the caption and before/after options, it will only send a link to the site. Please fix these problems, and I'll rate this 5 stars!!!"
2824,Flaxim,"July 20, 2015",5,"Amazing future forward solution ! I love this app! Was skeptical until I actually tried it and now I look forward to flipping through my ""photo album"" daily. It's an ingenious idea and really helps me with the fact that I have dozens and dozens of digital photos that I will never print out or look at again if not for this app! Love it and can't wait to see what comes next."
2825,Crazymegg,"September 22, 2015",2,"Great app but doesn't always load I really like this app, however I've noticed that some days time hop doesn't load at all so I can't see my past statuses for the day. I know I can wait a year for it, but it's frustrating because I check it every day. I also wish I could see previous days, even just the last couple days, for this reason. It'll work one day and not load the next. Also a lot of the pictures don't load lately. Used to love the app, but definitely disappointed. No response when emailing app support either."
2826,Candycane626,"June 16, 2016",2,"I used to love it, but now... I don't know what changed, but now my timehop won't load. I was only using it because I don't have the Facebook memories thing inexplicably, but now I can't even do that. I've signed out and back in, uninstalled and reinstalled, turned my phone on and off, disconnected and reconnected things like Facebook - nothing. Don't know what they changed, but it's extremely frustrating. I will be deleting the app now; what a waste! Guess I'm just one of the few who doesn't get to see memories at all, thanks Facebook and timehop for nothing!"
2827,ny.minute,"October 4, 2016",3,"Fun app but please lose the branding I love this app and check it everyday. However, I hate that when I save MY pictures from the app, they are branded with the Timehop logo and a time stamp like ""3 years ago"". They are my pictures. Please stop putting your logo on them. And half the time, the time frame is wrong too especially if it's a picture from 10 years ago that I shared for the first time last year. Please let us save our photos to our libraries without your logo and timestamp. Thank you!"
2828,Hacklack,"December 24, 2016",1,Used to Love I used to love this app and would check it every day. Until this morning. Normally I would give myself some time to get used to an update before deciding that it's hideous. 
2829,Adach1,"December 24, 2016",2,"Listen to your fans. Timehop has always been a different social media app. I'm not a professional when it comes to pleasing a customer in the application world, but lend an ear to our reviews. Timehop is an awesome concept. No need to change the whole format. The new update is very hard to navigate. I agree with the reviewers that said it was more of an aggravating experience today than a nostalgic one. Consider changing a few things back. If we want Facebook or Snapchat, we will use those applications. We want Timehop. Thanks for all the hard work guys."

Then, randomly yesterday, it just stopped working. I didn't change my Facebook password. I didn't change equipment. I didn't change anything. But now, for whatever reason, I cannot log in at all, and I get an ""error key:path missing"" message every time I try.  Quite lame and I am wondering if the 6/6 app updates caused this.  Sorry timehop, but you're being deleted until you get your act together."
2833,Robert Goerke,"July 18, 2014",4,"Amazing Overall, this app is great. I love being able to see what I was doing this day in the past. One thing I noticed is that I constantly have to re-log in. I think that you should be able to log in with twitter and Instagram, instead of just Facebook. I know you can add them later, but it's convenient to be able to do both. I also wish you were able to just type in a date and look at it."
2834,üòãüòùüòú,"August 31, 2014",4,"Really cool app... But I think you guys should introduce a feature where you can open up the tweet on your twitter or open a certain picture on Instagram (to see favorites and replies to the tweet or comments on the picture) I will change to 5 when it happens because I really think that would make this app perfect! Sometimes I want to know more about what I've tweeted or instagrammed, so thank you if you ever end up doing anything with this!"

It's a crazy reminder of how time flies, but also a nice trip down memory lane...annnnd how much I've grown up with social media! One year I'm chugging beers with friends and 5 years later I'm posting pictures of my son! I love it and check it every single morning!"

2838,Ox_KK,"January 26, 2015",4,"Love the App, a little disappointed with the update. I love some what of the updates done but I hate that now when you post to Facebook it goes to your mobile folder. I liked when it posted to my TimeHop Photo album. Can I please get that back. And now we have to upload to the sites individually boy which isn't all that great. It was better when we could most to multiple sites at once. Please fix then I'll give 5 star."

I think the people that give this a bad rating just don't have any good memories to look back on. üòù"
2840,nicolefeller,"July 9, 2013",5,Great but... I loved using timehop but just deleted my Facebook account so I can no longer use it. I'm disappointed about this because I enjoyed seeing my old Instagram photos. There should be other ways to sign into timehop and use it without Facebook. Not everyone wants to use or have a Facebook so it would be nice to still have the option for my other social networks.
2841,Mashamoon,"January 1, 2017",1,"HORRIBLE Update This is my first time writing a review, I just couldn't hold back my feeling of contempt for this new update/version. Have to one by one swipe through every picture (as opposed to easily scrolling down an organized feed of years/events as before), with every picture zoomed in so you have to take the time to zoom out, and on top of that half of those pics not loading or shareable to begin with. I used to check the old version every day and loved using it to share old memories/pics/FB statuses, but now I'm contemplating deleting altogether as it's become nothing but a pain :|"
2842,Mabadoo,"January 3, 2017",1,"It's a No from me This is my first time writing a review for an app, after being an iPhone user for more than 5 years. The new Timehop update is absolutely ugly. The attempt to become more Snapchat-style is recognized, but not appreciated. Previously, I was excited to view my former posts and pictures, but this update is just as cringey as my 8th grade tweets themselves. The inability to decently screenshot posts, unnecessary zoom, lack of captions on images, and inability to view the post in the original domain is an abbreviated list of my highest problems with the new update. I love the concept behind Timehop, but this update makes me want to die"
2843,Tfran056,"January 4, 2017",1,"If -3 was a rating, that's what I would pick I don't usually write reviews in general, but this used to be one of my all time favorite apps to use. But like everything else, all good things must come to an end. The company tried ""making the app better"" when all they did was run it to the ground. For the OG users out there, I had 217 consecutive days of checking timehop, but now I don't even open the app because it disappoints me every time. I won't restart using this app until the bring the old version back, so until then I would just save the space in your phone, you don't need this."
2844,Kimtention,"January 14, 2017",1,"Used to be my favorite app, now it's the most frustrating app I have used timehop every morning for probably a year and a half now. I loved the ability before the update to share photos and videos. Now, I can't share videos or photos that are similar to each other, and when the option to share is available, when I go to send a message, the app crashes. Every time. The zoomed in view is horrible and pointless. Not everything needs to be the same as other apps - Snapchat is snapchat for a reason, please update this so it's user friendly and actually works!"

Before it was easy to scroll through my memories and see what I posted in years past. Now it's annoying, frustrating, hard to use, and not enjoyable at all. This isn't Snapchat or Instagram stories. Please bring back how it was, get rid of the ""story"" type feed. I'm all about improving apps but you guys ruined a very enjoyable app experience. I'm deleting the app for now and enjoying my memories from what Facebook provides. Hopefully you guys fix this and start gaining your fans back. I'll download this app again once it's better."

I never liked this new feature where you have to tap the pictures away like a Snapchat story. Wish we could just scroll through it like the old times. Now, assuming the most recent update is the cause, my app crashes before I can even finished what happened in a day. Luckily I can watch videos of ads to keep my streaks from dying because of this, unless they decided to take that off as well üòëüòëüòë..."
2848,amydot,"April 2, 2017",1,Need big picture view back Been using this app for many years very happily. New update where you have to click through every photo and video is AWFUL. Totally impractical for 10 years of random social media! Go back to old format!

While it still does that it also shows a video of movies or songs from years past that I don't really care about. It shows that I have a picture with a little 1 even when I don't have anything that was posted in years past because of that other video that I didn't post!!"

2853,Liversnap123456789,"December 24, 2016",5,"New update is garbage! I usually never complain about new update or anything but I absolutely hate this one. I tried to go back to see something that happened four years ago and it took me so long I just gave up. I understand timehop is free, but after enjoying my memories for so long I no longer see its worth. I don't think I'll be using the app any longer."
2854,A2bucks,"December 24, 2016",1,"Terrible navigation and missing features I don't mind the full screen photos, but navigation is terrible. It takes so long to flip through each and every photo and video to get to the next year. It would be nice if they included a snapshot view that allowed to see all photos in a year and to go from year to year quickly. They also removed ""now and then"" which was a favorite feature. If they don't change this soon, I may not use it as often because it's a pain to flip through each and every photo. Did they even test this with real users?"
2855,phillywoozy,"December 26, 2016",1,"Glad I'm not the only one who thinks it's terrible I worried I might be overreacting in thinking the latest Timehop update is bad. Then I saw the reviews were overwhelmingly negative. This update is atrocious. I just don't get what they were thinking. What happened to the photo captions or the Facebook comments or the ability to go back and see a Twitter conversation? If any of those features still exist, I can't find them. Why are photos zoomed and then have to be zoomed out to see them? I've seen some iffy updates that took time to get used to, but this is the kind of thing that pushes people to stop using an app."
2856,ChristalC,"December 28, 2016",1,"Unfortunate Update... I have been a Timehop user for quite a while now, and the most recent update is the worse. I have always enjoyed being able to read the comments from the original post, and unless this is now hidden, it's not an option anymore. I am very frustrated that every photo is zoomed in to be full screen. Too much like another photo app. I realize there are millions of people you're trying to please, but this update stinks. Bring back the option to view the original comments and, at the least, give the user the option to zoom full screen."

I've had timehop since the beginning and i'm debating on deleting it now.... i never write reviews but i felt like i needed to because this NEEDS to be fixed... the new format of the way the pictures are viewed is zoomed in and blurry. It shows me pictures i tweeted but the
2858,Musiclaughing,"December 31, 2016",1,"Seriously?! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! I have never in all of my days seen a worse change to an app that was absolutely perfect the way it was. Is there ANYONE out there that thinks having pictures zoomed in, captions separated from their original picture, and the inability to share some of the memories you see is an actual upgrade!?! I'm hoping this is some sort of weird new year's April fools style joke- (it can't be real, right?!)... if it's not, I'll be deleting the app. It actually angers me to use it now- so much I sought out how to review it on here for the first time ever. Please bring back our awesome, simpler timehop! Stat!!"
2859,Autbot,"January 1, 2017",5,"Fun app I love that it's simple. I look forward to checking it everyday. Awesome app! But I think they could improve it, the last update to the app took away a feature that I felt was quite important. Now it just shows your photos that you've posted without the caption. The caption is every bit as important as the photo. I think this should be fixed."
2860,Englund27,"June 29, 2013",4,"Link inclusion I wish they would include the inclusion link factor from the parallel email service they run on the app as well. That way, one could, in essence open a post from Facebook say three years prior, and it would just immediately patch you to the post itself on the Facebook app or on a safari tab, again straight from the app. Oh, yes and please include Google Chrome functionality in next update if it is at all possible."
2861,Teeners87,"May 18, 2014",4,"Love this app but... This is a wicked awesome app, I love seeing all the different things myself and my son have done over the years. The only issue I have with this app is that it often doesn't allow me to post to my Facebook. I click the share button and when I try to press post it remains grey and will not go. Then I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and that didn't work for me this last time. Other than that really love this app."
2862,Ajuline,"January 20, 2015",1,VERY DISAPPOINTED I have loved app since day one it has been out. I have weathered through many glitches and disappointments on days it wouldn't load. Today I opened to find it showed me I had no history today! I went back and found several pictures in my phone and several on Facebook and Instagram- which are what I am connected by. As well as my phone. I went to my settings and turned all off and on again. Yesterday and today. My family everyday gets together and reviews these before we start our day. We are very disappointed instead of improving your getting worse.
2863,Mcginee,"January 24, 2015",3,"Used to the best! Ever since the last update Timehop has been butchering my photos. Prior to this, other than a few glitches, the app was great. Now the pictures are enlarged so the whole picture doesn't fit in the frame. Cutting off heads and such. Also now the date stamp is in the photo frame, so it often ends up over someone's face. Kinda makes the app pointless. If it isn't fixed soon, I'm deleting. Which is a shame because I've loved this app, and start each day with it. Please fix!"
2864,Danielle Lee,"February 5, 2015",5,"Time travel back in time... I absolutely love this app!! It's like reliving your past everyday...the good and bad times. Not only do you get to relive your life through photos and other things you've posted, but it pushes you to reflect on your life and where you were at the time and how things have changed. I look forward to the part of my day when I use this app."
2865,Moosie1972,"April 29, 2015",5,"Wonderful We all go through our lives, day by day in a constant blur. It's the little things we always tend to forget. This is such a wonderful way to remind us of those days so many years ago. Good times, bad times, it doesn't matter. My daughter is six now and to look back four years ago and the memories I wrote and completely forgot about is precious."
2866,Minaxkate,"May 3, 2015",5,"Multiple accounts?? I love this app, it works like a charm! But I would love to be able to link more than one account for each social media outlet. I've had previous Twitter accounts that are still active, and I'd love to see the memories from that account too! Anyway you can make this happen, Timehop??"
2867,a_u98,"November 3, 2015",1,"don't bother downloading! It's such a shame as when I first got the app a few months ago I loved it as it displayed all of my social media ever posted and allowed me to ""time travel"". However, a little over a week ago some content was not displaying from sites in which I knew I posted, then a few days ago nothing was displaying at all and the app just said there was no content. Apparently many other users are having this problem, yet it's been weeks and the issue has not been resolved, only gotten worse!! At this point, sadly the app is useless and not even worth downloading."
2868,EAHarvey,"November 10, 2015",4,"Fun, feel-good app I enjoy being reminded of the good, the bad and the ugly (and beautiful) that has taken place in my life over the years. It's amazing how fast we forget. "
2869,Ibmichele,"December 26, 2015",2,"Great app....until you try to share In theory I love this app. I love looking at the photos and videos of days gone by. The problem is that whenever I want to share a video, I get an error. Happens frequently with photos too but I can just take a screen shot. I contacted the developer and they were really nice. They said these were known issues and they were working to fix them. They asked me to send a link as an example. This app would be AMAZING if it wasn't for the bugs. I would even pay for it if you could just make it work ü§î"
2870,Tefyyefvysx,"December 29, 2016",1,"So disappointed with the newest update I have been a loyal Timehop user for years but this newest release has me considering deleting it from my phone and iPad. Where I used to look forward to scrolling through years past and seeing comments from friends, I am now frustrated with looking at auto zoomed pictures that focus on areas that make no sense and grouped pictures that should be separate. It's also impossible to share a favorite picture anymore - which used to be so fun and easy. Please revert back to the old product and go back to the drawing board for a new release."
2871,itsbmarieeee,"December 30, 2016",5,"New Update has to GO!! I have never went out of my way to write a review but the new update is just THAT bad. I used TimeHop daily, it was one of my favorite apps. However, after the new update I don't even want to use it. I have tried several times, thinking maybe it needed some getting used to but NOPE. I am clearly not the only one who feels like this from all the reviews."
2872,ChristaRahl,"December 31, 2016",5,Don't update I loved this app before the past couple of updates. I love seeing my posts from the past years and wondering if I can figure out which subtweet was about who. 
2873,Tifficans,"January 1, 2017",5,"Awful I've never written an app review before, but wow! I LOVED this app, and now I HATE this app. It took what I previously loved and turned it into a tease. You can't see full pictures, you can't share videos, and what is the purpose of that collage at the end??? You can't click on any of the photos! And, the quotes, detached from the picture they go with? Whyyyyyy? Please change it back!!!"
2874,Dahlik,"January 2, 2017",1,"Update is awful, useless. I loved Timehop before this update. Easy to see past posts, perfectly simple to go directly to an app from timehop, super easy to share. Now it's useless. What's the point of holding to zoom out on a picture? I can't see captions to any of my pictures of my posts or things I've retweeted. I hate it. They're trying to make it more modern, but the simple fact is DONT FIX WHAT ISNT BROKEN. This is is currently a 1/5 stars which is perfectly fitting for the current version. I strongly encourage them to revert it back to the old ways with maybe a modern redesign. Until then, your app is useless."
2875,eSpell,"January 6, 2017",1,"I hate that this is my first review... I'm very much a positive person, so this is uncomfortable for me, but PLEASE bring back the old app. I can't read any of my old posts or captions past the first line, it was all automatically condensed and won't expand, no matter what I try. It used to be a 2 min escape to see my past and be all ""awww"" and now I'm spending 10+ minutes frustrated because I can't read anything. Stop. It was fine before, change it back! And based on what I've read about the update, I'm not going to download it!"
2876,KenBug625,"January 17, 2017",1,"Terrible Update, Again The second most recent update, which moved from simple scrolling to tapping for each update was a step backwards in simplicity, usefulness, and ease of use. Now, this most recent update makes things even worse in terms of functionality. The app loads to a yellow screen with the date, and I literally do not know how to view photos and previous status update. I tap, I swipe, I try to scroll; sometimes a photo or status appears--more often, nothing. Timehop used to be one of my favorite apps, but one more update like the last two, and I'll be done."

I used to enjoy looking back at old photos on Timehop, but since I'm not able to enjoy the app anymore, only 3 stars. At least I can read old status updates... And yes, I am logged into Wifi most of the time. This is the only app on my phone that causes problems like this. I have deleted and reinstalled the app as well. Lame."
2883,Llambo611,"November 6, 2015",1,I hate the new timehop I use to love timehop now I can't stand it. Why can I only share on FB my pictures and not pictures my friends took of me. I'm someone who doesn't take a lot of pics and now I can't even share my friends pics. Clearly if my friends tagged me in a picture they are okay with me sharing it on FB. I'm considering getting rid of timehop because of this. It's a stupid app now because FB shows me pictures and statuses now from years past and still lets me share them. Why would I comment or like a pic I'm tagged in instead of sharing it?!?!? Wasn't that the whole point of timehop in the first place.
2884,Raineyville101,"February 15, 2016",5,"Reminds you how awesome life is Using your social media, (so if you don't upload things to social media- you may not have much info) Timehop reminds you of how much you've grown & how much fun you've had in the years past.

2887,StumpStudios,"December 23, 2016",1,"Regret installing update I updated this app and immediately regretted it. The update appears to have eliminated the ability to see who ""liked"" your post as well as any comments. Often times it is not the post itself that I so enjoy seeing again, but the commentary left by friends and loved ones. Also, when it shows that I've posted a link to something, the link no longer appears. It's very frustrating and disappointing. A good portion of what I'm trying to revisit is no longer made available to me through this app. I will look for a different app offering these details."
2888,Kb4256,"December 25, 2016",1,Considering deleting Timehop With this new update I have the urge to delete the app all together. The ability to scroll through things is no longer an option and having everything zoomed in as default makes little sense. I liked being able to see everything on one page and compare years and dates. Now I'm zoomed in on some random picture of a status I had years ago and can't figure out how to zoom out and save anything. Screen shots are nearly impossible. I hope with all the negative feed back you will consider returning to the original timehop.
2889,AmpSmith,"December 27, 2016",5,HORRIBLE UPDATE!!!! Who thought of this update?!! This is hands down the worst update I've ever seen! How can I be expected to remember what a pic is about from 7-8 years ago with no caption or comments?! I want TimeHop back not baby SnapChat! Please fix this foolishness you guys have done!! The scroll was and is far better than this tap/swipe mess! Boooo to the zoom feature as well! I want that ol'thang back!!!

Every time I click ""see conversation"" it says the page isn't available.

Whoever thought of it was one smart cookie!"
2892,Skell86,"January 12, 2015",2,Great when it works I love seeing my photos over the past years. It would be better though if when I tried to share my pictures from the past years the photos actually showed up on Facebook. Half the time when I hit share then look at Facebook all I see is how many years ago it was and a blank picture. This is getting extremely annoying. Recently it has gotten even worse at sharing and 3/4 of the time the picture doesn't show up. Please fix this and I'll happily give the app 5 stars.

The only suggestion I would make is to somehow allow the full original picture to be shared to Facebook, etc. without it cropping it off into a square. üíñüëå Also, sometimes the banner covers important parts of the photos, such as someone's face. Thanks for such a great memory lane app!! Look forward to more updates!:)"

I don't get the posts that went with the pictures. I can't see the comments people had previously left on the posts or pictures either, which usually was the most entertaining part. I've already been looking to find a replacement because Timehop does nothing for me in its current state. I've only held out this long hoping enough complaints would bring about a change, but so far no luck. Major disappointment."

Today, for some reason I had to log in with Facebook(which it let me know that I had already authorized it). It is going to sound silly but that one little move on your part, TimeHop, has me deleting this app. Who knows what grand scheme you have up your sleeve but 2017 I am making my life a little easier so you will have to proceed without me. One less app I need to concern myself with. Alas, you will now never know just how exciting my life is."

I can't stand to look through the photos and videos now that I have to press & hold to see them fully. Videos zoomed in?!? Really?! In what world is that a good idea? I can no longer see likes & comments anymore on Facebook or Instagram posts. Please bring that back. And I'd much rather scroll up than across. 
2898,Joey The G,"January 10, 2017",4,Better... I gave this app a one star review after they changed it to the new format because I didn't like the new way it was set up but even more because I wasn't able to see the comments on my previous posts. That has been changed now so that I am able to see the comments. I still don't like the set up as much as I did before the update but it's not that difficult to use.
2899,Lady Cornbread,"August 16, 2017",3,"It was awesome, now not so much... I loved this app when I downloaded it a while ago. Recent changes though have made it less then. Days don't load, or just stay up for several days in a row ( never changing), and it takes a while to load now. I have to either delete the app and reload download it to get the day to change, or restart my phone to get the app to go to the next day. Ugh, it's starting to get annoying and not fun to see the past!"

Every day now, most of what is presented to me are error messages telling me to reconnect the service in settings. Every service is connected, but what it's not displaying are items I've ""shared"" from another post on Facebook.  And now, when I attempt to Contact Us within the app, a blank email form is displayed with no address to send to. That's helpful.

I'd love to be able to post a collage of three or more pictures from timehop as a then and now. So a picture from  2014, 2015, 2016, and now. I think a lot of mom's out there would be all over this. I know I would."
2905,MrsAGC90,"May 7, 2016",3,"Stop the auto play!! I am definitely not a fan of the new retrovideo feature. It's cool in and of itself, but I should have the option of whether to play it or not. It starts automatically when I scroll down far enough, and even with my phone on silent, plays music and noise very loudly. There needs to be an option in settings to turn off auto play, like you can with Facebook videos. Or just make it so you have to click the video to play it."
2906,ssaarraahh6,"December 1, 2016",4,Glitch to fix? Recently the posts only show the first line of text causing me to have to follow the link to either Facebook or twitter. This is super annoying because I don't want to have to do that for every single post.
2907,Ed Pexing,"December 20, 2016",4,"Highly Enjoyable I have enjoyed TimeHop for more than a year now, and it is really one of the only applications that I want to have on any new device. It is very entertaining to see all of my old Facebook posts, Google Drive uploads, and Instagram pictures. I have great memories, and it is a helpful reminder of how the person I have been has informed the person I am. Plus, the day streaks are addictive! Get this app if you are introspective."
2908,CitySquirrel,"December 26, 2016",1,"Dislike the new update I greatly dislike the new update. Most of my photos are square, so the full screen awkwardly crops them and I have to zoom out. I also dislike that I have to tap to see more and can't easily scroll through things, especially to quickly bypass a memory I may not want to dwell on. If you decide to keep this format, give us the option to see it this way or in the old newsfeed style. I'm on a 225 day streak, but now I'm not excited to continue. Such a disappointing update. Especially right at Christmas when I know I have a lot of memories coming up."
2909,ItIsLiA,"December 31, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE update I've had Timehop for a really long time and I've always liked it. If I was to ever share a memory I'd make sure to do it from Timehop instead of Facebook memories. Well, the update has changed everything. First of all, it crashes constantly so most days you can't even load your memories. Second, the new layout doesn't allow you to see your captions (or at least I haven't figured out how to see them) and that's half of the fun. I just honestly don't know why I haven't deleted the app yet. I've never written a review for an app before, but I'm so disappointed with this one!"
2910,McMandie,"March 21, 2013",5,"If I could only have one app This would be it. I love the cumulative life picture it gives me. I've been getting timehop emails for over a year now, but the app goes back as far as my Facebook and twitter posts, even as far as the dates in my Flickr exif data. So in one shot, I can see how my life has changed and grown and stayed the same in one, three, five years and more. Love it so much!!"
2911,finnllow,"December 30, 2013",5,Top 5 Photo App! Instagram Sidekick! I can't believe this app doesn't have more reviews or a better rating. I consider myself a power-user having used it virtually every day since its original release date and I absolutely love it! I've not experienced any problems whatsoever. The only thing that could immediately improve the app is a share to Instagram option. Timehop Abe rules!
2912,TinaPhx,"February 23, 2014",5,"Great app! I truly enjoy being able to see what I tweeted about or posted as a Facebook status 1 year ago, 2,3 and 4 years!  It really does put the passage of time in perspective and brings back memories. And it's so easy to share those memories again on one or both of my social networks that I look forward to checking the app every morning. Highly reccommended!"
2913,TVColosi,"June 8, 2014",4,Really fun because I don't know how to find that stuff on my own Love seeing the stupidly sarcastic tongue in cheek tweets and FB statuses I've used. Also after losing over 250 lbs since '10 it's a nice reminder of what I looked like and how I don't want to go back. The only reason it's not a 5* review is I'd love to be able to click and see the likes/comments that were left on my status or photo. Also if they could add my old MySpace stuff would be cool too.
2914,Papa_fISH,"September 21, 2014",5,"So simple, so much fun Like printed picture before them, Facebook and Instagram pics often disappear into the web never to be viewed again."
2915,willcodeforfoo,"October 22, 2014",4,"Memory lane In the instantaneous world of social media, Timehop provides a slick way to reflect upon content you've posted in years past."
2916,Johnmarf,"December 29, 2014",4,"Timehop I Love this app! But there is some definite things I do not love about it. For instance, you cannot go back and look at previous days. There were days I have been in a hurry and I just skimmed through it. Realizing later I wanted a picture I found I could not go back. I have come to realize time hot has pictures that I no longer have for what ever reason. They are precious. It is very frustrating. Other than that it is a great idea."
2917,caseyynicole526,"January 26, 2015",4,Update I don't particularly like the update when you share a photo it doesn't keep the original caption when sharing and you can't share to multiple sites at once like you could before. I would like that back. Also I just had the issue of me going to share a picture and it auto cropped my friend out of the picture and I couldn't fix it. If these could be changed that would be great!
2918,Jitterbug0317,"February 14, 2015",3,"Updates are terrible! It's a great idea, and worked wonderfully in the beginning. However with the past few updates are terrible, the most recent update only shows me half the words on posts the other half are to right of the screen (like it was cut off) and I can't scroll to even view. I can only scroll down the years if I touch the very top of the screen (only app that does this to me)! Does not load every day. Go back the way it was before!"
2919,annaed884,"February 25, 2017",1,"Disappointing I finally had to delete the app after the developers refused to listen to their users. The old way with the scrolling was perfecting, but they changed it, and messed it up. Users were unhappy, and they changed some things, but it was still unusable. For the entire month of January, my memories weren't showing up, yet, they were showing up on Facebook memories. When I realized I could just use those, I decided Timehop could be deleted. If they decide to go back to the old way, I will redownload it and change my rating. It was a 4-5 star app before."
2920,Sir_Nigel014,"December 23, 2016",2,"Absolutely terrible update TimeHop's recent update changed the user experience from a scroll-based app to a tap-based app, which makes the app much more difficult to operate."
2921,abpersonality,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update is awful I really liked Timehop, I always started my morning scrolling through my memories...and then this update happened. As others have said, what is the point of blowing up the picture where you can't even see the whole thing unless you zoom out each and every one? Also, I enjoyed being able to see my captions and the comments on things, but now those are all gone. Everything that made this app enjoyable was taken away and changed to be...what? Certainly not changed to be better, that is for sure. Who approved of this?"
2922,droo216,"December 25, 2016",1,"Why so zoomed in? I'm saying what everyone else is saying: I don't like the new update. Tweaks and changes are fine, we all get used to app updates we don't like. I don't mind the format change so much, it's a little annoying at first but I'm sure I will adjust. But having pictures zoomed in as the default is just awful. Who would only want to see a section of a blurry part of a picture? It's nonsense. Additionally, I miss the ability to see photo captions and where they were posted - Instagram, Facebook, etc. It seems like a huge overhaul missed some crucial details and I'm pretty bummed."
2923,Lin829,"December 25, 2016",1,"New update is terrible I rarely rate apps but felt it was necessary in this case. The new format is terrible. Each photo takes longer to load. I don't always care to look at each photo individually; I prefer to be able to scroll down and scroll past photos I care less about to spend more time reminiscing over more meaningful photos and posts. I enjoyed seeing the comments and likes as well, which is a feature no longer available with this update. Please, revert to the previous format when we could easily scroll down to see years past."
2924,GandalfTheFunky,"December 27, 2016",5,"Hate the update. You be had Timehop for a few years and I love looking back everyday at the silly things my kids have said and memories I want to re-share. However, this update is horrible. The fact I can't scroll continuously and have to scroll each pic... especially when I've shared an album... so cumbersome and time consuming. Love the app... LOATHE the update."
2925,Agsmith07,"December 29, 2016",1,"Update is TERRIBLE The new TimeHop update has completely ruined what was an enjoyable app to reminisce on past experiences and social media activity. The app now just shows a couple zoomed in pictures - no tweets, no swarm check-ins, no context to photos. Further, the app doesn't even show all activity from a date in the past. I know there were places I went, tweets I sent, etc. on this date that are not showing up on the app. If this update isn't fixed in short order, I will be deleting the app. The app now is just a frustrating remnant of what used to be an app I enjoyed checking daily."
2926,Why no?,"December 31, 2016",5,"Why? I've never written a review before, but felt I should for this. I loved timehop, before this recent update. I could see my old posts, see pictures, and see comments my friends had left. Why ""fix"" what wasn't broken? This new format is terrible. Such a disappointment! Scrolling, great. Clicking, great. But all the rest, gone, not user friendly. "
2927,Catana77,"January 7, 2017",1,Nope Bring back the old format!  I liked the ability to see all of my memories by scrolling down instead of only one at a time.  I don't like that the photos are zoomed in and you have to zoom out to see the whole picture.  It doesn't show any of my captions that go with my photos and I can't access the likes or comments on those memories which is part of the fun.  Looks like I'm not the only one who is unhappy with these updates.  Might have to delete this app to make room for something else.  Too bad because I really enjoyed looking back in time each day.
2928,piaras78,"January 16, 2017",2,"Here's an idea... If you're dead set on continuing on with the miserable new interface, you could at least support an option to let users choose to use this OR the old format. "
2929,MamaMast,"January 31, 2017",1,"Bring back the former version I used to love Timehop and used it all the time to enjoy and share previous FB posts. Since the most recent update, it has lost all the functionality that made it useful for me. Now, I just check with the app periodically in hopes that you decided to bring back the former version. The current version is useless. I'm better off using the app that Facebook provides. 'Tis a pity."
2930,DAERKXP,"October 9, 2014",4,"Love it, buttt I love this app, it's interesting seeing snapshots of my online activity in time. The nostalgia- both good and bad, is certainly strong in this one. The issue I have is that since I've updated it, I've been unable to open the app no matter what I try.  It shows the yellow time hop window at the beginning, then force closes and returns to my home screen. Would be 5 stars if I could use it, hope it's fixed soon."
2931,Finchyxo,"December 4, 2014",4,"It would've been 5 stars, but... I love this app and being able to see all of the pictures and posts from the past! Although it would be nice I could copy the pictures to my iPod because a lot of the pictures that come up on my Timehop aren't in my iPod picture gallery. If and when that happens I'll make it 5 stars! But other than that it is an amazing app and I'd recommend it to everyone if I could!! <333"
2932,Carrrrrllllllsssss(:,"December 13, 2014",4,"I agree I'm only giving it four stars because I wish it wasn't so limited. I would love to connect with MySpace, because that's really where the action happened. And text messages! Oh my?! I would love to see not only what I filtered through social media, but what was unfiltered and said in..erm, text. It's a cool app though, sometimes getting lost in the shuffle due to its limitability. Widen the horizons and I bet more would love it instead of like it."
2933,Jamesy300000,"December 21, 2014",5,"Timehop's great! I love timehop, and seeing old facebook or instagram posts. Ive submitted a question about if the owners could add a feature. I wish to be able to push a button on my old facebook status that could bring me over to facebook to the exact day. This would mean i could read the comments of old facebook posts, or see who liked it. Thanks!"
2934,suggestionsiguess?.?/$/8-&1&,"December 22, 2014",4,"Suggestions I absolutely love this app, but I do have a few suggestions. First of all, I think that you should be able to get the link to the tweet you posted in the past, so you can see how many favorites/retweets it got, and you can have the actual tweet rather than just a Timehop screenshot of it. Also, what happened to the little icon that showed what the temperature was at a certain day in the past??? I liked that!"
2935,BrigitteTruman,"January 23, 2015",4,"TimeHop is rad. I love TimeHop. I check it every day, as soon as I reach for my phone first thing in the morning. And, let's face it, I have to check it because if I don't want to miss anything. I would be sad when that TimeHop is be gone forever without knowing what it was."
2936,Cebulko,"January 25, 2015",5,"Good except with Facebook pictures Loved the app before the updates and now it's a waste of space on my phone. This used to be an awesome app, except it's crap now when it comes time to seeing your past Facebook pictures. The ""time travel"" fails and displays a random message of Facebook and politics. If it could be fixed, it would be a great app again"
2937,Ijwga1,"March 16, 2015",5,"Awesome app! This app is so much fun! I love seeing what I've posted on days past. I know you can hook it up to the computer but never have, but the amount of apps it can draw from is pretty voluminous. Just wish you could see past days again. It will only show the present day's posts and pictures. And being able to repost them through the app is fun!"
2938,Infinifox,"May 12, 2015",4,"4.9stars In a way this app is akin to journaling, if you are the type of person who posts thoughtful things to social media, or takes a lot of meaningful photos. It's such a joyous, hilarious, sad, embarrassing, educational little moment of the day when I check in with TimeHop. I only give four stars because I'd love comment threads on posts to be available for viewing, for context, and laughs. TL;DR Download this app, it's fun, and hella worth the tiny amount of memory it uses."
2939,Malyssa 3,"June 28, 2015",4,"Pretty good! I absolutely love this app!!! It's so amazing! I love seeing pics I posted year ago, because some times I don't remember the pics right away! But my favorite part is I always show my children their pics from when they were younger. It's a very special thing for us, but I've had just one issue with it. It occasionally shuts down on me saying that ""time hop isn't working"". And that's a bummer. But anyways I love love love this app!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2940,Lisa Koch,"December 18, 2013",3,"Time Travel Failed. This app is awesome... When it works. Instead of a feed of all my past social media posts, I typically get the message ""Time Travel Failed."" Sometimes I can refresh for a quick fix. Sometimes I have to wait a few hours and try again. It also crashes quite frequently and the new sharing options are hardly ever successful. However, I do think the concept is fun, and when it DOES decide to work, the app provides a nice trip down memory lane."
2941,chrdboi,"March 31, 2014",5,"Nostalgic I frequently find myself going on Facebook and just reminiscing on the past years of my life. High school was long, but it went by so fast. I'm so glad there's an app that specializes in showing you your social networking past. And not only Facebook, but Twitter too. AND it updates DAILY which rocks. I love it, and I don't even see a reason to change it at all! 5 stars"
2942,poetgirl123,"April 17, 2014",4,"The app is great; could be better I really love this app and the whole idea behind it. It's really well set up and easy to navigate. It's so entertaining too! One suggestion I have is for the app to have the ability to have a calendar type feature. A user can review a week ago's time hop.. We can go through dates and not be limited to today's date. Just a simple idea that could improve the app. Other than that, it's awesome!"
2943,AK-Stranger,"January 7, 2017",2,"Don't like new design With the latest update I'm glad you brought comments, likes, and links back but I still really dislike this design. I liked the previous setup where users scrolled through vertically and could see all their Timehop instead of having to tap from one to the next. I'm constantly having to go back and I hit the wrong thing a lot. I will say the full size pictures in frames when we share them now is pretty awesome so keep that for sure. But I liked the old design much better :("
2944,princessbrande1,"January 15, 2017",1,Why haven't you fixed it yet? I didn't give you a negative review when you first messed up your great app figuring you had enough one star reviews. I assumed you got the message that nobody liked your new attempt to be something your not. I really thought you'd fix it. Change it back. Instead you changed a few minor things instead of what made this app great. Why are you okay with so many people dropping your app? Why would you listen to what people want? 
2945,Teammonaghan,"January 17, 2017",4,"PLEAS STOP THE ZOOM IN FEATURE! The new update makes it zoom every picture and its horrible!!!!  Please go back, please!  I absolutely hate not being able to see the entire picture!!!  Of course I can squeeze it to look but if I let go it just pops back and my finger is in the way the whole time. Also I recently noticed that you can no longer share videos, why?!  I am not a fan of the new updates!"
2946,Boorek,"January 17, 2017",1,"Current version I am very disappointed that I updated this app to the current version. I can no longer send text messages to friends or family relating to my timehop. All of the pictures show up as extremely zoomed in and it won't stay zoomed out when I let go of the picture. Then if it's a group of pictures it shows up in the app as if they are on a wall in picture frames. When they are in that view I can't look at them in normal view. This is just a few of my complaints on the new versions. Again, I am disappointed in this version."
2947,ahejl,"January 31, 2017",1,Waste of storage space This app has been on my phone for over two years. I have enjoyed seeing the flashbacks of my kids & after my mom passed away last year it has proven invaluable in showing memories of her that I can share with my young kids. Then why the one star? Over the past month I've been able to see my pictures one time. Once. This app has worked once in 31 days. I've tried to use it for 31 days and it never loads except 1 time. 1/31 is not a great success rate. The app developers need to go back to what they had and let go of all the fancy updates.
2948,SanFierran,"February 7, 2017",1,"New used interface is THE WORST Absolute garbage since they've instituted their new UI. NEVER loads any of the pics. No access to settings. This app literally just opens and gets stuck loading pics. I have. It been able to see a single pic for over a week and there is literally no setting or way to contact them. Who ever designed this new timehop that's been around the last month or so should be fired. Terrible, horrible and completely useless. Sad, I used to be a daily user. About to delete my account. Wait, I can't because there is no settings function! Total failüëéüèº"

2950,Kmde1,"January 30, 2016",4,"Awesome...except for one little thing. My favorite thing is sharing Abe's ""This Day in History"" fun factoid on  Facebook, I have been doing it almost everyday since I started using this app 2 years ago. I just now noticed that only the picture posts, and not the fun fact. Why? That makes no sense to me. The point of sharing is to share the cool fact; the picture means nothing without the words. Who decided that?!"
2951,JennJenn23,"January 31, 2016",1,"Really disappointing I've had this app for awhile, however, with the new ""update"" this past week, it's useless. This morning I went to look at it and it just froze, no pictures came up. I couldn't even go to settings within the app. I deleted the app and added it again. Still nothing. I checked that I had the latest os (which I did) and then powered down the phone. I tried the app again, still nothing. I again deleted the app and re-added. Nothing. I really enjoyed this app and I'm super upset it no longer works. Hopefully there is another fix in the works...soon."
2952,Laloschjetnan,"December 23, 2016",1,"So now I only see a portion of my pictures I used to love Timehop and really enjoyed scrolling through my daily timehop. I know we're all into the copying Snapchat interface but it just doesn't work when most of your pictures are horizontal and you have to zoom out to actually seeing them, apart from the fact that each one takes ages to load when you have iCloud Photo Library. To me it's killed the essence and uniqueness of Timehop and it's not something I'll want to check everyday anymore as the experience is inferior. Hope you can find a better solution soon."
2953,joy of suburbia.,"December 24, 2016",5,"New update is 0/10 would not recommend I love Timehop, but this update is making it harder for me to see the context of the pictures that I retweeted.

I would delete it, but I just really want to keep my streak going. Just change it back, please."

What is the point of seeing a picture but not seeing the caption, or the tweet that went along with it? I also used to love seeing old face book posts and the comments along with the post, but now I can no longer see that either. Also, there is no knowing if a picture is from my camera roll, Facebook, or Instagram. This update needs to be fixed pronto or there is no point left in this app."
2956,Old timehop user,"December 28, 2016",1,"You guys really messed up. I feel like you guys were all sitting together thinking about new things you guys could do when all of a sudden you just said screw it, with everything going wrong in 2016 why don't we just mess everything up a little more! I have a feeling this might all be a New Years kinda joke where as soon as the clock hits 12 you put out an update for the old actual timehop. And if I'm wrong you guys still have time to make me right. And if you don't, well all the other reviews speak for themselves so I think it's pretty obvious what'll happen. Well, Good Luck!"
2957,Katsilver,"December 29, 2016",1,Hate this new Version!!! Please go back to the way it was. This new version is terrible. You can't see comments left on pictures and statuses. You have to zoom out of EVERY photo because they're all zoomed in... why???? And if you posted a photo you can't even see your own caption for it. 7 years ago yesterday I posted something cryptic. I had to go on Facebook and find it to read the comments to find out what the heck I was talking about. What is the point of this app if I need to go elsewhere? Please go back to how it was. It wasn't broken but this update sure made it that way!
2958,MsEmAmI,"January 4, 2017",1,"Terrible. Worst ""update"" ever. Zero stars. Horrible new format. Not even remotely aesthetically pleasing. Zoomed photos that you have to pinch to see in their entirety are visually unappealing, and also makes things less convenient to share quickly. Bring back the ability to share photos at their original size WITH caption. Also, bring back clickable links! What's the point of sharing the memory of a link, if the shown link doesn't work?! üòê"
2959,Picstamatic,"January 5, 2017",1,"Why why why I used to love timehop, I loved looking back at old pictures and videos and tweets, etc. but now, it's not worth checking. The recent update has ruined the app. The pictures have no context and no way to see what the context is or what you said on it. They're zoomed in, and you have to press it to see the full picture, which makes no sense. You used to see the conversation on tweets or Facebook, which is also gone. I used to check it religiously but now I don't check it anymore. PLEASE make it useable again. There was nothing wrong with the old one, bring it back!"
2960,StephT101,"September 26, 2014",4,"Timehop more like Time to Smile This app is really 1st rate work. Spot on. Timehop does a great job of capturing the essence of your past self. I feel like lots of the things they send me even do sound like they could have been me years ago!! I'm not sure how they are so creative to come up with everything but, again, the graphics and soundtrack are amazing and the color scheme will blow you away. If you don't get timehop you don't want to smile today."
2961,Xopinkburstox,"February 4, 2015",4,"Great but no tweets I've had this app for awhile and I love it. But I have never once seen my old tweets. I've only had Twitter for about 2 years and I don't always frequently post. But on the days I have, there is nothing in my time travel. It's very frustrating seeing others look at theirs and wonder why mine isn't working. It's connected yet nothing. Otherwise the app is fantastic and I love looking back over the years."

It's a great way to see where I've been and a reminder of how far I've come.

I used to look forward to seeing what was on my Timehop every day, but now I hate it. With this new update I can barely see my pictures (because Timehop zooms in on them for whatever reason), and I can't even see what I wrote when I posted a photo. I can't see the comments on my posts, or who liked it, which was a feature I really enjoyed. It's as if I'm looking at a Snapchat story, and it just doesn't work for Timehop. Leave the ""tapping through"" for Snapchat or Instagram... bring back the old Timehop."
2965,ttttttt3325684,"January 7, 2017",1,"Awful update This type of update is mind blowing--the fact that an entire team of developers spent substantial time and effort to improve an (already great!) app with the aim of elevating user experience. And this is what they came up with. Astonishing. The update is HORRIBLE-- the idea of tapping and holding just to see a full size image? Completely counterintuitive. Not to mention that when you are actually able to see said full size image, you are unable to easily share without first zooming back (in???) and then swiping up. I love seeing past posts but this has ruined it for me."

I really miss just being able to scroll through and pick what I wanted to look at. It is not consistent at all! Sometimes it's way zoomed into the pics or videos and I can't zoom out. Sometimes I can't see captions or comments on pics and video. Sometimes it won't even open at all, it just freezes with the first picture of the dinosaur and today's date. I really hate it now. Anybody have any other apps that are similar but that perform better??!!"
2967,Lollipops03,"February 17, 2017",5,"Memories! This app is amazing! I go to it everyday and get to see photos from 1 year ago, all the way to 3 years ago! It can back as many years as you've had your Facebook, Instagram, twitter, etc. account! If you've had a gmail account for 8 years, it can show every picture you've taken using that email! Try it out!"
2968,KilroyWasntHere,"June 6, 2017",2,"Every update this app receives makes it worse In recent updates, we've lost the ability to see Swarm checkins, Facebook comment replies, and now individual images (on the main screen). "
2969,Soulx3,"July 3, 2017",5,"They took my streak I was at 256 days, and I had shared something on day 256 so I know I was on that day.  The next day I am at Day one.  I have contacted them several times only to get some auto ""we got your message"", ""can't read them all"".  They put out an explanation of the new version says ""we know you love your streaks"", ""contact us and we will fix it"".  Yeah right!"
2970,Cubgrant23,"December 22, 2016",2,Need to fix days in a row I love being able to go back and reminisce on all my posts and memories.  I also loved checking in and seeing how many days in a row I've achieved and everything was great until I hit 200 days in a row. Now every day it just says I have 2.. days in a row. Fix my days in a row and it gets 5 stars again plus now I can't even read 75% of my posts because they only display the 1st line and don't even show the pictures. Used to love checking every day. Annoying now. 
2971,jwgourleygirl,"December 24, 2016",5,"This update is awful. I hate that what photos I want to see are censored and that the statuses and other updates are harder to see in order, chronologically. Also, having to hold to zoom out and see the whole picture is stupid. Change it back, timehop. Change. It. Back. I'm just trying to see my babies' pictures."
2972,Lm951,"December 24, 2016",3,"Love Timehop, hate the new update I love Timehop, I have had it for a couple of years now. But I hate the new update. You can't see all your photos, when they put them in a collage, or a mini slide show(and half the time the photos are so zoomed in, you can't tell what they are) . You no longer see what you posted with them, and if the videos take longer than half a second to load, you can't view them at all. This was a step backwards, not forward."
2973,Pae94,"December 25, 2016",1,"Update ruined timehop I've been checking Timehop for 220 days. I wanted to get to 365 but after this update looks like I'm not! Timehop took out the most important part about the old memories, the comments on everything! This story mode swiping to see each day is also pretty ridiculous. I liked to scroll to pass up some of the pictures and captions I didn't wanna look at but now it's more time consuming to swipe than to scroll. The pictures are now automatically zoomed in. Why look at half a picture? Overall super crappy update. Extremely disappointed"
2974,Wtethdjeidhbdhdndg,"December 26, 2016",1,"Worst update ever I know for a fact that I've never written a review of an app in my life, but after this latest update, I decided it was time. By far the worst app update I've ever encountered. I'm frustrated with the fact that developers thought everyone wants to see their memories displayed in Snapchat form and even more frustrated at the lack of detail the new update provides. I'm unable to see anything I tweeted with a picture and I can't see 90 percent of the things I used to love about this app. Probably won't be using the app too much longer, y'all most definitely ruined it for good."
2975,RapunzelGrace,"December 27, 2016",1,"The new Update is Awful This latest update has ruined Timehop for me. I used to look through everyday, and now I avoid opening it because of the update. Tap and hold to zoom out? Come on. And all the pictures from years past are shown without the text they were posted with so I have no idea what anything was for. This app needs to go back to the scroll up style it had previously. This tap through is trying too hard to fit in with the likes of Instagram Stories and Snapchat. Don't fix what isn't broken and don't change what works. Seriously."
2976,Dallasxoxoxo,"December 29, 2016",1,"""NO"" to the New Update I'm sorry I absolutely love Timehop, but this new update is just about the worst thing I've ever seen. There was absolutely no need for it and to be honest I've debated deleting the app several times since the release of this update. It makes everything difficult to see having to tap to zoom out, i see pictures but can't see where they were posted or any context into the posts. And overall I just think this update was poorly conceived and unnecessary. I honestly don't even enjoy looking at timehop anymore because it's very confusing to look at now."
2977,Fetalina,"December 29, 2016",1,"Almost useless now I don't know that I've ever reviewed an app before because I always figure the updates will feel normal after a while when we all get used to them. But this update is awful. The swipe up to share feature only seems to work on some of the posts, so that's not useful. Also, it randomly chooses which photos to show now instead of allowing you to access the full set that you uploaded by clicking through, what's the point of looking back if some algorithm is going to pick and choose which memories I get to see?? Bad move Timehop."
2978,Mad times one hundred,"December 30, 2016",5,"New update Your new update is a terrible design and not user friendly. Having to tap and hold the picture to zoom out is so annoying. It was just fine the way you had it, why do you have to change it and make it difficult? Rethink your changes or else people will stop using your app including me."
2979,pabuffer33,"January 5, 2017",1,"Today was the final straw The recent update renders Timehop unusable! I've been frustrated since the update but today up popped 3 adorable pictures of my son when he was 3 years old and experiencing his first big snow. Would have loved to share those on Facebook but for some reason the share button was not on that memory so couldn't. However, had I wanted to share Timehop's memory of the debut of Mayim Bialik as Blossom the share button was visible and feature was fully functional. üòñ Are you kidding me? This update is a total joke! Photos even look blurry in this new format! Useless!"
2980,Leeveemee,"July 14, 2015",5,Love this!! This is the best thing since sliced bread!!
2981,chrissy_fit,"August 4, 2015",5,"Neat app. This is a neat idea and it really has improved my life. Sometimes, I wake up and start musing on my current social status and wonder what memories I have made. I open timehop and am instantly reminded of another time and place when I successfully achieved happy memories, experimented with new foods and trips, or just liked the way I looked and snapped a selfie. What a good reminder that memories matter."
2982,Sarbear1818,"October 12, 2015",3,"Can't share I used to have the option to share all of the pictures that came up each day, but recently it doesn't allow me to do that. Only a select few of pictures have the options of ""then and now"" and ""share"". Otherwise we can comment on time hop? I don't want to comment on time hop. I would like the option of sharing the pictures again, please. Otherwise it's a great app and it's fun to look back on what I did in the past"
2983,Maryiah's mom,"November 18, 2015",5,"Brings Back Memories.... Pros: I like this app most days. It help bring make memories of post you've made and post others made on your Facebook wall. Sometimes it's cool to see your views on life 1yr ago, 5yrs ago, even 7yrs ago. It's cool to see pics of yourself or children from the past that you can compare to current photos. "
2984,Taylor Lambrinos,"December 10, 2015",3,".. I loved Timehop when I first got the app but lately it's been not so great and every morning I consider just deleting it and being done, due to the fact that for the past month and a half now it says no recent activity for up to 3 years back which I know is not true. I've emailed support and they've done nothing, so what's the point of having the app if I can't see anything? It's such a great concept, I love it, but there are definitely some bugs needed to be squashed."
2985,Meredithdet,"December 13, 2015",4,"Cool, but one more thing... I've used timehop for about a year and a half now, and as a reminiscent person, I've always enjoyed it. However, I would enjoy if we could link multiple accounts to the same timehop. I've had a few different twitters and Instagram accounts throughout the years and would love to connect all of them! Even dormant accounts still have the potential to produce memories!"
2986,iamom628,"May 4, 2016",1,"Recent update I would agree with the others who have mentioned the disruptive nature of the retrovideo included at the bottom of the app. While I don't mind the idea of the video entirely, I would like the ability to control whether or not I view the video. There is no option to turn off the video in the settings, and the video overrides ALL other sound settings. I made the mistake of opening Timehop in the early morning quiet in my house (right after the update) and the video started blaring from my phone - when all other sound settings were on silent mode! Not cool Timehop. Not cool."
2987,Imnotarapeslothnopenope,"July 24, 2016",5,"Love it! Of course, as many have reported, the app has been crashing just within the last day or so. Just because it's acting up right now does not make it a bad app! I like it, and it is very useful in reminding me of the good/fun times I've shared on social media! üòä Looking forward to the fix, I'm sure you're all working on it right now. I appreciate this great app!"
2988,jbug24,"August 6, 2016",3,"Cool but want a few things back So there was some update where you could comment on the pictures on Facebook, like tag people in them or whatever. But for some reason, the revoked that and went back to just being able to post a picture of it. "
2989,Fanofdory,"September 16, 2016",4,"Great app Does what it says - pulls pics from the past to remind you of past moment.  Like it bc we all have hundreds of photos &  don't ever scroll through them (old days we had albums to go through) so this is easy way to review. Has connectivity to access & post to Twitter, Google, & FB. Would like feature to delete/edit a pic from within the app instead of trying to find it in iPhoto."
2990,ameliabee,"September 10, 2013",3,"works great The app works great for me. Two suggestions for future updates: allow direct save to camera roll and export to Instagram. For the first, I've been emailing myself, which is annoying. And for the second, if you check out the #timehop hash tag, you'll see lots of folks are taking a screen shot and posting. Both of these methods work okay, but I think it could be more integrated. ETA: half of my timehop photos fail to load these days which it never used to do."
2991,Supermama719,"August 12, 2014",5,"TimeHop is like a window back in time I use this app every single day. As the mother of a two-year-old baby I love using TimeHop to look back through pictures and my Facebook posts and see how much she's grown. It's also fun to see the pre-baby days and what I did before mommy-hood. This app is well constructed, user-friendly and I definitely recommend downloading it, it's a lot of fun!"
2992,Freckles260,"February 15, 2015",5,"Easy and fun! Once set up, this fun little app just takes a couple minutes out of each day and it always makes me smile. I love to see what I was doing seven, five, four years ago or even last year. It brings back great memories and it gives me something to talk about old friends with that I haven't texted in a while. Great idea! Keep up the good work"
2993,Liebemond,"March 22, 2015",5,"Wonderful digital time capsule I discovered this app through friends on FB, and have been delighted from the first day I downloaded it. I really enjoy having the ability to easily look back and share my activities and moods from the past 5 yrs. It's often funny and sometimes just a great reminder of how much has changed. Highly recommend."
2994,Kipspleen,"March 25, 2015",4,"So fun! A few requests though... Love this app! Great to see what I've posted in the past without having to go back on FB. I have had issue with pictures getting cropped when trying to share, can that be fixed? Also I would love to be able to go back a day or two. There are days that are too busy to eat let alone look at an app, I'd love the option to see what I missed. Otherwise, it's fabulous!!"
2995,Empixie,"June 24, 2015",4,"Fun App I really like this app.  It's great to see where you were a few years prior.  I don't necessarily have the time to check the app daily though so I wish it would allow you to see your timeline review for a few days before it's gone.  Also, since the new update the weather data has disappeared.  I really liked seeing the difference in temps over the years.  Please bring that part back."
2996,Sbhojigglez,"January 4, 2017",4,"It's not THAT bad... I guess I'm the only one who doesn't mind the new update! The older version always froze up on me while this one doesn't. I do however really miss the retro videos. Those were always so fun to watch. Frankly I enjoyed watching them more than I enjoyed looking at my own memories. They were very nostalgic and produced a lot of ""oh my god this song/show is ten years old now!"" Etc. bring it back!!!! :)"
2997,Newmale,"January 17, 2017",5,"Disappointed user Since the update, this has become a horrible app to maneuver through, and to actually get it to do what you want it to do. The other version I loved, this version is terrible and so, sadly I will be looking for another app to do the same thing. Go back to the way it was timehop. It was easy and fun, now it just plain bad."
2998,nighteowl,"January 20, 2017",1,"I can't believe it keeps getting worse. HOW IN THE HELL is EVEN WORSE!! What the heck did you do - AND WHY?? The side scroll is horrible, the zooming is hideous, and the share is clunky. "
2999,AveryBadseed,"January 31, 2017",1,One disappointment after another This once fun app keeps changing for the worse. All of the features I appreciated are gone and I am one step away from deleting it.
3000,abrethauer,"October 18, 2016",4,"Quit reminding me to check I check Timehop every morning.  Almost one of the first apps I check before getting out of bed. Even though I check it every morning, I still receive an alert 30 minutes or so later telling me to ""check out my day."" It is really annoying to have to check it again. Please fix and make it so that it registers that I've already checked it."
3001,With2ms,"October 30, 2016",5,"No problems! In the past there's been lots of bugs and issues but they've worked hard to fix those.  Now I have no problems with it other than it HAS to link with Facebook.  I literally only keep FB around so that I can use TimeHop.  If it could work even with my FB account deactivated, that would be fantastic!"
3002,Chaz67865,"December 18, 2016",5,Good clean fun unless you're a dirty person Timehop is a hoot√©na√±≈Ñy of a good time. Like the title says it's free of all the dirty things the bright and dark web lambaste our minds with constantly. Unless of course if you don't shower often like my old roommate Fredrick. Boy oh boy was he dirty.   Love to hop reminiscing about yesteryear when things were less orange n obnoxious. Gonna miss the good old days.  Stupid Donald. Heck I'll even miss smelly Fredrick.
3003,Maigen P,"December 18, 2016",2,"Recent update Usually, I love this app and check it everyday (199 day streak right now, whoo!), but I recently noticed that the formatting has been glitchy. It'll show the first line of a post, but when I try to scroll down or touch the post to reveal the rest, nothing happens. So, as a result, I don't get to see any of my posts in full; just the first line of it. So weird! Anyone else experiencing this issue? I know this isn't right, so I hope Timehop addresses this glitch quickly. Other than that, great app for creatures of nostalgia like myself."
3004,Rvarnbsn,"December 24, 2016",1,New update is awful I hate this new update. Trying to become like Snapchat was not a good idea. All my pictures are now zoomed in and pixilated. I can no longer see what platform I originally posted onto and I cannot see the comments I originally posted with the pictures which was my favorite part! Please change back or have an option for you to decide which layout the user wants to have. Used to love scrolling through this app everyday but today I was just annoyed and did not enjoy. Might delete app if it does not change back. Very disappointed.
3005,BHagy,"December 26, 2016",1,"New Format Worst Update EVER I know updates and changes need to happen. However, updates should not completely ruin the app!  I have enjoyed TimeHop for a long time and now, I HATE opening it!  Everything about the new format is terrible. Scrolling down the page to see the history was SO much better than this tapping idea. The person who came up with that should be FIRED!! The photos are blown up to where you can't see them on the screen. It is so not user friendly now. Switch it back!!  You have completely ruined such a great app with the new updated format!  :("
3006,addisonjames,"December 27, 2016",1,"New UI is a terrible experience The new horizontal scrolling UI is a terrible user experience. Especially when every photo is zoomed and you have to press to zoom out. Loosing the ability to quickly scroll vertically is a huge set back for the user and also feels a lot slower. I won't be using TimeHop anymore until/unless this is fixed. Remember TimeHop, users don't care about the TimeHop brand and experience as much as they do just quickly seeing into the past. I suggest you drop things such as forced branding and inability to save photos with a TimeHop stamp. üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº"
3007,repoman3000,"December 31, 2016",1,Please revert the update As you can see by many of the Timehop users this update is horrible. I understand the want to go to the Snapchat usability but the rest is horrible. I have to zoom into almost every photo. I can't share videos anymore. The collage of photos is annoying and I'm unable to stop or pause it. Next time please offer a beta before releasing a drastic change to the UI. 
3008,Neb322,"January 3, 2017",1,"In the same boat as other reviewers I liked Timehop for seeing my extensive social media history and especially reading old comments on my pictures/posts. Not only do I have no knowledge of how to do that with the new update, but the interface is extremely frustrating - requiring me to zoom out to see whole pictures, any taps on the screen zooming past the memories I cherished scrolling through previously. I really wish the app would revert back to how it was with any minor tweaks you all see fit, but until then I won't be using Timehop any longer."
3009,painfulpineapple,"January 3, 2017",5,"Can't see twitter pictures ?? After this latest update, the pictures for twitter don't show anymore. It just shows a link. I got this app so I could see the pictures I posted and look back on my last year. I even started a special assignment because of it, but now I can't even look at the pictures. I'm really upset and angry."
3010,SKdawgs,"May 24, 2015",5,"Worth the download for a trip down memory lane I was introduced to Timehop from a friend's shares on Facebook and found it's a great app for looking back and reminiscing about thoughts and activities from years ago. Some mundane like check-ins on Foursquare to tweet remembering milestone events. I enjoy seeing old photos and no, it's not 100% perfect, but it's pretty darn close. Definitely worth downloading. üòÄ"
3011,APG528,"June 23, 2015",5,Time Travel! First off let me just say that I absolutely LOVE this app. The majority of the updates have been great! My one critique would be that it would be great to be able to keep the original size of the photo when sharing. That is the only drawback for me. I don't like the crops. Other than that this is honestly my favorite app to check EVERY morning!!
3012,PinkElephant9,"July 7, 2015",3,Doesn't Work Anymore I used to use this app everyday and loved it but one day nothing would load and it would just show the initial loading page and it would never show anything else. I deleted the app then got it again and it wouldn't let me connect any of my social media because it said I had already connected it so now I'm unable to use the app. I'd like this flaw to be fixed because I used to love the app but now I can't use to app at all.
3013,Juliana Miller,"August 6, 2015",5,"I love the app, but it will never load my Instagram posts. It's a great app, although whenever I have Instagram posts from 1, 2, or 3 years ago, it will say ""photo did not reach 88 mph"" and ask me to retry. When I retry, it still says the same thing. It makes me mad because I actually want to see what my Instagram posts are from years ago, so I can share them. üò°"
3014,Singinindashowa,"August 19, 2015",5,Best memory app! I check this app daily. It brings me so many amazing memories from up to 8 years ago when I first created a Facebook. If only it connected to MySpace and Xanga! So many memories from those social media sites from back in the day. 
3015,i-podlover3,"August 28, 2015",5,Blast from the past!! This app is great!! I look forward to checking it when I wake up in the morning and seeing all the crazy stuff I've posted over the last few years. It's a great app to see your old stuff without having to dig for it for hours on your social media accounts! Definitely worth the download!!
3016,tdlittlestar,"September 20, 2015",5,"Lots of missing pictures Lately the app has been failing. I try back a few hours later without success. Even when it works, it doesn't show nearly as much as Facebook's On this Day feature (even pictures not including wall posts). I'm becoming increasingly more disappointed with this app each day."
3017,aegrinz,"September 25, 2015",4,"So fun! I only wish there was a way to go back and look at pictures from the last day or two, just in case you missed a day. Also, it'd be nice to have a way to save multiple pics at once. But other than that, it's probably my favorite app! Love looking back in time and sharing with friends now! Also, I've sent this review 3 times now, so I wish it would post and stop asking me to review!!"
3018,SleepSportsXbox,"December 29, 2015",3,"Ok I've always liked this app but when you began to have to upload your Twitter archive to view your tweets I began to dislike it. I have tried multiple times to upload the archive, and it says that I have and that it was successful, yet I still don't see my tweets, I haven't since I tried to upload the archive. Twitter has always been my favorite to view, I would really enjoy to see my Twitter again, I'm just not sure how to fix it. Other than that, the app is good."
3019,SolariSirius,"April 19, 2016",1,"Good and bad memories (but mostly bad) I have gone to great pains to remove certain people from my life, deleting all photos of them from social media and blocking them to ensure I don't stumble across them.  It works really well on the sites themselves, but boy does Timehop like pushing these people back in my face!  I love being reminded of my abusive boyfriend at every available chance; you think there'd be some easy fix to keep blocked people from showing up on your Timehop, but apparently not!  I'm deleting and avoiding this app like the plague until there's some sort of fix, but I'm not holding my breath."
3020,Loloismynickname,"June 30, 2014",5,"Login You should really have the option to log in with facebook/twitter/instagran because i dont have a facebook nor do i want to get one. I think It would be much easier for everybody and for people who dont have one. I really want to have this app and see what ive done in the past few years. Itd be great if you could add this ""feature"" in. Thank you!"
3021,My1banana,"August 6, 2014",4,More options I personally think the app is a great way to look back and reminisce in memories. My only problem with it is that I wish it would give me more than a couple options to choose from. I have the app hooked up to my Facebook and my photos and I only get 2 options to choose from a day? What if I don't like either of them? I wish it have me more choices is all. Overall a very great app.
3022,FlyshWife,"September 15, 2014",4,"Great app! I love this app! I see a lot of people complain that you can only see the current day, but I don't mind that! If I wanted to see weeks at a time I would just go thru my Facebook myself! The only thing that is less-than-stellar is the way things you previously shared (as opposed to photos you uploaded) come up really small if you try to share as a TimeHop. Once that flaw is fixed this will be a 5 star app!!"
3023,Jasmine2016,"October 20, 2014",4,"Great app! But.. Some days I am busy. I don't always have time to look at my memories everyday! I want to be able to view the days from yesterday or day before if I missed them because I was busy! Also, I think it's too difficult to hook my twitter up to this app. It's should be just as easy as Facebook and Instagram! Twitter is the one I wanted to view the most! Disappointing.. But it is a good app other than these things."
3024,Tvon5432,"January 27, 2015",5,"Without this.... Without this it would be near impossible for me to see posts from the past. Losing the love of my life in a tragic car accident on December 8th 2013 and getting to relive all the memories I've posted about over a 5 year span, would make this so much more difficult. As much as it hurt me, I am forever grateful for this app. And will forever be keeping it."
3025,DWRoque,"January 29, 2015",4,"Great idea, needs tweaks It's a lot of fun to look back at where I was years ago, but the yellow background with light grey for the system buttons, is just poor planning. Please update your color scheme, otherwise you're doing a fantastic job!"
3026,Trinton's Mommy,"February 2, 2015",2,Like it BUT I like the app but I do not like that if u have removed a post from ur Facebook timeline it does not remove it from this app! I remove posts from Facebook for a reason!!! (So I don't have to look at them again). However; if I happen to login to this app from a year ago or previous years & I have a post that I have removed from Facebook I still get reminded of it from here!!! Not cool at all. The Picts I have removed shows a ?question? Mark. Delete it all the way! Keep up with what I do. Don't make me remember what I am trying to forget.

3028,SimplySade86,"May 7, 2015",5,"Awesome! I love timehop because it brings so many memories and it allows me to see what I've learned over the years. It also allows me to reminisce about the good times I've had with my family and friends.

Still check every day to keep the streak, but twice now I've been hit with a ""you broke your streak, watch this video"" when I didn't break the streak. I really hate that I care about that now, but if you're going to have an app that builds a streak, it can't be bugged and break the streak. I can't see what day of the week the memory is from anymore. Also no longer can view who liked the post. Bad enough to inspire my first-ever review. Sad to see timehop go, but happy to know we're all in this together."
3030,NateS802,"December 29, 2016",1,"Haven't written a review before but... I've never  written a review before but this update forced me to. The layout is so illogical it honestly made me mad. I only check timehop everyday now to continue my streak until they update it again to the old way. I can't believe they made this update to where you can't see full posts, pictures are zoomed in, and it's harder to view and flip through everything. I'm only writing this review because I feel that if enough people do the developers will revert back. Please timehop. I (and many others) really enjoyed the other way."
3031,Mom of 3 in Houston,"January 5, 2017",5,Bring back the old version I want to add my voice to the MANY letting you know the new format is not working. 
3032,Leximurphy,"January 7, 2017",4,Hate the new version!!!! I don't like a single new thing on this latest update.  Please go back to the previous version.  Looking at just deleted it off my phone all together unless they get rid of these new changes.
3033,Cucc63,"January 10, 2017",3,"This update is trash Simply put, you broke the app with this new update as it is frustrating to the point of not being useable. Your best option would be to rollback to the previous version because everything is wrong with this one."
3034,Daniella hemsley,"January 10, 2017",1,Used to be a 5 The new app update is awful. You have to swip through each picture instead of scrolling through and clicking the ones you want to see. You also do not see the whole picture in your screen. You have to zoom out to see the picture--what's the point of looking back at your memories if you can't see the whole picture? 
3035,ighk,"January 28, 2017",1,Hate the new interface! I used to like Timehop. Now they changed the interface where all my memories where enlarged! I can't even see myself or my other friends in some pictures. I tried to make it smaller with my fingers and it went right back to the enlarged version when I release my fingers. What's the point of this? 
3036,baptistness,"February 2, 2017",1,"Boo So you changed it, then noticed people didn't like it, and changed some things back... But now everything is almost back to the first change that no one liked at all? Is this how it's going to stay? üòï"
3037,CW8675,"February 3, 2017",1,"Stop the insanity Wow, it's gotta be bad if I'm taking the time to write a review. Promises of changes re: auto zoom - yeah, okay we can take auto zoom off but that setting will not save so you have to re-set it every time you open the app. "
3038,cdparker13,"February 8, 2017",1,"Terrible update, please fix it I rarely ever do reviews, but I am doing this in hopes that Timehop pays attention to the negative feedback and fixes it back. The swipe feature is truly terrible. I have to touch every bloody picture and post to get through each day now. I preferred being able to scroll quickly to the posts I most wanted to see. Now the app is constantly locking up and I am not using Timehop as much because it locks up before I can even ""swipe"" through all my posts each day. Please fix it. It was a great app and this update ruined it completely."
3039,Istopher,"March 21, 2017",1,"Awful update! I love Timehop, but this update is terrible!  I have no control over how I view things anymore. You now force me to swipe each picture to view it, and I can no longer look at an overview and decide which pictures I want to look at."
3040,Wobblykate,"May 31, 2015",4,"Stop the Square I love timehop. I do. I enjoy my daily stroll down memory lane...but please create an option where I can control whether something I post is square or rectangular. No fun re-posting pics to facebook with friends if they're cropped out! It also makes their cute ""then and now"" function useless for a large percentage of photos. Still giving four stars, but hope they make those changes!"
3041,Cool grll,"June 21, 2015",5,Just did 5 so you can see it So I went to download this app and it only had the option to log in through Facebook. I don't have Facebook nor do I want it. I wanted to have it through Instagram but I can't. I was very disappointed I hope you make the improvement to sign in through Instagram without using Facebook first.
3042,SamSoBuff,"July 17, 2015",5,Simple app with a lot of fun I love everything about this app. It is incredibly simple and it makes walking down memory lane a lot of fun. It is convenient not having to sort through all of the mess of social media as well. I highly recommend this app to everyone who has had anything to do with social media in the last five years.
3043,JWSkills,"August 10, 2015",4,"Glad for positive updates My Latest Review: Timehop is working well these days! You can position photos how you want before sharing. The ""frames"" are goofy and not to my liking, but you can choose to go ""frameless"" so it's not really an issue. "
3044,Trikki111,"September 10, 2015",3,Confused... Shouldn't there be a way to go back to yesterday's date and see your picture. What happens if u skip a day checking it and want to go back to yesterday or the day before.... Shouldn't it archive all the data by dates so u can go back a week ago and re-look over all your pics. Especially if you're out of town and have no service. Is there no way of going back a day or 3 or even. Week to see what was put up on a past date? Thanks
3045,Sugarshell04,"November 27, 2015",4,"Seems to work better Fun app! Had problems in the past with the app no longer loads Instagram pictures. Uninstalled app and reinstalled and the problem still existed. Very annoying. Since I've gotten a brand new phone and installed the app it seems to be working fine (sn: there was absolutely nothing wrong with my previous phone, all the other apps worked correctly)."
3046,FM_M,"December 19, 2015",1,"Yet Another App looking for my phone number I see a bunch of people on my Twitter feed using this app, so I thought I‚Äôd check it out. But it‚Äôs yet another app that wants my phone number - no, guys, you can‚Äôt have my phone number. You don‚Äôt really need it - it‚Äôs just so that you can collect and collate my data with other data streams and sell it."
3047,sydniejourdan,"May 1, 2016",4,"This UPDATE is Trash. What's with this update? Taking away the ability to save photos; isn't that the WHOLE point of Timehop? Also, what's the collage at the top? It's stupid and unnecessary. And what happened to showing me the posts I've been tagged in? I don't think y'all thought this update all the way through. "
3048,Kridley,"December 26, 2016",5,New update terrible This had quickly become my favorite app over the month and half I've had it. The new update is really frustrating and completely takes the enjoyment out of it. I like being able to scroll up and down and see everything now you can't do that.
3049,PGaines,"December 28, 2016",1,"Update is a no go I read your update you posted, and I still don't like the direction. This morning's particular frustration is that I CAN NOT share videos....?? Pics have the share option and videos don't. Really a shame because they were some good ones. I understand that's a bug and will get fixed, but it's super annoying. "
3050,Sonlightmom,"December 23, 2012",2,"Disappointing I love the idea of this app, but nearly every day when I check timehop is says that I had no activity, which I know is not true. One of the latest updates said you should never get a blank day as it would just go back to your last activity, but that doesn't  happen for me. I love scrolling through my FB statuses to see what I was up to in the past so when I heard about timehop I was very excited, but I am just about to give up on it as it s very disappointing to keep having nothing show up on the app."
3051,Skwanto,"April 21, 2013",5,"Fun nostalgia It's quite fun to see what you've posted in years past. There's no date selection which would be fun. Then again, only seeing the current day makes it so you check it everyday. Timehop doesn't seem to go back as far as I have been on Facebook but it does reach back many years. I highly recommend this app."
3052,Jillicious13,"November 26, 2014",4,"Fun app! My son just turned a year old and I'm loving seeing all of his newborn pictures from a year ago today. This is a fun and creative app! I'm excited each day to look at what I was doing previous years on this day :) They have the feature ""then and now"" but it only lets you take a selfie. I wish you had the option to turn it around so I could take a picture of somebody else, like my son."
3053,Just2Bfun,"January 27, 2015",3,"Update = Not good Before the update I would have given this app 5 stars. I loved looking back on what I had done over the years and sharing that with friends. However, with this update it is a real pain to share, I should have to go into each place I want to share. Also, I don't like that the shares are going into random photo albums on facebook, it was much better when Timehop had its own album and every share went there automatically."
3054,The Elson's,"January 27, 2015",5,"Really cool app! I love seeing all the things I did in the past, and the embarrassing high/middle school pictures and posts on facebook are hilarious. I just wish I could see the activity of others on my TimeHop. Show me a tweet from a year ago and show the favorites and replies to it as well. Same with facebook posts. Otherwise it's an awesome app that I highly recommend!"
3055,JessieC71,"March 5, 2015",3,"(Update) downgrade due to buggy update (Update) I used to love the app, but as many users stated, this version makes it worthless to try to share anything. That being said...  My last review still stands when you fix the problem! ----This app has been awesome at reminding me of things from a couple years back that I may have forgotten. Brings back lots of laughs and some serious moments too‚Ä¶ But often the laughs are hysterical and outweigh the serious moments. Great app guys!"
3056,OMGitsKatieB,"March 17, 2015",3,"Fun app, but... I love this app. It's fun to look back and remember things you were up to years ago. Only thing that bothers me is that they've changed the ""Share"" feature and it appears that you can't share a photo except in that square form. So if you have a horizontal photo, you're gonna have to cut part of it off to share it. I just found a hilarious photo from 9 years ago and I would like to share on Facebook, but it'll cut people out no matter what I do. :("
3057,Hopeki13,"March 24, 2015",4,"I love this app! I check it every day. It is funny to see kid quotes from 5 years ago, and forgotten photos. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars: occasionally I can't get to it in the morning and then forget later. I wish you scroll back even just 1-3 days. "
3058,jgoldman77,"May 11, 2015",5,"Daily Smiles This is my new favorite app.  I connected TimeHop to my desktop photos, iPhone photos, and Facebook photos...  It goes back about 12 years.  Every day TimeHop pulls pictures from the current day over the years, and I relive images of my kids (now ages 9 and 6) and family and friends through the years.  This app makes me smile every day!"
3059,Jonny.k13,"May 22, 2015",4,"Great app. It really is a great app. It does help look at all the great times in our past years. For the fifth star what would be great if you could from the app delete past tweets or stuff for example. For anyone that tweeted something that now as a business professional you wouldn't want in your profile. Instead of going into the app and have to scroll three years. Still great work, really enjoy it."

3061,Miz Keyz,"January 2, 2017",4,"TimeHop update is horrible This is the first review I've ever written on the App Store. I used Timehop because it allows me to see everything from the past and have fun reading all the comments that my friend made on my pictures. Facebook does not give me the ""On This Day"" feature, so i rely on TimeHop. Well, NOT ANYMORE. I no longer enjoy checking my Timehop daily. And I probably will delete the app unless they fix this nonsense."
3062,Cooldude420,"January 2, 2017",5,"New Update is Terrible This update is horrible. I used to enjoy this app so much. I enjoyed seeing my posts from social media, and being able to read people's comments. That is no longer possible. What is the point of zooming in so much on the pictures automatically? Please go back to the previous version!"
3063,WhovianJ,"January 4, 2017",1,"New Format Is Awful I don't know why they decided to change the format in the last update, but it's awful. If it doesn't change, I'll delete the app. It makes it difficult to view as it often splits posts from their pics, and no longer shows comments. "
3064,lifeaficionada,"January 6, 2017",5,Love the latest update! üëèüèº Latest update is much appreciated - fixed so many annoying bugs from last time! Strange request - I have multiple instagram accounts and would love to see my history on my 2nd one as well. Any ways this is a possibility? üôèüèº Thank you for all your hard work on this amazing app! üëèüèº
3065,Mark_pena_wx,"January 9, 2017",5,"Thank you for listening! New update is back to everything I loved about the original. From what it looks like though, not everyone's app updated. For instance, mine updated automatically, but my boyfriend's didn't. So for those of you whose still looks the same, just wait for the actual update, it's back to normal!"
3066,PianoGirl4,"January 15, 2017",1,"What happened Timehop?? I have never written a review for an app before, but then again, I have never felt so strongly about changes to an app before. Why can't I look at all my posts on one page anymore? Why do I have to scroll through each individual picture or post? I used to love going on Timehop for my memories but now I find it tedious. I wish I had not updated - please bring back the old version or something similar to it, or at the very least, have an option in the settings so that if a user wants to see everything at once, they can."
3067,Lovey0907,"January 26, 2017",1,"Worst update ever Please change back to the old layout. This one is awful. It's so hard to see anything or follow along. It makes no sense!! Go back to being able to view it all on one page. You can't even see the whole pic unless you pull back. Even then you can't see it all if you let go. I've tried hanging in with the new update but I'm almost done with timehop. Facebooks ""on this day"" is way easier than timehop anymore. I never used to look at facebooks but I'm finding myself not even wanting to open timehop. Please change the layout back!!!!"
3068,Nookkkie,"February 25, 2017",2,"I think I'm done with the new version. Seriously? Change it back to the way it used to be please. Who tell you guys that this version is a good idea? I don't like it. My friends hate it. I don't want to swipe up to see the whole text or zoom out   to see the whole picture. It's used to be so easy and I enjoy using time hop but now It's not so fun to use anymore. I think you have a lot of people complaining about this problem. So please please before my friends and I stop using your app, change it now!"
3069,DesertPilot.com,"June 26, 2017",4,Love the app Great app and looking back in time. My only drawback is my iPhone live Photos and Google Photos. Timehop seems to load those Live Photos all as videos and it tries to load them all and I don't need to see a whole bunch of 2 and 3 second live videos when I can see the photos I wish there was a way to disable seeing videos under 5 seconds or something like that.
3070,Cltread,"June 18, 2015",4,"Great app!! Love it.  It's cool to be able to see all the changes that's happened over the years. I get blind sided every once in awhile when a picture of my son who died almost 4 years ago pops up, but it's a good thing,too. The only problem I have is the banner that tells you how many years ago the pic was posted. Sometimes no matter how I move the pic that banner is still covering someone's face. üò´"
3071,Amanda04,"June 18, 2015",1,New addition It won't open and I had to go through facebook to even find it in the App Store. What is happening?
3072,MaxBulwa,"June 18, 2015",5,Forward thinking about the past This was the first pioneer to do what most apps want to do today. I feel lucky that Timehop was there for me every day to remind me how lucky I am by showing me what I did and have through photos in my past. Many of my Facebook friends have adopted Timehop from being inspired from the special post I made using Timehop.
3073,mariarenecf,"July 14, 2015",5,"My favorite app! I look forward to checking Timehop EVERY day! This is the perfect app for someone like me who is a big ""dates"" person, who keeps up with all kinds of significant (and maybe some insignificant) dates. I also love seeing pictures from years ago since I don't have the time to reminisce through my many and various photo albums!"
3074,christiana_,"December 20, 2015",4,"Pretty Good App Useful for walks down memory lane, save for when the app glitches & kicks you off. Beyond that, there are no issues, but the app is really a one-hot wonder. These updates to make my memories social are uncalled for; the commenting of the notifications that others have seen our shared memories, etc. are a little creepy & I prefer just being able to screenshot & share them via text."
3075,Princesskp1836,"July 7, 2016",4,"Viewing comments With today's update you fixed it to where we could view Facebooks comments without leaving the app, but when you try to view Instagrams comments it takes you to Instagram. Also please fix it to where we can click on pictures to view full size. This only works if there are multiple pictures from 1 day."
3076,Pandao3,"December 23, 2016",5,"Timehop is the best! One of the first things I do every morning is look at Timehop and see what else I was up to that day in history. It's fun to see how things have changed over the years. It used to let you see what other people commented on that status/photo, but that feature seems to have been cut on the latest update."
3077,Jd8614,"December 24, 2016",1,"The update is the worst Xmas present I got This update is awful. Why? It was so much better letting us control what We saw from our past posts. Now it is copying the snapchat way of tap and zoom and whatever. Guys, you messed up on this one. I don't think I will be using it anymore since I'm more annoyed than excited to open it. I don't want to see me pictures in an album or have to zoom out on anything. Please put it back. If you notice, this is my first review on an app Bc it's just that necessary to say you we want it normal. Not everything has to be complicated. Thx"
3078,GC717,"December 24, 2016",3,"Big Fan I absolutely love Timehop, I'm a very nostalgic person who loves scrolling through what I've said in the past, but this new update gets only 3 stars cause I'm just not diggin it! I can't see captions on photos I retweeted, can't see conversations I had at the time & I just feel like the layout has been complicated unnecessarily. The app developers are allowed to experiment but hopefully they'll listen to their supporters & simplify again. Things were great how they were!"
3079,MegNF,"December 25, 2016",1,"Horrible Update Did anyone do any user testing or speak to any actual Timehop users before this update? What a huge disappointment! This was one of my favorite apps but now I can't see comments, can't see the whole picture without additional action, and can't quickly scroll through my old pictures - part of the enjoyment was quickly seeing how things were different (or the same) year to year which isn't possible when all memories show on different screens. Please change it back or give a settings option to do so!"

Also, when it shows me a group of uploaded photos I would like the option to pick the ones I want to share. But it's been pretty good. I really like the option that it can show, not only facebook, but, other social media pages"

Thank you, TimeHop developers, for creating a way for me to look back & smile, on a daily basis, @ pictures, sarcastic & funny posts, that remind me of how good life is when sometimes I forget.

Only thing I wish they would fix is that you can't click on that Facebook post or picture you posted 6 years ago and see what the comments were :( only the Instagram ones for some reason. Please fix that, I'd love to see what the comments were!"

3086,Ashleysuzanneee Official,"January 22, 2015",5,"First thing I look at in the morning! I love this app. I'm a very sentimental person, so it's so wonderful. It helps you really realize how far you've come, or it helps you relive moments with people you may have lost. The ONLY thing I would change, would be the ability to scroll back a couple days within the week that you're in."
3087,KrisCrazy,"March 3, 2015",4,"Like the app not thrilled with the update The app is fun! The reminders of when something happened generally make my day. However, I'm not thrilled with the recent update. It is not unusual that I want to ""share"" and FB is not s share option. I don't do Twitter and rarely do Instagram, and I have virtually zero interest in emailing a TimeHop. FB is the only place I want to share this and since the update FB shares have been a repeated issue."
3088,Amo314,"May 11, 2015",5,"Love it! It's so simple, yet so fun...like going through a scrapbook each day. I love looking & seeing what we were doing a year ago ... 5 years ago. My son checks it out everyday. Since I don't make time to scrapbook anymore this is the next best thing & I find that I am posting pictures & thoughts a little more now so I will be reminded in the future. It's a lot of fun!"
3089,Courteliz2,"June 14, 2015",3,"Timehop I love the idea of the app, but I wish some improvements were made. I hate that you can't see who posted the memory whether it was you or someone else. I also hate that you can't see what people liked the post or commented. If it is a status from FB you also can't see who you tagged in it. I recently discovered Facebook has a ""on this day"" and you can at least  see all the FB memories there with no restrictions, but wish it was all on timehop!"

The app automatically closed, says there was an error, or says ""time travel failed"". No matter how many times I close the app or delete and and re-download it, it never gets better. The new update doesn't allow you to have TimeHop friends anymore, so you don't see anyone's unless they post it to Facebook, which I only opened to use this app! Not as good as it used to be, and mine doesn't ever work anyways."

3094,Anxious Romulan,"January 11, 2017",1,"Well, it's been nice--so long, Timehop I really have loved this app over the years. This last couple of years though, it's been getting worse and worse. With every new update, something new didn't work. It finally got to the point where I'd just open it to remind myself of what had been going on, because the ""share"" was totally broken on 50-90% of stuff depending on the day. This new update has rendered the app totally unusable, and I'm done messing with it. Sorry Timehop, you lost me. :/ let me know when I can read and see and share my posts again."
3095,Tarapsncr,"January 19, 2017",1,Go back to the way it was before! This was one of my favorite apps until the last update. You didn't need to change anything...the app was great. Now I can't see my pics cause they zoom in so far and if I zoom out they won't stay. My other pictures in frames?? I can't see them and it won't let me click on them or share those. I don't have options to use cute frames anymore or compare?? You took away everything I loved. It's confusing and annoying. Please go back to the way it was before. 
3096,Bellasam329,"January 24, 2017",1,"Worst update EVER This update has ruined this app. I used to love looking at what happened on this day in the past but now it's no fun. If I want to share something that I didn't post to social media- and there were several pictures taken at the same time, timehop has now grouped them together making it a slide show, making it not possible to share one single photo from the group. I can no longer view the comments on anything that was posted to social media. May as well delete the app. It's useless now. Should have left well-enough alone! üò°üò°üò°"

If I could give it less than 1 star I would, especially compared to the original version. The streak function is either broken or a scam now. I check everyday (I go through every page) and it still says that my streak is broken and then I have to watch the dumb sponsored video. The UI is terrible! If this doesn't get fixed I'm going to have to delete the app and just rely on FB for my memories. Sad to see a once good app become trash."

It's only day 2 for me and it's made me redo all the access permissions again. I can tell you that if it happens again tomorrow, I'll be deleting immediately."
3099,Alexisajul,"July 17, 2017",1,what happened????????? this had been my favorite for a solid 3 or so years but the second your update changed the list format to having to click each post one by one I debated deleting it and never looking at it again. today my timehop feed was filled with bs from 'abe' about world emoji day and his 10+ posts made it tedious to find my other posts.

Sometimes there are 100s of photos taken on a single day. I don't want to have to look at EVERY SINGLE PICTURE INDIVIDUALLY to see what else is in my Time Hop from other events/date. It is not user friendly. Change is hard, but I don't think the functionality of the new update is something I'll get used to. Dear Time Hop, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The last version worked so well!!! Bring it back to us!!! üôèüèª"
3101,Kgturek,"December 28, 2016",1,Updated version I have used the Timehop app for a long time. This new updated version however is not something I want to continue using. It is not easy to use and you can't see any of the previous likes or comments. The pictures are zoomed in really far and you have to zoom every picture out before you can see it. I really enjoyed the old version where you could just scroll down the list and see everything quickly and orderly. I'm disappointed with the update and probably will not continue using the app.
3102,vollela,"December 29, 2016",1,Please go back This new update is awful. Most of the time I'm unable to see my past memories because they never load. It doesn't matter how long I let it sit there. It doesn't even show any sign that its working on pulling my images up. I'm not a fan of have to tap through every image just to get to the next year. Some time you don't care to see the whole grouping of photos and just wanna skip on through. Just seems silly that you would change something that worked perfectly fine to look like another app (Snapchat stories).
3103,KAITLIN LOVES AMY AND KAELA!!!,"December 31, 2016",1,"Wait... it gets worse?! Today seemingly debuted another new feature of the worlds worst update (Or the first time the feature has been relevant to me?) Last year was my best friend's wedding- lots of pictures were taken- and rather than letting me actually look at them, timehop spastically slideshows thru them??? I even made the adjustment to ""slide up"" every single picture to actually be able to see the entire thing (what a waste of time, thanks) and you can't even do that on spastic pictures that just keep moving. This update is really a disaster, I've got to say."
3104,Nicci5,"January 4, 2017",1,Change = bad this time I used to look forward to looking at Time Hop every day. I can't stand the new format. I used to love to see old Facebook posts and comments. Now you can see a  terrible zoomed in version with no comments/photo. I've seen so many where whatever I wrote makes no sense without context and there is no context without the photo and comments. Sometimes it does only photos but they are zoomed in and hard to appreciate. Please return to the old format or completely change this one. Normally I like updates but this one is bad bad bad. üëé
3105,jmacy05,"January 7, 2017",1,"New update is horrible! I use to love to check the app daily to see what has happened over the past years on certain dates. I would be able to see where I posted and any comments and likes, but the newest updates has taken that away from me. I get to swipe quickly through past posts, but can't see where they were posted or any comments and likes. Can't add filters or then and now features. This has made the app pretty useless to me, I'm better off just using On This Day function in Facebook. It very user friendly."
3106,Gamingalldayyy,"January 7, 2017",1,"Bring the old version back, or I'm deleting the app! Timehop used to be one of the highlights of checking my phone in the morning and now I only click it to get rid of the notification. All of the pictures are so zoomed in, it gives me no options to view old conversations, and links to fewer apps. The old version was amazing but this is a waste of space. Everyone agrees, bring back the old version."
3107,MiSkii,"January 7, 2017",5,Just awful This is possibly the worst update of any app I've seen. It's impossible to navigate. It won't let me share to other social media outlets and always kicks me out. It has no way to get to settings. I truly hope this is fixed. If not I hope you are prepared to be deleted by many. Two stars should be a hint
3108,Bebesworld,"January 8, 2017",2,"Bring the old version back!!! I'm not a fan of the new update. I wish I could just scroll through the feed like before. It's hard to show someone something I see without having to tap through. I used to be able to scroll quick to show an older post. I liked that. Now we have to tap tap tap tap just to get somewhere. It's annoying. It's annoying in Snapchat and it's annoying here. And where is the ""then and now"" button. I'd like to be able to do that again!!"
3109,Disappointed #500,"January 8, 2017",1,"Not happy I never do reviews but I'm not happy with the update. It's awful and I see no reason why you felt the need to change a really great, super simple app. I see I am not the only one who feels this way and took time out to actually post a review. You're losing a huge user base bc of this update. The zoom function is stupid and POINTLESS. It just makes watching videos that much harder. Honestly I've just been using apples ""this day last year"" most bc I can't watch the videos on here. Don't fix what isn't broken. Very unhappy and would give no stars if I could."
3110,MattxthexBailey,"December 12, 2016",5,Love it but... Really annoyed because it's been at least 2 months that I've had the issue of everything being cut off. With all these dumb updates they're always putting out I would've thought this would be resolved by now. They need to stop worrying about their clever little jokes and fix it!
3111,Jaclyn2279,"December 23, 2016",1,"Awful update Your new ""better"" version is TERRIBLE!  I can't even share any memories, when I ""click"" share it just takes me to the next memory and  doesn't allow me to share it!  The pictures are ALL so big!  Why?!  I shouldn't have to ""hold"" for it to be smaller!  It should just be the normal size!  Also you cannot see any of the comments on the memories any more either!  That was part of the fun!  Reading all the old comments of the memory!  As the saying goes if it's not broke don't fix it!  The update is TERRIBLE and I will no longer be using the app!"
3112,R2theachh,"December 23, 2016",1,We want the old version back! Terrible update! Don't fix what isn't broken. :(
3113,Extremely disappointed.,"December 24, 2016",2,"New update is awful I'm usually not one to complain when free services I use change the way they do things, however, this update takes ALL the fun out of Timehop for me. My photo captions are gone, which often include funny memories and quotes from my friends and family in them. I have to zoom out on practically every picture because I primarily use Instagram, which makes most of my photos square. Tapping through the super zoomed in photos seems like a chore rather than a trip down memory lane."
3114,TheJonnyMagic,"December 24, 2016",1,Disastrous update I always liked this app for a simple trip down memory lane.
3115,Zisuu2,"December 25, 2016",1,Update is horrible I loved this app until this update. I have my photos connected to it which means sometimes there is a roll of blurry pictures of my pet or a burst of photos of similar things. Not sure why Timehop thinks I want to individually click through every single one. Previously I could see the photo set and know I didn't need to click through all of it. I won't be opening this app until the next update which will hopefully get rid of this stupid feature or at least have the option to go back to the scroll view.
3116,MISSMYZUNE,"December 25, 2016",1,"Worst update First, HORRIBLE TIMING for this 1/2 baked update! It's the Holidays, a time I imagine you get even heavier use - people wanting to look back at their kids/family and it is NOT functioning properly! I can't share anything with context at all. Something that made it even harder for my young son & family is we lost my husband just over a year ago wanted to look back at our last family Holidays (2014) and even possibly share them. Typically tech companies (given that I came from the largest one) do lockdowns during the holidays - really poor decisions were made here!"
3117,Sydney McKinstry,"December 25, 2016",1,"Awful Update!!! The new layout of the app is awful!! I can't access the original posts anymore, which was one of my favorite features. Also, it takes way longer to see all my posts, and I can't even see the captions on pictures I've posted. I don't understand the point of this slideshow style. It's not efficient and it prevents users from actually seeing their original posts and captions. There was nothing wrong with the timeline the way it was, this new layout is cumbersome and annoying. Really wish I would not have updated."
3118,Alexandria01,"December 26, 2016",1,One more bad review I almost didn't even bother leaving this bad review since I went on and saw EVERY OTHER USER left a bad review for u as well! I thought... well one more is not going to make a difference for them. They are either going to change it back or leave it. But it's so awful I feel I had to add another bad review onto your piles of other bad reviews. I want the timeline back! It shows the changes through the years and was so much more memorable! The comments and posts about the pics are all gone and the zooming is awful! If it's not changed I'm done with Timehop
3119,Hshdkc,"December 26, 2016",1,"The update ruined it I used to love TimeHop! It was the first thing I looked at each morning. Now, after the update, it's horrible. Instead of being creative, they tried to make it like snapchat. The problem is it's not snapchat and has a totally different function. I no longer can see the likes and comments, the photos don't fit in the screen, captions posted aren't included with the pictures. It's horrible!! I loved the old Timehop, I don't even want to open this one. My suggestion to you is skip the timehop and just start using facebooks ""this day in..""."
3120,Jess92201,"June 29, 2015",4,"Won't work after newest update I LOVE TimeHop! It is one of my most favorite apps! I've been using it for some time now, and have never had any problems with it. But after this most recent upgrade, that I did last week, it will NOT upload to Facebook. It's super annoying, because that's one of the things I enjoy using this app for. Please fix it, so I can go back to enjoying using this app!"
3121,JayeGoCrazy,"August 16, 2015",5,"So Many Gems!! I loved TimeHop but once I added my tweet archive I became addicted. I couldn't believe the things I'd been tweeting 6 years ago! And the things I saw other people tweet. So cool to see where and what I was like just a few years ago. So many things that were major then I don't even remember now. Also, that dinosaur has the most hilarious quips every day. Love it!!"
3122,3kidswithmemories,"September 3, 2015",5,"Timehop is amazing! I love timehop!   I have three grown children and every time they post on fb that is adorable, cute picture or an embarrassing picture-I asked them to tag me because when the picture pops up ( which may be two,three or four years old) makes me smile and remember the moment ! Pictures are the best way to remember history !"
3123,559KBUG,"November 29, 2015",4,Some past needs to stay there I love the idea of reliving all our past moments.  However sometimes the past needs to stay there.  I wish the app can determine when certain photos are deleted from ur FB and timeline and leave them alone.  I also agree with many others about being able to look at past days on or around the time hop.
3124,HayLaura,"December 8, 2015",5,Timehop I love Timehop more than you know. I love getting reminders every day to check out the pics I posted years ago. I have been babysitting for years and it just brings back such wonderful memories of all the little ones I have been watching since they were babies and now they are 4 or 5+ years old. Thank you Timehop üëçüëçüòäüëèüèªüëèüèª
3125,Shpippy,"January 29, 2016",5,"Blast from Your Past! What a refreshing app: always brings back memories / photos from one to many years ago. It helps me remember how long ago certain events occurred, and draws my attention and emotions back to them. I enjoy this application as it also visually helps me track the growth and progress of my daughter over time."
3126,Pookie620,"April 15, 2016",4,"I love the app, and... Timehop is one of my favorite app that a check daily. It is very convenient and can give nostalgia feels. My only wish would be that there was a Snapfish choice. I don't know about you, but I have A LOT of pictures that take up valuable space. I've had to upload all of my pictures from two years ago to now, so it would be really cool if there was a Snapfish feature."
3127,MRQKJ,"April 29, 2016",2,"Changes since recent update I used to love timehop. Some recent changes to the app have caused it to crash on me a couple of times week. I also dislike the fact that I cannot turn off the sound on the daily video that auto-plays as you scroll through the app. Sure, I can turn my phone volume down but I'd rather not have to do that. The user should have the option of disabling auto-play or muting audio, neither of which are currently an option in settings/preferences."
3128,Chicaloco7,"May 9, 2016",5,"I LOVE timehop and the new retro video I love time hop because I can look back at memories that were wonderful. I start every morning looking timehop since it makes me smile. The new retro video is pretty awesome, I love looking back at stuff from past years. My only complaint is that the video should only start when I click on it and not automatically."
3129,Brandon In Dublin,"May 12, 2016",5,"Retro video üò¢ Am I the only one who liked the retro video?!? I loved looking back on previous music and movie video clips on their release date! It was like my own time machine. Yes the music was a bit loud but once I got used to it I learned not to scroll all the way down when I needed to be more discreet. Oh well, guess I'm in the minority, again. Big surprise there!"
3130,Katelynmarie09,"September 3, 2014",5,"Fun, simple, nostalgia-inducing I've use this service for a long time and I'll continue to use it for as long as it's around. The only thing I don't like about it is that I wish it recognize when I've already looked at Timehop for the day and no longer notified me I have a Timehop waiting throughout the day. I'm sure it's just a small glitch though."
3131,Mkavanaugh,"October 13, 2014",5,"Download it ! It is very nostalgic to see what you were doing or thinking, in the past. The App just sends you a little note to check a Timehop , you never know how far back they will go so each reminder is a surprise. I have just recently downloaded it and each time I a get a reminder it is like getting a little present -"
3132,Kaserspaser,"November 13, 2014",5,Love! Love it! Love to have a surprising flashback every day or most is at least it makes my day and I laugh and feel happy looking back at the good times in the past that I haven't seen in a long time it's so fun and I enjoy every day also showing my friends what popped up that day if it had them and it is so fun!!
3133,David Levine,"January 17, 2015",2,"Facebook account required üò¢ In order to start using Timehop, you have to grant it access to your Facebook account. Once in the app, you can connect other things like Twitter, the iOS camera roll, Instagram, and Dropbox. However, in order to keep using the app, you have to keep Facebook connected. If you disconnect Facebook, you're sent back to the Timehop login screen and can't do anything. This is a shame because I really only want to use Timehop with Twitter. I deleted the app because of the Facebook requirement."
3134,BlackTrex,"January 23, 2015",5,"Thank you Abe. Thanks for showing me all the good times, bad times, good women, great women and terrible women I've been through in the past. "
3135,Sabbbsssy,"January 31, 2015",3,"Great app but... I love timehop! I laugh and share about my timeline almost every time, but it upsets me that I can only see my tweets from up to two years ago when I've been on Twitter for about 3 or 4. I tried adding my archive but it still hasn't worked. It will not let me download it to Twitter. Which is something I find odd because I don't have as many tweets as other people I know and they never had a problem or even had to download their archive. Please help me :("
3136,Jgiguain,"March 16, 2015",5,"A moment in time Timehop makes Facebook better by showing you those past moments you posted about and forgot. It's like a daily time capsule. I see pictures from 5 years ago of my kids, stories I posted about them or about family. Checking Timehop everyday is like opening a little gift of the past."
3137,DC's Finest,"March 29, 2015",5,"Throw Back Perfect I've been using this simple little app for years. I love it. It consistently works, but more importantly it does what it does beautifully. It's great and amazing to see what happened last years on this date. Pretty much all the features added enhance this experience vs going a new direction. They do this really well. I use it every day."
3138,Rory Winchester,"April 20, 2015",4,"How about a suggestion or two? I'm currently loving this app, but, seeing as I don't post on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram very often, and I don't have a four square or drop box, I was maybe wondering if you could add a couple apps like Tumblr or even Vine. Just a suggestion! :) otherwise, I love the fact that it tells me when I had posted something, it makes it fun to see how far I've gotten since then!"
3139,99Kel99,"June 3, 2015",4,"LOVE APP...CROP NOT SO MUCH! This is a fabulous appüíó!  I get excited each day to see what Timehop can find bc most of the time, it's pics I've totally forgotten about!  However, if you want to use the comparison option, forget using a selfie. Timehop crops half of whatever picture you use. It's def something that I hope they can fix soon. But like I said, I love this app, and I can deal with not using that portion of the app just to see my memories!"
3140,2meters,"March 3, 2013",5,"Fun and useful I have been on twitter and Flickr a long time, and it is fun to look back. I have been sharing to timehop the things I like best, so now I have a place to feature my ""best of"" tweets and pics. I have not figured out how to add friends, as most are not on Facebook. But they have seen it all already anyway. "
3141,brittlak,"December 6, 2013",2,"Great idea, bad app I love the idea of this. Getting to see pictures from the previous years is so fun, (especially if you have kids) and I look forward to it daily. However, this app continually fails to load and crashes a lot. It will give me the notification that my time hop is ready for the day, then I go into the app and it takes 5 mins loading, then says it failed. Closing the app and waiting to go back in doesn't work either. If they could fix these issues this app would be amazing."
3142,Mphska,"June 1, 2014",5,Daily trip down memory lane! It's really neat to take a trip down memory lane every single day. This app brings up pictures and statuses from 1-5 years ago. It's something that you could do yourself but you just never do.... It's nice every morning to wake up to pictures and statuses and memories from years ago. I highly recommend this app!!
3143,czechoutyourbod,"January 26, 2017",1,"Do you realize this used to be a 5?!?!? Change this format back to the way it used to be already! You went from a 5 to a 1!!!!! I used to look forward to seeing my timehop everyday and now I can't even stand to open in. Can't see half the pics because they either don't load or they are so zoomed in it's stupid! God forbid you have a video that you want to share, NOPE can't happen! I'm this close to deleting this app. It's been long enough where you could have changed it back. You were great, now you're terrible. Don't change what worked!"
3144,Emilyd753,"January 28, 2017",1,"Update is Terrible I hate that I can't scroll through like before and that I have to tap through each one. But the worst part is when it's multiple pictures on one day it scrolls through them very quickly and I can't see them all and the other worst part is it automatically zooms in on pictures and you have to hold down to zoom out. 99% of my pictures look bad zoomed in. Basically, the updated version is more complicated and harder to look at. Instead of enjoying my memories, I'm frustrated I can't see them easily."
3145,Dcejamie,"January 28, 2017",5,"Bring back then/now option Through the last update, you can no longer do side-by-side ""Then vs Now"" updates. Please bring it back! "
3146,LPeeezy,"February 6, 2017",1,"Just getting worse I am honestly fed up with this app. Do the creators even read these reviews? The majority of people want the old layout back. With each update, it's just getting worse. I used to tweet so much and now I have to click 50+ times to get to the end. It's not worth it. I'll redownload this app when the old layout comes back."
3147,elisa5865,"March 3, 2017",5,Very frustrating!!! About 10 days ago this app stopped sharing my posts on Facebook.  What a total pain!  I've sent three messages to the company but have heard no reply.  I don't know what's wrong with this but it's lousy and needs to be fixed.  This is very disappointing because I really love this app.  At least I used to.
3148,Buttrflylace,"April 12, 2017",1,"About to delete.. I've used this app and enjoyed it up until the last few updates. With this last update my ""TimeHop"" shows nothing but status messages I've posted in Facebook. That's it!!!

3149,Libby1701,"April 28, 2017",2,"Getting worse I got this app over a year ago when it was still good. My streak has been recent twice, once when I was at 295 days and once, two days ago when I was at 99 days even though I definitely checked the app both times. There's no point having streaks if it's going to glitch. That's just frustrating. Also, the layout just got worse. Scrolling made so much more sense for this app. The tapping layout is overrated and overused. Just bring back the app that worked."
3150,opus0002,"December 28, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE update The zoomed in picture are just plain annoying. Usually updates are done to enhance an app or make it run better, yours makes me cringe when even think about opening it. I liked being able to see the comments left on pictures and videos, now I just see a zoomed in shot of my kiddos hand, with no way of even seeing the whole picture. I haven't even tried a video yet and I've heard those are just as bad.  You will never be recommends by me again, great idea for an app, lousy that you let someone change it to this garbage"
3151,willworkforbooks,"December 28, 2016",1,"Extremely dislike new update I'm a long-time user and prior to this update, have & would have continued to recommend the app. But I HATE the new update and can easily see myself dropping off as a user, instead finding other, more time-consuming methods to seek out the same purpose. The side-scrolling is annoying, font with colored background distracting, and the progress bar within each year frustrating. I don't like not being able to see picture captions. I don't feel like the user was considered in this urge to create something flashy."
3152,meggles 41,"December 28, 2016",2,"Not User Friendly I've never reviewed an app before but felt the need to after TimeHop updated and I no longer enjoy using it. It's hard to view now, the memories are zoomed in too far so I can't see a picture. I liked looking at everything all at once so I could laugh at all the ridiculous things I was doing X years ago. One at a time defeats the purpose, I want to see myself throughout the years! Please change it back, I'll most likely delete it if not and I'm sure others will too."
3153,NY_Rebecca,"December 29, 2016",1,Another hater of the update Writing this mainly hoping that Timehop sees the reviews and abandons ship on this crazy update. In one word it is WRETCHED. Go back -- you broke something that didn't need fixing. My 2 two main issues: (1) no captions = huge fail. (2) auto zoom is stupid. 
3154,Kendall*,"January 2, 2017",1,"One star is too generous I have never felt compelled to review an app before, but this update is truly a death knell for the app. Everything is now zoomed in horribly creating terrible quality images, occasionally there will be a set of multiple photos in these tiny little frames that you cannot zoom in on or share. It's a true disaster. Honestly, the quality went from wonderful and fun to low quality garbage overnight, it really makes you think that someone must be trying to sabotage Timehop from within. "
3155,KopperGirl77,"January 2, 2017",2,"Hate the update I'm so glad I'm not the only one that hates the newest update. I hate having to zoom out of every single photo, and not being able to see my captions for the photos, which are sometimes the best part (unless there's a way to do this that I don't know about.) Time Hop used to be something I looked forward to everyday but now I don't even like checking it and am thinking of deleting it. Even my daughter who used to love checking it everyday doesn't even ask anymore."
3156,Ldavie,"January 3, 2017",5,Retro video I love time hop!! Old memories and things I forgot about are always awesome to see. I really miss the retro video because it always shows things from my past that I thought were cool to see again. Bring it back!!!!!
3157,gabyblaze,"January 3, 2017",1,"I'd give 0 stars if I could Everyone's pretty much said it, but I felt like I needed to add my two cents. I loved checking Timehop prior to this update. I liked seeing my old tweets, old Facebook statuses and posts and the likes/comments that came with them. The format was easy, you just scroll down and old memories come back, I loved it! What the actual hell were the developers thinking with this update? I can't see anything anymore. Everything is zoomed in and it's really not user friendly anymore. Timehop people do EVERYONE a favor and take us back to the old format."
3158,Kschie,"January 13, 2017",1,"Hate the update I, like all the other complaints, really enjoyed this app until they updated it. I understand the need to keep updating and making changes, and usually end up liking most changes.   This update and change, however, is very disappointing!  It zooms in on every picture you scroll through...  it is very difficult to look at the pictures not zoomed in.   Also can't see comments from Facebook any longer.  Accessibility is also difficult!  I wish you would go back to the old version!"

It's cool to be reminded of where you were a year or a few ago. Two years ago I was battling cancer and with this app I am able to see how far I've come on my journey and I am constantly reminded to be grateful for the life I have today
3162,Jeatc2007,"November 28, 2015",5,Love seeing the past! Remarkable and exciting! If I was forced to give an improvement idea I would ask for a button up top to allow you to select a certain date. With the date selected it would then show you the past from the selected date. Seems like a very simple addition.
3163,Catherine77!,"December 18, 2015",5,"Awesome App, wish I would have discovered it sooner! I love that Timehop shows me what I posted on this day in the past few years, and the ability to integrate all of my social media outlets is great (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)."

You can only repost using their ugly graphics that only a 12 year old would love. I have pictures of my kids from Facebook and IG from up to 7 years ago and I loved the ability to save them. Many pictures are no longer on my phone or computer. This was my chance to snag them for myself. :( Please fix this! I might need to search out a new app for this kind of thing."
3166,Maribethgrace,"May 7, 2016",1,"Everyone hates the update! Hellloooo!! Tons of reviews telling you we hate the update and you're not going to change it?! Facebook has videos so that the sound only plays if you click it, Instagram has videos so that the sound only plays if you tap it! Doesn't that send you a clue that you should make your app that way?! Not only is the retro video dumb and annoying, but people can open the app in any quest environment. I'm sure you've already gotten enough people embarrassed or in trouble at work, school, and woken enough sleeping babies. Can you fix it now?"
3167,Tasha6790,"June 29, 2016",3,"Why is an ad the first thing I see? I understand the need to have a profit margin, but I can tell you right now anchoring an ad to be the first thing a person sees (tricking them to think it's a memory- there's no aesthetic differentiation) is a very poor user experience, and if it keeps it up I guarantee you'll see a drop off in your daily active users. "
3168,Abcdefuvwxyz,"December 23, 2016",4,Newest version I honestly do not like this new version at all. You can't see who liked or commented on something you posted how ever many years ago like we used to in the earlier version. I would prefer to just be able to scroll to see my time hop info instead of click and it's such a huge screen. Very disappointed bring the old version back!!!!!!
3169,Mk60390,"December 26, 2016",1,"New update is bad I really don't like that the new update doesn't allow for you to see captions under pictures. I love seeing the comments under my Facebook and Instagram photos, and I can't do that anymore. Also, the swipe to see the next memory isn't really working. I like scrolling to see my memories throughout the day, and this new update isn't working for that. Also, in general the app is weird and glitchy. Sometimes it'll randomly crash on me, and last week I randomly lost my streak even though I had checked Timehop twice that day."
3170,Leon Wellz,"September 24, 2014",2,Other options on how to login I heard about this app and i was excited when i downloaded and when i opened it was very disappointed when I found out that you have to have a Facebook to login and i dont have one and i am not allowed to have one. There should be an option to where you can login with an instagram account or a Twitter account and I was very upset that i had to waste my time downloading the app and then having to delete it so i hope you can make these changes and soon...
3171,Jay-Way,"October 2, 2014",3,"Cute but buggy It's fun to see what I was doing at this time years ago, but from the time I got this app a week ago it hasn't functioned correctly. First it crashed every time I tried to connect with Twitter, and now with the new update it crashes every time I try to go to settings (so I still can't connect Twitter). I have an iPhone 4 so maybe I should blame it on the old technology but the frequent crashes are definitely interfering with how much I enjoy this app."
3172,Buffalojill6793,"October 6, 2014",5,Love it! Great app! Love reflecting on the past. Just wish it would let you know if it's a year ago from the date or the day of the week. Also would love it if it would give the option of like a five day period so you could see more than just that single day. Other than that it's always fun to look at old photos!
3173,Shehrin,"January 2, 2015",4,"Love it! Just one problem... This is without a doubt my favorite entertainment/miscellaneous app! I have absolutely no complaints but one - for the past couple of weeks, I haven't been able to view my timehop of the day (except a few days in the middle) because of a lost connection. I don't know why this happens as the Internet on my phone works fine. Anyway, love you guys. Thanks for this great app."
3174,Nicole Nixon,"February 2, 2015",5,"Great app but I have a suggestion... I love TimeHop. It's great being able to see what I was doing/saying years ago. But I think you should add another form of social media to it: Snapchat. It'd be cool to see what ""My Story"" was a year ago. I know it's probably not that easy to add on another networking site, but it's just a suggestion and I think it'd be a great addition! Love the app overall."
3175,TaraNWiles,"February 9, 2015",4,"Love it! I really love this app and check it every day! I also really enjoy the side-by-side Then/Now feature - it's perfect for those of us with kids! The only thing I wish was different about the app is the ability to go back and check past days. Sometimes I forget to share a photo or want to see it again and I can't look at yesterday's or before that. Otherwise, love it!!"
3176,Rulersmg1,"February 12, 2015",5,Brings back Memories This is such a great App! I have tons and tons of photos so it's great to be reminded of what I did two or three years ago! I even love the fact that it shows your old Facebook posts! It can make you think of how dumb you were back then but it's still cool to see things from the past! :) download this App people! It's great!
3177,Ginsnappity,"March 18, 2015",3,"Day Late, Missing Captions but still like it Today I got my St. Patrick's Day memories. (It's the day after.) I still love seeing them! But yesterday I would've shared that pic of my daughter with the Chicago river dyed green. I did share a video of my son from a couple of years ago, but I had to re type the whole caption. Why? It used to stay. Please bring that back. You DEFINITELY get five stars if you bring back the captions when sharing, and fix the lag. Thanks for the memories!"
3178,Carp1Sean,"May 12, 2015",5,"Addicting and Inspiring TimeHop has become one of my favorite apps, earning precious real estate in my ""Use Daily"" folders on my iPhone. It's neat to see all the things I did on this date via my social feeds but it also inspires me to reach out to people who I might have been involved in activities with me or been together at an event with. Great reminders to ""keep in touch."""
3179,Greasergrrl,"June 18, 2015",5,"Great app - used daily I love this app and it's changed how I think about social media and how I remember my life. I feel bad that Facebook has copied this functionality into their product because it's actually more useful on Facebook - you can like or comment or delete the posts directly because you are already on Facebook. Sorry, guys :("
3180,Testarosa2,"February 27, 2013",5,"Update today I'm not sure what the update today was for, but it still looks the same. I love this app for seeing the stuff from my past photos FB and Twitter, but I have friends added and I know they share things, but I never see any of their stuff. FIX THIS PLEASE! And I'd love to be able to see comments from past things I've posted too"
3181,penstone,"March 14, 2013",5,"Fun and Interesting Insanely fun and interesting app! You can link Facebook, Twitter and even Foursquare to see where you were at and what you were saying in years past. Would have given 5 stars but you should be able to look at previous days as well, not just a single day at a time. This app has a lot of great potential."
3182,tmcallahan,"August 27, 2014",4,"Fun app but one suggestion: I love this app, it's so cool to be able to see what I was posting years ago. One thing I would change is to have to option to go back and look at days previous other than just the current day. Also it would be nice to be able to filter, like if I only wanted to see posts that were a year old or two or five, etc. Otherwise love it, what a cool idea!"
3183,JPGRGIRL,"September 5, 2014",3,"All of a sudden just stopped working. I'm a fan. I have been for at least a year. I love being able to see my old statuses and instant throwback Thursday. But I just started having problems that I've seen in other reviews. My time travel is failing now. I can't load pictures. And as a mother of a young child, that's kind of a big deal. I want to know of a fix so that I can look at my pics again. If y'all can work this out, I'll go back to five stars."
3184,Anonmoro1629,"January 21, 2017",1,"Boo new timehop The new timehop ruined a good app. Photos are not consistently scaled to fit the screen and the app won't usually let you zoom out so you often cannot see more than a fraction of your image (this never occurred before). Also, the thumbnail/scrolling interface was much better. You could see more at once and, more importantly, now you can get stuck in a photo series  that you can't scroll past on days where you had uploaded many (sometimes hundreds) of pictures. Bring back the old interface and photo formatting!!!"
3185,K.c. Daughter,"January 22, 2017",2,"Concept-ok. Update and execution-catastrophic Title says it all. I loved checking this everyday and doing ""Then and Now"" collages but I can't do that anymore. If I can, I can't figure it out. I hate clicking through all of them. I tried to disarm the zoom feature and it won't save that setting. I had already planned which days I couldn't wait to show up in my feed, but I am truly disappointed and may end up deleting this now. The original version needs to be brought back... quickly."
3186,Chattienatti,"February 28, 2017",2,"Hate the updates Glad to see I'm not the only one who hates the updates. I honestly would've given them 4-5 stars before because I love the idea of Timehop--I love to look through old memories. I wish I could go back to the previous version though. The new version is awful. I hate only being able to look at one photo at once and half the time my pictures and videos won't load anymore. It's also harder to share. Please go back to the old version, I loved it how it was!"
3187,A Hopper,"March 8, 2017",3,Horrible update I have used Timehop for many years. It is likes diary of my life. But your new update is terrible. It has cut out so much information that I no longer enjoy the app. Facebook now does a better job of sharing your memories. 
3188,NewYorkDavid,"March 21, 2017",5,"One of my favorite apps I used to love this app, but the main thing I liked about it was seeing my old Foursquare/Swarm check-ins. There is a notice in the help section dated January 17 claiming that Swarm check-ins will be back ""very"" soon, but I'm still waiting. "
3189,Sad concert goer,"May 6, 2017",4,"Not bad I love being able to see pictures I have forgotten about and ""go back in time"" once a day but I would like to be able to go back to my time hop from the day before. There are days (although) rare that I don't look at it and would like the option to go back. "
3190,Sara1919,"December 26, 2016",1,"Loved timehop until now Timehop was something I always looked forward to every day. I could easily scroll through pictures and share photos, while being able to crop them if necessary. This new update...I no longer find myself enjoying timehop. You can't easily scroll through photos, you have to tap the screen to get to the next one, which can be a long process! And, you can't share videos, and can't zoom in and out on photos when sharing them via text, email, etc. Timehop, please change your format back!!!"
3191,Sophia120199,"December 26, 2016",1,"Disappointed I have never had such big issues with an app that i feel the need to write a review about it until this Timehop update. I used to love the app and the nostalgia of seeing old posts, but now i cant even see the text that comes with it! All i see is a zoomed in picture with no caption. Theres no way to even view the captions. This is a very basic version of the app, it seems as if it was downgraded. I'm VERY disappointed because i look forward to seeing what happened in my past, and now i'm missing days because of this new update."
3192,Jen On Earth,"December 29, 2016",1,"Timehop, I used to love you. I enjoyed checking Timehop every morning until the recent update. The scrolling top to bottom worked well and all my photos loaded. It was also clear how many years ago the post or photo took place.  "
3193,Newmom1226.0407,"December 29, 2016",1,"You've ruined it! I do not write reviews for apps but I feel like I need to express my opinion as well, like so many others. 0 start would more accurately describe my rating. This new update has ruined the Timehop experience. I want to be able to see my comments and captions. I want to be able to scroll through my posts so I can easily compare year to year. I want to see my photos without having them zoomed in on me. I don't know why anyone thought this was a good update to release but clearly your users do not agree. Please change it back!"
3194,25katie25,"December 29, 2016",1,"New update I love the app but I don't like the new update. I think it is more difficult than the way it used to be (less user friendly), and I don't like that all the pictures have to be zoomed out right away, I don't enjoy seeing the pictures anymore."
3195,Ashley_cookie,"January 4, 2017",1,"Update is awful Like many others here I very seldom write reviews but the newest version of Timehop is extremely user-UNfriendly. The automatic zoom is pretty inconvenient however my biggest complaint is when I come across a memory I would like to share, I now how to swipe up in order to access the share options. As an iPhone user, when you swipe from the bottom up, your settings come up making it ridiculously difficult to access the share options without accessing the iPhone settings. In a nutshell I hate the update."
3196,klktag00,"January 4, 2017",1,Terrible update please revert back! After the latest version/update I am hating TimeHop. I can't see what I said or wrote I just see the pic which I have to click on to zoom out and actually see it. So hard to navigate please please please revert back to the old style I used to have it ranked 5 stars it was my go to favorite app as you can see below from previous post. Fix ASAP 
3197,Nettsa,"January 9, 2017",4,"They fixed it!! Hurrah! If you liked Timehop prior to late December and hated it since, you'll be happy to know they put back all the necessary features they inexplicably removed! Annoying auto-zoom is gone, and captions are back. I still have ZERO IDEA why Timehop developers thought any of those changes were good ones, but I'm thankful they listened to all the complaints and changed it back!!"
3198,05111984,"January 19, 2017",1,"New version is TERRIBLE! Checking timehop used to be one of my things each day now every time I try to look at it I just get angry! The old version was perfect.  It was user friendly and had the features we loved.  The update is difficult to use. The frames and the click thru are enough by themselves to not want to check it, then add that the sharing option rarely works and it makes it not even worth it to check. Unless you want timehop to end up in the land of My Space, you should listen to the people and change it back."
3199,IluvTrgt,"January 20, 2017",1,"I miss the old version I don't often write app reviews but this new version makes me so angry. If this was my first time downloading it I would have already deleted it but since I have faith that they will bring back the features I loved (then/now, scrolling thumbnails instead of swipe to advance, sharing videos, basically exactly how it was before it was updated)....I'm holding out. Timehop was my favorite app that I often told people to download- but now it just frustrates me because so many of my pictures I see but can't share- for some reason."
3200,@michellebarron211,"September 11, 2015",5,I recommend it to everyone It's nice getting that silent notification from Timehop in the mid morning. I look forward to seeing how far I've come in 1+ years and reflect on good times. The whole app itself has a quirky charm. They give you an interesting throwback in history and the little dinosaur has his jokes too. Definitely worth it.
3201,ShoeNazi,"September 27, 2015",5,"Getting worse Are you in competition w/ Facebook?  Is Facebook purposely feuding with Timehop to make sure every day's Timehop is filled with unshareable statuses and deleted pics?  It's pointless to even scroll through, because IF there's something you can actually view, what you CAN share is no longer attached to what it originally was..."
3202,4ssteph,"December 5, 2015",3,"Lately nothing... So lately when I check time hop there is nothing there that is from the past. Like last 7 days. Now this is confusing because on the Facebook app there is an option, ""on this day"" that has tons of history on this day. Interesting stuff too that time hop is not catching. I'm going to end up deleting it if it can't do what it is meant to do. I can simply see all history on Facebook. Something to fix admins!"
3203,Voicelover7,"December 21, 2015",4,"Impressive but sometimes boring Time hop gives me a laugh most days as I see the completely ridiculous things I posted to social media in the past, but sometimes there simply isn't anything to show. In that case time hop has no purpose. So if you have been a social media fanatic you may enjoy time hop. But if you haven't posted much, or nothing at all, it will be boring for you."
3204,Tybom2010,"May 1, 2016",1,"Enlarge photos? Wth Recently lost the ability to tap on any of my photos to view full screen, since many of the photos are slightly cropped this effectively makes the app useless to me. If I can't even look at my own old photos and posts full screen and without ability to zoom in/out then what good is having the app. I'd be better off scrolling through my own camera roll and not having to deal with the tease of the photo preview on timehop. It wasn't broken before the update, why try to fix it? And the video at the end... No please."
3205,Yeaup89,"August 6, 2016",3,"bummed out I like this app but the new update totally screwed up my streak. I had a 50 streak going but the the app started acting up and wouldn't even open. When I tried to update it, the caption on it says get a 150 streak and you will get a mewtwo and I was a little confused but due to the whole Pok√©mon go hype, I understood what they were trying to do. So I figured that's why the app started acting up and messed up my streak so I could start all over again.. I'm sad now"
3206,"""JustJack!""","October 19, 2016",3,"Day streak lost, All. The. Time. Lost another long streak, even though I look at the app daily. But if you don't go just so far down and stay there while it processes or something you'll lose the streak. Why is it even a thing!? Also, there should be an option to ""go to photo"" so I can delete useless old screen shots or whatever the photo is that I don't need to see. I just think this could be better and more fun so three stars for now.."
3207,Gunnah441,"December 14, 2016",3,Day streaks So far the app has been great showing me old memories of things I and others have posted of me but for some reason when I'm on a certain streak of days in a row I've looked the app will just reset the days and I'm back to one which is extremely frustrating especially because I was on a 138 day streak and I know for a fact I checked that day but it reset me to 1 and it has happened two other times since then.
3208,Ekrose9872,"December 25, 2016",1,"Never reviewed an app before This update is garbage!!! Having to tap through every single picture is so annoying. Sometimes all I want to do is scroll and select a few pictures to view. Also, like the other 100s of people reviewing this app today have said, the pictures look awful and pixelated because of the zoom feature you've added. Timehop was one of my FAVORITE apps, something I check every day, but not if this update sticks around. The flow of your app was perfect, why try to complicate things? Go back to the old version please!!!!!"

My possible feature idea is linking up with Snapchat to have one or two ""My Story"" photos shown as well. I think people may enjoy this and it could be a 0.99 cent update so it's fair to both consumer and provider."

3214,cecicanelos,"May 27, 2015",4,"The ultimate TBTs This app can either brighten up your day or embarrass you by realizing how pathetic and immature you once were. Nonetheless, it's a unique app, taking you down memory lane for sure. The bad thing is that you can't view yesterday's time hop if, for whatever reason, you forget to check it. Gotta wait a whole another year. The trivia at the end is a great educational tool - I look forward to that the most."
3215,coleslaw1990,"June 9, 2015",4,"Two Frustrating Things I love this app a lot. The only problems I have, the time zones don't work. When midnight strikes for me, (Eastern time U.S.) it still doesn't change anything until 3a.m. No matter what time zone I change it to, the day stays the same. Also, the archive for Twitter isn't Mac compatible when I try and drag it from my downloads. If they could fix this, that would be great! :)"

Also if we could go back to about a week before that would be great especially since I don't know what photos have been on there for a few weeks!"
3220,Scipio96,"November 27, 2012",3,Needs one thing. Good app with a good idea.  One BIG oversight though. If I miss a day (forget to check) I can't go back and see what I missed.  I understand not letting me look into the future...it keeps me coming back to the app...but let me look at days in the past. I can't imagine that would be too hard to implement. Even if I can't go back to any day at least let me look at the last 3 days or so. Each day adds one new day (today) and the oldest one falls off.
3221,lph2488,"September 16, 2013",4,"Love the service, but a little clunky Works 90% of the time on the first try. I love the service but it's a little clunky to scroll through, say, tons of pictures (which often don't load). Also wish Facebook/Twitter sharing were more efficient - it always cuts off part of the tweet in the post, making people click on the post and leave Facebook to see the rest."
3222,AbkJames,"May 13, 2014",5,Great app! I love this app! It shows all of my old pics & statuses & takes me down memory lane. Also gives me a 2nd chance to have old photos I've lost.

3225,Hi im tayler,"September 9, 2014",4,"Love this Love this app so much. It's such a great way to look back at your life from years ago on that day. Only reason I'm giving four stars, is because I can't connect two facebooks. "
3226,Sidorokara,"November 5, 2014",4,"Awesome concept! All-around great app that has cute, silly features.  It is great to revisit old memories!  The only downfall is the manner in which photos are posted to facebook now.  Instead of showing the full photo, all you see is a small box that you have to click instead.  I would have given 4.75 stars if I could, but aside from the facebook photo post, this is most def a 5-star app!"

Looks like I won't really be using this app much unless they change it back."

I dislike everything about it; they took away a ton of great features and what they've given us is complete crap. I used to love using this app every day but it's so awful now it's not hardly worth it. I really hope they change it back.
3233,Lrb917158303,"January 11, 2017",1,"HATE the newest version Timehop used to be a fun way to laugh at yourself from the past, but they have actually ruined it with the latest release. The full screen craziness makes all of your pictures and posts way too zoomed in, you can't read comments on old posts anymore (which used to be the best part) and everything is so big that it's really aggressive. Went from being one of the most pleasant and funny parts of my day to an actual pain in the tush- going to look for another app that shows your old posts normally!!"
3234,Hottermiss,"January 17, 2017",2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it! I do not like this new version of Time Hop, at all.  I've been trying to get use to it and learn to like it, but I just can't.  It's very difficult to view the pictures as they are practically magnified when you first swipe to them and when you zoom in, it doesn't stay that way.  It's not very user friendly either, trying to figure out how to share and whatnot.  I love looking back on memories and will of course keep Time Hop, I just preferred the older version. :)"
3235,NDLF,"January 27, 2017",1,Why isn't timehop back to the original yet?? Please listen to your constituents and revert the app back to normal! We don't like the update! 
3236,tennis_lover,"February 20, 2017",1,"If I could rate this 0 stars I would I have never felt the need to write a review for an app, but I can't believe that Timehop hasn't made changes after receiving so many negative reviews. I hate the new format, and I don't understand why some of my pictures that are the same change fast from the different filters. It gives me a headache. This app is absolutely useless now that Facebook has memories. I have loved Timehop for years, and now I dread looking at it because it ruins my pictures and memories. Don't try to fix something that isn't broken, Timehop"
3237,Cenzo79,"February 26, 2017",1,"Oh Where, Oh Where is the Old Hop At? Congrats guys and gals, you took an app that was a lot of fun and turned it into a frustratingly annoying experience. I used to look forward to my daily time travels with Abe, now I find myself hoping that he's extinct each morning. For the review trolls who will say, ""Duh, just uninstall the app and get over it,"" I say this - should we just get over the fact that Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was cancelled for no good reason? Should we get over the fact that Tom Brady left Bridget Moynahan high and dry for that Brazilian home-wrecker? The answer, good internet denizens, is no."
3238,Shellerenae,"April 4, 2017",5,TimeHop PLEASE FIX THIS APP!! This app needs to go back to the original format. It is awful now and I cannot load half the stuff nor can I share videos or pictures via messaging or social media. I loved this app cause I could share memories with people and that feature is not working anymore. Go back to the old format please.
3239,Plmnivxj,"May 24, 2017",1,Annoying Used to be so much better before updates. 
3240,Mccwalker,"December 26, 2016",4,So very disappointed Timehop was my favorite app. Truly. It made me smile every day in some way. This new update is God awful!! It's not user friendly at all. I actually came to find where to review it because it's so awful that I needed to say so! (I don't usually take the time to review them.) I would give it no stars if I could.
3241,jo2213,"December 26, 2016",1,"From amazing to completely worthless I have been using timehop now for a long time. I loved using it to see my posts, see what I had to say about things, and see who I interacted with. Timehop recently updated its format so now I only see the pictures I posted. I cannot see what I wrote on the pictures or who commented on them/liked them/ etc.  You can still see your tweets, but nothing attached to your pictures. It's only about you and not others you interacted with. It's horrible. I'll be deleting it and moving to Facebook ""on this day"" memories."
3242,mamamac,"December 27, 2016",1,"Hate the new picture layout I have hundreds of pictures every day, so flipping through every individual image instead of scrolling through a collage-style layout is cumbersome and slow. I look at the first few and give up, and haven't shared a memory since the update. "
3243,reginaldo,"December 28, 2016",1,NOPE I don't know where they found the UX team who developed this update but I don't think I've ever seen an app go from great to terrible so quickly. It's completely unusable. 
3244,Seb94p,"December 29, 2016",1,"New update makes this horrible! I don't review apps, however this new update is so horrible I feel I should say something. I used to love Timehop. It was neat to go back and read comments under my status updates and read the captions and comments under my pictures. Now all of that is gone. No past comments, no captions and the pictures and videos look horrible now that they are so zoomed in. Whoever came up with this update needs to get fired. This WAS a great app and fun to use. Now it's just crap. Please fix it and ""update"" back to how it used to be."
3245,angellbee,"December 30, 2016",1,"Horrible update! I've never left a review before, but feel like I had to say something about this horrible update. I loved Timehop & looked forward to seeing my memories/reading old comments from years past every day, but this new update has completely ruined the whole experience for me. The whole thing is frustrating now & I'm missing the older, easier & more user friendly Timehop!"
3246,Kari062307,"January 1, 2017",1,"Oof. I have never written an app review, but I had to for this. I loved Timehop before. It was my favorite app. But with the most current update? I can't even stand checking it. I keep opening it, hoping it has changed back. But it hasn't. So I immediately close it out. I miss being able to see the comments and the captions and the statuses. I was planning to start off the new year by using Timehop to go back and hashtag my Instagram photos to make them easier to look up, and I no longer can do that easily, thanks to the new update. I'm very disappointed."
3247,TheRealFatMan,"January 2, 2017",2,"... I realize the is brand new, however, you see what the people want. There were features such as saying what day a picture was (ex. Monday, Tuesday...) and small features like that, that were removed for reasons I don't understand. Timehop is still a good app, though. You should be responding to the market. I still however like some of what the full screen pictures do. There should be an option to switch both views every time. Because the look of the full screen is good."
3248,ManGat384,"January 6, 2017",5,Hate it!! I don't like the new update at all!! I enjoyed being able to see my captions and comments from other people. I can't stand how the pictures are automatically zoomed in and you have to touch the screen to view the entire thing. Just don't like anything about it! Fix it back!!!!!
3249,arc2889,"January 7, 2017",4,"Then and now? I really enjoy this app! It's always fun to see what I was doing in previous years. I do like the layout that came with the new update but what happened to the ""then and now"" option?? I loved that! I can't find it anywhere so I'm assuming it's gone...please bring it back?? Lost a star because that feature is gone but everything else about this app is pretty good!"
3250,MomB96,"May 12, 2015",5,"Who doesn't like looking back? Remember pulling out old photo albums an scrapbooks to reminisce? I get to do that every day with this app! I love seeing old pictures and remembering what we did on, two, or even five years ago! So much fun. It's even nice to see the sad posts. You remember but also realize how far you've come since then. Great app!"
3251,Breeskee512,"May 13, 2015",5,"It's amazing the things that electronics can do! I think this is one of the best apps anyone has came up with! Even though I know alls I have to do is go back through pictures to see the same stuff, I love that I don't have to and it's just one click and you see stuff up to 5yrs ago on that same day!!! It's definitely bitter sweet!!!"
3252,Lucinda97,"June 27, 2015",4,"Awesome app, few problems Timehop is seriously the best. I love getting to see what I was up to and what was on my mind 1, 2, 3, 4 even 5 years ago. It's always a fun time for me. "
3253,Ana's mum,"June 29, 2015",4,"Great concept I love looking back and seeing what I've posted. Often, it's something I've forgotten about. I wish that when you wanted to share a post, the original content was intact. For example-- not only are the photos cropped when sharing, but the narrative doesn't post at all. In posts with links, the links aren't clickable. Great concept, still needs some refining in the execution."
3254,KimKim138,"July 4, 2015",5,"**Feature Request: Captions üôè To, the only way this little gem could improve is to offer the option to either include the caption/comment/title/text from the original post - or even free/new text -  onto the Timehop photo  --OR-- provide a link to or other easy means of accessing the original post. Otherwise, bravo üëèüéâ"
3255,Gayane K,"July 26, 2015",5,Each update seems to cover what we want I like this app. Enjoy seeing the flash backs as far back as 7 years for me and sharing with my friends. It's nice that it is able to cover so many platforms. Also love all the new sharing options and think they just keep improving with each update.
3256,melodius624,"August 2, 2015",5,"Really great app! I honesty love this app!! It's so easy to use and makes organizing your current plans and making future plans so easy! I definitely recommend this app to everyone, especially those with a busy schedule. The developers did a fantastic job creating this app, and it will get better with each update!"
3257,smileeyone,"December 21, 2015",5,I love TimeHop This is a super cool app. I love that it shows me posts and pictures that I've most likely forgotten that I even posted a year or two ago. It's also nice to be reminded of the uplifting tweets and posts that made me feel better before because most of the time they help to lift my spirits again when I see them pop up on my TimeHop feed.
3258,sandflea82,"March 27, 2016",4,"Does its purpose but wish there was more The app is great but I wish you could add multiple Twitter accounts instead of just one. I have two so it would be really beneficial. I would also love a tumblr feature to be able to see what you posted on tumblr in the past and to be able to share to tumblr. Other than what the app needs, it does its purpose and it's great."
3259,Youngbinks,"July 10, 2016",3,"Change Change is obviously inevitable. That being said, why isn't there a way to click on a photo to make it full screen and then zoom and pan freely? This was an option before all of the ""updates"" meant to improve the application. However, you must now save the photo to your camera roll (that you most likely already have saved) and then zoom and pan. First-world problems at their best."
3260,Horsegurlmerc,"January 11, 2013",1,"Started out great... I loved time hop when I first got it. So cool to be reminded of things past. But for the past few weeks its saying I had several blank days (NYE- def not true), the data won't load and if the data loads, the pictures won't load. Also, when I have a blank day I hop back in time to December 2. Every. Single. Time. I want to hop back to random days throughout the year! Biggest pet peeve is the fact that my Facebook friends on timehop always get checked to see my posts everyday after I uncheck them! I want to share my memories but let ME decide who can see them."
3261,Jupert,"August 17, 2014",4,"Roll back surprise! It's fun using the app as a great way to see and post Facebook statuses & pictures since I joined. It gave me a. Chance to communicate with the important people I work and met. However, does it really need to archive my tweets so I could see them in the app? Also, do I really need to log in with Facebook everytime I open the app? Other than this, I'm happy with the app, only some minor bugs."
3262,Rowechicky,"August 31, 2014",5,"Brilliant...just brilliant! Loved this app from the first day I downloaded it. Cute little TimeHop Abe makes my day. I love how they use my name some days for my personal message and the daily trivia. Some days it's painful to look back but overall I love the idea of this app and looking back is fun. I wish they had a function to ""like"" Abe's messages or to share those too!"
3263,DrAnalytical,"December 16, 2014",4,"Best app ever This is the reason I kept a detailed Facebook page. Now I can see exactly what I did, every single day, for the past 5 years. It's cool to see how you change, or don't change, over time. If you post on fb everyday, this is a must have app for reminiscing. Made for #tbt"
3264,Kailag23,"February 21, 2015",3,"Misses past posts and photos I love this app, but I've noticed it misses a lot of old moments from my Facebook account. My grandma died 5 years ago today and I see zero posts on my time hop about it. I had to dig deep into my account on my own time to find them. How does this app miss some things? And I know it's not because it was 5 years ago because I sometimes have things that pop up from 6. Now I'm wondering just how much is actually missed."
3265,Little_angle,"March 27, 2015",4,"More Than 1 Day Off Date Issue's! I love the app and the concept of the app. My only issue is that the dates are off by a LOT! I got married in Sept 2014. On my 6 month anniversary it showed me pics of my wedding and said 1 year ago. Not quite timehop, not quite! Today is March 28th and it's showing me pictures that were taken and shared on St. Patrick's day, March 17th. I still love the app, but wish the dates of events were correct."
3266,Heather!ex,"February 1, 2017",2,"UPDATE RUINED IT. This used to be a great app, one I used regularly.  But as others have lamented, the recent update has made it very difficult to use (can't share memories) and not very comfortable.  It cuts the edges off pictures so you only get the central bit, which makes it feel very crowded. "
3267,KMM one star,"February 14, 2017",4,"Worst update ever! Two days ago, I tried to post a video of my grandmother who passed away two years ago and couldn't.  I couldn't even save it. Also, why should one have to click on a picture to zoom out. Makes no sense. I really hope you are working to improve ALL of the updates. **Update...still terrible** Time time to delete it altogether."
3268,Feliss2017,"February 16, 2017",1,Delete this app!! I felt I was left with no choice but to delete your app. It's really disappointing how you won't listen to long time users and revert to the old version. It's crazy how fast a 5 star rating can turn into 1 star. Listen to your users and I would consider redownloading. Users: bad reviews are not enough everyone should delete this app and maybe we will be heard.
3269,CourtsRN,"June 2, 2017",5,Enjoy my Timehop memories At first when the app was updated it was clunky and had quite a few bugs.  It's working well now.  I love this app!  I really appreciate the State of the Union message from today.  Thank you for all of the work you have put into this app so that we are able to enjoy daily memories üå∫.
3270,southphilly_chic,"January 2, 2017",1,"Terrible Update I like Timehop and have been using it for a few years now. This update is the worst of all of them. One of the main things I liked about Timehop before was being able to see likes and comments on an old picture and now that's gone. I hate this zoom out feature too why is that necessary? Also today Timehop posted a picture that happened 12years ago, but there's no caption or anything so I have no clue what the pic is from. Anyway please fix this update it's terrible and I can see I'm not alone in thinking that."
3271,Aimless085,"January 2, 2017",1,Bad Update I really dislike the newest update (version 4.0.1). It automatically zooms in on all of the pictures (omitting parts of the photos until you zoom out) & no longer shows the wording that goes along with the pictures which is all part of the fun in taking a look back at your history. It also takes much longer to go through the pictures. What you had going in the previous versions was a good thing (scrolling down your screen like a vertical timeline). Please revert back to that format. Thank you.
3272,Tadds,"January 3, 2017",1,Used to love this-HATE THE LAST UPDATE The last update is horrible. I want to see the pics back in the newsfeed format and I HATE how it zooms in and you use to hold to see the full pic. WHY wouldn't it work the opposite way? Really hoping they will revert back to the old format. :( I've tried to get on the bandwagon and continued using it but will stop soon if it doesn't change. It's annoying to use now. There is no way to skim through all pics quickly. What if I loaded 300 pics one day? I don't want to go through those one by one. Bring old timehop back!!!!!!!!
3273,beckyohmer,"January 3, 2017",1,"Maybe the worst update to an app ever That may be a bit dramatic, but I have literally never written a review for an app before and I needed everyone to know that this update is horrible. There was no problem with the old style of the app, and instead of bettering the existing platform they make you click through, which doesn't allow me to see multiple things at once, and it also requires full screen, so you can't see most whole pictures. If I could give this update a zero I would, I'm considering deleting the app."
3274,Kittel,"January 4, 2017",1,"Why Fix What Isn't Broken? The app is ruined in it's current state. Obviously I'm not the only one who thinks so. But not only is the layout terrible, but it's missing key moments I know were posted to social media. For example, today is my girlfriend and I's one year anniversary. I know for a fact the relationship status as well as other posts were made that day, and nothing is there this morning. I'm not only sorely disappointed in the new layout, but I'm disappointed that the one thing Timehop is supposed to do regardless of layout is failing as well."
3275,Jake3553721,"January 4, 2017",1,"I wish I could give 0 stars You guys made a barely useful app completely useless. Yes I can see a picture that I posted on Instagram years ago but you've made it literally impossible to view the caption posted with the pic. Same for Twitter conversations. There's no way to actually click the link to the tweet and view replies or view who I was replying to. There's no way I'm keeping this app on my phone as there's no use for it anymore due to the new update. Also, for some reason it won't let me give you zero stars but that is what this app deserves."
3276,skolamunn,"January 8, 2017",4,"Best App Out There Thank you!! Thank you for putting back the comments and likes. People need to understand that changes take time and made the most important change first and I appreciate that. Yes, the app was better two versions ago, but it's back to being my favorite app again now. There's nothing else out there that does what you do. Thank you, TimeHop developers!"
3277,Sav0913,"January 16, 2017",2,"I miss the old Timehop I miss the layout of the old Timehop app. Scrolling up to see the progression of your posts is way more efficient and appealing than touching to scroll like Snapchat. Now it feels isolated. Most of all, I miss the ability to click on a Facebook post and see the ""likes"" and comments from that post. It was my favorite feature! The dialogue that went with the status/picture was the most important piece of the memory! Wish I hadn't updated and now I'm contemplating deleting it."
3278,Tori1984viv,"January 29, 2017",5,"Huge problems still The app hasn't opened to show me my pictures in a week! It freezes, nothing happens and eventually I close it again. Please find a fix for this!!!!! I love time hop, the little dinosaur guy, please get my favorite working again, I miss being able to see my day in history......."
3279,Janaaaaaaaa4828227,"January 30, 2017",5,Awful update Really hate that you can't share videos anymore. Also the then and now option is gone. Also you can't click on or share pictures in timehops with multiple images (if I uploaded a Facebook album I can't get any of the pictures in it). So so so disappointed.
3280,Eleu2u,"September 1, 2015",4,"Most missed when wasn't working I'm so glad it's back working solidly again! I love this app and all it reminds me of, daily.  It was frustrating when no one would respond when it wasn't working on any of my devices but I would get emails teasing me about what was waiting but Timehop wouldn't open for months. Glad it's back but that experience kept it from 5 stars."
3281,Only Tiff,"September 7, 2015",3,"Was better before I used to love timehop. Seeing pictures that I totally forgot about and bringing back the memories. But with every update it just gets worse. Most of my photos don't show up. It just says ""this photo has been deleted"" when I know for sure that I haven't deleted any pictures. Sometimes nothing will even show up, no statuses or anything. Fix what's going on and then maybe I'll start to love it again."
3282,Mandeejean,"December 25, 2016",1,"Hate the update I don't ever write reviews, but I hate the new update so bad that I had to write this. Why change a good thing if it's not broken? I liked being able to scroll down through all of my statuses and seeing all of them in a row. But most of all I liked being able to look at what people said on my statuses. My brother who passed away used to comment on a lot of my stuff and I loved waking up and looking at his comments. Taking away that feature is the worst part of this update and I really don't see a point to this app anymore."
3283,Duckieer,"December 26, 2016",1,"Changing previous review! Echoing what everyone else has said, the new update is terrible! I shouldn't have to ""zoom out"" to see my pictures, they should be shown the way I posted them. I also hate the slide show when there's tons of pictures on one day. It gives me a headache trying to keep up with the flipping. I also really enjoyed seeing past comments and likes and while it was harder to do after the last update, now it seems like it's not there at all. Terrible terrible terrible!! Is there a way to undo the update?"
3284,Ladivaj,"December 26, 2016",1,"This update ruins the beauty of Timehop I look so forward every day to seeing my memories and viewing the comments from FB and Instagram. This new update has taken that away and therefore, taken away 70% of the time I get to spend reminiscing. I updated because my videos were not loading, but that is still a problem with this as well. Please go back to the old format where everything was not zoomed in and the captions and comments can return. I love Timehop, it's one of my favorite apps. But I cannot look at it or really enjoy it in this new form."
3285,Help me post a picture please,"December 28, 2016",1,New update needs to go!! The fact the all the pictures are already zoomed in and you can't see the whole picture just seems not very reasonable. And why would you take away the captions of the photos??? That's part of the memory so basically you are just cutting the memory in half. The old version was so much more reasonably fun to flip through and watch the progression of the years and see the captions on the photos. Bring back the old!!!! Hopefully the developers will listen to the users and bring back the old!!
3286,Barbleephoto,"December 29, 2016",1,I hate the new update! What have you done to my favorite app? I used to love to start my morning over coffee reviewing wonderful memories and photos. You have destroyed time hop for me! It is Connor intuitive why would a person want to tap to see the whole photo? While earth would you present us with the zoomed in view as the default? And what is happened to the photo frames I love them. When I clicked on share this morning to share a photo nothing happened. Please just hop back in time to how it looked last month. That's all I have to say. Just heartbroken.
3287,jjw1982,"December 29, 2016",1,"Completely useless I never write app reviews but I'm so annoyed by the Timehop updates. You've rendered the app completely worthless with this update. It's so user un-friendly with the clunky interface, crashing every time I open it, the overly zoomed in pictures, impossible to see where the memories are coming from, and far too time consuming to swipe through each individual memory. You changed it because you could, not because it made sense. I'll be deleting this app, it's not at all entertaining or useful in this iteration."
3288,OptumEmp,"December 31, 2016",1,"Why change something that wasn't broken? I don't normally write reviews, but I had to say something. The new TimeHop is TERRIBLE. It's not user-friendly, it's glitchy, and it's hard to navigate. Now I'm unable to view or send certain pictures and videos, or I have to zoom out to view something. What happened to just a simple list, by year, that was easy to navigate? I cannot believe for a second that focus groups, if you even held any, approved of this new layout. I hate to leave this app because I love the memories, but it's literally unusable."
3289,Filthyrich41,"December 31, 2016",1,"Timehop is Awesome, new App version is not. Timehop has been one of my most favorite apps I've ever used. It's such a fun and easy way to see a snap shot of social media and photos each day. Love using it everyday....however...."
3290,bherzberg96,"August 5, 2014",4,"Very good app Very good app, but the notifications need to be a little less obnoxious.  A simple ""Check your Timehop!"" would be good, instead of it trying to read off your past posts/tweets, which never end up fitting in the space Notification Center leaves for the notifications' text.  And maybe some history (instead of just pop culture) for days in the past."
3291,richter baby!,"August 29, 2014",3,"Time Options I really like TimeHop! I haven't had any trouble with mine loading, and I think Abe is adorable! "
3292,eebyzzi,"September 6, 2014",3,"Won't Load Photos This app worked great at first, but now all of a sudden, it won't load any photos. I would say about 80% of my posts are photos, so this is an issue. It's frustrating. The 'tap to retry' does nothing. It's also kind of strange how it takes around until 9am every morning to load that days time hop. Very cute app, definitely needs to be tinkered with. I also wish there was an option to go back to previous days."
3293,DevynB.,"January 23, 2015",5,"5 stars Really great app! Love that you can share the old posts to your Facebook or Twitter or whatever you use. I hate seeing embarrassing posts from 5 years ago, haha, but it's a really cool app that lets you see posts you made years ago. Nothing wrong with it. It never crashes. Doesn't over-do it with notifications. It's got a cute Dinosaur. Yeaaaah"
3294,Blisfulmama,"March 2, 2015",3,"Glitches galore! I love the idea of this app. It's fun to look back and see what was happening this date in my history. However, it won't show my iPhone pics, lots of times there is no content available, when I click on a post to see comments then click back it crashes every time. It was great when I first got it but many of the updates have created more issues. Needs some fixing to be 5 stars."
3295,SUNLOVER28,"March 24, 2015",5,Love this app! I haven't had any problems/ bugs like others who reviewed. The problem may be in their phone. I've found that if I've missed a few days I can just go to my home page and swipe down ( iPhone 4s) and see notifications on many apps from previous days). Thx for the memories!
3296,Tragedy13,"May 3, 2015",5,"Love this App! Absolutely LOVE this app! I get so excited when I get a notification for a ""time hop"" update for something exciting that has happened in the last year to last few years! It's great to real live all of my Wonderful memories and share them again with family and friends! I recommend it to everyone!!"
3297,Oranges2424,"May 13, 2015",5,Genius This app is a genius idea. Everyone loves looking back at their distant past to see how much they have changed and hopefully improved. This also reminds people of what they used to prioritize and love. Bring back old and great memories. Without a doubt one of my favorite apps and a must have if you use social media often!
3298,Steph2993,"May 15, 2015",5,Great trip down memory lane I love being reminded of where I was a year ago today...two years...three years and so on. It's a wonderful way to remind me how different my life will be one year from today! Very simple app and concept! Doesn't overload me with ads or notifications. Don't usually post reviews but I really like this app! Thank you
3299,DFish07,"July 28, 2015",5,"Fun app I love looking back through the years to see what was going on in my life at that time. I also enjoy sharing certain memories with family and friends through the built in sharing feature. Finally, the then and now photo option is neat to visually display how memories grow and change."
3300,heathrulez,"January 1, 2017",1,"Loathsome update As everyone has been articulating about this update already, there are really awful aspects about it that make timehop much less fun to use. I've always loved getting to see the comments on posts and cautious of photos, but now that's gone. And while I haven't had that many photos that were affected much by the zoom I still find it annoying you have to zoom in. Also scrolling down makes much more sense to go ""deeper"" into your past. Hoping the developers get the message and switch it back."
3301,Thankfulwife,"January 2, 2017",4,Sad update I was a huge fan but the update is horrible. :( it's way less fun to use now and harder to see pictures and share them. Very sad about that. It was great before and would prefer it just went back to how it was. 
3302,claire todd,"January 3, 2017",2,"Love love love - except the UI Updating a previous review (original is below). Still love the idea of this app, but the UI has been getting progressively worse. Not everything needs to follow the Snapchat swipe! "
3303,kaliyugaa,"January 5, 2017",1,"Echoing many others While all of the other comments have done a wonderful job to hit on how poorly designed this update is- in a world full of Snapchat and Instagram stories where we need to click, it's not necessary to do the same thing. But for me my largest complaint is that I no longer have a way to see comments on my posts. Half the fun of TimeHop is reading what friends said on your posts and that's impossible to do now. I find myself only opening the app to get rid of the notification. This is truly a terrible update."
3304,jbamberger,"January 6, 2017",1,Should be 0 stars... I have never written a review before however due to this terrible update I felt like I needed too. The new setup is absolutely terrible and makes it impossible to view/share a majority of your posts and photos. The old layout was user friendly but this new update doesn't make me want to keep up with my daily streak. I appreciate Timehop wanting to keep up with other apps layout and design but I believe there should be an option to go back to the old layout. If this isn't fixed soon I'll be deleting Timehop.
3305,Robynmhmhmhvv,"January 7, 2017",5,"APP NOW FIXED Every problem you had with the new update has now been fixed and I'm super happy about it! Thank god. The new layout isn't as annoying anymore, comments are back and easier to access!!!! Just wish the photo clusters showed more or was easier to see them all together."
3306,Money's hot,"January 12, 2017",1,Go Back to Scroll Screen!!!! Timehop used to be nice in that you could just scroll through all of your old stuff and look at it year by year. Now it makes you click through similar to a Snapchat story but does this by having weird layouts and is not user friendly at all. It tried be something it's not and ruined the functionality of the app. A common mistake that companies make...should stick to who they are and not try to even pretend to be a Snapchat one off with this story junk. Smh. 1/10 would not recommend.
3307,Moegleink,"January 23, 2017",1,"Bring Back the Better Version! My favorite features are STILL gone. No more Now/Then. No more photo grids from albums (or pictures over the years like Halloween). Instead of scrolling I'm tapping so now I get bigger pictures-big whoop, what's going to happen when my big travel albums show up? I'll never be able to see anything else!"
3308,Ms GJW,"February 25, 2017",1,"Huge disappointment I've not enjoyed the new TimeHop ""upgrade."" I'd give it zero stars but that wasn't an option.  I miss the then/now option. If it still exists, it's too hard to find. The pictures are too big and I liked being able to scroll down, rather than swipe or tap to see the next photo. To whomever is in charge of these upgrades, please go back to the original. It was fun. Facebook gives me memories and I can just use those and don't really need this. I will give this app another month or so and then I'm done."
3309,Krissa Shoesmith,"April 11, 2017",1,"Aggravating It's very annoying checking Timehop once, going all the way through my time line and updating my streak. To have to do it three or four more times or else I lose my streak? And then having to watch a video to ""unfreeze"" my streak days when I check it every morning but if I don't double or triple check it- it won't count. "
3310,The Elusive Artist,"June 13, 2016",2,"Noooo! What'd you do?!? I love Timehop and use it daily but Whyyyyy would you guys make it so I have to sign in to see comments and likes?! Like, you guys had it perfectly fine before... Why do this? I have Timehop because I no longer login to actual Facebook or use the Facebook app, but still want a bit of nostalgia in my current life, but this is now defeating the purpose ... So annoying and unnecessary ! Please get it together for the sake of me and Abe's relationship... Lord knows I love Abe! #AbeForPresident ... Why does that seem vaguely familiar? **shrugs**"
3311,LadInCA,"December 25, 2016",1,"Horrible update - please go back! Long time user. Even though facebook has the ""on this day"" feature, I'd still use Timehop because I liked the combo of Facebook and instagram posts on one app. The new format is really bad and not very intuitive. Yeah, I know, it's just a few ""clicks"" and ""swipes"" but I liked the straight forward view better. I really enjoyed this app before the update and apparently I'm not the only one who dislikes the update. Please listen to all of the feedback and go back to the old version. I'll be uninstalling if it stays the same."
3312,SdPank,"December 29, 2016",1,"Not a Fan of New Update I dislike change for the most part, but usually adjust to app updates within days. But not this one. I hate that the pictures are zoomed in. That I can't see the captions I'd written. That I can't access the comments and likes. The ease of scrolling through my memories while eating breakfast is gone. Be more like Instagram and less like Snapchat. Scrolling is better than tapping and swiping and zooming out. (It's asking me to rate this and I have to give it one star in order to post- but it doesn't even deserve one star.)"
3313,Laurenashley2007,"December 29, 2016",5,"Why fix what's not broken? WHY WHY WHY would you mess this app up with this most recent update?? It's absolutely horrible! I can't see half of the past pictures I've posted and all the different swiping confuses and annoys me! Go back to the way it was before, it was perfect. Now you have ruined this app, I'm deleting it."
3314,Mentokskakakcc,"December 29, 2016",1,"Bring back the old Timehop I LOVED how this app's layout used to be, and I thought I was the only one who was extremely frustrated with the new update. I can't even fully experience my old memories because you can't even see captions on pictures, so what's the point?!? I have no idea what I was talking about sometimes. The way the app used to be was a thousand times better. Listen to your users and bring it back, otherwise you will lose a lot of your usership. Back in the day, I would've given this app 5 stars. I can't do that anymore"
3315,Callenleigh,"December 29, 2016",1,HORRIBLE UPDATE Clearly I am not the only one upset by this and I hope that Timehop sees all of our complaints and reverts back to the old layout because this new one is trash. The fact that the pictures are zoomed in is ridiculous and 9 times out of 10 the pictures wont load so I am just scrolling through a bunch of grey pages. I wish I was able to jump to the different years as well instead of having to tap through every photo and post just to get to 8 years ago. Please please please get rid of this ridiculous update.
3316,Auddems,"December 30, 2016",1,"It's okay, I can't share a lot of photos At first I really enjoyed it, and sometimes it shows posts/pictures that Facebook's ""On This Day"" doesn't. Unfortunately iHop crops all of the posts and I can't share most of them because it crops out so much of the picture. I've looked to see if I can have them uncropped but there isn't any options. I will most likely delete this app due to it being a waste of time to look at. Also this new layout is TERRIBLE. It crops everything even more and won't let me share anything that it worth sharing."
3317,Gigemily,"December 30, 2016",1,"Horrible update I've never written a review for an app but I felt like I needed to add my two cents along with everyone else. This recent update is horrible! I don't understand what the developers were trying to accomplish, the design is odd and not user friendly. I feel like I'm missing a lot of pictures when I scroll through, and it's really hard to navigate, it just doesn't make sense! Please change it back, I really enjoy looking back at my FB posts and photos but with this new update, it's frustrating to even try looking at."
3318,Smjones0130,"December 30, 2016",1,"New Update Blows! Why the heck did you change it??? I agree with everyone that the app is not enjoyable to look at anymore. I don't get the whole zoomed in pic thing. I'm also not happy about the framed memories that AREN'T zoomed in so you can't see what they are. And, all the other pics I took on the same day aren't there at all!  It's easier to just scroll down through the dates rather than tapping forward. I'm on day 175 of viewing my Timehop and because if this stupid update it may end up back down to day one!  I vote to change it back!!"
3319,elzblz,"December 30, 2016",1,App update is SO bad that this is my first review This app update is so bad that I actually logged in to write my first review of an app after having the App Store for over 7 years. I can't stand that they are trying to be like snap chat and all pictures are zoomed in and you're u can't see comments or likes on things. Give us an option to switch back or I'm going to remove this from my phone. I get that people hate change and usually complain at first but I've been using this for 2+ weeks and have decided it is horrible
3320,Jessiwar,"April 28, 2015",4,"Great app This is a really great app and it's fun to see all the old things I posted. I just wish it went back farther than 4 years since I just recently got it. It's still a great app! My only complaint is that I don't get the notifications anymore, I used to and all of a sudden it stopped. All my setting in the app and on my phone are the same. If this was fixed I'd give it five stars."
3321,Mrsdiamond,"May 14, 2015",4,"Love it, few bugs need fixed I love the app but I do see a lot of time travel failed for a lot of my pictures. Also I experienced being able to go back to the previous days for a short period of time but then a few days later that option was gone. I would love to be able to see a previous days timehop. Overall awesome app. And I love the new app icon. :)"
3322,Bigboy$ben,"June 25, 2015",5,Cool idea The app gives you the nostalgia of looking at the past without having to solid through the minutia to find it. It just takes a quick look and you can see what you were doing 3 or so years ago and enjoy. Plus the fun fact at the end of historical or pop culture references are fun as well.
3323,D.Ro.,"June 25, 2015",5,"Great memory keeper Love this and how it tracks. Only wish you could view previously viewed days - if you miss one, you don't get to see it again until next year.  Only bummer.  One star off for that.  But especially seeing pics from years gone by makes it completely worth it."
3324,TheMarie,"July 9, 2015",5,"Great, but... Love the app but please, lose the frame-things you can put on shared pics and the like. They're really obnoxious. Also, can we have an option of going to the posts on said social network? I've seen some things I'd honestly want to just delete because it's embarrassing/reminds me of stuff I don't want to remember."
3325,cwmather,"July 21, 2015",4,Multiple pictures I enjoy the app. I like seeing what happened on each day. I just wish I could **upload several pictures** at a time. I don't like going back and forth between Facebook and the app in order to post several things. It fills my newsfeed too much. I end up taking screen shots and just posting several things that way.
3326,RobotsGoRawr,"September 8, 2015",5,"pictures don't always show up a lot of times my pictures won't come up and it'll say, ""didn't reach [insert certain speed]"""
3327,Alove0150,"September 26, 2015",3,"What happen to my pictures I have had time hop for a long time now, however lately it tells me my pictures have been deleted because "" someone it trying to get a job in politics."" It was funny a few times, but now my whole feed is like that. At this point I do not see a reason to keep this app if I can't see my pictures. Can this be fixed please? I really enjoyed looking back at old pictures."
3328,Bhill0220,"November 30, 2015",5,"Discontinue comments please. I love time hop but I don't care to see comment section. Especially with so many being negative. I have no interest in reading profanity and opinions of complete world. Granted, I can only view a few but it never fails to be a distasteful comment. There should be an option to turn off the comment section."
3329,jawrite,"February 19, 2016",3,"Reinstall to fix TimeHop I've had TimeHop for a couple years now. A few months ago it stopped showing Facebook and Insta posts and would only show images added to iCloud. More recently, it was just blank every day. Today I removed the app and reinstalled it and everything works perfectly. I see other people had the same issue. I recommend deleting and uninstalling to get all your TimeHopping back!"
3330,Beavis aka Brian,"September 2, 2013",5,"Awesomeness for those that love history. As a person that loves history this app makes history on a personal level fun. It'll remind you of your past, things you found important to share 1,2,3,4 years ago. Having this app helped me settle a debate with my girlfriend as to when our first date was. Pretty cool deal all together!"
3331,J sprout,"April 10, 2014",3,Use to be better I love this app and use it everyday but I liked it more when it connected to twitter. It was my favorite part but a few months ago it stopped showing my past tweets. And also the picture of the day thing that hasn't been working most of the week so I hope it keeps that. I didnt post on Facebook or Instagram much last year so I without twitter I don't have much to look forward to. Please bring twitter back!
3332,CCoolPhotos,"April 18, 2014",3,Great Idea - App needs work I love this app! Make TBT that much more fun. I am disappointed to find however that many of the Timehops are failing to load and I am not sure why. I am using an iPhone 5S.
3333,ATalcott,"May 2, 2014",5,A great way to remember the past This app makes it wonderfully easy to review pictures from the past. It's great for those of us with kids as it makes it easy to see how your kids have grown and what they were doing on that day in the past. iPhoto integration means that you can review your entire photo library.
3334,Timounyo,"May 23, 2014",5,Intuitive This app is really cool! I've tweeted thousands of things over the years. Seeing where I've been and what I've done is really interesting because one doesn't usually think of the social media aspect of their lives when reflecting on the past. I've only seen 1 days worth of Timehop but I can't wait to see more!
3335,RubyNicole_,"September 15, 2014",5,"Download, you won't regret!! Love this app because I like scrolling back through my social networks to remember things I did/said/thought/liked, but scrolling back can only take you so far. This app does it all for you, day by day w/ cool daily facts as a plus. Very clean and smooth-running app, and I also love the timehop dinosaur and his little heart boxers üòç"
3336,nascarfan315,"October 13, 2014",2,"Great when it works, frustrating when it doesn't I've only had Timehop for a few days. The first day it worked fine. Since then, I've had nothing but problems. When I receive the notification my daily Timehop is ready, I am constantly kicked out of the app. If I want to use Timehop, I have to delete it and reinstall it every time. I really like the concept but I'm not sure it's worth all the trouble. If you could fix it so I wouldn't be continually kicked out of the app, that would be great!"
3337,Acazemiro1234,"February 2, 2015",1,"I completely regret this update. I use this all day long, and I honestly don't even want to look at it now. Im not sure if these changes were supposed to make this easier, but now I just have to relearn how to use the app. I can't see clearly who is following me that I don't follow back. I don't know what that thing is to the right of my story. I don't find it convenient having a bunch of stuff where I should be taking a picture. There should be an option to undo the update, because if this stays this way I'm just getting rid of the entire thing."
3338,Mitchinerd,"February 5, 2015",5,"Facebook App Requirement = No-Go I loved TimeHop until one of the newer updates added the necessity to use the Facebook app to post any Hops to the website.  I have no interest in using that app, so TH had to go. It still gets five stars, though, because of its awesome premise.  I just won't be using it until the developers drop the Facebook app dependency."
3339,Gutterfly72,"March 15, 2015",2,"Fun App, Bad Customer Service. This is a really fun app. Definitely to go back and see what you were doing on this day in years past. This would get a sold 5 stars from me except for the fact that my wife's app gives her the ability to see all of her past likes and comments. Mine does not. I contacted them and never got a returned reply. I like makers who stand behind their product. Don't like being ignored too very much. Don't include a 'contact us' option if you're not going to respond to it."
3340,Dash-2,"January 24, 2013",5,"Wonderful! I've been using their email service for a while, and now their app is amazing! It goes back 5+ years to the things you said and will even send you a notification at the exact minute you said something a year ago. Very fun, download, add as many networks as possible, then sit back and enjoy!"
3341,Save yourself and don't update,"December 29, 2016",1,"Update is horrible This update is so disappointing.  Very hard to navigate. It slaps the ""1 year ago"" logo in the top center of the photo - often on top of peoples' heads/faces. There is no ability to resize the photo, the frames are gone, the borders are gone, every photo is full sized and rectangular with no options. If you have more than one photo from the same day, it makes them small and clustered together on one page, and you can't do anything with them - there is NO option to share them and you can't zoom into to see them."
3342,Maaadddddsss,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worst App Update I've had So disappointed with this new update. I've loved using timehop for years now but honestly this update is making me want to delete it. I loved being able to click on the tweet or fb post and see the original one on the actual site but now all I can do is share and swipe. From what I'm seeing on the reviews I'm not the only one feeling this way. Timehop, you guys really messed up and probably lost a lot of customers. I would suggest you fix this ASAP or looks like your app may not be around for much longer"
3343,Jnbertsch,"January 9, 2017",1,"Terrible since the update I get why Timehop did this to follow suite if Snapchat and instagram stories- but that's why I liked timehop because it wasn't like that. This new update makes it hard to see the full post from previous years, it looks terrible on an iPhone plus screen, and I don't like it. It's awkward and I liked just being able to scroll all my previous posts not this new swiping and clicking stuff. I get so frustrated every time I use it. Please change it or go back to how it used to be. This update is miserable."
3344,ALL4Nana,"January 13, 2017",1,"It's not even fun anymore! I used to love Timehop. It was my favorite app & the first thing I'd look at in the morning! But this new version is just awful! I can rarely see the full pictures, even when I zoom out. Old status updates only show the first few words... there's no way to see the entire update. And you no longer can see comments/captions so I have no idea what any of the pictures are from! What a bummer, Timehop. Bring back the old ""click & scroll"" ways. This swipe thing just makes me claustrophobic & annoyed."
3345,J David Baker,"January 15, 2017",1,"Latest update very disappointing I love looking at my day history. The previous version frequently crashed when there were videos, which was very annoying. The new version hasn't crashed on me yet, but they took away some of my favorite things. Namely: the day of the week is gone, Facebook and Twitter posts are gone, ""then"" and ""now"" feature is gone, going into an album and seeing all the pics is gone... someone could come in behind TimeHop and steal their user base with just these simple features. I know I'd switch."

I've found my new hairdresser"" but then after that one great cut she couldn't quite get it right time after time. Finally, you just can't take it any more and you gotta go find a new one. I'm really not happy with the recent updates. Even the fixes you tried to make after the last update are just not doing it for me. Wether or not I find a new app similar to Timehop, I can't stay. Hopefully you'll change it back, until then I'm deleting this app."
3347,Jesouhaite416,"February 4, 2017",5,"Sorry timehop I usually enjoy looking at timehop but it's frustrating now. Why can't we see the entire picture, and zoom in if we want?

3348,A_Wilkins13,"February 8, 2017",1,"Please go back to the old version! I don't even know where to begin. This update has really been the death of Timehop. I used to love opening the app and seeing past post and pictures from that day. Now it's just become a nuisance. What happened to the then and now side by sides? That's what I loved most especially having a young son and being able to share how much he's changed. But like the previous reviews have said it doesn't seem as if they are interested in changing anything, which is said because I used to love this app üò•"
3349,HK5790,"February 8, 2017",1,"Very poor layout due to recent update The app doesn't work as well as it did with scrolling. Half the time it won't load and I have to continuously click to retry. Having to tap to see each individual memory is annoying and has no flow whatsoever. Go back to scrolling, obviously many people keep telling you that for a reason. Still even with the newest update, scrolling is not back. ""Remember how you wanted to share that video?"" No I don't because I was too busy remembering that I wanted scrolling back. Fix it."

There is a new thing with these ads in the middle of the 1 year ago segment and the 2 years ago segment so maybe it has something to do with the ads but the thing is there is NO way to get rid of the ads. Not even a X to click."
3353,jaberm,"December 24, 2016",1,"They ruined it.. Timehop used to be one of my favorite apps until version 4 came out. The new way of displaying memories suit social networks, but timehop isn't a social network. In the past I used to get a clear view of all the posts where I can easily see each one of them and scroll up and down to the others. I used to be able to identify each, where was it posted and what was the comments and get a quick link to it. Now it looks like a beautiful display of unusable information. Bad navigation and lost usability."
3354,TheLadySlipper,"December 24, 2016",1,"From loved app to deleted app I rarely review, but the disappointment here is profound. I loved this app and looked forward to checking it daily. However, the newest overhaul is a complete and utter failure. You took something that was working great (loved the videos added at the bottom!) and turned it into a confusing mess! Why ""press and hold"" to zoom out?? Why would I want to see a tiny super zoomed portion of the image at the first???? Today it was just what I could only describe as a seizer of random photos across my screen. Deleting one of my once favorite apps."
3355,TravelGrrl27,"December 24, 2016",5,"The Update Ruined the App Totally disappointed after the update to the app. I liked being able to just scroll up and down through my history, and easily see all the likes, comments, etc. The new format doesn't work well with the posts/pictures"

You can no longer see captions on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook pictures which is half of the memory. Also the new format just makes it extremely confusing. I liked the old format, it was easy, fun to see the progression, and I could swipe back and forth between memories. Please bring the old version back, or at least include the option of switching between formats."
3357,Thpitre,"December 26, 2016",1,"Can we Timehop to before the update? A great app with a now flawed design. The new update doesn't allow for a general overview of your past, but now makes you click from photo to photo. The photos are zoomed in though, and sometimes you don't even realize that you aren't seeing what's cropped out. There is no easy way to quickly go back to the beginning or scroll through your memories. They lost a ""dashboard"" that allows you to navigate your memories how you want, instead forcing the user to go from photo to photo."
3358,Award1675,"December 27, 2016",1,Timehop Let me start by saying I've never written an app review but the new Timehop update is so bad I felt I must tell the app developers. When I logged on to do so I quickly realized that there are 100's if not 1000's of users who obviously feel the same. 
3359,GatorChick2416,"December 28, 2016",1,"Awful Update! I agree with these other users. There are so many things that just do not work with this update. I am probably going to stop looking at this app because of this change. I loved being able to see my comments on the various status updates. Not sure why that is no longer an option. Also, the zoomed in auto feature is annoying and I have to zoom out for every picture. Please change it back or at least give us the option to see our comments!"
3360,TeKaT,"January 23, 2015",3,"Fun app. Works well. It takes you back to you posts on this day from previous years. It's fun to see what was going on then, and you can reshape, although only as a photo, so links from the original post are not clickable. "

I do wish there was a way to look up/search for dates. I know that may go against the main idea but make it where you can look it up but you can't share it until the day of? Just an idea. Overall love it!

The app is great for seeing what I did as far as 5 yrs back but when I see what I shared or posted and click on it to bring it up it says page can not be displayed. If it's there in a little frame why is it not able to be seen bigger ? You need to fix this feature cause I would like to be able to load it when I click on what I posted
3363,ChrisLC,"June 7, 2015",3,"Fun app but really needs one feature This is a fun little app for reminiscing. However, it would probably get a 5 star rating from me if each Timehop post would also contain a link to the original post on Facebook or wherever. "
3364,Sarbearr321,"June 10, 2015",5,Off center on my device I haven't been able to post anything to Twitter since the new update because the app is off center and I can't click share. also I can't change the border on when I try to share on Instagram or Facebook. I hope you guys can fix this because I really love this app.
3365,Lokipoe,"June 19, 2015",2,"Could be better I enjoy the general idea if this app, but I don't understand why the original caption doesn't post with the picture (if you share it).  That context is so essential for most pictures. Why would that either be attached automatically or be an option??  Also, the ""1 year ago"" banner should be moveable or adjustable.  (Sometimes it covers faces because it's always at the top.) Overall, this app just needs to add more control setting options for the user."
3366,Crashes and slow,"August 20, 2015",5,"Love this app! I love looking back at things I posted years ago and seeing how much things have changed! Every once in a while the app doesn't work and says ""photo did not reach 88 mph"" and nothing loads, but those are almost always times where I don't have good signal. Would definitely recommend!"
3367,MusikofMeeko,"September 20, 2015",4,"Fun to see your history Love this little application! It's fun to go back and see your own history and have those ""oh yeah!"" Moments. Only reason it gets 4 stars is bc recently it hasn't been able to pull all of the pictures, however this could be due to the fact that Facebook has now made their own ""time hop"" in which case, shame on you face book."
3368,Bexykins43,"October 24, 2015",4,What happened to Twitter posts?? For at least 3 days now I haven't been able to see any of my previous Twitter posts in the last few years and I know for a fact I was tweeting since this time last year the Giants were in the postseason and I tweeted like crazy during that time... I've disconnected and reconnected my Twitter to Timehop and it didn't fix the issue... Please fix asap!!!
3369,Pbhz,"January 17, 2016",4,"Time Capsule I love everything this App, I personally only have one Thing I wish would let you have the choice to share the comments Below our post but Besides that It is funny to see how much has changed one day, then the next day you realize your doing/watching the same thing you were doing 1,2,3 years ago. Great entertainment, recommend to anyone!"
3370,Silliebean514,"October 22, 2012",5,"Love timehop! I am always excited to getting the notification that my day in history is available! The app makes it really easy to share my favorite memories with my friends, even those that don't use timehop. I love the way the app looks... it's very fun and whimsical and all the features are easy to understand. Go timehop!"
3371,Deabanana,"November 10, 2012",2,"Disappointed I've never posted a review of an app before but I wanted to chime in here. Like most here I have been receiving timehop emails for a while and was so excited to see the app. Unfortunately, the photos rarely appear. I emailed with tech support twice and they just told me to log in and log back out. It's not working. Even after the update the photos appeared for one day and the next they were missing. Very disappointed that what would be my favorite app doesn't work well. Please fix."
3372,Kyle Poz,"May 27, 2014",4,"More Social I really love this app! The dinosaur is amazing. BTW, what is his name? The only problem I have with it is that it does not connect with all social media. For example: it has Facebook and Twitter, those are the main two. Maybe get snapchat, tumbler, google +, and vine. To me, it seems as if developers from Facebook made it and did not reach out to other companies to partner with. Other than this, I love it!!!!!"
3373,CookMom03,"May 31, 2014",3,Fun & neat app but.... I love this app and how I can look back so easily on what was going on a year ago 2yrs 3yrs.... It's very neat but when it has pictures attached to my old posts they won't show up! It's a glitch in the app so I never get to see the pictures that go along with the posts! Another thing that would be so cool and fun is if the app not only showed you past posts from that day but if you could search old posts with key words and or dates!!!
3374,Mzlashelle,"August 26, 2014",3,"Ok Ive seen this app in my newsfeed a lot and I think the concept is great... Only thing I don't like is the fact that when you go to sign in it gives you the option to edit access to certain things, but when you do edit it tells you that you have to allow access to everything or you cant log in and essentially cant use the app. Why give the option of editing only to say you cant edit?"
3375,Jbhails,"September 6, 2014",4,"Recent Minor Glitches I absolutely love Timehop! This App is perfect! But recently it hasn't been loading the last few years of pictures and posts and every time I ""tap to reload"" nothing happens. I'm sure a quick update could fix this problem! I would really like to see everything like I was in the beginning when I first downloaded the app. Thanks!"
3376,Skydivesre,"September 28, 2014",5,"Love love love I love that I can start my day with a trip down memory lane & a reminder of how far I have come in the past 1, 3 or even 5 years. I just wish they would make the last week available so that if I get distracted and do miss a day I can go back to see it without having to wait another 365 days! So simple but so fun!"
3377,Kittyscratches,"October 25, 2014",5,"Virtual Diary This app is just fun! Reading some poor reviews makes me wonder if people expect too much from it. Definitely best for those who are heavy social media users otherwise it doesn't give the info. I've enjoyed it tho, so interesting to see what and where I was up to a few  years back. "
3378,katlin nicole!!!!,"October 29, 2014",3,Good but needs improving Don't get me wrong the app is great but there are a lot of improvements that need to be done every time I try to go on to in the morning when my notification comes up it says Time travel error and when I try to refresh it it just keeps saying that it's like it'll only work over Wi-Fi and I have my cellular data on I wish they would fix this problem I love this app but it's really annoying
3379,lakeeriemaniac,"November 23, 2014",3,"Eh It's very fun to have BUT for the past several weeks it's been getting the dates wrong. I know for a fact that some of these pictures happened two or three years ago but it tells me last year. I am 100% positive a recent picture I saw on there was from 2012 but it told me it was last year 2013. So, it's very angering when I want to enjoy my past but they can't even do a simple calculation as a couple years ago"
3380,nybble73,"October 22, 2012",5,Just install it already. Do you like yourself? Then do yourself a favor and install TimeHop already.
3381,Kimduff1,"January 10, 2017",1,Update is horrible. Updated for latest update:The update is still horrible-go back to the older format or I will end up deleting. The zoomed pictures are an annoyance. It is not an improvement.
3382,Manisha89,"January 14, 2017",1,"HATE THE NEW LAYOUT Who came up with this new design? Why would you think this was a good idea??? Who wants to sit there and tap through memories??? It's beyond annoying! The previous design was 1billion times better! There aren't even enough words in the human language to describe my disdain for this new layout! Change it back please!! Or I'll be forced to delete Timehop! You turned something into an enjoyable trip down memory lane into an obnoxious thumb war with my screen. No offense whomever came up with this new design needs to be fired, i'm sorry but I'm not sorry :'("
3383,Julanso,"January 16, 2017",5,"New version is awful I have enjoyed timehop for a long time, but this new version is absolutely frustrating. Not something I will keep using for much longer. I keep hoping the updates will fix our complaints but not happening. Too bad as it was one of my favorite apps. :/"
3384,Lolomclolo,"January 21, 2017",1,"Great app, horrible update! What is it with app developers? Why do they take something good and make it bad? Do they need more to do? I could recommend some books to read, maybe take up knitting, anything...just leave a good thing well enough alone!"
3385,Kaila156784,"March 7, 2017",1,"HATE the new update I don't normally rate apps but I dislike this new version so much I had to give it a review. The page that has multiple pictures on it is not appealing to the eye and I can't share any of the pictures on it. I can't share videos. Not happy that the ""now and then"" option isn't available anymore. If you change the app for the better I will change my rating."
3386,Mgc331,"March 26, 2017",5,"Newer is not always better. I much more prefer the older version with the ability to scroll through memories rather than click through memories. Also, it would be nice to be able to save the picture without the added time stamp (ie 1 Year Ago)."
3387,Shannon Drullinger,"May 2, 2017",2,"Annoying changes Aside from resetting my ""days in a row"" seemingly every other day, despite looking at the blasted thing every morning, it's not a terrible app. I mean, unless you count all the annoying changes that happen almost weekly. I get wanting to be streamlined and user friendly and fresh, but stop ignoring users that tell you the changes are obnoxious. Get rid of the bugs. Go back to what works. New isn't always improved and it isn't always better."
3388,Diimplez_,"May 5, 2017",5,Love It Not sure why so many folks are complaining but I absolutely LOVE the app. It bring up photos that got erased of my daughter it also shows my growth from my Facebook stats. All my photos load and the app moves pretty fast with or without wifi. I can also save my photos as well as do a then and now photo. LOVE IT!
3389,jasonandhart,"August 26, 2017",5,"Love timehop! I don't know why the reviews are so negative. I have timehop set to show ALL my photos and I check it every single day. It's fun seeing which photos I took on which days. Much better than just using ""on this day"" on Facebook, which only shows Facebook posts. I like seeing all my photos so timehop is my favorite."
3390,Saintsfans1,"December 30, 2016",1,"Newest update ruined this app Up until I updated Timehop last week, it was one of my favorite apps.  After the update, i no longer feel that way.  I dislike having to resize the pictures in order to see them, and not being able to see the comments is a game changer.  I really enjoyed reading the comments on the old pictures and posts.  The app worked perfectly before the newest update, so I don't know why they decided to completely rework it, but in this case they took a fantastic app and ruined it!"
3391,JLeno90,"January 1, 2017",1,"Disappointing I'm incredibly disappointed with this app update. I religiously check my timehop every day and can't stand to open it now. I don't like how the pictures flash so quickly and how you have to press on it to see the entire view. Half the fun was seeing what other people said and now as far as I can see, that's no longer a possibility. Go back to the old app. I read your explanation and hope you reconsider. I'm all for change if it's for the better but this is almost as bad as the Windows 8 os was for Microsoft. Wake up Timehop!"
3392,Curry236923,"January 1, 2017",1,"This version is terrible Ok I've never written a review before for any ap but I hate this new version that much that I'm hoping timehop will take note and make changes. It is absolutely ridiculous that in order to see my picture posts, I have to hold down the photo for it to zoom out! Why can't you just display it at its original size? Ugh! That's the worst. I'm just logging into Facebook now to see my posts from the past. No need to use timehop if I can't easily see my posts. Please make changes soon or else I'll delete the app."
3393,DerindaS,"January 3, 2017",1,"""New"" Upgrade?? Totally DISLIKE the new upgrade! I do not like the larger picture.  Many times it opens on a picture that is enlarged, therefore you do not see the whole picture. Then you have to work with it to try and see the whole picture. I do not like swiping to the side for the next picture. Keep the app scrolling down like all the other social media apps. And what is up with the number count at the bottom?? Counting how many times you check TimeHop? That is not necessary either. The fun facts at the end of the scroll are cool."
3394,haayfayee,"January 5, 2017",1,"Ugh I very rarely write reviews, especially if it has to do with an app or something technology related, but I'm going to say what everyone seems to have already said: I miss the old Timehop. "
3395,MedlinInYerCamp,"January 5, 2017",1,"Hate the new update Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, just adding my voice to the masses. TERRIBLE UPDATE. Why did they have to change the layout?!  Why does every picture automatically show up zoomed in?  Half of my pictures don't even load anymore and my videos hardly ever work.  Not to mention how annoying it is to have to tap through everything instead of the old scrolling option.  I don't even want it anymore, especially since most of my memories show up on Facebook anyway."
3396,rawrxrissa,"January 6, 2017",2,"Disappointed Normally don't write reviews. Don't completely hate the new update. Most photos aren't portrait (usually square or landscape) so I don't know why the developers thought it was a good idea to make the height of a photo auto fill the screen instead of the width, but whatever.  I think it was impractical and miss the old format, but I can live. What I don't like is that the new update made me lose my 160+ day streak. I know I didn't miss, the app even updated the count the day before."
3397,Devamy23,"January 7, 2017",3,Love it and hate it This used to be one of my absolute favorite apps. Within the past few months I have noticed that the app crashes a lot when trying to look at all the memories. I even did the update today and I still can't even get through my memories from 1 year ago. My phone screen will just go black then bring me back to my home screen. I'm just tired of it crashing!!
3398,MissChelza,"January 7, 2017",5,"New upgrade is terrible This app used to be so much fun!  Simple easy scroll with the number of years ago the photo was.... since the update took on a persona of Snapchat, it's terrible. Click through all photos one by one, and you're lucky if they load! "
3399,Rdhddramaqn,"January 7, 2017",5,"Did like it until they made awful changes!! I loved Timehop until they made the most recent updates.. they made it more difficult to use, more frustrating, less aesthetic, and they took away the ""Then and Now"" feature which was a favorite.. not.. happy.."
3400,Luomae,"July 9, 2016",5,"Soooo slowwwww There was a time, when TimeHop was awesome...then updates came and now...wait for it...wait for it...slow and frustrating. "
3401,Cgreene0630,"December 15, 2016",2,"Time hop app Big thing I don't like about this app is the fact is first when will bring up a statement you made on that day a few years ago but leave out the picture or video you're commenting on! Then on the other hand it shows a picture you posted but when you share it, it leaves out the comment you had posted with the pic at the time you originally posted it, even though it shows the comment on Time Hop! This needs to be fixed!!"
3402,Meggers9916,"December 23, 2016",1,"Update üëéüèº I LOVE timehop. I've been using it for years. I'm that sappy emotional person so I love logging in everyday to relive memories. However this new update is TERRIBLE. I honestly dislike the update so much that I think I'm done using this app, which makes me sad. The tap to move on feature, the ultra zoomed in pictures, the inability to click on one picture when multiple are shown, and the lack of captions posted with the pictures make it so unpleasant and hard to follow. Until they make some more changes, unfortunately I'll be deleting this app."
3403,NahlaYSL,"December 25, 2016",1,"New update is bad! First review, btw.  I love Timehop and look forward to going through my timehop every day.  However, the new update from Dec 23rd has ruined my enjoyment of the app.  All the pictures are zoomed in and looks awkward and unflattering.  I can no longer see comments and likes from each photo/post.  I cannot see all my photos and posts from the same day anymore.  This new update is really difficult to use.  I may have to delete the app from my phone if it doesn't go back to its original layout--scrolling up and down."
3404,Kcj185,"December 25, 2016",5,Cannot share videos anymore!! This update is a fine however you cannot share videos anymore which is a huge bummer!!! Sometime sharing videos is one of my most favorite things that time hop had to offer!!! Sharing videos needs to be brought back!!!!!!
3405,ninzmarie,"December 26, 2016",1,"new updates is THE WORST this is awful. why can't your app just be unique to you, why change it to be like snapchat and instagram stories?? you can't read any comments on past events (which was the best part of the app) half of my pictures you can't zoom in or out on and they keep changing colors on the ones i've edited, which is completely unnecessary. whoever spearheaded this update needs to go or possibly do some research because no one could possibly like this update. fix it or you lose another subscriber"
3406,Geek_girl_33,"December 27, 2016",1,"87 day streak about to end The new update has made the app useless. Moving through the app is confusing and surprisingly difficult to understand since all you should really need to do is swipe, correct? What's with the tapping? And the comments are gone. Didn't you guys take those away before only to bring them back because the fans missed them? "
3407,Boogaloobabe2,"December 27, 2016",1,"Worst update in the history of updates Like many others this is the first review I've done for an app, which says a lot about how upset your user base is. I will simply echo the sentiment of the dozens of reviews before me and say that this new version is unusable. Where previously Timehop was the best part of my day, now I'm on the verge of deleting it because of how awful it is. You've taken away every meaningful part of what made this app great. Listen to your users on this one and go back to the old design, or you might just be left without any."
3408,Traysaysumms,"December 28, 2016",2,"What happened? I loved the timehop app for a long time, especially when we got the ability to see old comments. Now that's gone??? We only had that ability for a short time and it was honestly my favorite feature. Honestly, I can't see myself using the app much long with some of the ""updates"" that have been made. Maybe I'll check back in to it when I see that the app has a new update. Hopefully the constant zoomed in images will go away too..."
3409,Katholmes9,"December 28, 2016",2,"Update I have been using timehop for years now, but I will be deleting soon if there is not a new update to fix these terrible changes with the last update. I have to unzoom all of my photos. Most photos don't show the caption, and I know there is one thanks to Facebook memories. I don't like having to go left to right, I much preferred scrillling up and down. I understand that not everyone will like a new update, but this seems to be widely hated and clearly timehop needs to fix it."
3410,ShadyluvsNook,"March 6, 2015",5,"A look back at your life! LOVE IT! I love this app so much because everyday it lets me look back at where as was on that exact date and makes me appreciates all I have now because of all the people and places a was a few years ago!!!! I love this app, it rocks.... Plus the little time shop dinosaur's comments alway makes my smile ""NE1CURR"", ""NO1CURR"".... Just wanna say ""ICURR""... And I love it!!!!"
3411,Nicolegn930,"May 11, 2015",5,One of my favorite apps!! I truly enjoy being able to look back through pictures and comments and see how far I've come. It's memories I'm able to rekindle with friends and share with others that may have not been in my life at that time. Thanks for making such an amazing app.
3412,Siriuslyderanged,"May 19, 2015",4,"Fun but sometimes sad... Yeah it's really interesting to see things from the past (seeing as now I've been on social media for a decade), but every so often I am reminded of stuff that really sucked. For such a simple concept, this app can make you get real introspective very quickly. Very functional though with few errors or crashes. Just prepare yourself for the occasional emotional curve ball."
3413,AmyJoGrace,"May 20, 2015",4,"Enjoy the history Love looking back and reflecting on all that's happened over the years. I've found once the dates were off (said my grandson was born 4 years ago but he's two) and for a while pictures weren't loading, but that seems to have been resolved. Overall, the experience is worth forgiving the minor technical difficulties."
3414,buschschwick,"June 3, 2015",2,"Great Idea - forced Facebook I used to love this app. I use a lot of social media except for Facebook so I cut the cord with them, and now I can't access Timehop. They make you sign in with Facebook no matter what which is extremely annoying. What's even worse is I still get push alerts with my past events so it still KNOWS and pulls in my data but I just can't access it without Facebook. "
3415,Halierojo,"August 10, 2015",4,"Facebook statuses & Twitter I wish it went more into detail when it came to Facebook because I can go on the Facebook app and actually see what I posted compared to the two or three things timehop has shown me. Also when I want to see what the conversation was on Twitter that I had, it takes me to this weird profile instead of showing the conversation."
3416,primowalker1960,"December 20, 2015",5,"This is one of my favorite apps! As a parent of grown children, a grandparent, and dog owner and breeder, being able to see pictures of the one's I love that I haven't seen in years is just wonderful.  If you have years worth of photos online, this is the perfect app for you.  It will make you smile every time you get an update."
3417,Ejworsham,"December 23, 2015",2,"Used to like it... I used to love checking my Timehop account everyday because I think it's interesting to see where you were and what you were doing in the past. However, I started getting notifications that Person A/B/C has viewed a photo their tagged in on my Timehop and after realizing how many random people (most of whom I don't talk to anymore) are getting those notifications about me...it's so embarrassing!!! No thanks, Timehop. I will stick to On This Day on Facebook until this is removed."
3418,JW7379,"February 20, 2016",4,"Fun reminders of past posts It's fun to see posts from years past, and it's cool that it pulls from various platforms (for me, it's FB, Twitter, and Instagram). The only thing I don't like is the share feature, which can be slow and clunky. It also slaps a Timehop logo on your photos and posts (bleh), but the additional text or graphics you can add are pretty lame. Minor complaint though."
3419,DrRegina,"May 2, 2016",1,"I used to love this app. I used to love this app but the latest update is terrible. Please do not hijack the sound settings on my phone to broadcast obnoxious music at full blast that is not within my control! I thought maybe there was a setting to turn it off, but nope, no such luck. Also why would you disable picture saving? I'm not sure what additional users you were going for in this latest update but I don't think you are keeping me, and from the looks of the latest reviews I'm not the only one who feels this way."
3420,AnimeMandi22,"August 31, 2014",4,"It's pretty good.... Except that it pops up with the stuff from the wrong date. First time it did, I thought it was a glitch but it does it very frequently. If I posted something on the second then it should show up on the second not the first. Most people's posts on various sites are date related not day of the week related. It would be nice if this was fixed."
3421,Jaxi 133,"September 21, 2014",4,Fun but could use more options. I love this app! Always excited to see what the next day will say. 
3422,Jmsaop,"October 23, 2014",3,"Love it, when it works... I really enjoy this app, but more often than not, it says ""time travel failed."" Even after it sends me a message describing what last years post was, it still will not work. I just installed the bug fix update, & now it won't even log me in. I hope all the bugs get fixed, because I really like the app. It would be nice if you could scroll through days, as others suggested. :)"

3426,CollagebabyK,"January 26, 2015",5,Update Ruined The App I absolutely LOVED this app! I still love the fact that I can take a trip down memory lane every single day..but I am really disappointed in the newest version/update. Sharing anything has become such a chore. It used to be so easy! Put the app back to its original glory and I'll change my 3 star rating to a 5!
3427,Giggly3lmo,"February 1, 2015",1,"Hating it I'm really starting to hate this app because I remember I can easily just tap the share button and that's it, then the memories are shared under one album! Not to the point where I have to keep going back and forth with each individual sharing of logging in and logging out of Facebook so my bill won't be charged every time I have to log into Facebook on my iPhone. I have tried to use TimeHop to see if it was different for the iPad but no it's not! I'm getting really annoyed with the update. I liked it better the way it was!"
3428,The bestiest game,"February 21, 2015",5,"Great way to relive the past Everything you've posted it shows you. Good things that bring back good memories that even spark old friendships again. And bad things that have shown how much you've grown. And let's not forget the the funniest thing of all, a the embarrassing things you use to say, look like and do."
3429,XalAhlEme,"February 27, 2015",5,"Awesome! What mother doesn't like taking a stroll down memory lane and seeing pictures of their little ones from years ago? This amazing app does that for you, everyday! Super easy and super cool! Even has feature where you can see a side by side picture of then and now! How cool is that? I love timehop! Makes every day begin with a smile!"
3430,Jojofantasy,"November 28, 2012",3,"Timehop Great app, but still some work to do. I get push notifications telling me that my next day is ready but it's still on the day before even after I refresh. Takes till the evening to show the correct date. Would like to see it be a little more interactive too like seeing a feed of my friends posts without having to share and keeping previous posts up. Could be great with some creativity!"
3431,Seizsar,"February 26, 2014",5,"My fav app This is such a great app! I get to reminisce over the years : my pregnancies, my kids, vacations, jobs, the things that bothered me before and I now laugh about..."

I've been on social media for 10 years and would love to timehop to some of my first posts. The app is good, it works, is easy to use, but it's only slightly entertaining. Let it go further back in time, and make it available on more devices and I'll give it more stars."

Whenever I open the app, I get a ""missing key path"" error message. I still get push notifications and emails, but there's no way for me to view my time hop for the day. I've discovered that this is a common problem based on other reviews below. Hopefully Timehop releases a fix for this soon! I really miss this app!"
3434,KnLMom,"July 31, 2014",4,"Fun to flashback I generally really like this app! Being able to see what my kids were up to a few years back is sweet, and it's also fun to see what else I was posting about. I wish there was more freedom in going through various dates and not being stuck on the one the app pushes out. (It's a day late it seems.) Overall, fun and easy to use. Love being able to post on IG!"
3435,katkins410,"January 14, 2017",1,"I used to like Timehop. I'm a strong believer in ""if isn't broken, don't fix it"". Who designed this update? They need a new job because app design certainly isn't their calling. It was so easy to view everything with thumb scroll, but now that I have to swipe/tap/do a fancy twist of the wrist to move on it's super annoying. I hardly ever review apps, but I came here hoping and praying I wasn't the only one who hates this update. Clearly I'm not. I understand change takes time, but this is terribly inefficient! Please do us all a favor and change it back."
3436,Kidney Doc,"January 28, 2017",1,"Hate update! Unpleasant to look at! New update is terrible, it's a pain to scroll through, the zoomed in photos don't make sense (I want them all zoomed out), so much more difficult to use this ap. Really visually disrupting and unpleasant to use."
3437,Sarai_nocole,"February 25, 2017",5,"Timehop review I love timehop I have had an amazing time using it! The only thing I miss in the new updater it the then and now filter along with the other different filters. I absolutely love the way they have the dinosaur at the end and he has something new to say everyday. I currently have a 92 dayvstreak, and can't wait to get to 100."
3438,Tony-0274,"April 16, 2017",2,"Fun and depressing I love how the app allows you to see what happened on that day in your social media life especially when it was 8 or 9 years ago. I don't like how you can open the app, see all your memories, get your new number for the days you've checked and it tells you you've never checked it yesterday. The app is horrible in remembering you checked it the day before. I've had 2 streaks broken now and I'm thinking of just forgetting this app all together."
3439,Tsaltman,"April 18, 2017",1,"Needs some bugs fixed Every few days the app lies and claims I missed a day and my streak has ""frozen over"" and that I need to watch a video to unfreeze it. If they need ppl to watch videos for sponsorship do it another way. Better yet get rid of the streak because I was almost at a 300 day streak when they did the initial update back at the beginning of the year & lost my streak because of it üò° I use Timehop every day for YEARS so to tell me I ""missed a day"" & my streak is frozen is bs. Now that Facebook also looks back there's really no point in Timehop. ü§î"
3440,Meghan2493,"December 27, 2016",1,"Disappointed..... I loved Timehop before this recent update. I could tap on a picture and make it bigger when I wanted too. Now the pictures are too big and I can't see the captions that went with the picture/post.  On Christmas Day, it put pictures into a collage and I couldn't tap on a particular picture to make it bigger without it taking me to the page to post the collage on my wall and it still didn't make the pictures any bigger.   I hope the old version is restored.....this update wasn't the best idea. üòï"
3441,Rjmulson,"December 27, 2016",1,"The new update is no good :/ Overall I've loved timehop! I used to wake up and check it first thing in the morning, I love looking back over the years it all my photos and memories. After this new update, I find myself avoiding it completely. It's so frustrating to look through, I don't enjoy it at all. I'd rather just look through my memories on the Facebook app. Now I wait until I get a reminder, and check it just so I don't lose my streak (225 days woohoo!) I get what you were trying to do, but I'd much rather have the told timehop back."
3442,MrsGilkins,"December 29, 2016",1,"Wish I could give 0 stars I'm all for keeping things current and updating apps but the new update is a huge bust. Just because Snapchat does it doesn't mean anyone else should. I hate tapping things and the zoom function. I don't even truly understand how to use it. I loved seeing old memories, especially of my kids when they were babies but forget it. It's so user un-friendly that I'm over it. I used to tell people to go download timehop...now I'm done using it until they fix the giant piece of crap that it has now become."
3443,BJazzy24,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worst. Update. Ever. I never rate apps but with the most recent update being so maddening, I needed to vent and get it out so I can stop yelling at it every day. "
3444,Air Boat,"January 2, 2017",1,"Go back to old Time Hop Like others said, I've never written a review for an app before, but felt the need with this new update. It's just plain awful. If there are several pictures from the same day it only picks a random 2-3 and you can't zoom in or see any comments on the pictures (which is half the fun). The click to zoom out feature makes no sense.. not sure why anyone thought that was a good idea. The old time hop layout was easy to use and made sense. This update makes me not want to use it anymore."
3445,Diana Laspina,"January 5, 2017",1,"It is just so so bad. Timehop used to be my favorite app- I used to check it every morning and reflect on the day using it. The new update took that away from me and all of the other users of Timehop. I'm really really sad to see it go, it used to be just fine. I'm deleting it until there's any other word from the design team other than ""soon"" :) on twitter. It's ridiculous and I feel like you all do not care. You have a lot of redemption to do if you want to prove to your fans that you do in fact care about what we have to say."
3446,Milamrl,"January 6, 2017",1,"Bring back the old format!!! I never write reviews but the update to this app is terrible! My husband is not on social media and I installed this app on his phone so he could see what has essentially turned into a baby book for our two little boys. Opening Timehop every morning was one of the best parts of our day.... and now it's not!! :( PLEASE bring back the old format. With this one, we miss some of the pictures and it is not user friendly at all. Please pay attention to all of these reviews and bring back the old timehop!!!!"
3447,Palmfam,"January 6, 2017",5,Go back!!! I despise the new update!!! When there is a video or multiple pics in one group you can't share. In the old version you could see the group one individually and share a video. Please go back to the old version or at least let us share in the new version
3448,Andy Rose,"January 8, 2017",1,"One step forward, two steps back I didn't like the update before Christmas and when I saw that you guys finally fixed it I was excited to use the app again. But...you didn't fix it, you made it worse. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy I can finally see comments on posts again, but it's still tap through and not scrolling which is what I originally liked. And now I don't even get to see the full status update/tweet. It's cut off! Please go back to what you were before and stop trying to be apps that you're not!"
3449,Patronus01,"January 11, 2017",1,"I'd give no stars if I could. The latest update barely fixed all the issues the redesign has caused. I still can't read Twitter or FB posts without have to swipe up to share, because they're zoomed in so big and I don't see where the comments are added back. Plus, the whole swiping thing to begin with is stupid and ridiculous. I much preferred being able to scroll through my timeline. It was faster, easier, and I could see everything I wanted to see. I'm really considering just deleting the app altogether."
3450,kjvp,"April 29, 2016",1,"Retrovideo ruins the experience Autoplay on a video is one thing, but having the sound default to on?! Not even Facebook does that, and they let you turn off autoplay completely if you want to. This is a disruptive and annoying new feature, and combined with the app crashing and late loading issues that are so common these days, it's starting to make me doubt the value of TimeHop. At this rate I may as well just use the Facebook history feature and go back through my Instagram history manually when I'm curious."
3451,Let the babies nap,"April 29, 2016",1,"No videos please Here's a time hop for you.  Remember back in the '90s when everyone was new at the Internet and people thought it was a good idea to surprise you with music that started playing when you opened up a website on your work computer and you had to scramble to hit mute before your boss realized you were browsing the web instead of working?  Well, I have kids now, and surprise music is still a terrible idea.  At least give us the option to turn it off after one time ruining our morning."
3452,Planetstrider,"April 29, 2016",2,"Entertaining Before Most Recent Update It's very entertaining to see the past and notice all the posts from friends not acquainted with anymore and all the dumb things you used to say. However the new Retro Video ""feature"" is absolutely terrible. It bypasses phone sound settings (thanks for that when using at work), plays automatically, loops, and plays things that are not related to you. Let us turn it off, opt out, mute permanently, or better yet, just remove it."
3453,kaepora-gaebora,"May 30, 2016",3,A few suggestions I have old accounts for both Instagram and twitter. I'd like to be able to hook up both accounts without logging in and out everyday. 
3454,KrollMul,"October 2, 2016",5,"Love it I do really like this app, but I just wanted to comment to say that it would be even better if you could connect multiple Instagram accounts. I know a lot of people who have more than one account, myself included, and being able to connect them all to timehop would be awesome!"
3455,jeffgibby13,"December 24, 2016",1,"Great app, horrendous update Calling this an update is an insult. An update implies enhanced user friendliness, a better experience, and more functionality. Timehop found a way to do exactly the opposite of all those. This current form is what most apps would change from to something more functional and user friendly. I love using the app, but hate the way the pictures appear, how burst photos automatically cycle through like a gif, how you have to go through every picture in a year to get to the next year, and the list goes on."
3456,teamgeotrax,"December 25, 2016",1,"Terrible since update Timehop is super dumb now. You used to be able to scroll through years, now you have to tap through individual photos one by one. Do you know how long that can take just to get through a single day?!? You can't swipe or select to skip through faster. You have to tap one by one by one. Plus, ever photo is automatically zoomed in. Every single one, even if they are formatted horizontal. Worst update ever. I can't even look through Christmas pictures because this update makes it so pathetic."
3457,camwennn,"December 25, 2016",1,"Horrible Update Please, please, please fix this update! This layout is too confusing and inconvenient. I do not like how the pictures are zoomed in and have no caption or no context of where it came from. Why would I want to keep zooming out when you can provide the picture nicely?! I also do not like how you cannot click the twitter icon and take you to the tweet. I want to see who thought I was funny three years ago! I used to enjoy timehop and reading about my poor life decisions but now I have a hard time reading the entire app :("
3458,Bbmari70,"December 27, 2016",1,"Not happy with the new update I have been using this app for quite some time. I know that changes will have to be made and not everyone will like them. The new updates has taken away the purpose of having the memories and comments that go with it, which you can't even see anymore. I especially don't like when you have posted multiple photos and it just clumps them all up together. I can't just select a photo and share. Not happy with all the new change as they were not for the better."
3459,Lizowar,"December 27, 2016",1,"Such a weird update Three last version of Timehop was giving me issues by not showing me the full captions for pictures, just the first sentence, and clicking comments only worked half the time. They fixed that by getting rid of captions and comments entirely??? Not to mention having to hold to zoom every single thing, only to see it's a picture of a building or something I took seven years ago that I have no idea the context of because there are no captions. I've given up on maintaining my hundred plus day streak."
3460,TKE122,"July 6, 2015",4,"Then and Now I agree-please bring back ""Then and now."" I thought I was just doing something wrong, or that it was just a special thing not offered on 4th of July, but it's gone! It's great when you have kids-and I wanted to show them last year to this year, and I couldn't! Other than that, it's fun to see what's on Facebook and in my phone on these days."
3461,TreeKHLCE2103,"July 16, 2015",5,"Love this app! I love, love, love this app!  I enjoy reminiscing and browsing through pictures from the past. Lately I've noticed that a good chunk of my pictures are not loading & therefore in able to be viewed. I've tried deleting & redownloading the app but no success. Im hoping they'll be able to fix this bug soon."
3462,Emojilover264,"August 8, 2015",4,Great app but... This is a great app but you should be able to sign up with your email too! Also it would be great if in the next update that you could add more apps in the history! If you could add flipagram and maybe your snapchat story from a year ago or Pinterest or any other app like that! Please please please try and make this possible!  Other than that it's great!
3463,Dizzy1985,"September 8, 2015",5,Doesn't want to stay connected to facebook For some reason lately the app won't load anything from Facebook. All it says is that it's not connected but when I go to settings on both the app and my phone it says it's connected.  I've disconnected and reconnected it multiple times.
3464,Lebfzs,"October 18, 2015",5,Love it! I really love this app!!! It's a great way to see pictures that I don't look back at often and see who I was with on that day in the past. I only wish there was a feature to go back to yesterday's pictures and Fun fact. I hate that I have to wait a year to match them all up again.
3465,Joccy16,"October 24, 2015",5,"Not working I haven't been able to see my Twitter history for days. I haven't changed anything on my Twitter and I tried turning the Twitter option off and on, hasn't worked. Not sure if it's my error or there's something wrong with the app. This has never happened to me before, though."
3466,Silk55,"December 2, 2015",5,"Love, just wish push notifications still worked I love this app.  However, when I got my new phone, I stopped getting push notifications to remind me to look at my memories every day, even though I made sure they're on.  With that feature working I could give 5 stars."
3467,AHues,"February 18, 2016",2,"Used to Work I used to see all my memories from all my apps but now it won't show anything from Facebook. And when I try to go to the website to report a bug, it just redirects me to the app (really?) and when I click Help on the app it just takes me to an FAQ page which fails to load every time. Thank goodness for Facebook's ability to show memories, but I'd rather see it all in one place which is what I though this app was made for. Huge thumbs down right now."
3468,LashBossLady93,"March 15, 2016",3,"Bugs need to be fixed So the app was working great as of 2 days ago. I went in to see what happened over the years through all my linked accounts and then bam, it doesn't work. I had the update, deleted and logged out of the app entirely and still nothing. Facebook's ""On This Day"" works for Facebook but nothing else. And plus it shows I have activity but it won't show what it is.. "
3469,Kathy0829,"April 8, 2016",5,"Fun to look back I find it fun to look back, so I do enjoy the app, however, it needs improvement.  It's difficult to link to Instagram about 75% of the time, and if it's a video, forget it!  Also, about half the time the pic won't upload to FB via Timehop. I'd rate it 5 stars if these issues were resolved."
3470,Mfarmer88,"May 12, 2013",3,"Not accurate My problem is its just taking my check ins and Facebook statuses and throwing them in either around the same time or no where close. I was at a friends wedding at a church in September, and it just told me today, may 12 that it was last year. I had a graduation on may 10th, and it told me it was 3 years ago today. Again, may 12. It's neat to see the past statuses and check ins but it's sad that they're not accurate :("
3471,oatmeal_mac,"July 6, 2014",4,"Love it! I'd love it more if‚Ä¶ Take heed, Apple, before someone else (Google) buys them out: I wish something like this was built into the iPhone.  It's a stunningly simple concept,  brilliantly executed. "
3472,maybelline930,"September 25, 2014",2,"WHY did they get rid off the ability to swipe through past days???!!! First, even though I enabled badge notifications for the app, it never shows ANY, and without that red circle reminder, there are many days where I've forgotten to check my timehop."
3473,Dontworryboutitttt,"October 3, 2014",4,Show Conversation Doesn't Ever Work I love this app it's awesome being able to see what I was doing on this day throughout the years. I've had the app almost a year now and the 'show conversation' option for Twitter posts or Facebook has always said that the page doesn't exist anymore. Am I the only one and will there ever be a fix for it? Other than that it's a great app.
3474,JennK1013,"January 24, 2015",4,"Love the app! Wish the photos would post. I love being able to look back at posts and pics from years ago. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that if a pic is no longer on my phone, it's a blank space if I post my timehop to Facebook. The post looking back usually doesn't make much sense without the corresponding picture."
3475,Jewelie2012,"January 27, 2015",5,"My favorite app This is the first time I've reviewed anything, and I have a LOT of apps. This is, by far, my favorite! Every day I look forward to seeing what was happening in my life on this day in past years. It's almost like keeping a journal, and it lets me relive those moments over and over again. Every year, I like it better!"
3476,NemoJo,"March 3, 2015",5,"Life is good Every morning before I leave for work I check this app. It's a great reminder of all of the events that have happened that have shaped me today. Just when I think I'm having a bad day, this app can give that feeling a complete 180. It reminds me that I've always had great family, friends, and experiences. LOVE this app!"
3477,Skylar980,"April 5, 2015",4,Update A lot of people have old Facebooks they don't use anymore (for various reasons) we should be able to connect multiple facebook accounts to our timehop so we can see those pictures as well as the ones from the facebook we use. & when we share a picture it will go to the Facebook connected to our phones.
3478,LRGorman,"May 22, 2015",3,"Cool, could be better I wish when I shared a picture on Facebook it would include the caption that was originally with the picture. Instead I have to type it out again, or its just an old picture with no context. Also, pictures get cut off sometimes. I shared an old picture that on Timehop had two people visible in it, but once it posted to Facebook the person on the right was completely cutoff."
3479,LEMcClain,"June 25, 2015",5,"Easy to use, fun I have A LOT of pictures saved to my iPhone, and actively use Instagram and Facebook to share pictures.

3480,M S Walker,"October 22, 2012",5,"Abe-solutely fabulous! I'm a long-time fan of the daily Timehop emails, and this is a really awesome step forward for them. The real clincher for me is pulling in the photos from my phone's camera roll; I have a LOT of pictures that haven't been uploaded to Facebook, so being able to have them included in my daily Timehop is a real treat."
3481,Boxhousev,"January 11, 2017",5,Used to love this app I don't know what you were thinking with this new version. It is terrible. So difficult to share. I can see things but can't share them.

3482,Jsanders73,"January 12, 2017",5,"Latest Update I don't know why you felt like changing a good thing to this latest piece of junk, but your app now is just horrible.

3483,LL048922,"January 20, 2017",1,"New format is terrible As many people have said, the new format is absolutely awful. You can no longer save videos or click into some of the photos. The photos that you can't click into to zoom in on, etc now have an unpleasant looking picture frame around them. On top of that, the app has been incredibly slow and keeps crashing. I haven't been able to send photos via text since the update. It's very frustrating and the old version was a million times better."
3484,zoefrish,"January 20, 2017",1,"Unhappy I have used this app for more than a year every day and have loved it. It's a great concept and the old version was easy to use and fun. This new version is terrible, I don't enjoy using it, and I don't know what the purpose is. My photos that are taken horizontally are cropped to fit into the screen, the app weirdly and quickly jumps through pictures with no warning, and the whole system is harder to use. I will be looking for a different app to serve the same purpose because this one is just not good now. Very unhappy."

I feel bad saying that because I really do love timehop, but guys... come on! I like being able to scroll through and look at everything as a whole. I don't like that it now mocks Snapchat and I can't even see the whole photo on some of them. I also can't save some of them. I really used to love looking at timehop everyday but now, not so much. Please please please bring back the scrolling through photos and the old features!"
3487,mariahcciphone6user,"March 18, 2017",4,"Awesome update great app overall. has gotten way better esp w latest updates. only reason i gave 4 stars is bc it's so hard to get ""archive"" twitter from years. does everything else well though. "
3488,MWD82,"June 1, 2017",1,"Crashes daily It used to work amazingly and then I'm guessing the app creators just stopped caring. I had a streak of checking it 172 days and then it started crashing daily. I have had to delete it and add it again almost every day since then for about a month. It's really not worth your time anymore. If they do updates, they don't fix the bugs, they just take away options they used to have and it's really pretty much useless as an app. I'd give the app 0 stars if it was an option. Not worth your time."
3489,anniejotime,"September 7, 2017",1,"the highlight is my memory not the cutesy new design My memories get lost in confusion of swiping and zooming and over designed cartoon bubbles around my post to the point where I don't recognize right away which platform the update is coming from. And why are we swiping our memories away? Swiping is for tinder not a linear storytelling app. I think the Keep It Simple Stupid mantra is the best way to go here so that our memories are the highlights not the ""cool new features"" that may work for other apps but not necessary here. I want so badly to love this app :("

3493,Rcb7424,"December 30, 2016",1,"Strongly dislike this update As with most of the rest of the reviews since the new update rolled out, I am sincerely disappointed in the new Timehop. No captions, no comments, pictures you can hardly see (especially if there is writing on the picture because your finger has to cover part of the picture to keep it zoomed out ü§î), and the overall layout just doesn't fit the theme of the app. No use repeating what everyone else has said, so here's to hoping the next update reverts back to some of the old features!"

I appreciate the effort to make the Timehop experience more seamless and ""scrolling"" but it's completely reduced the usability of the app. I liked being able to view all of a day's photo at a glance (album view style) rather than needing to swipe each photo one by one. I can no longer click on the original tweet to retrieve it from Twitter. The share functionality is not intuitive at all. I am SO disappointed."
3495,Smallires,"December 30, 2016",1,"Update needs some serious tweaks I love looking back at my memories from years past but this update has really taken away a lot of functionality from the app. Why can't we see captions or comments anymore? And having to hold my thumb down to view a full photo or video means a good chunk of it is blocked from view anyway. I like the idea of swiping through one memory at a time rather than scrolling, but the execution was very poor. Hope this is fixed for the new year as I always like to share a then/now :)"
3496,Ang0424,"December 30, 2016",1,"Update=fail! Please revert to the previous interface. This new update is AWFUL! I loved just scrolling and glancing at old photos. Also, since I have small kids, I often take multiple pictures before finding the ""good"" one and with the new update it puts all of those together into something that looks like still frame animation and makes it virtually impossible to choose the right picture to share! I also wanted to do a then/now picture on Christmas Day and could not get it to work. Please fix!!"

The Facebook statuses don't show up correctly, the photos are zoomed in too much, and it just seems like they completely missed the mark on this. The app was great before and now I'll be erasing it because it is not useful. So sad that they ruined a good thing."

And this update didn't even fix what WAS broken - I still can't see all the words in my tweets because they get cut off halfway through. Please bring back the timeline style and show me all the information. I wish I could rate zero stars."

Seeing old posts and comments made me smile and sometimes helped me get through a bad day. But, this new update is so horrible. It doesn't allow you to enjoy what the point of timehop is. Why would you guys ""fix"" something that was perfectly fine? I understand a new look, but this is a whole new app. I suggest if you want to keep people happy, you fix your mistake you've made."
3500,Mr sloppy,"May 2, 2016",4,"Good I like the app. It's pretty simple, shows what you've posted or sent between social media and texts and I liked the daily ""today in history"" type trivia. I'd like it if they added a way to click on something I posted on Facebook that would take me to that post to delete. I was young and dumb but not motivated enough now to spend the time doing it."
3501,yeahyeahawesomeyeah,"October 1, 2016",4,"Delete option I love the app! However, sometimes it reminds me of things I wish I never put out on the internet (early teenage years when I thought I was invincible). I think there should be an option to bring you to the original post OR even better, a direct option to delete it from the Timehop app. That would make this a 5!"
3502,fizzeh,"December 23, 2016",5,Horrible update. Most of my photos are portrait.  Now I get to have an extra interaction step to view each of them.  So much friction.
3503,CuriouslyKat,"December 23, 2016",1,"Horrible app The new update is terrible.  There are no functional improvements to the app, instead they gave us a messy and illogical app.  Why would zoom every photo to the extreme? Why remove time stamps? Why get rid of comments? Why can't I actually zoom out of many of the photos? Why would you shrink down many photos and squeeze them on one page with bad/cheap drawings of frames? Why do you guys want to look like a really stupid and poorly done version of Snapchat stories? Why wasn't improving the app your goal?  Please fix it."
3504,Old timehop lover,"December 24, 2016",1,"I hate the update This is my first app review ever because I'm so disappointed in the new timehop update.  I loved the old format but could probably get used to the new one.  BUT I can't see the captions on my photos!  Sometimes a photo makes no sense or loses its full meaning until you read the caption.  Bring back the captions!  And why do I have to press and hold to see the entire picture?  Please fix it.  People love this app.  It's the first thing I look at every morning.  And now instead of enjoy old pictures, I'm writing this review...."
3505,Ggxggxgg,"December 24, 2016",1,"Used to be good, now trying to copy Snapchat I used to love this app, but apparently they decided to jump on the Snapchat bandwagon and released an update that forces you to manually page through each photo, one at a time, which is time-consuming and annoying. What's worse is that the photos are formatted incorrectly -- they're zoomed into a vertical orientation, even though most people don't take vertical photos, so you can't even see the whole photo. After several years, I'm done using it and am about to uninstall it."
3506,redsoxbabe210,"December 24, 2016",1,"New Update Ruined App The new update that includes tapping through old posts completely ruins this app. You can't see the caption, you can't see any interaction you had on the post, and you can't even see the whole post right away. I don't know if the designers were trying to be like snapchat, but timehop is a totally different app with completely different needs. Please fix this new update, it's the worst. Go back to scrolling through your entire timehop, not being able to see more than one is frustrating."
3507,Rindy721,"December 24, 2016",5,Loved it until latest update This new update is awful. I loved being able to read comments from my friends from years past. Now that's gone. Also pictures come thru super zoomed in and we have to resize if we want to see the whole thing. Not good changes Timehop!
3508,Ohtes,"December 27, 2016",1,"Immediate Fix Needed 156 day streak is gone.  I'm not going to use this app anymore because I can no longer see my posts rather than pictures zoomed in for no reason.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  This app worked great just the way it was in the first place, but now it is the literal definition of trash.  I used to look forward to each new day to see what past-me had shared, but this app does not allow me to do that anymore and has taken the excitement away.  Revert to the old Timehop ASAP.  I visited this app EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS and will no longer be doing so."
3509,LiveFreeRockHard,"December 28, 2016",1,"Horrible Update Everything I dislike about this update has already been said (e.g., terrible new scrolling, zoomed in pictures,  not seeing comments on Facebook/Instagram posts). However, I still felt the need to write a review so Snapchat can see how overwhelming negatively the feedback is on their new update. Just restore the previous version and everyone will be happy üòÉ Until then, I can't even use the app anymore. I'll likely delete it if it's not changed simply because it's so unintuitive and frustrating to use now."
3510,EmesARMY.org,"April 29, 2015",4,"Great fun tool Love the concept, but find limitations that are frustrating. I use it predominantly to share/document my daughters aggressive vision loss from a rare genetic disorder, but can't share directly to her Facebook page - I guess because it's a page, and not a personal/primary account. I also hate that it cuts off pictures. Wish it could shrink them & let you add text."
3511,DeegeMonster,"May 15, 2015",1,"Nothing seems to work properly I get notifications randomly, I can only share some things, half my images are seen as ""deleted"" even though they are on my Facebook, and when something does work and I have the ability to share it, no matter how many times I adjust the image to crop the way I want it to, it will still blow it up and only show the top left corner of the image. I'm considering getting rid of this app all together at this point, since it doesn't seem to work right in any way shape or form."
3512,Jazzy716,"June 17, 2015",5,"Love you guys! I always look forward to reading my Timehop every morning because I love the little sayings at the very bottom. I screenshot them because that little dinosaur is so cute. One day it actually said ""Does anyone ever read these?"" I do! Faithfully! Keep it up. Whoever writes those, You are an amazing person and you make me laugh. üòÅ"
3513,J2Rosen,"June 25, 2015",5,"Great walk down memory lane! We love this app! It's such fun to see what you were up to 6+ years ago ""on this day""... Only wish for next product update is a ""Favorite day in history"" option that lets you pick any day and then takes you to what you had posted then. Otherwise, it's lots of fun."
3514,QT_Emo,"July 7, 2015",3,"BRING BACK 'THEN AND NOW!' The amount of times this app has changed in the last few months is ridiculous...the frame options are fine, but they're lacking for those who aren't teenagers. A simple ""memories"" frame would even satisfy me... And PLEASE bring back 'then and now!' I went to post the perfect 'then and now' only to find it gone...would be 5 stars if they would stop changing it every 5 minutes."
3515,NGimbal,"July 9, 2015",5,"A Great App I have a ton of photos, but don't have a reason to go through them regularly.  This app makes those photos accessible in a way that I care about.  The biggest draw back is that sometimes I'm reminded of things that I didn't necessarily want to think about... But there's value in that too."
3516,Cinamo7456,"August 11, 2015",5,Best app out there to share memories!! Love this app!! Look forward to it when I have a post to share with family and friends-especially on Facebook TBT (throw back Thursday's)! Best thing is we have control over posting it on public media or staying private. Thank you for letting us share our precious memories!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
3517,LilySunshine,"August 29, 2015",5,"Best part of my morning üíñ Every morning, Timehop is the first thing I check. It leaves me with a grateful sense of nostalgia to see how far my life has progressed in the last 10 years. It reminds me of those friends that were once a huge part of my life, and encourages me to get back in touch with them. This is an amazing app."
3518,ReReRo89,"December 20, 2015",5,Love it! I  like timehop. You can look at multiple social media accounts at once and it tells you what day and time your post was. The little dinosaur is super cute. The only thing I would change about it is allow you to be able to see previous days in case you missed a day.
3519,cbpierce,"December 23, 2015",5,Best daily notification I receive! I love this app and seeing daily what I and those close to me were doing in years past. I have three kids so it's always great to see what they were up to as well. Really quick great way of pulling the different social media sites so we can see past photos.  Very Cool!
3520,ScottySauce,"February 9, 2013",4,I USE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY! I've been using this app since the day it came out and I currently use it every single day. It's a great way to go back and see what came out of my mouth and the photos I took a year ago. It would be awesome if we could go back any day we wanted or even find things by searching for specific words. Keep up the great work and keep the updates coming.
3521,GK Dub,"September 20, 2013",3,"Cool concept, poorly executed. The concept of Timehop is cool. It takes you to see whatever you posted on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ect. on that day 1-4 years ago. Unfortunately you aren't able to see any comments or likes on those posts. Also, the app tends to be glitchy and unable to load half the time. The first couple weeks I had the app it seemed to work ok, now it frequently closes out unexpectedly. It's not quite there yet."
3522,Time hopper,"August 29, 2014",5,"Love it! Love the whole concept of how it ties together all of your accounts to see what all you were up to the same day years in the past. Sometimes the links to pictures and conversations are broken so you can't revisit every moment, but still a blast to check every day."
3523,AJS TX,"September 14, 2014",5,"Works well and so fun! I love this app, what a great idea!! The design is very appealing and it's never had technical issues, so bravo. I would like to be able to put in a date and see what was going on at that time, but I feel like it would bog it down, possibly. I would pay for a pro version that did it, though!"
3524,PlanetCrazy,"September 17, 2014",2,"It was good until it stopped working Great idea but the software died. First pictures didn't load, then they fixed that and pictures started loading again. Then you would share them on facebook only to not have them load again or showing you shared a blank square. So then you had to screen shot the app to get the photo. It would probably be easier to sift through your photos and comment on it to put it into people's newsfeed."
3525,amylizz81,"September 23, 2014",5,"Nice app I like this app. I like that I can see older photos showing how long ago they were. But since my update to ios8, it doesn't access my older iPhone photos since Apple decided to mess up the whole photo album. Also I can't share my timehops via text anymore. I hope you have an update soon!!"
3526,Sandra.Lynn,"January 25, 2015",5,"Love it! I look forward to checking my Timehop every day. It's awesome to see how much things have changed or just reminisce about past events. Like most reviews I've read, integrating MySpace into all of this would be pretty awesome. Between Fb and MySpace, the past 10 years of my life would be covered. Keep up the awesome work."
3527,Lynsaybabexoxo,"January 25, 2015",5,Exceptional I love this app. It's great to look how far you've come year by year. The new update made it actually possible to use on my phone. 
3528,Rhubaka,"February 11, 2015",3,"Stop the crop! I loved sharing with this app  but the current version with only the square crop option is so annoying! If I want square I'll post it to IG. Please revert to the non-cropping version, or give us the option to decide. Otherwise this is one of my most favorite daily apps. I've probably shared about 1/2 the time I normally would because of being forced to crop a photo. Also where is the SAVE TO CAMERA ROLL option?"
3529,Deeceedubs,"March 16, 2015",5,"Great Way to Be Reminded of Fun Times This app is really easy to use; literally it runs itself. The reminders make me smile when I see them, and make me scratch my head at the realization of how fast time flies. I look forward every morning to seeing what I did on that particular day one, two, or even six years ago."
3530,lafferty12,"January 3, 2017",1,"BRING BACK THE OLD FORMATTING I downloaded this app about a year ago and loved it. The formatting WAS nice and smooth and it allowed you to read the captions off of your old IG posts and was very easy to connect to. Since the newest update however, Timehop now has a format like snapchat, where you tap to continue, but you can't see the captions on your old photos and is very hard to connect your accounts to the app. Because of this, I would not recommend downloading this app until unless they bring back the old formatting."
3531,Freetobme,"January 3, 2017",4,No joy in the update I have always enjoyed finding old treasures that come up on Timehop. But this new update that was forced upon us is horrible. It does not bring me joy. It is not clean lined like the previous version. I have to zoom out to look at photos.  There's no text that went along with the photos. And I can't save or share the videos.
3532,Player14679,"January 6, 2017",1,"Too bad you can't give zero stars I'd rather walk on hot coals while chewing on foil and glass than use this app. You should fire the designers that produced this update. I know that if I owned a company and my designers made the app go from a 5 star app to a 1 star app with 1 update, I would seriously consider letting them go. And whatever person signed off on the update. They should be let go, too. This app is terrible. Facebook now has a better ""look back"" feature than TimeHop. How has this not been fixed yet. You developers are pathetic."
3533,Taber Wood,"January 7, 2017",5,"Thanks for listening! The latest release is the best it has been! It has a much more updated look, it is the most user friendly version yet, and I'm really happy to see some of the old features back that had been removed on the last update."
3534,Nathan Kinney,"January 14, 2017",1,"Timehop to What? Before the recent major update I saw a lot of memories, and I even shared some. Following this latest update, I often don't see any memories from either Facebook or Twitter. On some days one Facebook status will appear, but others from the same day don't. (I know this because Facebook has a similar feature.) I haven't seen anything from Twitter since the update. Too bad. I have the same complaints as the other reviewers here, but without seeing my history, those complaints for me are kind of moot."
3535,Dee39056,"January 18, 2017",5,MiMi D I HATE the new version of Timehop!!!!
3536,Els323,"February 4, 2017",1,"Hate it There are times when businesses really need to consider whether they need to change something or not. Sometimes these quotes can be beneficial: ""Don't change something for the sake of change,"" and ""If it's not broke, don't try to fix it."" It does make you wonder how many wasted employee hours are happening due to the decisions of the previous two updates."
3537,Late and Mad,"April 2, 2017",1,"This update killed Timehop I didn't have the app on my phone for a while but when I upgraded my phone and backed it up Timehop was back. I was excited to go back and look through it but the swiping sideways through events one at a time is so annoying and it makes me not even want to use Timehop anymore. (By the way, Snapchat does the swiping and holding it down to share MUCH better. This kind of app should not be like that) Please go back to the old way, I don't know how much longer I can put up with it like this..."
3538,Lexie37,"July 5, 2017",4,"Good app I like being able to see what was going on in my past, but if i miss a day of looking at timehop then i miss out on seeing my history for another year. I suggest adding a feature where you can chose the date of your timehop, for those of us that don't take the time to check everyday but are still interested."
3539,George136894,"September 22, 2017",1,"This App DOES NOT PERFORM I've had Timehop for about six months now.  It rarely gives me Facebook post, by rarely I mean three the entire six months..... maybe.  It used to give me photos I've taken in years past, but it hasn't even done that for a month or so now.  üò§üò°"
3540,M_milkovich83,"December 24, 2016",1,Are you kidding me? This has got to be the worst format change the I've ever seen on an app. No facebook support. One of my favorite things about timehop was being able to read old comments. I'd love to know how to do that if you even can anymore. And what the hell is with all the pics being on auto zoom? Not impressed at all. I have been on timehop forever and this is complete garbage. I will give you time to fix this but not long. I'd hate to leave but this is just not a usable app now. Would give zero stars if I could.
3541,KariLP,"December 24, 2016",1,"Update is awful! I've never written a review for an app before, but there's a first time for everything. I'm so upset about this new update. It's awful! Why change a good thing? I'd rate this version zero stars if I could. It's hard to look at. The pics are weird sizes. I don't like having to zoom in and out.  I hate scrolling through the pics/posts horizontally and very much prefer scrolling vertically. It's making me dizzy. I can't read the old comments either. I may delete the app. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Please bring the old version back."
3542,Gam3r Vix3n,"December 25, 2016",1,"Awful update I love Timehop I look at it everyday and it is one of my favorite apps hands down, however with this new update if they don't go back to what they had before I'm going to delete it. I don't understand what is going on. The pictures are automatically zoomed in and I can't tell when the slide ends or begins since it's a continuous loop. Also 90% of the photos don't load so I miss out on the pictures.  Please read all these poor reviews and go back to what it was before.  I don't see one positive review since the update."
3543,Chey üíú,"December 26, 2016",1,"Repetitive.... I'm yet another person adding to the insanely long list of upset users.... everything about the update is bad. Let's just leave it at that. I don't even care about my streak anymore, and that was why sometimes I made sure I made the time to check it.... I'm only leaving this app on my phone bc I'll be expecting a mass update that will fix everything that everyone's complaining about. I'll give it two weeks then I'm deleting it. I have the ""Same Day"" thing on my Facebook that I can check anyway..."
3544,Eworlegin,"December 27, 2016",1,"This update is...just not good :( If it ain't broke, don't fix it, y'all. I love the idea and concept of the app but this update wasn't very well thought out: 1. I will always want to see the whole picture, so why is it always zoomed in? 2. The ability to scroll through all of the content at once was nice, but now we have to go through each one and possibly have to wait for a picture to load which apparently can take awhile with this update which can be very frustrating! Love the app but miss the scrolling!"
3545,Xsonia09x,"December 29, 2016",5,Not a fan of the New update. I actually don't like the new update. I normally love Timehop. But this new update when you wanna see the post on IG it use to take you to the exact post and open up in IG but now it doesn't do that. I prefer the old setup. Because than I could edit captions or delete posts easier.
3546,Adella25,"December 29, 2016",1,"Update I love timehop. I really do or at least I did. I got timehop when it was first introduced and wasn't very popular. The updates have all been wonderful except the most recent. It is the worst thing the app makers could have done. I hate that I can no longer see the captions from the posts anymore. The pictures no longer make sense and completely ruin the point of timehop. If there is not another update soon fixing the update that wasn't needed might I add, I will unfortunately delete timehop after all these years."
3547,mediaperuana,"December 30, 2016",2,"Latest version a major disappointment The latest update seems to have done away with most of the features I liked about this app, while adding a bonus bunch of bugs. I don't need to see each of my photos in super zoom, but I did like the then/now feature, which seems to have disappeared. "
3548,thesnuffy,"December 30, 2016",5,"Windows ME Timehop Edition I have no idea what the team at Timehop was thinking with this ""upgrade"" to their UI, but it is awful! The only thing that keeps me using it is because I have a streak over 220 going and I don't want to lose it. However, I may delete the app if they don't fix things soon. I used to love this app."
3549,Greta333,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worst update to an app I've ever seen. I have never written a review for an app in the history of my owning an iPhone, but I am so irritated with the update that was made that I'm writing my first one. "
3550,Dria Babe,"August 2, 2015",4,"One little problem. I love this app. I use it all the time, but recently it will not let me see my Instagram photos from over two years ago. It will say it didn't reach 88 mph,  I will hit retry. And it still doesn't work. I've tried deleting and re-downloading it and it still doesn't work. I just don't want to give up on the app, because I love it so much."
3551,OhioanGal,"August 4, 2015",5,"Great way to relive great memories! This app is easy to set up and use, and the unused interface is simple and a fun design. It's great to be reminded of both important and smaller things that happened or that you were thinking about this day over the course of the years you've been involved in social media."
3552,Jden15,"October 6, 2015",5,"Great app but needs major improvements Love that the app pulls my photos from Facebook, Instagram and Google Plus. However, some of my photos don't come up (about 20%) with an error message and videos do NOT work. I see ""video failed to load."" Doesn't matter if it's a 4 second video or 1 min video."
3553,DiabloNinja12,"October 7, 2015",5,"It's great It's a great app with a great premise but the only trouble I have with it, is if you don't post like everyday on your social media accounts, don't expect to see something everyday. For me I only see things like 3 or 4 times a month but that's just cause I don't post a lot of things. Other then that this app is great"
3554,Lesley0182,"October 31, 2015",5,Not liking this anymore I used to have lots of stories and pictures show up and the last few days it says I have no stories or pictures when I know for a fact I had posted things that day. Is it just me or is anyone else not happy anymore?
3555,Violabrain,"April 29, 2016",1,"The new retro video feature is awful! I used to love this app because it's fun to see what you were doing on a particular day in the past, but the new retro video feature is terrible! It starts playing automatically, it's way too loud, and I could care less what was going on in pop culture on a certain date. I try to avoid pop-culture at all costs and here it is blaring out of my phone without any possibility of me turning off. Please either take away this feature or make it possible for users to disable it."
3556,Jhgarcia4,"June 27, 2016",3,"Used to be 5 Star, now it's 3. When on earth did Timehop decide that it was a good idea to switch up how you view your comments from Instagram and Facebook? You used to just be able to click and the comments would appear. Now I have to log into Facebook or open up Instagram every time I want to view a comment. I am not logging into Facebook 6+ times just to view my comments. That is absurd!"
3557,Bri-bri-97,"November 25, 2016",4,"Timehop Timehop is a pretty good app, although, it's really annoying when they send you notifications that say, ""if you miss your timehop today, you won't be able to see it for 365 days. So yeah, don't miss it"". Sorry I don't have time to look at it EVERY SINGLE DAY on the dot. Their notifications are annoying, but they can be turned off. But all in all, it's a good app to have."
3558,omegawolf73,"December 15, 2016",4,"Fix the glitch! This app is a really fun way to see your old tweets and insta posts, but the new glitch where it only shows you the first few words of a post on your Timehop timeline (unless you save the post) is pretty annoying. Other that, I've had very few issues with Timehop. The longer you've been on social media, the more fun it is! :)"
3559,Adlne,"December 24, 2016",1,"New layout is the worst This app is so bad now. I used to easily be able to scroll down past the years, and I was happy and satisfied with that. The new interface is just not user friendly AT ALL. For example, the zooming out to see a full post is so annoying. I hate everything about this update. I used to check this daily, and now it's rendering me as an app  that's trying too hard to be something it shouldn't. Go back to the original layout. It was perfectly fine and way more user friendly."
3560,Aubrey Ann's Mommy,"March 2, 2015",1,"Original caption/text is GONE. WHY??! I HATE that I updated this app,  because the original text with each picture does not appear when I share on Facebook. I literally have to screen shot and post the screenshot (which keeps it from going in the automatic ""Timehop"" album) or I have go back and forth to see the text and type it in myself. A lot of my photos need an explanation, especially the old ones. I need the text to translate over. WHYYYYY would you have taken this away? üòîüò©üò≠ I haven't used since this horrible update. PLEASE FIX IT!"
3561,Cm brown,"March 9, 2015",5,Really fun I almost never write reviews. It's very rare I enjoy an app enough to take the time to rate it. Time hop is truly enjoyable. It's fun seeing where you were in life on any specific day years ago. Sometimes happy moments you forgot all about and sometimes troubling times you've overcome. I now check the app daily.
3562,JonnieHarvey,"March 23, 2015",4,"Not Right Lately Normally I have no issues with TH. But lately it has been scrolling with some difficulty...like it wants to freeze up. And when I want to share something, it won't. Might want to look into that. I'm on an iPad 4. Also, I can't share to Instagram now. I just did yesterday, March 22. Now today it's not an option. Nothing changed in my settings."
3563,ugafunshine,"March 25, 2015",3,"Fun but not always accurate. I'd never noticed it as most times I have no idea what I have posted in the past. However, when I looked at it today it had a picture I posted of my sons first birthday. It says this day in history on March 25. But his birthday is the 26. I even went back to check facebook to see if I had just up loaded a picture of the cake early but no the post is dated the 26th. Other than that it's a cute app"
3564,BoogleFace,"April 23, 2015",5,"Like it a lot! Going back can help you see how much you've grown. It also conjures up memories you'd rather forget. The only thing I'd add to this app is making the calendars of years past match the same day of the current year so I can post, for instance, my Easter picture from last year on Easter this year."
3565,Konaeyb,"April 30, 2015",5,My fave I saw this app all over Facebook and it took me months to finally give in. I regret not getting it sooner. I look forward to opening this app every morning. I love that I get good and bad memories with this app. It makes me want to post on social media more so in the years to come I can see more of what I was doing now.
3566,sacant95,"May 13, 2015",5,"the cutest app timehop is so cute because of the tiny details, like how when you refresh the page, the dinosaur looks like he's pulling it down, and when you get to the bottom of the page if you keep scrolling, you see the little guys underwear. I love timehop! definitely worth the room on your phone."
3567,Krystal Tate,"May 21, 2015",4,"Great app! Only 1 flaw I love this app! It's so fun to reminisce on good, funny, embarrassing, completely forgotten, bad, over dramatic etc. pictures and statuses! I love that I can save those pictures to my phone just wish there was a way to save the videos straight to my phone like with the pictures but all it will let me do is share it through social media or an email account üò´"
3568,bobrayburn,"July 25, 2015",5,"More comprehensive than Facebook's version Love that this looks through your photos (if you've granted permission) as well as Facebook, Instagram etc. also the ability to share across so many platforms is great. Will be even better when less of images gets cropped."
3569,yolipook,"July 29, 2015",5,"Fun app I love this app. I sometimes don't get around to checking it for the day and wish I could see a day or so back, but no such luck. I've had some issues with sharing, though none that I can recall in detail at the moment and none that would lead to the end of the world. All around great app!"
3570,INFMSJaes,"February 26, 2014",4,"Fun was to start your day Very fun app when you connect your relevant social media, however I've noticed it has problems displaying some posts that it didn't a few months back. It doesn't seem to work well with Twitter anymore and I've done everything I can. I even contacted the developers via twitter and they said they reran my tweets. Regardless, it's worth a download."
3571,Lexi Green,"March 27, 2014",5,"This app makes my day, everyday!!! I tell everyone I know about this app! It puts a smile on my face and helps me stay grateful for what I have in life today. I recommend it to parents and artists especially. You will see how your children or your skill has grown with time. What a delight! I cannot spent highly enough of this app! <3"
3572,Lightbulb5665,"May 22, 2014",4,"Love!! Love the app!!! It's great looking back a few years without scrolling through pages and pages. One thing I think they should try to gain access to (and I know it would be really hard, if possible at all) but to have the option for all our SnapChat pictures to be included; it would be a funny/ memorable way to boost the app. Just a thought :)"
3573,Danatopia,"June 26, 2014",5,Look forward to opening it daily This is a fun little app that tells you what you were doing last year and years past on today's date. Fun glimpse into the past especially to see how kids have grown in the last year and last several years.
3574,alliecat54,"July 6, 2014",5,Suggestion: This app is FANTASTIC and every day I end up looking forward to seeing what it comes up. I do have one suggestion though. You guys should look into getting it synced with Tumblr. I know that I would love to see some of my posts from years past and I'm sure a lot of other people would too!
3575,Dk093091,"July 29, 2014",5,"Fun little app It's a great small app that has brought back so many funny memories between me and my friends. It's just one small update every day and it reminds you of something from your past. And I only use it for Facebook, so it would be even better if I used other social media networks."
3576,Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee3,"September 25, 2014",5,Great app! I love this app! It's very cool to see pictures or posts from 3-4 years ago that I completely forgot about! Sharing these post again is very easy and you can do it straight from the app. Sometimes it gives me an error and won't load my pics for the day but overall this app is super cool and a lot of fun
3577,Bass player 555,"October 27, 2014",4,"Awesome App, Could Be Improved This is a fun app.  It's really cool to see what I posted years ago.  I just have one concern.  The pictures are way out of context.  Sure it's cool to see what picture I posted years ago but the description is absent therefore I have no idea where the picture came from, why it was taken, and why I posted it on Facebook, etc.  Other than that, it's a very cool app."
3578,Jstarrme,"December 15, 2014",3,"Needs more Since my Facebook was hacked 3 years ago and I had to make a new one, this doesn't go far enough back for me. I would love it if we could connect to MySpace because I could relive  my high school embarrassing photos and what not. Once this coming year rolls around I will be looking at the same ""past photos"" as last year just with 2014 added. Give us something new to look forward to in 2015 :)"
3579,MUHMULLET,"January 21, 2015",5,"Great App! This app has the potential to change people's perspective on their own lives. I can't believe how much I've personally changed over the course of 5 years, and I have this app to thank for showing me that growing is the inevitable. One request to add to the perfection: Would be neat to see what I was up too in the MySpace days. Haha"
3580,aleem,"September 13, 2013",5,Puts a smile on my face every day! This app shows you what you were up to on social media on this exact day on years past... But the thing I like best is the desktop sync addon which shows me all the photos on my computer from that day in years past as well!  It's totally fun and surprisingly insightful!
3581,Someone_LikeYou_151,"November 15, 2013",3,"Good Concept, Not Working Now Well I used to really enjoy this app, but as of right now it won't allow me to log in. I had it connected to my Facebook, which worked great, but then I connected it to my twitter. It said it was connected, but none of my tweets ever showed up when I ""time traveled"" very frustrating since I use twitter more than Facebook, and it would have been interesting to see my tweets... Fix these bugs please!"
3582,hicktowncutie11,"January 4, 2017",1,"If only I could give negative stars... ... I would. The new updates is the worst. I can't share half the photos I want to, some of them move so an unknown reason, they are all zoomed in way to much forcing my to press and hold to see the whole picture to decide if I even want to try to share it. Yea know the old saying if it ain't broke don't fix it? Well you broke it! The old version worked just fine I could see everything and share it all! Now I get almost nothing and can't share what is there! #stupid"
3583,ALadyAway,"January 7, 2017",2,"Go back in time, get rid of new version The most recent update of this app is a total headache. I used to look forward to scrolling through old memories but now all of the images are so zoomed in you can't see what they are and if multiple images of the sam scene were taken, they flip by quickly and without option to share. I see what the developers were trying to do with the new update, but it's just not user friendly"
3584,jenniferkaufman,"January 12, 2017",2,"So glad it's not just me - awful update! I've used Timehop since just about the day it hit the App Store, and was annoyed when FB started shoving memories in my face. Timehop already does that perfectly, thanks."
3585,zubes317,"January 22, 2017",1,horrible I think everyone else has said it pretty well.. go back to the old version. I can't stand clicking through every single post. I liked being able to quickly scroll through without having to look at everything in detail. I also am not able to share videos when I was able to do that before. I wish I could downgrade app versions. I don't even utilize your app anymore bc of the new format. It's a waste of my time. Listen to everyone and go back to the old format!!
3586,Mark Gerdy,"February 17, 2017",1,"Don't waste your time anymore Still, update after update, the developers refuse to address the biggest issue with the app and the main complaint of its long time users. App is a joke now and hardly works. Layout is clunky and annoying and forces you to swip through each memory which sometimes can take forever depending if its downloading from iCloud or if you just have a ton of memories from a particular day. Officially deleting this app as of today. It's just wasting space on my home screen."
3587,SabrinaM2014,"February 26, 2017",1,Can't share memories Ever since the most recent update I have not been able to share from the app. 
3588,Gennanicole,"May 21, 2017",2,"Wish it was what it USED to be. This used to be my favorite app, hands down. But as so many others have noted, after many updates, this app is just awful now. It's clunky and difficult to navigate, crashes often, and is riddled with ads. UI is horrific. The worst part though, is that so many have spoken out about the issues and been downright ignored by developers. So I deleted it, because even though I love the idea of this app, I hate the execution. Too bad."
3589,rileywaggy,"June 26, 2017",3,"Good but... This app is good. I enjoy it, however the update I am not the fondest of. I try and tap the side to flip trough each post, but it only works half the time before I have to slide my finger across the screen to get to the next item. I liked the taps because they were a lot quicker. Also just the look of the new update isn't the best. TBH the last update was the best yet, before this one. Just my opinion."
3590,JLRMARCJRMJR,"December 26, 2016",5,üëéüèªNew Update 1. The photos are huge and it seems silly to have to pinch it smaller when it should just be smaller. 
3591,Dollyann74,"December 27, 2016",1,"Not sold on the update Looking at Timehop and seeing memories has been a highlight of my day for a few years now. However, that is not the case with this new update. An update should make something better, not worse. The fun part of Timehop is seeing the memories from each year in a sequential list. Swiping through different screens has taken away from seeing the progression of different years. A solution could be to offer two different views like instagram; a list view or individual view."
3592,WUTTIS DIS,"December 28, 2016",4,New update is TRASH I've never cared enough about an app to write a review and this is my first time doing so. Please revert back to the old version. 
3593,Cyn627,"December 28, 2016",5,"horrible update i used to love timehop. i could see old memories & read the comments from years ago. but this new update is terrible! the comments are gone, the side swipe is awful & the entire picture doesn't fit on the screen. AWFUL! i will be deleting this app."
3594,Bbmnda,"December 28, 2016",1,"The update breaks my heart! Timehop used to be he first thing I checked every morning- it brought me so much joy!  Now, since the new update, it's nothing but frustration!  What was wrong with the way things were???  Now, the pics are so big they don't fit on the screen, plus there are no captions so I have no idea what I'm looking at. I'm beyond sick of app algorithms deciding what I want to see- just show me my posts from this day in history, and stop trying to be fancy!!!  I'm afraid I've lost this piece of my day and look down memory lane forever!  :("
3595,Jonesy324,"December 29, 2016",1,"The new update ruined TimeHop I used to love TimeHop - I faithfully check it every day. But this latest update sucked the fun out of it. I don't think this is a ""you'll get used to it"" kind of update.  You lost the history of what you said when you posted a picture and the ability to read people's comments. The pictures are super zoomed in for some reason.  They messed with a formula that didn't need to be messed with - I hope they give the option to revert back to the old version so I can enjoy the app again."
3596,buffla15,"December 29, 2016",5,Don't upgrade!! Horrible! This upgrade is the worst!!! The photos are enlarged so you have to touch them to see the whole photo. They zoom thru similar photos so you can't save them. Every time I touch a photo it skips to the next one. Why would anyone think this upgrade was a good idea?????
3597,J2daCh,"December 30, 2016",1,"Terrible Update Honestly I don't think I've ever written a review on any app before, since I haven't had motivation. But this new update serious annoys me to where I don't even wanna open it anymore. The new layout is terrible, zoomed in pictures look blurred and pointless to where if you even want to see your stuff you need to zoom out, the tap through feature was a bad idea, maybe it works for snapchat, but certain things aren't meant for everything. I will not be using the app anymore until a new update."
3598,user447388,"December 31, 2016",1,"bad in general I understand that the update was supposed to make the app easier, but it really just features the photos of the app. The main reason I got the app was to look at old twitter posts, but now i can't even see the caption of the post if there's a picture on it. You can't even see the entire picture without zooming out, and even then, if it's landscape, you can't see all of it. Also, it takes a really long time to get through the scrolling. This update is just really bad and unnecessary."
3599,Plungy,"January 3, 2017",1,"Don't waste your time the new update killed this app I loved This app was awesome before they updated it and ruined it. You can't zoom in on half the photos, and they're full screen zoomed in and some just play a couple pictures in a row and all you can do is skip it.. you can't tell if they came from Facebook or Instagram or your photo roll anymore.. I stopped looking at it and I just use Facebook memories. Maybe they'll listen to all of their users and go back to the old version!! Don't download!! It's awful!"
3600,Fish1085,"October 3, 2016",4,"""I've Moved On,"" or ""Over It"" option I love Timehop. It's fun and easy and I love a nice walk down memory lane. This app would be even better if we had the option to select certain memories to not see anymore. Like, I would like a to not be reminded of my amazing Mexico vacation for every May for the rest of eternity. That'd be great. Just give me an ""Over It,"" option. Anything. Please."
3601,Pretii_Ladii,"November 21, 2016",2,"Salty At the bottom, the app keeps track of how many days in a row you look at your story."
3602,Mdnyunc,"December 23, 2016",1,New view is terrible The new view is terrible!!! Sometimes I have dozens and dozens of pictures. I used to be able to scroll through lots of them at once and click on ones I wanted to see up close. Now I have to look at each one individually? Then they're too zoomed in so part of the picture is cut off unless I click on it? And if I want to go back and look at one or share one later in the day I need to scroll through every single one again? Not worth it! I don't know how much I'll use Timehop anymore.
3603,Brandon sparrow,"December 23, 2016",1,"Pointless update This may be the worst update that has rolled out ever. First of all, why was it decided that this new layout would be better than the previous one. It removes so many features that we had before. I, along with many other people I'm sure, would much rather have a list of events in my timehop, allowing me to go to the tweet that was 2 years ago, or go to the Facebook post that was 3 years ago. I think you guys need to rethink this update, especially since it basically makes timehop useless."
3604,agana21,"December 24, 2016",5,"Dislike the new update I always loved the Timehop app. I loved looking at my old pictures and seeing my comments. Now with the new update, it's been removed and you always have to zoom out of every picture. Wishing it would change back to its original format."
3605,Mrs. Kristen,"December 24, 2016",1,"Very Disappointed in the Update. I have had Timehop for quite some time. I have ALWAYS enjoyed looking back at old posts, being able to see the whole post, and even access comments on those posts. Now I have... well... a hot mess. There are posts where the pictures aren't with them and then pictures where the post part is missing. The zoom feature is weird and kind of annoying. Let's bring back the basics... I'm all for updating, but this was a bit much and not a wise move. :( #sadstuff"
3606,Anjbow,"December 24, 2016",1,"Update: Not a fan I am not a fan of the update. I loved the old format and how easy it was to scroll down through the years, see comments, see ALL pictures from one event, etc. the new app is frustrating. It's annoying that there is no difference in the years anymore and that we can't see the entire photo without holding the zoom out button. I will stop using the app because I don't like it at all. Bummer. I loved going through the past days in history. Guess I won't be doing it anymore."
3607,allaboutjo,"December 25, 2016",1,"Yuck...two thumbs down...really bad upgrade I never review apps but for some reason I'm compelled to do so now...I've recently lost my mom and using Timehop to enjoy my past posts and memories has helped with grieving, sharing, smiling, remembering good times etc...all the things I thought the app was created for. But this upgrade takes away from all of that...it leaves me confused and ticked off that I can't see comments or really do anything productive within the new format...please go back to being the old app that made me smile again..."
3608,Saliture,"December 25, 2016",1,What were they thinking with the new update?!? The app is useless now. I can no longer see my captions or comments on photos. I can't see my text only comments either. Photos are zoomed in by default which means you can't see the whole photo unless you hold your finger on it. It used to be easy to scroll through your timeline but now it takes time and is just plain annoying. I sure hope they give us an option to go back to the old style or this app is as good as dead to me. Unfortunate.
3609,MelissaKKelly,"December 26, 2016",1,"Update is horrible!! I used to love looking at my memories on the old timehop but now it's not fun anymore. It's hard to navigate and the swiping left and right crap is getting old. I try clicking on a picture to look at closer and it jumps to the next one. I loved being able to click on a picture and see the old comments and likes. Not sure if you can still do it, just can't figure it out. Ow. Too confusing and too much to do. I just wanna see my old pictures and memories. Bring back the old version!!"
3610,Marit 14,"July 16, 2015",3,"Prompted to ""Get Started"" repeatedly I am not sure why but the app keeps prompting me to start over. I have had it for a few months and using it daily when it prompts me that my time hop is ready. "
3611,Niicoleemarriee,"July 29, 2015",4,Everything is awesome but... It's annoying that it won't show the current day immediately. I want to be able to look at it at 12:01am and see everything for that day not have to wait till the next morning to see! So instead I started using Facebook yeah ago app. üò´ please fix this! Then it would get five stars every time!
3612,Jasmine Leilani,"November 10, 2015",1,"What a shame I used to adore this App. I used it several times a week, mostly to reminisce with friends (mostly on Facebook). I loved how I could share with a click, a nice trip down Memory Lane every day."
3613,Dixie3813,"December 9, 2015",4,"Awesome App but it's missing something.. I know MySpace is like a blast from the past to most people which is why I would really love to have it added to my timehop so I could see old posts from when I was like 13 lol that would be a real timehop memory for me lol they should add it!! (: but as far as timehop goes it's amazing, memories at the tap of a screen that take you back (: love it!"
3614,Navyman3,"January 16, 2016",3,"Won't post to Facebook I like the idea of the app and it is fun to see posts from my past. The only issue stopping from getting a 5 star rating is the fact that when I click to post to Facebook, it says it is posting, yet never posts to Facebook. So if I want to post it I have to physically take a screenshot, crop it, then post it myself which is a hassle. Fix this issue and it will have 5 stars from me."
3615,Teresa C Dail,"January 25, 2016",5,Love it! This is a fun app. it brings memories back good and bad. Kinda shows you where you were and where you at. Have you gotten better or worst? 
3616,TXAgMom,"January 28, 2016",5,New update killed the app!! The new update yesterday killed the app. It's sitting on my phone 'Loading' and won't do anything else. I've tried to delete the app and it won't let me. So i guess I'm going to get on my iTunes and see if I can delete it that way. I really liked the app too! It's needs to get fixed!
3617,Scmoola,"March 31, 2016",4,Notifications Love the app but I wish it notified when there was content to check. There are period of time where it has nothing to show so I forget to check the app. There should be a notification that tells you to check the app if you happened to have posted on that day in a previous year
3618,Fbhpifdti,"April 19, 2016",3,"Decent App to Look Back On I like this app so it compiles all my social media accounts. But the downside is not being able to share multiple posts (say select 3 of the 6 from that day) and be able to create a small feed to post today. This would enable users to select and then show all at once something from last year, 3 years ago, and 6 years ago and post/share that."
3619,Rachelmegs,"June 11, 2016",2,"Works well, but... Where's MySpace? The good: the app appears to work well. It recalls memories from Facebook (which Facebook also does now) and my iPhone. "
3620,reviewer of products,"February 10, 2015",5,"great for narcissists! TimeHop is the perfect way to start off my day -- with a reminder of how awesome I am! I always look forward to reading a feed that is all about ME, MY pictures, MY tweets and statuses, MY wonderful self! It's so easy to forget how great I am at using social media, but the young dinosaur boy always reminds me! What a terrific app for a terrific person like me!"
3621,Jess joy1234,"February 20, 2015",5,"I look forward to this every day It isn't perfect, but it is really fun. It makes me happy to see old pictures & silly or dramatic status updates. I notice how my priorities have changed and how I've evolved in general. It makes me realize that when I thought I fat in my early 20s, I actually had a rockin body. Love it."
3622,Clartzy05,"February 24, 2015",3,"it's cute. This app is cute. The concept is fun and by now, all over Facebook. I don't like that I still get a notification every. day. that my 'Timehop is ready!' despite my preferences against having said notifications. Also, I know some of these posts are pulled from multiple years ago but why include them if the photo or the actual post doesn't show? other than those two things, this app is cute :]"
3623,BrittyVb,"March 4, 2015",5,LOVE THIS APP Awesome app that gives you the ability to see what you did in previous years.  I saw other posts stating it doesn't go back further than 3 years....mine has gone all the way back to 11 years ago. It just depends on the date you took the picture and what avenues you sync up with Timehop.
3624,shmallls,"March 15, 2015",5,This app is amazing. I've always enjoyed going way back in time on my Facebook and twitter and now I don't have to. Time hop shows me everything from the past year all the way up to the past six years ago. All in one adorable little app. It's like reliving some of the best memories over again. I love it.
3625,Areilsharp,"March 16, 2015",3,Not that great I love the idea of the app and usually enjoy it but half the time photos do not show up or link you to facebook and when you try to look at the link it doesn't show anything. I also do not like when you share the photos again on facebook you only see the timehop info until you click on the timehop link. So if you do not have time hop the photos cannot be viewed.
3626,Nostalgic for '08,"March 31, 2015",4,"Please I really love this app, it's interesting to see what I was doing on this date in years past, but what would really top it off would be to be able to sync old Myspace profiles as well. I had MySpace when I was going through my most awkward phase and I really would like to have a daily reminder of that as well as my more normal Facebook years. Thanks."
3627,Sweetmandaz87,"April 9, 2015",5,"Remembering the times The fact that you can use one app to see pics and posts from multiple other apps is awesome,  not to mention Timehop is so easy to use.

3628,CoachMissy,"May 12, 2015",3,Love it but... What a great idea!  Love being able to look back at previous posts!!!  Since the last upgrade there seems to be something wrong. It freezes and you can't scroll.
3629,hughesnum3,"July 14, 2015",5,"First trip down memory lane of its kind! I love timehop! It's really cool to see photos and/or posts from previous years stored in one place and revealed on that exact date! It's really fun to recall those memories and be able to save and share them, but sometimes the nostalgia can get to you. Great app nonetheless! Highly recommended!"
3630,~lyns~,"September 7, 2014",5,Love app but fix ! Love this app one of my favorites.  But it hasn't been working the last few days on the pics. Your support page to contact you isn't either so had to include in review.  This is the only time I have had this issue and others are having it too. Please fix!!
3631,StonerSlut,"October 19, 2014",2,"Room for improvement I do not like the fact that you can only see the current day. I don't always have time to check everyday, and I would like to be able to check the previous days that I missed."
3632,Pinkglam08,"December 5, 2014",3,"Signing In I just got the app and I found out that you have to log in with a Facebook account, but I don't have and don't want a Facebook account. I think that in the next update you should be able to log in using any type of social media account like a Twitter or Instagram account. I have seen people using this app and I think it is really cool. I just want to be able to use it without a Facebook account."
3633,Lexy&Natasha,"December 17, 2014",5,"I love timehop üòã Timehop is so interesting. I honestly look at mine every day. Its the best way to look at your past. Pictures, all that!

3635,Prettymsb,"January 26, 2015",5,Social Media Timehop reminds me one of the reasons why I started posting to social media. At times it reminds me of my struggles and my successes! Also my children are 3years and a day apart and it was so cool to see just how much they look alike via timehop. Everyday I can compare their similarities and differences in look and activities! What a wonderful way to remember!
3636,Between-THE-Lines,"February 5, 2015",5,"Fun App It's fun to see the dumb stuff that I have posted to my social media sites. My wife told me about it, it didn't seem like something that I would enjoy. I was wrong. It's fun to see where we were and where we are. I check it every day. It's good for a laugh, especially those who like to laugh at their own jokes."
3637,Frustrated Timehop User,"January 24, 2017",1,"Awful Update, Please Revert to Old Version The update you did in December that completely changed the Timehop App ruined something that I used to do on a daily basis. Now, the App is very slow and almost useless at times. I would rather pick and choose which pictures I want to look at full screen instead of having to scroll through them all. Please have the courage to admit that this update was completely wrong and go back to the older version. If not, you will continue to lose users."
3638,Kfitz02250,"February 5, 2017",1,"Please go back to scroll version I tried so hard to be patient and wait for the changes to be made based on everyone's feedback, but I can't wait anymore. Using Timehop has become such a frustrating experience that I'm deleting it until I hear of major changes. Please go back to the scroll-through version! "
3639,monalizj,"July 4, 2017",4,Good Option to Look Back This is a good option for looking back at the years past. It also can become addicting to try and get a streak of days in a row of looking back. There are some aspects I'd like improved but for the most part - it does what it should be able to do: pulls past social media or photo memories like a time machine app.
3640,45Baker,"December 31, 2016",5,...update is horrible üò©üò´üò£üòñ The latest update has really made me not enjoy this app. I'm not understanding why the pics are zoomed in and I can't read what each pic was about without going through so much hassle. Please rethink this or I will have to find another way to enjoy my past.
3641,Dave-mon,"January 2, 2017",5,"Why oh why Used to love this app, now you can't even share old stories. Gonna give it another week and if not any better I'm gonna delete it. It's totally unusable now. Full size pictures make it hard to see. I will just stick with "" On this day "" from Facebook."
3642,LattaLuv,"January 4, 2017",1,"From 5 Star to 1 I have taken a few weeks to try to get used to it, but I just can't. I do not like this update at all. "
3643,Rock Anthem,"January 5, 2017",1,"New Update is Awful I check Timehop everyday because the captions and pictures from my past make me laugh and help me get out out of bed in the morning. That being said, the new update that forced us to click through the past events instead of just scroll through them is driving me nuts. Most importantly, the update doesn't allow me to read the captions on my old photos and reposts which defeats the whole purpose. I hope Timehop fixes these issues or else I am going to stop using the app."
3644,Mindgamers,"January 6, 2017",1,"New update sadness I have never written a review before. Please bring back the old format. There are so many things I had forgotten about, pictures, updates, and videos. I would save so many of them to my phone and share with many people. Some of those memories won't let me save or share. I am watching a video of my daughter from 5 years ago and I can't save it or share it. Now I will have to hunt my Facebook and every corner of my phone to find it. This new update is so upsetting. It honestly makes me sad."
3645,Hot81grl,"January 11, 2017",1,"What Happened?? I was excited about the last update that changed the way things look....but with the newest version I can't get the program to open AT ALL!!!! It is nice to hear you have finally changed it so the photos are not automatically zoomed out, often cutting off my photo. But now, I wouldn't know if I like any of the changes, since the app just freezes. This is extremely frustrating and annoying. If the new update doesn't come out soon....I will be forced to delete the app."
3646,Cnpmom,"January 14, 2017",5,"Hate the update I can't read old post without pretending I'm going to share it.  I can't see my pictures.  I loved looking at what happened in my life on this date everyday, and now it is horrible!!!   Some days it doesn't even load. Please go back to the old version!"
3647,JOEYROXHISIPHONE,"January 21, 2017",1,"Just awful The ""new"" update is horrendous. I used to joyfully look forward to checking out how our seven children have grown since I have been sharing on social media in the past, and I was even more glad when iCloud became an included feature. This last update however is awful. Pictures cannot be viewed completely (even on a 6+). Your insignia being on EVERY SINGLE picture of MINE with no way to remove it is shameful. I will be deleting this app if improvements are not made - and glad to do so."
3648,CwissyC,"January 23, 2017",5,"Ruined a great app The original TimeHop was wonderful. With a single update, everything became horrible. It isn't easy to share photos. You CAN'T share videos anymore. Nor can you compare side-by-side photos for year to year within the app anymore. It's horrible now, don't waste your time."
3649,BriBusse,"January 23, 2017",3,"New updates ruined this app for me I agree with the droves of reviews begging for the old format back, or something more efficient. The app used to work smoothly, show the entirety of my pictures, and not create little slideshows of pictures that prevent me from sharing the photo I would like to share. Everything I dislike about this app has been in the last few updates."
3650,Alirae29,"December 23, 2016",1,Dismal update This update is horrible and will be enough to get me to abandon the app if it does not change.
3651,Turtles91178,"December 24, 2016",1,Update Blues I really dislike the new update. Let me spell it out for you:
3652,crstn85,"December 24, 2016",1,"Go back to the last version! I don't take screen sized photos so when you try to fill the whole screen with a photo you are preventing me from viewing some, or in the case of landscape images, most of it! Pink background and white text is annoying. Inability to scroll quickly is frustrating. Lack of a contact us button means I have to leave these grievances here rather than send them directly to the developers! Please give us the option to timehop back to the last version."
3653,jpbananaman,"December 24, 2016",1,"Intuitive interface, the gold standard since the 80s There shouldn't be an issue with navigation in an app as simple as this. A gesture based redesign was never requested nor necessary to make this any easier. In fact, it's made the experience much harder and somewhat worthless. If full screen is your goal, add it as an inline feature when scrolling down through the timeline. Quick sharing is needed, add it as a press and hold action. This change was done for the sake of change, not the user experience."
3654,buster27,"December 24, 2016",1,"Taking something good and making it worse The app started so well, you could click and save without graphics. "
3655,Susiesix,"December 25, 2016",1,"Loved it before the update I'm sure the developers were trying to give the people what they wanted (I'm not sure what that is), but as someone with TONS of pictures on their ""stories"" the layout doesn't work very well. Before, I could skim through them, but now it feels like a chore to tap through each & every picture and status update. Where before it took me 2 or 3 minutes to check timehop, now it takes forever. Please go back to the way it was before. I'd give it 5 stars if it were that way."
3656,DW14410,"December 28, 2016",1,"New update layout is awful I understand that people are conditioned to reject change but I gave this new layout a chance, and it's horrible, feels totally unnecessary, and actually has me considering simply deleting the app. It's counterintuitive and it makes even the simplest processes difficult, I don't understand why this was even implemented, he former layout was so much straightforward and better. Long story short, revert to the other layout or I'm deleting this app, and I can only imagine almost everybody else will too, it's THAT bad."
3657,Pegeseus,"December 28, 2016",1,Just what? Came to complain about the latest update but appears that 4000 people beat me to the punch. What were you thinking? Did you beta test this with anyone? You made an app that was working perfectly fine into an awkward mess. The default option is to zoom in my photos and videos to full screen so that they are unrecognizable? To have to hold my finger on the screen for the entire length of a video to watch it? I feel like this is some weird April fools joke that I don't get. Who thought this was a good idea?
3658,H316,"December 29, 2016",1,"Worst update ever get rid of it!!! This by far is the worst update! Not even worth one star! Who cares about the large pictures when you can't see the original look whether Facebook or Instagram, The swipe is annoying then tapping on the image to zoom out takes several times or swipes to the next image this becomes repetitive if you don't tap it just right. Who tests these updates before moving them up into the store? Change it back or fix it, do something I'm on the verge of delete."
3659,Maumaua,"December 29, 2016",1,"Please revert back to the good thing you had going! Can you please go back to the way you had it?! The fact that every picture is zoomed in is a terrible idea, especially since a lot of people have pictures on their timeline that are landscape or square sized. This makes no sense to have it zoomed in automatically. I liked seeing the comments as well. Did you take that feature off or is this new version that user UNfriendly that after poking around for some time I still can't find it??"
3660,Danielle_79,"September 12, 2015",5,Always says my photos are deleted üòê I would really love the app but for some reason it says every one of my photos has been deleted! I don't think I've ever deleted anything off of Facebook. But when I look at my Facebook memories the picture is there! Please fix this!!!
3661,Egopat,"October 3, 2015",2,"What happened to this app? I was really enjoying this app until the latest update. Now I keep getting the ""Time travel failed"" message. This has happened every day for the last four days. I try to refresh, kill the app and reopen, but still nothing... This is very frustrating and needs to be fixed ASAP or I'm deleting the app. There is no point in being told my time hop is ready to just get a time travel failed message every stinking time!"
3662,Carrie (west),"October 29, 2015",1,"Only shows FB pictures now, not statuses! This app was wonderful to check every day, but now it only shows my Instagram posts, my pictures posted to Facebook (which are the same Instagram pictures usually) and then my tweets. It doesn't show text status updates from Facebook, which I usually have plenty of!! The FB's ""On this day"" feature shows more than what Timehop does now, and that's sad since I like the sharing feature more for Timehop. Please fix this and give me back my status updates!"
3663,Goblue214,"November 13, 2015",4,One of my favorite apps This app makes posting old memories very convenient. I agree with several of the comments about the cropping. That could definitely be improved. It seems that if you're not careful you could eliminate a person or a portion of a person from the original photo. All in all I would rated four stars.
3664,JustWWFQueen,"December 17, 2015",5,"Jechelle My daughter kept telling me to get this app...I should have listened sooner! I love it, it's like my own personal journal! But I also wish there was a way to show all the pics/statuses in one screen. I'm constantly shocked at how a very similar thing happens on the exact same days for me. That's always fun to share!"
3665,StaC-62,"February 7, 2016",5,"I love Timehop I really enjoy Timehop.  There are other apps that will show your history--FB even has a version.  But I love it when Timehop notifies me of the past several years.  Most of all, I love their mascot!  His historic moments and little comments at the bottom of the page always make me smile.  Keep up the good work, folks. üòä"
3666,dqeryofdhorggi,"February 14, 2016",2,"Can't see stuff from 1 year ago I'm not really sure why but I can't see my memories from a year ago... Haven't been able to for a number of months now. Tried requesting my archives again but got nothing. I can't see everything else (2 years ago and on) but I can see nothing from 1 year ago, all it says it that there nothing to show, when I know for a fact that I have tweeted and stuff. Very annoying and I wish it would be fixed"
3667,Cyngood99,"April 5, 2016",5,Super memories app Much better than what FBook uses. Love the random memories that pop up! BUT I'd LOVE to be able to go back and review them another day.  I had a video that I didn't watch and it was gone the next day! I can't find it anywhere. üòí so remember to look at it each day.  There's no going back.
3668,all for honest reporting,"July 31, 2016",3,"Great app but... Timehop is a lot of fun, and really successfully integrates memories and posts from past years in an accessible and engaging way. However, in recent versions of the app, Timehop has tried to motivate it's users to check in every day, and does so through irritating push notifications that leave the user resentful and unwilling to open the app rather than motivated to see what memories await them today."
3669,Soooo funnnn temple runn,"August 18, 2016",2,"Language I really enjoy using the app. I love being reminded of memories I have since forgotten. I am very frustrated that on some of my photos time hop inserts a banner of its own using unwholesome language. I had a picture of me on a mission trip and TimeHop tagged the banner with the abbreviation ""AF"" and a praying emoji.  I was very upset. Curse words have also been in the banners. I'm not offended if others choose to use that language, but I choose not to and I don't appreciate it showing up on my pictures via TimeHop."
3670,Shanny68,"April 29, 2015",5,"Easy trip down memory lane I love this app. I've had only a couple of things I don't like about it. The biggest thing being that some things you share don't move over to Facebook in their whole form, such as just part of a picture. But for the most part, I love it!"
3671,AKGriggs,"May 22, 2015",5,"Wow this is amazing! I absolutely love that I can have this on my phone and to see what I was doing a year ago or longer! Absolutely fun to use and to see where I've been, what I've done, love this app highly recommended it and it makes it easy to share! Just sorry it took me so long to find it!"
3672,SwedeRunnings,"June 23, 2015",5,Great app really! In apps I'd never expected to get hooked too - this is awesome. Every day I get reminded of some great memory from the past. It has honestly become my moment of gratitude for the day. It takes me a minute a day but usually I fire it up and find myself smiling (or cringing) at something I forgot a long time ago.
3673,BA mom,"June 28, 2015",4,Good App I love being able to look back at my son and how he has changed over the years. I like that you can now position your pictures and chose different frames. Unfortunately I cannot get some pictures wide enough to show everything I want. That is my only complaint and why I went with 4 stars instead of 5.
3674,Insanedream,"June 28, 2015",5,Outstanding! What I love most about this app is the feature that allows you to link into your computer and cloud photos in addition to any social media updates/uploads. I have memories from 10 or in some cases 20 or more years ago that pop up from my computer. Phenomenal!
3675,Hgcruz,"July 7, 2015",2,"Used to be a good app This app used to be a good app. I used to love to go on every day and post pictures to Facebook and see memories of all that I've done in past years. But then they started adding stupid captions of things like Yolo and 'Merica with child-like cartoons and borders. And then they took away the best feature, ""now and then."" I am giving this review two stars because of how they changed things recently, otherwise I would give it five stars the way it used to be."
3676,Mee74268iyddtui,"July 25, 2015",5,"TimeHop Great app. Best time traveling app. The Dino is pretty cute too, just wish you could go backward with days. I missed a few days due to vacation and I can't go back and see them. Also wish I could share from the app to multiple sites. I can't share to insta fb and twitter at once. Just one site at a time."
3677,Juhhnayy,"July 26, 2015",4,Love it ! The only problem is that when you do the pictures you can't share the whole picture it wants to crop it really awkward ! And when I share an old tweet with a vine or a picture it doesn't share that just shares a picture of it ! Other than its a great reminder of all the ridiculous things I've done in life hahahaha
3678,Arnoldsmurf4,"July 27, 2015",5,This really is a convenient app and I love it! A lot of my old phones would stop working and I would loose my pictures with it. This way I can actually screen shot the pic and have it again. It's also cool to see what u posted 5 years ago or whenever you made your account!!
3679,Kellio_91,"August 28, 2015",3,"Overall, not bad. However lately most of my photos are considered ""deleted"" or do not ""reach 88 mph.""  Now I just use Facebook's ""On This Day,"" which is more reliable but unfortunately I don't always share my Instagrams and am missing things.  I'll probably delete the app in a week or two if it's still giving me problems.  It's great when it works, but pointless to have on my phone if it doesn't."
3680,Nikhil R Varma,"November 6, 2013",5,"Delightful to use. I love the core concept of the app. However, the amount of thought put into the design is really significant and it shows . The dragon in underpants when you pull the screen up and the ""you've made it to the top"" message in the settings screen had me cracking up. Very very well done."
3681,JayKay0811,"April 22, 2014",5,"Love! The first time I downloaded it, the app would not fully connect to Facebook, so I deleted and downloaded it again- works perfect. User friendly and easy to use. I have so many pictures on my phone and Facebook that it's really cool to see one selected at random one and two years who. I love it :)"
3682,Fashgal7,"October 7, 2014",3,"Well I love this app I find it very interesting to see what I said in the past. However it only gives me Twitter a year ago when I've had it for at least 3 year and tweeted all the time, also does the same with Facebook but only gives 3 years ago. In the display pics it shows the temp mine doesn't though. I'm not sure if it's just mine not working or no? It's been like this since I got it in the spring."
3683,Breeeeannnaaa,"November 30, 2014",4,"Wishes for timehop I love this app. There are just a few things I wish it did. I try to check it everyday but sometimes I don't get around to it. I wish it would let me see the days I missed. Also, I wish there was a way to book mark or favor certain posts instead of me having to screen shot every single thing. Again, I love the app."
3684,marcmariusmueller,"December 4, 2014",4,"Nice trip down memory lane I really enjoy seeing the reminders of things that happened in the past that I posted. The only thing that I miss is making it easier to ""export"" things. Sometimes I come across links I posted to websites that I would prefer to easily add to my reading list again but it feels difficult in the app right now"
3685,Smangs,"January 8, 2015",4,No longer works for iPhones! It won't post the pictures for iPhones. Only posts the words associated with the picture. Makes lots of us very sad!  The latest update did it. We have to take a screen shot of the photo in the app and then share it!  Won't be using it again until there is an update to fix this issue!
3686,Toooldtowin,"January 14, 2015",1,"Fun app, when it works. I don't know if there's a bug or if an update needs to be made but very often when I try to post a picture from this app it to Facebook or Twitter the picture doesn't show up. If there was a comment to that one along with the picture the comment will post but not the picture itself. This is very frustrating. The other issue is that it doesn't always open and show history at all. I end up having to delete the app and re download it. Double frustrating!"
3687,Steven Terrasas,"January 21, 2015",5,awesome! I love this app. The only thing I wish that was different is the videos would play and if you could read the articles you post or the things you post that aren't only status' that would make it 100x better. Would also be cool to read comments.
3688,Jpick1115,"February 26, 2015",4,Cool but could be cooler It's awesome to be able to go back to the same day a year ago or 7 years ago. But it would be even better if there was a way to open the original post and go back to look at all the comments again instead of only being able to post a photo of the original post.
3689,Nanabert58,"March 7, 2015",2,"Disappointed! I thought I would love this app but am seriously disappointed in it. First, why do I get a time hop notice if I haven't anything on that day, very annoying. Second, don't like the square picture format! Third, wish I could move the  "" this day .... "" writing where I want. Sometimes it ruins the pic. Fourth, if I miss a day I can't go back and use it. Why?  I don't care if it is a day off of the actual! Last, let me chose which pics to use from that day - don't pic for me!"
3690,JessWalker,"December 30, 2016",1,"Was Great - Update Ruined It Timehop. We all love you. We always have. We want you to put ads in because we want you to make money, that's not our complaint. The update is just not user friendly. We know your coders worked hard on it, but the way it was before was just better. "
3691,Ashb1508,"January 1, 2017",1,"New update is terrible The new update makes no sense. It's more work on the person trying to see their memories and the setup isn't conducive to easy viewing of the past years. Also, the app crashes half the time making it so I can't see the memories at all. This app seriously needs some work. If they're going to update, they should make it so comments can be viewed of posts and pictures, because the app lacks that ability. Facebook memories has it all over timehop at the moment."
3692,Amberkathleen89,"January 3, 2017",4,I loved I loved this app until they did the upgrade you cant see half of the things you wrote others are way to big to see and other wont let you share and i liked it when you could see other comments on what was written! Would have been 5 stars if it didn't have the new update
3693,Myahs mom,"January 16, 2017",1,"Bring back the old layout I love(ed) Timehop. One of the first apps I would open in the morning while drinking my coffee.  Since the update I have not liked it at all.  I can't see half of the things that show up because of the zoom and I can't zoom out and hold it there to see the picture.  I can't share videos, which was my favorite.  I love sharing old videos of my kids with family and friends.....not anymore!  Half of my ""memories"" show up blank. There's a box and a date but no picture."
3694,Rebel4,"February 10, 2017",1,"Change it back Look, this isn't like when Facebook updates it's layout and everybody wants to go back to what they're used to. Making it quicker won't work (especially when every update since the layout change hasn't improved the speed). Every person using the app wants to be able to speed through the timeline by swiping up. This doesn't work. If you want your 5 star average rating back, bring back the old layout. There was nothing wrong with it."
3695,Whitethingy,"February 28, 2017",5,"Loathe it. Yet love it I love whenever I find out that I'm wearing the exact same shirt I was wearing exactly one or two or three or four or five or six or even seven years ago. I hate reading Facebook statuses from seven years ago. They're usually flat out embarrassing. But then again, it's a good reminder of how much I've matured"
3696,Dhayner,"March 7, 2017",1,Great in the past... I don't like it anymore :( I have loved Timehop for years. I used to share the photos with my friends and now with the new update it crops the pictures so i can't see the full picture. It also doesn't allow you to share videos. I am going to look for another app soon if it doesn't change to be more user friendly. Take notice of these recent horrible reviews Timehop! I like to see all the pictures! Please don't group them together into a weird collage or crop the photos!
3697,erin marie<3,"March 17, 2017",1,"Pathetic NEW REVIEW: You morons have lost another user. I put one star because there isn't a zero star option. Not only is the now three or so month old update not any better than when it first appeared, now the app has glitched, logged me completely out and thus restarted my streak that I had going. You people need to figure your crap out because the app is UNUSABLE. It is pure GARBAGE. Good luck fixing your pitiful rating. I won't be downloading your app ever again. I implore others to follow suit so that maybe you guys will get your act together."
3698,Sugarglorykid,"September 8, 2017",1,Awful. 9/8/17 edit: the app refuses to show anything but photos from all my linked accounts. I'm so over TimeHop being terrible. 
3699,Jcb34thr,"September 18, 2017",5,"Still issues with the updates I am in the camp of loving the former version of Timehop but really not liking the update at all. When there is a video, I get a screen wth a still shot, then the video plays behind/underneath the still shot, so there is no way to view the video."
3700,cjbriare,"February 17, 2016",5,Doesn't Actually Travel in Time I was very dissatisfied after downloading this app that it did not actually let you travel trough time. All it does is open a window to your dark past and has you reflect on how dumb you were x amount of years ago. 10/10.
3701,PFS122,"May 10, 2016",3,"Yeesh, yeah...not a good update Update: It looks like they've disabled the autoplay on the video, which is great. Now if we could only save photos..."
3702,Tomreard,"September 14, 2016",3,Won't load most pics I've been using this app for about a year and I really enjoy it. But over the past month and a half or so it has been struggling to try to load photos. Gives me messages like wasn't able to get up to speed. I don't understand hope you can fix it. I would even pay a little bit to get rid of the ads and make this app better
3703,jessiestudio,"December 23, 2016",4,"Great update, until you want to share a video... The new update is great and far more fun to scroll through however the new set up makes it impossible to share videos from your past with friends. A real shame especially in an era where videos are surpassing still photography in most social platforms."
3704,Soccerpupie,"December 24, 2016",1,"Horrible I always click the ""no thanks"" button when an app asks me to write a review but my God I could not pass this up. This update is terrible. The apps need to stop trying to be one another. This WAS my favorite app to go on every day to see my old stuff but now it is way too cluttered and the best part has been taken away. I want to be able to click on my old tweets so they open up in Twitter and I can view all the comments and same goes with all the other social media apps. What a disappointment."
3705,Jmichelle23476,"December 24, 2016",1,"Horrible Update - Will Stop Using Until Fixed The new update is absolutely horrendous. It used to be so easy to scroll up and down, read comments and likes from the original post, which is usually even the best part. Now the need to tap through and zoom out, is ridiculous. If you want to go back to the first picture you have to sit there and tap/swipe a bunch of times?! I was enjoying having a timehop streak but I will absolutely stop using the app until it's fixed. So disappointed."
3706,Monannabb,"December 26, 2016",4,"Worst update ever I know you were trying to make this app more useful and modern by updating it like this, but it definitely makes it WAY harder to do anything on here. I don't even enjoy reading my old posts on here because of how badly they all show up from the update. Please fix this and change it back to the normal format"
3707,Katiagg,"December 28, 2016",1,Update RUINED THIS APP I loved this app I have used it for years. The new update is horrible. Photos are zoomed in to center as well as video you have to zoom each one out. You can't share easy now. They made it tap to flip to next image and the share thinks you want to flip to next image. You can no longer share videos. If this isn't fixed I will not use it after the New Year. I am willing to allow them time and read all the bad reviews but a once peaceful enjoyment in my morning is a stressfully headache now!!!
3708,Es_erika,"December 29, 2016",1,"Hate the UPDATE! I don't have Snapchat but even I know that this is what the newest update has turned Timehop into. I absolutely hate it! Like many of the hate reviews right now I hate 1) zoomed in pictures (absolutely ridiculous), 2) unable to see the photo captions (half the memory!), and 3) swiping past each post (scrolling is universally simpler!). I've honestly considered uninstalling and just sticking with Facebook Memories. If nothing changes that's just what I'll do because Timehop has lost it's purpose in trying to appeal to Snappers üòí"
3709,sullivanrp1019,"December 30, 2016",1,"The update ruined the app Timehop used to be a lot of fun. It was easy to see the progression of your own posts, and even look back at comments on those posts it was a breeze to share something."
3710,Crayolapencils3292,"June 13, 2015",5,Thanks for reminding me how embarrassing I was Every morning I look forward to reading how embarrassing I was 4+ years ago lol. When does the app progress to the next day though? Shouldn't it happen at midnight? I'm convinced it tracks your activity and only moves to the next day after a good nights sleep. Who knows. Love Timehop.
3711,Err_merrr_gerrd,"June 16, 2015",5,Time hop Time hop is awesome it works really well. The only thing I would like to see is if there was an option to put the words with the picture you put up. Other than that it's a great app. You see how far you have come and who you may have been with five years ago.
3712,Jen530@,"July 20, 2015",5,"Love it This app is one of my all time favorites. I love seeing what my kids looked like and what we were doing last year, 2 years ago, 3 years ago, etc. I love seeing flashbacks of when me and my husband were dating, engaged, and newlyweds. It's amazing and I look forward to opening this app everyday."
3713,sixtyeightwhiskey,"August 28, 2015",5,It's a neat app. I like it. It's cool to be able to see stuff I posted/shared and stuff my friends posted/shared from the day I created my Facebook without having to scroll through my whole profile. I also love that you can sync your photos and videos to your Timehop account. It's just a fun app to use.
3714,Tigerslate,"September 24, 2015",3,Love the App but..... I have loved this app & look forward to seeing my old pictures & videos everyday but lately I don't always get to see them. I get error messages telling me my pics won't load & now it never uploads my pictures from Instagram. Today it's telling me the app isn't connected to the Internet. But my internet connection is fine. So I wish these issues could be resolved!
3715,Je'Niece,"September 25, 2015",5,Great App This is a great app to use for your memories.  It's a great way to look back and refresh your memory on great moments in your life. The only thing I wish for is a way to be able to access dates through a search--without the restriction of having to wait for each day.
3716,Kaosmom,"October 16, 2015",3,"Used to be better 6 months ago this would have been a 5 star review. However, due to the glitches, Timehop has been pointless to look at for the past couple of months. My photos almost never show up, and I'm sick of seeing the ""job in politics"" message (which wasn't funny even the first time I saw it). Please fix this so I can go back to enjoying my daily trips down memory lane."
3717,amoreau,"November 12, 2015",5,"My history in one app I really enjoy this app, it is my way to know what I did that day on previous years. It is fun to have the opportunity to recap everything in one place."
3718,Adam Dee,"December 22, 2015",5,"Changed how I view social media Posts are no longer to friends or followers. They're to an audience I should care more about: my future self. Now checking in on foursquare, tweeting, and more are diaries to myself. A year or more from now, if I want to know where I was or what I was thinking, Timehop tells me."
3719,Dis niggahhhh,"December 26, 2015",4,"Good App It's a great app for viewing photos and it syncs up with so many social media sites. I think the push notifications for when other people viewed is too over the top, but don't particularly mind knowing if other people have viewed the same photo as me. The app itself functions well and I've never had any problems with it."
3720,Lizzyc152x2,"June 10, 2014",4,"Great fun app This app is great, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish you could go back to see posts that you missed if you forgot to check it one day. It would also be fun to be able to type in a date to see what you posted on that particular date! But other than that, I think it's a fun app!"
3721,Ilovesballyhoo,"July 22, 2014",5,"Look back in time A great way to remember what you were going through one, two, three, four years ago!  It's a great way to see how you've changed as a person, or just to remember old times.  Five stars! I look forward to getting my notification for a new TimeHop every day."
3722,Dani2.0,"August 30, 2014",4,Love it! Very entertaining. I love looking at this every day! It does exactly what it says it would do. It would be awesome if we could see the go back and see past days for a short amount of time though...maybe even just a week? Also it doesn't recognize yfrog which is what I used on twitter way back when! But I'm sure all I have to do is sign on.
3723,macdiesel4,"September 17, 2014",5,The best app! Love looking back at my sweet babies! Great app! Love seeing my children when they were babies! And the end of day facts always make me smile...Can't get enough of this app! Friends this one is a must buy!!! No I don't have to go back and pull out the old dusty photo albums! This is a easy quick album with no hustle!
3724,sjdfhdjksncjkse,"February 8, 2015",4,"I love this app, but... I love seeing history from a specific day, but when I want to share a photo, the app crops it to a square! This cuts off important parts of the photo, so it's pointless to share. Also, I like the new option to add text, but there should be a way to keep the old text too, sometimes that's just as important as the photo itself!"
3725,himynameisscott,"March 6, 2015",3,"Used to work great, now pictures don't work This app worked wonderfully back in the summer, and what a great concept. Unfortunately the last month or so, not one picture loads correctly. I have even gone onto facebook to see if the picture was still there, and it was. If they can work the tweaks out, this app would get 5 stars. Oh and add myspace? I would love to see what I was doing 10 years ago!"
3726,feld-a-mundo,"March 16, 2015",5,"Simple app, part of my daily routine, helps improve memory I've checked my Timehop app daily for more than a year because it brings back memories of where I was and what I was saying. It actually helps improve my memory because it reminds me of little moments that I'd otherwise never revisit."
3727,Vlllgg123,"March 23, 2015",5,Fun! The title is self explanatory. Timehop searches all of your various social media accounts and phone to find pictures or statuses that were a year ago to the day. Sometimes if applicable years ago. It takes all the work out of strolling down memory lane. The facts are always fun or interesting. Great concept and execution.
3728,Bfegan,"April 27, 2015",3,"Was a 5-star app until... It started cropping all photos to squares. That's obviously fine for Instagram, but I frequently want to share my photos to Facebook or directly save the memories to my phone. I can't understand why there's no option to save/share photos at the size they were shot. I used to use this daily, but without being able to save memories what's the point?"
3729,Randy C 1977,"June 1, 2015",5,Updates I liked the last version better need to change it where when you share 3 years ago you can select all the photos and share in one shot please fix this in your next update then it would be a five star app
3730,Logan Janis,"February 4, 2014",5,"Great way to reminisce! This app is great for people like me. Ive always had trouble remembering when ""that"" happened. 2 years ago? 5? Last week? But this app sends me blasts from my past daily. Keeping me in touch with time. AND letting me get nostalgic now and then too. Bravo. Can't wait to see what updates come along!"
3731,Sasha_Smith11,"March 3, 2014",2,"Is it recording all the time? I love TimeHop, it's my favorite app. I love reading what I've posted in the past. However, in the past few weeks, the first post is always a big camera button and it says ""TimeHop Today"". That doesn't bother me. But if I open my TimeHop more than once in one day, it shows a video of my face, apparently while I've been on my phone. Why does it do this and how do I stop it?? I don't want it to record anything without me telling it to. It's kind of creepy."

3733,Jonel Rodina,"March 11, 2014",5,"Love this app! Maybe it's because I have kids, but I love this app. I have it synced with Fb, Instagram, and my computer. So I get to see pictures of my kids as they grow up every day. It's really nice to have that instantly on my phone and spend a few minutes reminiscing. I love this app. Would recommend to anyone!"
3734,Njaspersen,"May 15, 2014",4,"Love this app but wish I could go back This app is very fun!! I love seeing what my family was doing on this day in years past. I just wish I could swipe left and see the previous days. Once it goes to the next day, the day before is completely gone unless you screen shot all the pictures. Then I would give it a full 5 stars."
3735,Poan26,"May 28, 2014",5,"Walking down Memory Lane I don't normally write reviews. Actually, this is my first review."
3736,Knewbey,"January 22, 2017",5,Now a disaster You guys really messed up with this most recent over haul. Bring back the frames and ease of navigation. Right now half of my pictures and texts get cut off by the screen size. I'm completely baffled by why you have done this. Just truly terrible now.
3737,elbeach,"January 23, 2017",1,time to stop. The new interface is not only irritating but useless. The tap/swipe right or left idea is overplayed and impractical and I'm not sure what was wrong with the scroll.
3738,BrittneyyyKayyy,"February 23, 2017",1,Doesn't upload to Facebook I've been using timehop for a long time and never had issues. Now I can't post any of my memories to my Facebook and this happened all of a sudden. Once I choose which to upload to Facebook it just going to a black screen with a half circle. I've uninstalled both app and lost my amazing days streak and it still doesn't work. My entire phone and all my apps are up to date also. Once this is fixed I will definitely change to 5 stars. Thanks!
3739,smith37,"March 29, 2017",1,"New interface utterly ruined app Wonderful concept which I've used daily for a long time to see photos of my family, etc. BUT the developers attempted to change the interface to a Snapchat-esque style and completely ruined the app. I can no longer send videos to friends and family, there are all kinds of audio issues, and things don't load often. Used to love the app, but now I'm just hoping they revert back to the previous version because it's been really messed up."
3740,aidanwahl,"December 31, 2016",1,"Please change back I don't write reviews but after updating I've felt I just had to so they hopefully see we are very unhappy. The old layout was absolutely great. Sharing is now much harder and what happened to comparing before and after?!?! I hate that it's zoomed in by default and it just really takes away from the experience. I miss the old Timehop. Please don't be like the rest of app developers who ignore users when they ""update"" something. Timehop was different and special. Don't become what they are"
3741,alidobs729,"January 1, 2017",3,"New update is awful I used to love this app because I'm obsessed with the streak and love seeing my day in history but the new update makes it so difficult to see everything and has oversimplified every previous tweet, instagram and picture that it shows from each day. Timehop was much better before this last update and I'm considering stopping use of the app because of it"
3742,Apburke3,"January 5, 2017",1,"Bring back the old TimeHop! As all of the other recent reviews share, the current version of TimeHop is extremely frustrating to work with! I'm frustrated with: 1) The zoomed in photos and having to hold the screen to zoom out. This is such an unneeded addition. 2) Not seeing the likes and comments from old posts. I really enjoyed the ""most like post of xxxx year"" feature. That was really nostalgic! 3) No scroll down feature. That was so much more efficient. Please bring back the old version."
3743,Days of the week,"January 8, 2017",1,"Still no I waited three weeks for you to do the simple thing and revert back to the previous version of Timehop, but instead you only added back a single feature (which never should have been removed as it's the most important feature of the app.) "
3744,wenc,"January 8, 2017",1,"WHY ABE,  WHYYYYüò´üò© UPDATE1.9.17"
3745,Paige788788,"January 8, 2017",1,"Whyyyyyyyyy This used to be one of my favorite apps. I loved it because it was fun to look back on the past years and see what was happening YTD, and the app made it very easy to quickly scroll through the pictures, see them, smile and then be done. Now, using Timehop is very annoying. I HATE that I have to go picture by picture. It takes too long and is not efficient. I really wish they would at least give the option to see all the pictures at once like the original Timehop."
3746,Alyssa2073829,"January 12, 2017",1,"Why? This was such a great app, but you ruined it by trying to format it like a Snapchat or Instagram story. Where did the captions go? Those are my favorite part. Also, I don't like having to zoom out to see my posts, and like I said they don't even make sense without captions. I have checked TimeHop every morning for about a year, but y'all ruined it."
3747,Myrandan,"January 13, 2017",1,"Completely worthless after upgrade Update did not fix any of the crucial problems from the last update that made the system virtually useless. Deleting this app and looking for a better solution. No longer user friendly. Having a video or slideshow of memories should be optional, not the only option. Saving and sharing memories is now impossible depending on media type, and the swiping function is not fool proof. Why fix what there wasn't broken? Boo, Timehop... this was a major downgrade."
3748,xjp,"January 16, 2017",1,"An update too far... Timehop used to be decent, but the company self destructed with the latest updates. The app is now pretty much unusable. "
3749,Arayc86,"January 21, 2017",1,Edited review since last update Brings back things I had forgotten about completely. Great app.
3750,KarenJSx,"December 24, 2016",1,"Stay away from the update, if possible The new UI is just inexplicable. Photos are weirdly zoomed. You accidentally tap anywhere and you've moved on, or back, or who the heck knows. And, Worst of all, you don't get to see if your Facebook posts had any comments to them. It's just what you wrote as a status update, with no other context. It's such a bummer."
3751,AkrosWeddings,"December 24, 2016",3,"Fire whoever created this update Holy cow. I've never seen an app go from 10 to 0 over one update. I can't see captions anymore, I can't look at comments on the posts, I can't share videos, there's obnoxious music playing on loop, if I touch the screen to try to figure things out, it skips to the next page. Honestly THIS is the worst update I've ever seen. You killed this app. The app was great before this."
3752,waningsanity,"December 25, 2016",1,"Terrible update. Seriously. This update is horrible and not easy to use. I'm sure someone thought this would streamline things, but if you need an instruction manual to use a simple photo timeline app, then they are doing wrong. I can no longer compare now and then photos and everything is zoomed in cutting off comments and pictures. Sure I can zoom them in, but it's annoying for each one. Hopefully, they'll fix this disaster update, but if not, I'm uninstalling and sticking with the imperfect Facebook one."
3753,Megzmann,"December 25, 2016",1,"Terrible Update! I agree with all the other long time users. This update is awful. I hate having to zoom out on every photo and you can't even watch videos because they are so zoomed in. It is confusing having the pictures separated from the comments. It's just plain terrible. Designers should have put the pencil down a long time ago. Should have spent more time on testing this app out first.  Eagerly awaiting another update, that makes this app more users friendly, like it used too be."
3754,Benjakdkkddddx,"December 25, 2016",5,"I USED to love Timehop :-( What did you do?!?! And WHY??? This was such an amazing app and you ruined it!! There was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Please fire the person who suggested this horrible change and go back to the old format. I would literally pay $1 for the old app. Terrible update, please fix ASAP!!"
3755,cfleming711,"December 27, 2016",1,New Update BITES I've used Timehop for a very long time now and I absolutely love seeing my old memories but I hate the new update. It makes me not want to use the app at all. You only get pictures with no captions and you can't open the images or text in their original app. Almost everyday on Timehop I see an old tweet and I open it in Twitter to retweet it again. Now I don't have the option to do that. Most of the time I don't even understand the tweets cause it's just the photo with no caption. This update is absolutely awful.
3756,jmk0428,"December 28, 2016",1,new update is AWFUL i didn't find anything wrong with the way timehop was and then came this update.. holy crap i hate every second of it. i loved that you used to be able to click on the time stamp and it would take you right to that post. i liked scrolling and seeing things from the past and not having to click to go forward or back. they've eliminated all of the features that everyone loves about timehop. I have deleted the app because of how awful it is. not wasting my time.
3757,Pdoobs,"December 29, 2016",1,üëé Update to my previous 5 star review... 
3758,Jsmoke180,"December 30, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE UPDATE This update is horrific. Absolutely horrific. Now you have to swipe through each memory as if this is Tinder or a dating app. For those of us with a lot of things to look back on who just like to scroll down, this is unnecessary, cumbersome, and unacceptable. "
3759,Skilla82,"December 30, 2016",1,"Go back, this update was a waste. I would think that the fact that your current version has one star average should tell you something. The update was atrocious. It's ugly, clunky, terrible. Why have every photo zoomed in? Why group photos into these weird framed collage things when I just want to see the photos by themselves? Why have it be a tap through system? You aren't Snapchat guys and we don't want you to be. It works very poorly in this version. Just go back. Pretend this one never happened."
3760,megsbrunk,"May 4, 2016",2,New Update is a flop The retrovid is a good idea. I don't mind it. I just wish that the sound wasn't playing automatically. A much better way to go about it would be to have it be like snapchat or Instagram where the sound only turns on after you hit a volume key or tap on the video.
3761,petron71,"May 8, 2016",5,"Horrible, useless app It's absolutely horrible. You can't even share your memories anymore, what's the point in Timehop if you can't share. "
3762,Husteadfam,"May 19, 2016",5,"Works after you shut your phone down After the last update, it wouldn't open. But after I shut my phone completely down, it worked when I turned my phone back on.  I love seeing posts from the past!"
3763,camarokween94,"July 6, 2016",5,"It's cool It's a good way to see all post, snaps, and comments from all social media including the camera roll. Only there used to be this awesome 1 minute video that would play what happens on this day from the first game boy to music videos to historic events. But it's gone, you should bring that back"
3764,Milesdaguy,"October 25, 2016",4,"It's amazing, but could be a bit better Let me just start: this app is amazing. It does it's job, and keeps people happy. But I have only two problems: first, my app doesn't remind me daily, even when I have something on it. Second, I used to make a lot of vines. If you guys could make Vine an option, if be a happy customer. Thanks!!! ;-)"
3765,MiladyOfScott,"December 15, 2016",4,New glitch after update I love Timehop and use it daily (for the past 217 day!) however it recently developed a glitch where it shows the first few words of a post and you cannot read the rest of it unless you tap share. This glitch happened after a recent update. Running Timehop on an iPhone 6S with iOS 10.2
3766,Nateri,"December 20, 2016",5,"Usually one of my fav apps - glitching lately Usually one of my favorite apps. I love seeing my past posts today in history. Lately it has been glitching and only displaying one line. This is very frustrating, making the app virtually pointless. Hopefully an update fixes this soon."
3767,Cacher101,"December 23, 2016",1,"New format ruins app This new format has ruined my user experience. Hold to zoom? I want to see the whole picture without having to touch the screen thereby blocking the picture. How do I know if I need to zoom or not? I have to touch the screen to find out. Then, if there is no zoom it goes to the next picture. The previous version allowed you to see all the pics easily and scroll around easily. Now it's inefficient and too hard to get an overview of your pics. "
3768,Does THIS name exist??? üò°üò°,"December 23, 2016",1,"Bring back the old timehop! I've been using timehop for a while now and I used to love it, but this update is just a little too much for me. Why do we have to zoom out in order to see our full pictures? Why do we have to click through like a slideshow to see every single picture? Now timehop is more complicated and harder to use. I liked the old version much better and I don't see the need to completely change it. If it ain't broke (and people enjoy it just the way it is), don't fix it!"
3769,TabzKat,"December 23, 2016",5,New version has bugs I love this app but with this update I can not share videos and that is very disappointing because I have videos of my son I would love to post today and I can not because I do not have the option to share videos anymore. Fix this ASAP
3770,Mefastophalese,"August 4, 2015",5,Love this app!!! I love this app because I love seeing sweet pictures of my babies grow up. Everyday I look and see pictures of my daughter from 5 years ago or a year ago. At times it makes me want to actually time travel lol. Especially when I see pictures of beach vacations I went on.
3771,Diajon6060,"August 12, 2015",4,Love to see the pictures I took before and share them too I like seeing the memories from 3 or 4 years ago . I love that I can share them today I don't use the frames much because I they cover up too muck of the picture and they are not the best . I have some trouble opening the app since I updated it this time not sure why .
3772,TuckerFam4,"August 31, 2015",5,Love this app! I use this app daily! I'm always excited when my daily Time Hop is ready so I can experience what I shared on that day. The kids pictures really warm my heart when I the silly stunts they were doing and how much they have grown. Oh and the added historical facts at the bottom are a great added bonus!
3773,Weedelicious,"September 1, 2015",5,"Does what it says it will I have timehop connected to my iPhoto, my Facebook, my Twitter, and more. I've had it go back as far as 8 years, to when I was in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL in iPhoto. Sometimes seeing my past is bittersweet. But that's all part of the package. I love checking this app every morning and seeing what has changed about me."
3774,Timbfisher,"September 13, 2015",5,"The best time travel app Timehop is a handy time travel device that allows me to manipulate space time. Let me explain: I get to go through my old photos and it'll say things like, ""throwback Thursdays"" when I post to Facebook or MySpace. I don't know the color. What is this Google with a phone? Google voice?"
3775,PokerStart,"September 27, 2015",2,"Where are my pictures? I have had this app for a while now and I love it. But just recently I haven't been able to see my pictures. I know for a fact that I haven't deleted any of them but when I open the app most my pictures say ""looks like someone is trying to get a job in politics."" I though that maybe updated the app would fix it. I was wrong. Most of my TimeHop is picture and if I can't see them it's pointless to keep the app."
3776,LindseyMaye,"October 11, 2015",3,"I like it I look forward to waking up and looking at my time hop, but most of my pictures don't load! I try reloading them and it just doesn't work! I can only hope that I post these pictures of Facebook as well as Instagram so I can see what they are! Really disappointed that my Instagram pictures don't load! All it says is pictures haven't reached 88 mph! And they won't load even I I retry!"
3777,Lexxxiiixox,"November 24, 2015",3,"Pretty good This app is pretty good, but sometimes you might miss a day or two checking timehop, so you should be able to go back and view the days that you've missed! That's really the only criticism I have towards this app, but it really bothers me because I like to see what happened over the past few years. That should really be included in the next update and it would be perfect!!üòä"
3778,Deletefeaturepls,"January 13, 2016",2,Needs a delete feature Why is there not a feature where I can go back into the original post then delete it if I want to? This needs to happen. I hate seeing embarrassing things I posted and don't have the time to scroll through years of posts just to find it. Just let me delete them!!!!!!!! I have also updated this review at least twice and I know I'm not the only one who feels this way so do something about it
3779,"Nic C, MA","March 12, 2016",5,"Look forward to see what happened X years ago! This app is great. I enjoy opening it and seeing memories from 1, 2, 3, or 8 years ago. Think this is a great app when you have kids to be able to remember and see her back in the day. I definitely recommend it!"
3780,Icantfindanicknameomg,"February 10, 2015",2,"This photo has been deleted :( Since the recent update, EVERY SINGLE PHOTO in my time hop shows ""this photo has been deleted :("" I know that I haven't deleted all of these photos and posts for weeks in a row. I absolutely love this app, I think it's great to look back and see my old facebook statuses and pictures I've posted on Instagram. I am going to delete it until I see this fixed, because not being able to see my photos defeats the purpose of this app."
3781,Amy4582,"March 6, 2015",4,"Great idea but execution needs work I LOVE this app for my phone, but the iPad version is extremely buggy.  Crashes a lot, I have lots of trouble scrolling.  Sometimes when I try to share a picture on Facebook, it just posts a Timehop banner with the text that I added, but the picture doesn't show. "
3782,Lady.ariel,"March 21, 2015",4,"Fun app! For all of us nostalgics out there, this is a great app!"
3783,Shelbyluwho,"March 31, 2015",5,"Love the ability to do then and now! I look forward to it everyday, I love watching my kids grow up and seeing what the last couple years have been, brings back memories! Some happy, some sad. Love the updates with text and then and now, and the Doctor Who references!"
3784,Twf0214,"May 12, 2015",4,Great App... BUT.... It's a great app in that it shows you everything from this day for as long as you been on social media.... But don't even try and repost from the app because it will crop the living daylights out of your picture. Usually to the point of making what you're trying to repost impossible to figure out for others.
3785,Amandah616,"May 30, 2015",5,"LOVE THIS!! Getting this app was 1 of the main reasons I wanted a new iPhone. I had run out of space on my 4s, and I was so jealous of everyone that had this. Now I get to enjoy all the memories stored over the last 1,2,3,....6years!! I have always loved remembering dates and love to remind ppl of what we were doing a year ago, ect... Now TIMEHOP does it for me :-) THANKS TIMEHOP!!"
3786,gabyyyy,"June 15, 2015",5,"Love!! I love the app. I linked my facebook, Instagram and Foursquare. It's great checking it every day and be reminded about fun/special moments that happened years ago. It's easy to share the pictures that come up via text or social, so my friends and family are enjoying the results too :)"
3787,Hdi111121,"July 14, 2015",5,"Awesome I love this app! It is a walk down memory lane! My dog died in October and when it shows me pics I took and posted 1 or more years ago it shows me that pic was taken on this day however many years ago! The only thing I don't like is seeing posts about my ex. But it's still a memory, right?!?!"
3788,Lost but always found,"July 25, 2015",4,"Great app but... This is an awesome app, but sometimes things show up that you never posted to Facebook ... Like I saved images to my phone last year and they show up on my time line...so although they was never shared on Facebook they still pop up and remind me why I did or did not share in the first place! Still my favorite app!"
3789,Melissa777,"July 27, 2015",1,"Some frames not appropriate This app in itself is a good idea. The update that includes the frames were also a good idea. However, this app is rated ages 4+. At the time of this review, a couple of the frames are certainly not appropriate for a 4 year old. I'm sure a 4 year-old doesn't use this app. However, some older kids do. The initials for some of the frames stand for saying that include curse words and are not appropriate for older kids either. Hope these particular ones end up being removed, but as for me, I'm deleting the app."
3790,KingOfGotham,"January 10, 2013",2,"No Facebook = No Sign Up I don have a Facebook but I'm on almost every other network listed in the app, and it would be nice if we could sign in with Twitter of Instagram. I know that ""Facebook-only"" could be because of the way it populates certain fields that twitter or instagram just can't, but it would be awesome if you could figure this out soon! Until then I'll give it 2 stars bc even though it's non-functional for non-fb users, it's very well designed."
3791,Elaine Lambert,"July 31, 2014",5,"Unbelievable MUST TRY! Brilliant job developers!  Take a lot to motivate this app junkie to write a review.  I can tell app is updated then based on feedback, and the fact it only notifies you daily (can't currently search other dates) will keep it on user's radar.  I often play with a cool new app and forget about it."
3792,eayovino,"August 15, 2014",2,"Only goes back 3 years or less When I first saw people using this I thought it was such a great idea that would make looking at your profile content from years ago more organized. But after I downloaded I was disappointed to find that it only went back 3 years! I've been using social media for 10 years, since Facebook started, and stuff that was posted around that time is much more interesting to see. Deleted."
3793,lmwenner,"September 8, 2014",5,"So fun to look back This app lets you look back at any digital activity from past years. Pictures, Facebook, see what you tweeted. It's a lot of fun to remember that stuff. The only downside I've seen is that timehop can see you did something, but I'm guessing the API doesn't pull the info through."
3794,Ohiofan197410,"October 12, 2014",5,What a great reminder of things past The last 15 months have been extremely difficult to me because of an injury. I documented a lot of the progress for friends/family through posts. It's great to now look back and realize how far I've come. Thank you!!
3795,Brittmcd90,"January 25, 2015",4,I hate the recent update I liked this app until the most recent update that takes way too long to just share a picture. Now you have to do it one at a time and it goes to Facebook every single time before you can move on to next thing you want to share. I'd like for timehop to go back to how it initially was.
3796,Dradd21,"February 10, 2015",5,"Great app - love looking back I have used this app for a while now and really enjoy looking back at the pictures posted over the years.  It's cool to see your kids grow up and take a walk down memory lane.  You might even wonder, what the hell was I thinking when I shared that!?!?  Lessons can be learned!"
3797,Ashleyyyyyann,"May 11, 2017",1,"So many updates so little fixes It doesn't matter if I JUST checked time hop one minute ago or 10 hours ago, I still constantly have a notification to check time hop... even with my notifications turned off.... If I already opened the app for the day, then stop badgering me ALL DAY!!! I keep thinking this is something you'll fix with your endless updates but it's never been solved. It's enough to have me delete the app, and just look back on my life via facebooks on this day feature."
3798,skyiffland,"September 17, 2017",5,"Ignore the negativity, this app is great! I don't know why this app isn't working for people but it works fine for me, Abe is great and the service is great, much better than Facebook's version. Now if they had a paid version (say $.99) to get rid of the ads it would be even better!"
3799,AJcobb0824,"September 23, 2017",1,Saving photo option doesn‚Äôt work. I did the ios11 update on my iPhone 7plus. Once I did the update I am no longer able to save my photos from Timehop. Timehop sends me a pop up saying I need to give access to my phone so I went into my settings where I was told to go and everything has access so I don‚Äôt get why I can‚Äôt save. Anyone else having this problem? Please check into this and fix it Timehop. I love your app and just want to be able to save my photos without having to screenshot it.
3800,Tiff in Florida,"January 20, 2017",1,"Horrible after update Most days, I get the ""re-try"" error message instead of getting to see my old photos. This used to be my favorite app to check every day, but now it's just awful. When photos do load, navigation through the app is difficult and not intuitive at all. It's like the developers tried to see how many ways they could make the app worse than before. I hope another app takes its place so I can go back to reviewing photos from the past."
3801,Cutegirloutthere,"January 22, 2017",1,Hate the new layout Time hop was great before when you could see each individual post from previous years. However this new layout is trying way too hard to be a snapchat story and it honestly just doesn't make sense with this type of app. I hate it. I hate that it zooms into pictures unnecessarily. They also took away the feature where you could click links to see the original post/get more context. Horrible update. They need to change it back.
3802,Gradstudent24,"January 23, 2017",1,"Awful Update Your update made Timehop terrible.  I can either barely see the pictures (multiple small pictures on the screen) or the pictures are way too large for the screen.  Enlarging or shrinking pictures is pretty much impossible since it switches pictures as soon as you hit the screen.  Your newest update did nothing to fix the app, from what I can tell you just added more ads!  I'm getting rid of this app.  Facebook basically does the same thing anyways."
3803,Abbes7,"January 26, 2017",5,Undo the update Please bring back the previous layout.  I updated last night sadly and this is awful :-(((. I would have given it five stars before today.  My kids and I extremely enjoyed looking through Timehop but today was measurable.
3804,Kcant002,"January 28, 2017",1,"I used to LOVE timehop I checked my timehop every day and sent at least one memory to friends or family every day and they always loved it! My timehop streak was well over 100. Now it's hard to share photos, it's annoying to go through my memories, and the ads are obtrusive. It used to be great when I could scroll through and casually look at my memories, but now Timehop is trying to be like a Snapchat story. I hate Snapchat stories and I never check them. I'm lucky if I get a timehop streak of 1 now. I hate the new timehop."
3805,AlJoGaJo,"January 30, 2017",1,Bring back the old version! Just from the few reviews I've read it seems many others share my same sentiments. I don't like not being able to see full posts and comments! What's the point of a TimeHop when you can't actually see what happened on that day? The original version was great and very user friendly so why the change? Just let us scroll and click on the image that will actually let us view the original post! Please listen to reviews!
3806,Ashlini,"February 8, 2017",1,Old version was so much better The new update is trash. The amount of tapping you have to do is ridiculous. I hate that they group together photos that you can't even look at or save/share. The way they show your old tweets is also terrible. It's now way more difficult to see the entire conversation your tweet was a part of. Please please change the format back. I would think that with this many negative reviews there would be a change by now..... bad business plan.
3807,Paul in NY,"March 10, 2017",2,"What once was good , now is not as good This app used to be much more user friendly. The app is now too buggy, frequently losing connections with connected accounts."
3808,bluelunatique,"April 6, 2017",5,You ruined the app. Links in posts aren't able to be copied or clicked. No galleries of images mean you have to click through each on individually. Stupid!!!!
3809,LewisDG,"April 26, 2017",5,"Keep your history in mind While there are some glitches with this version, in general I LOVE Timehop. Being able to see this day in history is fantastic. Nearly every day I share a photo or post from past years. "
3810,souma968,"December 28, 2016",1,"Please bring back the ability to view posts in context. 90% of why I enjoyed this app was that I could tap on the tweets / Facebook posts / Instagrams right from Timehop and view the likes and comments from that period in time. THAT was truly a time capsule in of itself, rather than just giving me a snapshot of the posts with no other context. Maybe I'm just being vain, but I liked seeing who liked and commented on those things at that time, it helped me to truly relive those times via this app. No longer."
3811,bdashrad,"December 28, 2016",5,"Terrible user experience and design. I never write reviews, but this update is so terrible I had to warn others. Sure, it looks cool, but it's harder to view individual photos and videos, and harder go through the past, which I'm pretty sure is the whole point of the app."
3812,Haley_Diane,"December 28, 2016",1,New Update Makes Me Want to Delete the App I am completely disappointed in the new update. I use to get so excited to open time hope and really enjoyed the simplicity and clear experience of looking through all of my memories. Now it's so confusing and the app makes no sense. I now hate opening it because of how complicated and ridiculous the new update had made it. The zoom is horrible and I can't even tell what my memories actually are..Please just revert it back to the old version!
3813,Sarah768,"December 29, 2016",4,New update is awful I love time hop but it doesn't load half of the time.
3814,babygirlshelbs1997,"December 30, 2016",1,"no to the update i just updated my time hop, i already don't like it. And as i scrolled through the rest of the reviews it seemed no one else was a particular fan of it either. Don't fix what isn't broken. The other layout was simple and easy, i don't like everything zoomed in, and i had a picture from a year ago that was on twitter and it was attached to a tweet but it would only show the picture so i had no idea what it was, as to the other layout i could view the whole tweet or post."
3815,A_Shepard,"December 31, 2016",1,Worst update ever. Why in the world would you actually zoom everything in?? This app use to be really great and was part of my morning routine but now it just infuriates me to open it. If you want to keep your horribly designed layout fine but please give users the option to switch back to the old layout which actually makes sense and is user friendly. Moral of the story don't fix something that isn't broken! If you insist on it you have to be more innovative than that.
3816,Missy2886,"January 1, 2017",1,"New update is terrible! Hate that everything is auto zoomed in, and that you can't see the captions anymore.  Really miss the scrolling down...it made it way easier to compare years which is what I have to assume most parents like about the app!  Roll back this update to the old version.  It feels like you just updated it this way to force us to see/stay on the adds longer.  I'd rather be forced to watch a 10-20 second add each day when I open than have this new layout."
3817,Myshoe5464,"January 1, 2017",1,"Never should have updated Terrible. My photos are now zoomed in, the interface is obnoxious, I can't read the caption on any photos, & I can't read the comments left by friends on anything. What's the point? The scroll was cleaner, easier, & not broken. "
3818,Rjay03,"January 8, 2017",1,Ummm what I never rate apps but here's my first. I don't like the newest version I know you want branding on the pics but I hate that I'm forced to use the branding. Sometimes the videos/pics aren't from 6 years ago they are screenshots from that long ago but are older than that. So I don't want it to say 6 years I rather it say nothing. There are some pictures in little frames and I can't turn that off. Ummmm yeah can we have the ability to control this. Most times I don't mind having Timehops branding sometimes I do.
3819,Nikkilameness,"January 13, 2017",1,"This new update is horrible. I liked being able to scroll through all my years easily and see both of my Facebook and Instagram posts. Now if I have a picture I can never see the full caption. I have to click the share button to see a full status, and even then sometimes it gets cut off. It is so frustrating that it's not worth it anymore. Please, timehop, listen to your users. Change things quickly before we all get frustrated and delete this app."
3820,Hanging w friends addict,"December 23, 2016",1,"Hate the new update I absolutely can't stand the new update. Swiping up to save doesn't actually swipe up to save, it just switches back and forth between pictures and is extremely annoying. Much rather use the old version where I can look at what I want to look at and not be surprised with what pops up on my screen. Don't like how everything is zoomed in all the way even though you can zoom out and hold it. Just over all the new app makes me want to delete time hop all together."
3821,Hotpinkgrl96,"December 23, 2016",1,"Needs update Loved this app in the past but lately it has been filled with ads and missing events that has happened in the past.  For example when I go on Facebook flashback service they offer it shows me stuff that time hop did not (I have time hop linked to Facebook). Also time hop has been cutting short my past statuses and tweets. For example if I had a status from 4 years ago that said ""can't wait to meet my new niece"" Time Hop would show it as ""can't wait to"" which VERY frustrating."
3822,lemondropc,"December 23, 2016",1,"Annoying and bad layout I've never reviewed an app ever before but this new update has me all kinds of angry. I hate that now you swipe through your memories... any time there is a photo you have to zoom out and if you tweeted a photo it doesn't show you what the caption you used was. Swiping through and the zoomed in fonts and look to it are horrible. The list version was way easier and simpler, and honestly, better. Think I'm going to delete the app, not really worth the headache it has now become."
3823,Mchdtehehcnu,"December 23, 2016",2,Newest update I give this 2 stars because the newest update makes it difficult for you to see any pictures. It doesn't allow for you to see what site you were on for the memory. It also doesn't allow you to click through to those sites. One of my favorite Timehop features was the ability to go back and see other people's replies to what I had tweeted and now that's not possible with the new set up.
3824,PalmettoGirl73,"December 24, 2016",1,"Great App - HORRIBLE Update I love this app & use it daily. But the latest update is horrible. Today it can't even load my memories - it just keeps trying & failing. And when I was able to see my memories yesterday, I was unable to see comments or likes, which was one of the best parts (as other reviewers have stated). Also, some of the pictures were in a collage & I couldn't really see them that well & there wasn't an option to make them larger. This is a prime example of good idea with poor execution."
3825,Captainloozer,"December 25, 2016",1,"Update ruined this app I hardly ever write reviews unless the app is really great or really terrible.  This app used to be good but now it is completely useless.  After the latest update, you can no longer see comments or likes on your post and there's no link to the original content to view it elsewhere.  They also changed the layout and it's horrible and pointless.  If you have this app already, for the love of God don't update it.  If you don't, don't waste time downloading until it's fixed."
3826,Steve Kubitz,"December 25, 2016",5,"Terrible update The most recent update has taken all the enjoyment out of using the app. It's the exact opposite of user-friendly. Hopefully they roll it back to the previous interface, otherwise I'll likely eventually delete the app all together."
3827,JSwy,"December 26, 2016",1,"New update ruins it for me. I used to love Timehop and all the memories it shared. But now the layout of the update is miserable. Viewing them in ""Instagram story"" mode is awful. AND if you uploaded multiple pictures to Facebook in one day, you only get two or three from that post and you can't see the pictures up close. I used to look forward to my daily Timehop, now it's easier to look at Facebook memories. I don't get all my social media outlets this way, but I'm not bashing my head in because the update is awful..."
3828,Eleven_o_five,"December 26, 2016",1,"New format is awful! I have enjoyed Timehop (with some minor frustrations here and there) since it came out, but the new format is truly awful. Did you even do any test marketing or review with any current users before making such great changes?! With all the negative reviews of the new format, I hope you reconsider your decisions and change it back. It's good to try new things now and then, but it's wise to realize when you've made a mistake and even wiser to make the necessary changes to right your wrongs."
3829,Will Work For Wine,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update is beyond terrible. I am not sure who's idea this update was,  but it is awful. You can't even see the caption associated with a picture. The picture is zoomed in for some odd reason. I'm assuming the people at ""Time Hop"" have hit the peak of their success and are done with app designing in general. They clearly want the world to delete Time Hop. That is the only rationale explanation for why the app currently operates the way it does. Bad bad bad update ! In fact,  I've never ever left a review for an app. The time hop app update is so bad I had to leave a review!"
3830,Lilfergie2012,"May 31, 2015",4,"Memory Bank Love this! I can see the stupid things the younger me had posted, look at pics that have been lost through many phone upgrades, and revisit ideas, triumphs and defeats I may have forgotten about. Just wish you could perhaps scroll back to older timehops that I may have missed by not checking the app that day."
3831,HeartSimGames,"June 10, 2015",5,"Good but inefficient This app has a good idea but it would be better if we could connect multiple facebook, instagram, etc. accounts because if we're looking at the past..almost everyone has had multiple accounts right?"
3832,AJ56,"July 9, 2015",4,"This app is so fun! I really enjoy the throwbacks you get with this app. It's a great way to relive your experiences. The only suggestion I have is to have the ability to block certain time frames from being included in the app. For example, being able to select view only posts from 2007 forward or something like that."
3833,Timehop frequent user,"September 4, 2015",4,Suggestions Definitely a great app. I have a few suggestions.  Being able to actually read Twitter conversations instead of open in app.  
3834,Akajoos,"November 6, 2015",2,Needs a little help I love this app! Such a neat idea. :) the only thing I want is maybe have the time hop available for the week. There's been days that I miss and I wish if been able to see it. Fix that and you got a 5star app. 
3835,Time hopper 12,"November 26, 2015",4,Access to content I enjoy time hop but it would be nice to be able to access the prior days for a certain amount of time. Example;if you wanted to share a time hop offering say about Thanksgiving you posted last year. By being able to access prior days you could post it on this Thanksgiving.
3836,Vinnysmommy9111,"February 7, 2016",2,"Decent. Would be perfect if it would work right!!!! Love this app but for some reason it doesn't even show me half my memories. Please fix!!!! I would also consider doing something to make it better, more interesting. Now that you can see your memories on Facebook itself, and share them, time hop has lost a lot of its appeal. Barely even use anymore. Probably going to end up deleting it since I don't even really benefit from it anymore."
3837,Ilikesmurfs,"June 16, 2016",2,"Not sure about this... I have used timehop for a while now and have had no complaints until now...with the latest update I am not able to see any comments or likes from Facebook posts without signing into Facebook. It's pretty frustrating...and today the timehop app won't open at all.  Again, I'm a fan of the app, but not with this most recent update...I really hope something is done to fix these issues soon."
3838,RAS1133,"July 27, 2016",3,"Lots of bugs I love this app, but it rarely works well for me. I keep deleting it and downloading it again. It works for the first 2 or 3 days, but after that it either gives me errors every time I open it, or it opens, but doesn't pull my activity. It will say no activity for every day, even though I can scroll back and see that I'd posted that day. Wish it worked--it's a good idea!"
3839,Princesspeachyclean,"December 23, 2016",1,"A little disappointed.. I'm not a big fan of this update, I do not like how each memory takes up the whole page. "
3840,Bwolf_14,"September 21, 2014",3,"Disappointed I absolutely love this app. However, anytime I want to share something to facebook the picture never posts only the caption. I have written into technical support and still have not heard anything back. If this problem can get resolved then it would definitely deserve 5 starts but right now I am only giving three. I hope this problem will get resolved."
3841,Oh rly?,"January 17, 2015",5,Love the daily reminder! Really fun to see all the old pictures. Wish it grabbed and showed the pictures from my phone not just Facebook! Also would love to see things I've been tagged in not just things I've posted. Love sharing these with my close friends
3842,Lbs skin,"January 23, 2015",4,"Liked it better before the upgrade Great app, love the idea of getting to look back at this day in my history. However I dislike that I have to have the FB app now in order to share on FB. Before the upgrade I could share wo having the app. I'm not sure what else the upgrade changed but I thought it was great before the upgrade."
3843,Rachael<3Elias,"February 17, 2015",1,"Use to love it, too much like Instagram now Before this latest update, I would have given timehop 5 stars for sure. But it's too much like Instagram now. I would like to share my WHOLE picture! Not to try and squeeze it in the tiny freaking box. It's exactly like Instagram. Also, all timehop photos use to go in its own album on facebook but since the change it goes in my uploads. I wish whoever creates these apps would just leave a good thing alone! Fix the bugs and kinks but stop changing everything else around!"
3844,6 months In,"February 23, 2015",4,"My favorite app! Timehop has quickly become my favorite app, and I look forward to it on a daily basis!  The only issue I have with it, is that although my Twitter account is connected with it, I have yet to see any tweets from previous years.  All the other forms seem to come through.  Hopefully this will get cleared up because I love this app!"
3845,kjpugs,"March 4, 2015",3,"Fun but buggy For some reason, this app won't pull any of my instagram pictures from a year ago. But 2 or 3 years ago it pulls fine. I can see the tweets of the instagram pics but they have errors when opening them. I checked and the pictures are indeed still on my Instagram. Have contacted support with no response. Very annoying- otherwise this would be a 5 star app."
3846,tiptwinmommy,"March 8, 2015",5,"Great app! I appreciate being able to see how I've grown as a person and in my faith in God over the years. I love seeing old pictures oh my husband and I, and our children! This app is great!! I do wish I could move the years ago banner. Thanks for working hard and letting us have this app free!"
3847,kayleentuh,"April 16, 2015",5,Love! I enjoy this app! I look forward to seeing what I did in the past. It's like looking through an old photo album everyday. It's awesome for fueling my nostalgia needs. 
3848,Imani1234567328,"April 16, 2015",5,"Great App I love being able to see my old tweets on Twitter . The only thing is that I wish it would show me more than one year ago, like maybe 2 or 3 years ago too. I love how easy it is to use and how the push notifications tell me when I can see my new daily update!!"
3849,JT424,"April 23, 2015",3,"Good, but could be great I enjoy getting the message most days with pictures from the years past and even sharing them on social media. However, on days where there were multiple photos from an event, you have to share them as individual posts. I'd love to be able to select multiple photos and share them with one comment in a single post."
3850,Brielleliefje,"January 16, 2013",3,"Cool but glitches now When I first got this app it was awesome!! I was telling my friends to get it because it was so great. A few days ago though, the photos weren't loading. I thought it was just my connection to the network or something. The next day it still didn't  load. Still today, it's not loading!! So boo on that! I will put into a folder for now but I hope you'll fix this!"
3851,laurlaur3,"November 15, 2013",5,"Still having log in issues Loved checking this app every day to look back at events or thoughts or pictures from previous years, but even after the latest update, I'm still unable to log in. Disappointing since it's a great app."
3852,Babyjean13,"June 9, 2014",4,It's really awesome! It's a pretty cool app. It lets you connect all your social media and see what you posted in the past. It also shows you what random things have happened in the past. Like when Harry Potter was first released. I would recommend to everyone. The only bad thing is that sometimes it takes a long time to load.
3853,EccentricCheese,"June 21, 2014",1,"Great nostalgia, not so great with pics Overall a good app, but using it to share photos you've posted in the past is a joke. Once shared, Timehop displays a thumbnail-sized version of your photo tucked to the left side of a relatively large banner that, of course, prominently displays the Timehop logo. I don't mind the logo being displayed so much as I do the fact that your photo is so small. Pretty shameless in my opinion and needs to be changed. If you're using the app to repost treasured status updates from the past, however, the app does so well."
3854,katlin.,"July 15, 2014",5,"Blast from the past I love timehop!! I check it every morning before I even look at twitter. It's fun to reflect back on what was happening a year ago and has even helped me to gain a lot of perspective on the way my actions affected situations happening in my life at the time. For any avid social media user, this app is a must"
3855,Autumn Lynnnnn,"August 3, 2014",5,"Love it!‚ù§Ô∏è I adore this app. It's great to see how many memories I've forgotten. I like being able to see what happened to me a year, two, or even more years ago. Plus, for any Whovians reading this, it's great! At the bottom it has a different quote each day. Today it said ""Bow ties are cool."" Another day it had said ""Don't blink."" Loveeeee ittttt.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
3856,Keacruc,"August 3, 2014",4,Love love love It's so great to be able to see back to what I posted but they need to add likes and comments to Facebook post. I've had Facebook for a while but I don't feel like scrolling all the way down to see likes and comments . It's a great app tho!! Also would be nice to add filters. A fun popular touch. I like the history time hop part too nice job overall!! üëåüëåüëå
3857,Keeping it off this time,"January 16, 2017",5,It's been great until last update! I HAD loved this app very much! BUT... they totally changed it and I don't even look forward to it at all! It's sad! I was excited to open it every day and now it's just a waste! 
3858,Margo 0000,"January 21, 2017",5,"Not working I have used this app for a long time and really like it, but I liked the original format much better!  The last few days the app keeps crashing and will not load pictures. It's getting annoying"
3859,Kinggreen253,"January 26, 2017",1,30 days. If no change I'm done with it Edit: I cannot believe that after all the negative reviews they haven't done something about this. The new Timehop is absolute garbage. A competitor needs to step up so I can leave this app for good. If I could give this a zero star rating I would. Won't even let me see the whole status anymore. The developers really flubbed it on this one 
3860,Blondetobe126,"December 28, 2016",4,What happened? I used Timehop every day and enjoyed it before this last update. What happened? It's no longer enjoyable because I have to zoom out on every photo and can't see the caption or the responses. There's absolutely no point in looking at it. Why would you change something that worked so well?
3861,Ken244442,"December 29, 2016",1,"I give up! Wow! What a horrible update. Instead of scrolling through your old posts, you have to tap and wait for each individual post from previous years to load. It's soooo slooowww! And I'm on a 50 megabit connection!"
3862,Kellie Veltri,"December 29, 2016",2,"Update 4.0 Was a Mistake I have always loved Timehop and check it nearly every day. However, the latest major update, which boasts being more ""beautiful,"" has made the app much less user friendly. The clicking mechanism goes on to the next image far too easily and you can no longer see the captions on photos, which was formerly a main benefit of the app. Please resolve some of these issues as I do not enjoy Timehop very much anymore!"
3863,Ksjam,"December 30, 2016",1,"New update is AWFUL First off, let's talk about how it crashes 3/4 of the time when opening..... talk about annoying."
3864,bcre8uv,"December 31, 2016",1,"I used to LOVE Timehop, but the latest update ruined it WTH, Timehop??? The joy of opening this app every morning and revisiting memories has been completely ruined by the new format. It's awkward to navigate, hard to share (some photos don't even have a share option), and just generally not user-friendly anymore. I had a 190 day streak going, and I tried to get used to the update, but now I'm looking for alternatives. I'm sure there are plenty of other apps out there that do the same thing in a better way."
3865,larrym2,"January 2, 2017",1,"Used to work so well! I loved checking my TimeHop everyday, but with the new update it is way too time consuming to scroll through each photo individually and to have to zoom out on every single one. I liked the old design much better with collages that I could quickly scroll through and pick and choose which photos I wanted to look at. When you have 8+ years of memories it takes too long to look at one thing at a time."
3866,anghenderson,"January 4, 2017",1,"Terrible new update This update made me so unbelievably disappointed. I thought it was something I could get used to but it's just so annoying having to see all the pictures zoomed in and especially with no caption? Most of my timehops are from Twitter and my RTed tweets are just random pictures without captions. I also absolutely hate the fact that I can't click a link to go to that post on my twitter app or click posts to go on, on my IG app. Really wish they would go back to the original format."
3867,Nmstell,"January 6, 2017",1,Update The new update is horrible. The only things that can be shared are previous Facebook posts. My pictures from my camera roll are put into a collage that you can't really see. You can't zoom in on those pictures or share them. Very disappointed.
3868,Katiebugs30,"January 7, 2017",3,"New Update is Awful I really enjoy the concept of the app. It's fun to see all the pictures from my past. However, the new update is awful. Most of my pictures never load anymore. And you have to tap the picture for it zoom out and see the whole picture. You can't just scroll through anymore, you have to tap. It's dumb. I hate going into this app now."
3869,Stimpy232000,"January 9, 2017",1,Hate the new update The zoom still goes on unintentionally then I can't figure out how to turn it iff w out changing settings.  Then guess what? It goes right back on!  Just let us pinch to zoom. Nobody wants an auto zoom
3870,Adbarr,"September 15, 2016",1,I used to love his app I used to love this app but now my notifications to check are for ads. Even if there is nothing in my history to check I have a notification to check. The ads inundate the app so much that I'm on the verge of deleting the app and relying on FB to remind me of things.
3871,JamileSJ,"September 15, 2016",2,"Bring back the facebook source A few days ago I had an update that whenever I clicked on a memory from facebook it would take me straight to the source on Facebook.... Now it is back to how it was before, it just shows whatever was posted and commented on inside Timehop... I really liked the update before, you can delete whatever stuff you posted in the past that you dont like... Bring back that feature pleasee!!!"
3872,broadwayaddict<3,"December 19, 2016",4,"Great! But.... I've loved this app since I first got it  a year or two ago. Being able to see what my past self was doing on this day however many years ago. On the other hand, it has only been showing the first line of my memories with a solid 5 seconds of the full memory displaying. Please fix!!!"
3873,Newmamma,"December 24, 2016",5,Worst update ever!!!!! No!!! I can't see half my pics bc of the massive zoom. I have to scroll through alllll my pictures from that day to go back and find the one I want to show someone later. I can't look and compare my years at once.  No. No. No. this update is horrible!!!!
3874,danielle_lk,"December 24, 2016",1,"please go back! The new update is so horrible! I hate that I can't see my original caption on pictures or what people commented under them. That was my favorite feature and now it's gone. Honestly I just hit my 200 day streak and the only reason I checked the app was because I didn't want to lose the streak. Usually I'm excited to look back, but now it's just annoying. Why fix something that isn't broken to begin with? Please get rid of this new update and bring the old version back"
3875,ManyMuchMusicMan,"December 24, 2016",1,"Newest Update Ruined the App I've been using Timehop for a few years, and it's generally fantastic. However, the most recent update has made this app almost nonfunctional. Navigation is difficult, and original posts can no longer be accessed. Further, image tweets only display the first image and no caption; I haven't found any way to display remaining elements due to the ""simplistic"" but ultimately unusable new design. I hope they correct these things or revert to an older version; this was once one of my favorite apps."
3876,rikkialba1998,"December 24, 2016",1,"HATE HATE HATE i have never even took the time to write a review for an update, but i was trying to delete the update and came across this. this update ruined the app for me, i used to love seeing my older posts and seeing how much i've changed and who liked and commented on what... but now i can't do that. i am going to delete this app because this update doesn't let me do the fun things that i once was able to and it just makes everything harder to look at. not worth the storage it is wasting."
3877,kay_saff,"December 25, 2016",1,"worst update ever This is the first time ive ever been so annoyed with an app that i've written a review....the new update is terrible. For the past month or so my tweets won't show up all the way and i was hoping this update would fix that...nope. All it does is force you to look at every. single. picture. and every. single. post. most people like myself don't want that, but want to be able to scroll past a bad memory and not be forced to relive it. point being, if you haven't updated the app, don't."
3878,Gloriavela02,"December 25, 2016",1,"Worse update I was IN LOVE with Timehop & posted multiple memories of my pictures as well tell family & friends about it. With this latest update I'm so upset because 1). you can't crop pictures, 2). there's no option to add frames anymore, 3). I can't read what I previously wrote, 4). pictures are now zoomed in & 5). pictures are now collaged in multiple frames with no open to click on picture to enlarge...instead it goes to next picture. I want to frames, captions & crop/zoom feature back Timehop!!!"
3879,Me_shell_68,"December 26, 2016",1,"Worst update I have always enjoyed timehop but this update is maki g me not even want to use it anymore. You can read any of these other negative reviews and they will tell you the same thing I'm thinking. Pictures are zoomed in to one spot and even if you zoom out to see the whole thing, you cannot then zoom back in to look at different parts of the photo. I hate that you have to tap through like a snapchat story. This isn't snapchat. Stop trying to be snapchat. I don't like that layout."
3880,Iheartjmac,"September 7, 2015",3,I love Time Hop but it could use some upgrades Lately I have been seeing that a lot of my photos wont even load and it really bugs me! Also i think y'all should show old photos we took but didn't post...as long as our photos are synced up with the apps...i would like to see the ones that are possibly aren't even on my phone anymore...the shoebox app does that i like Time Hop better!
3881,LoganJAlex,"September 24, 2015",2,"Good while it lasted. My timehop hasn't worked at all for the last 2 days or so, it's extremely disappointing and I'm kind of over waiting for it to be fixed. Facebook has an 'on this day' app, that basically does the same thing; at least with your Facebook posts over the years. I've been using that instead of this and since it seems like it will not get fixed, I'm going to just rely on facebook from now on."
3882,Clubby77,"September 25, 2015",5,"Great app I only got on this app because all my friends were using it. I wanted to check what's it about. Seeing that Facebook already shows you what you did years ago I didn't see the point in downloading it, but I like that it incorporates other apps as well."
3883,Kittyprsn,"September 25, 2015",5,"One of my favorite apps! This is without a doubt, one of my favorite apps. I look forward to my every day reminders of past pictures and posts. I love the fact that I can also text the pictures and share them w/ others. Definitely a 5 star app!"
3884,Shanner169,"September 26, 2015",5,Time hop I love this app! Never go a day without seeing what I did on that day years ago. And I like how you can do the now and then pictures but I wish you could move the part that says how many years back it was... Sometimes cuts off faces:/ other than that I love it!!!üëçüèªüòä
3885,LauraDFerreira0,"October 27, 2015",4,One tiny fix I love love love this app! I love looking back at what I tweeted in the years past because it makes me happy and helps me remember what I was feeling that day. One thing is that you can only see your last 3200 tweets which is a bummer. One thing to fix is definitely that. Please fix it so we could see all of the tweets we've ever tweeted.
3886,SawyerBeatty,"November 10, 2015",3,"Was great, doesn't really work now This app used to work great, and i loved it so much. It was very cool to be able to see pictures from the past and know exactly what point in time it was taken. But now the app doesn't even show any pictures and barely ever works. It says that my pictures are synced, but it just says no posts available every day now. Hopefully they fix it soon."
3887,Boobow20,"December 21, 2015",5,"Love it!! I love it I just have one request. When I wake up and see something from years ago and it says Photo has been deleted, I would prefer whatever photo I deleted from that many years ago not pop up in Timehop. Then it makes me wonder what it was"
3888,FunnyHotdogMan,"December 23, 2015",4,"Focus on Memories. This app should not be its own social media service. Get rid of the ""likes"" and ""who's viewed this picture,"" and just show me the things I posted on this day. If I want others to see it I will share it on my social media pages. That being said, there's something great about cringing at my old posts. I love that part of this app."
3889,Asdfgihl,"August 30, 2016",4,"awesome app but needs a few changes I would give five stars except I really wish you could connect other devices to it. like I have tons of photos on my old phone that I would like to show up on my current, so I can see even older photos. but it only shows the pictures from one device"
3890,TheKimFam,"February 7, 2015",4,"Daily trips down memory lane I love getting my daily notification and remembering past experiences and thought. I'll give it 5 stars when you give it the option to move the banner for re-sharing. It is very annoying when I want to share an old photo and a blue banner ""three years ago"" cuts off someone's face."
3891,Teagensmommy,"February 9, 2015",5,"Love it.....however I love this app, one of very few that get used daily on my phone, occasional glitches but no big deal, however since the last upgrade its more of a pain to share pics. That needs to go back to the simple way it was prior to the ""update"""
3892,Krst10,"March 19, 2015",3,Love it but! Love the app great to see old memories and you kids how much they have grown etc.
3893,2009ProudMomma2014,"March 20, 2015",5,Really look forward to opening the app every morning Really enjoy this app. The videos play easily and with the same quality as it was recorded. Fun to see all the crazy weird things I post as far back as 4 years. To relive and share past events. Great app! No complaints.
3894,DDayWalker,"April 30, 2015",4,"It's okay I enjoy seeing the posts everyday and remembering what was done years back, but it doesn't scroll easily...I have to pull the page down and then up for it to scroll, it awkwardly crops pictures and seems to skip some years that I have been on facebook. It's a good idea in theory, but frustrating sometimes."
3895,Jadedflames,"May 15, 2015",4,"Fun, but not life changing It's kind of neat to see what all I got up to in the past, but it is really only for people who take pictures every single day. "
3896,WandaEllis,"May 27, 2015",5,Review So far I like everything except not being able to go back a few days if I missed something. I love the fact that no one except me can see my pics unless I share. Even better it's not social media that I have to see anyone else's stuff! LOL keep up the good work.
3897,Loudogriley,"August 7, 2015",3,"Loved it at first, but... Loved this app at first, but for the past few weeks, it hasn't been loading ANY of my photos from instagram. I've emailed tech support, I've linked and unlinked...everything. If it doesn't start working soon, I'll probably delete it. Most of my photos are on IG, and without it, the app is kind of pointless. Please help! I don't want to delete, but I'm not keeping it around for kicks."
3898,Wardl64,"August 21, 2015",2,"Great when it worked This app used to be a fun thing to check out old posts and bring back memories, but it no longer works. I mostly past to Instagram and it will not loads IG pics. It either tells me that the photo did not reach ""88 mph"", their way of saying it could not upload them, or tells me they have been deleted. I've tried updating "
3899,Tiffanyblue456,"August 29, 2015",5,Simple but special A lot of apps come and go on my phone but this one is a permanent factor timehop is so simple yet so special everyday I'm so excited to see a blast from the past and I admit some even make me tear up from how long ago the memories were I love this app and don't change a thing
3900,Trish Birdstone,"May 22, 2014",4,"Like it but could be a little better I really love seeing this day in history, but I agree with many of the other reviews. I wish you could visit prior days (even if I could just see 2 days prior). Sometimes the work week gets crazy and I see the notification but can't look at it right away. Other than that, GREAT APP!"
3901,Love4eva5436,"May 23, 2014",4,I like but maybe you could add... Tapping top of screen scrolls to top (this is a standard feature for iPhone users and I keep tapping the top and it keeps going into the settings -_-)
3902,Skullcrash 77,"May 23, 2014",5,"Timehop is great! üíñI love it!! So awesome to see what you were doing on ""this"" day 1, 2, or 3 years ago...it really let's you see what has changed..as well as what has stayed the same!! Some very special moments in your life are rekindled through timehop, and now you can share it with the world all over again!!"
3903,Emmmmxxxx,"May 24, 2014",5,Love it I think it is so awesome. Having the ability to see things you have posted years ago. I make sure and check it every day so I can see what mood I was in and what events took place within the last three years from my Facebook. I'm in love. Whoever invented this is amazing. üòçüíã
3904,EmmaSoul,"July 1, 2014",4,"Will change to 5 stars when... It can go back farther than 5 years!  I've been on social media sites longer than that :)  Otherwise, the time when my timehop is available each day is my favorite of the day.  So many random thoughts and forgotten memories come up and it is so fun to share them (again) with others."
3905,LuvlyLibrarian,"October 25, 2014",4,"Great app Love being able to see my old posts. I would like to see two improvements: the ability to scroll back or forward a few days, and when you tap a post, the app should take you to the original post on the original platform, so you could see people's comments, etc."
3906,Cysteine,"November 1, 2014",5,Fave ap ever First time I've made the effort to rate an ap. love it! And I actually like the fact that you can't scroll through and see other dates because that would ruin the anticipation of seeing the next day. Wouldn't be as special if I could scroll thru and see all the dates.
3907,Ray bobolink,"January 19, 2015",5,Love this app! :) Of course I wish I could not see the old statuses about exes from five years ago but hey that was five years ago lol it's fun to see what you were doing and where you were years ago! Also fun to see how you've change and how far you have come from your past!
3908,amykck,"January 22, 2015",2,"I used to love it... This was one on my favorite apps until the latest update. :( like others have said, it's more of a pain to share, and I hate that the original captions aren't shared! half the time that was the best part! and I liked having them all in their own album, or at least framed so you could scroll through and tell which were new and which were TimeHop. Not loving the update, and I can't see myself using it much any more. :("
3909,Teryx510,"February 7, 2015",5,Fantastically nostalgic This app reminds me of what I was doing and with whom as far back as my social media accounts have history for. I love being reminded of those memories and often end up reaching out to an old friend I have talked to in a while as a result. This is easily a must have app on my phone.
3910,Sohrab S,"October 8, 2013",1,"Many missed opportunities to be better Timehop gets one star for having a great concept and pretty interface. However, simple functions like being able to jump to a different day are not available, making it a drag to have to wait to land on a day to see what happened then. To my knowledge, there's also not a clear way to click on a post to see it (for example, I want to go to a post on Facebook that Timehop is showing me, so that I can look at comments and likes that people left)."
3911,Starfishes suprise,"January 7, 2014",4,"I never knew how boring I was till now Timehop shows me my life a year or 2 later when the emotion of what I wrote has gone. Sometimes it reminds me of a fun time long past, but most of the time it just shows me what I write like I'm seeing it through someone else's eyes- which is very cool however, makes me seem like the least exciting person on the planet."
3912,Islndgrl02,"May 22, 2014",5,"Awesome!! I take a while to catch up with the times, I guess. I saw a review that said she had been using it for years! I thought it was new! Lol "
3913,kal414,"March 9, 2017",1,"STILL the Trump of updates... This is the Trump of updates... No body wants this new change, just go back to the way it was!"
3914,Me1989.,"March 27, 2017",2,"Streaks Cut Short Overall, it's nice to see past posts. However, I think it's dumb that the streak starts over if you don't get on Timehop when there are no posts to view from the past for that day. Every time I get close to 100 days, or sometimes before then, I mysteriously miss a day. It's always due to the reason mentioned above. I'm just curious to see if anything special happens at 100 says. We shouldn't be penalized for miss days with no posts."
3915,abenba,"April 24, 2017",2,"Really gone downhill I absolutely LOVED this app when I first heard about it a few years ago. Now, I dread opening it because I know I'll have to swipe/tap through all of my memories rather than scrolling. Additionally, why is all of the text highlighted then in white? I think it looks pretty heinous."
3916,Meagenv,"April 30, 2017",2,"The previous app was much better Timehop is awesome to remember old mems! Love that it pulls from all of your sources like fb, insta and even your camera roll.  I used to love Timehop, but i am not a fan of the recently updated app and format. I hope the developers consider making a switch back where one doesn't have to individually click through each item, instead of being able to scroll like it's previous option."
3917,Mrs.McDowell,"May 18, 2017",5,Best memory reminder app This is the best app to bring back all your memories from FB. I know a lot of people use other apps but they don't compare to Time Hop. I tell everyone about it. Thanks for reminding me of great things in my life. Things that happened almost 7 years ago. It's great
3918,Sasha_Becky,"June 21, 2017",5,"TimeHop!!! This app makes my day, everyday... and it does that over and over again! Definitely a cute walk down memory lane. A little disappointed on days that I look back in with no Timehop memories, ha!"
3919,Sdittus,"September 1, 2017",5,I love this app! I have been using Timehop for a while now. I love it and only ever had a few issues over the years. Each time the issues were quickly addressed and fixed. Ads aren't fun but if they keep me from paying for the app I'm ok with it as is.
3920,nicolebuckner,"January 6, 2017",4,"Review Not a fan of the new update, I preferred when we could just scroll to see all of our memories rather than click through each one, enlarged and such. I enjoy the app though, but the new update I am not a fan of. As for how well the app works, I am a fan as there are very few to none issues I have encountered."
3921,Superdopeee,"January 7, 2017",3,It's better The updates makes it better than the last one. But I don't like the fact that when I click to see how commented on an old Instagram photo it'll exit the app and take me to the instagram app ... why can't it just be like the Facebook one where it just pops up a screen without exiting the Timehop app. Ugh I still miss the old timehop. Don't fix what's not broken
3922,hoffwinoh,"January 8, 2017",2,Updated Updated- the update fixed some of the concerns like being able to see comments and likes and also got rid of the weird zoomed in pictures but it's still not great or even as good as it used to be
3923,Bend12345,"January 8, 2017",1,"Terrible Update I see you made some adjustments to the first terrible update, but I think you are missing the point.  I'm fine with scrolling through the pictures but make it an option! Why can't if have the old interface then you click on a picture and can chose to scroll through? Part of the fun of Timehop is seeing the change that occurred over the years all on one page together. Hopefully this will be resolved in the next version."
3924,Bgsnydermd,"January 12, 2017",1,"New update is junk Still terrible. My Facebook posts reference a link or image but I can't see what it is. Just the text. If the text is longer than what fits on the screen, I can't see the rest of it. Why is it so terrible. Who approved this? I'm holding out that the developers will just change it back but as days go by I find myself checking it less and less. I was on a 90 day streak until they changed everything. Now I haven't looked more than two days in a row."
3925,tacolover80,"January 13, 2017",1,"Terrible update This update is awful! I can't stand the single screen view. I want to go back to being able to scroll through the day and see multiple posts from the same year. And I can't figure out what happened to Facebook. It's not showing up anymore. But as far as I can tell there's no where to click on settings to see if my Facebook account is still linked, or to link it again. Very frustrating! Please put it back to the way it was!!!"
3926,Rylee R.,"January 16, 2017",4,Fun App I enjoy getting memories from my different social platforms. The only thing I don't like with the overall app update most recently is that you do not have the ability to share videos anymore. I text memories to my family all the time and was bummed that I couldn't share videos with them.
3927,Ashadelic,"January 29, 2017",5,What the...? I want my old Timehop back. Why am I only limited to sharing photos Timehop picks at random (I'm assuming? No rhyme or reason) Is there some way I'm missing to share the photos that just disappear with no options? I used to love this app and loved looking at it each day to see my daughter. :(
3928,Danae24,"February 18, 2017",1,"What in the hell?? After the most recent update it seemed like all was well. The screen wasn't cutoff anymore. But, low n' behold, there are still major issues! The biggest: the fact that it NO LONGER contains actual memories posts! I go to Facebook to see my memories posted there, and those same posts for the same day DO NOT show up in Time-hop. This app fails to do what it says it does. I'll be deleting right after I post this review. Go back to the way it was if you want this app to actually succeed!"
3929,WFQUAJ6,"February 28, 2017",5,"Timehop every day I can't believe how low the ratings are for this app, I absolutely love my Timehop app. I check it every single day. I still wish there was a way you could see your past Snapchat stories but either way, I still love this app and I will always be a fan."
3930,Betsdesigns,"December 30, 2016",1,100+ taps today? No thank you. You know that person that snaps every second of their drive down the highway? How you groan and furiously click through their story to get to the end? 
3931,LauraK√§the,"December 30, 2016",1,"Terrible update I love the app and have used it for a long time, every single day. Now I don't even want to open it because the update is so ridiculous. Who thought this was a good idea? I miss the ease of just scrolling through and being able to see everything, rather than clicking through one at a time, unable to see captions and comments or even the whole picture anymore. Worthless, I've started just using facebook's ""on this day"" feature instead."
3932,Briannalottchea,"December 31, 2016",1,"New Update? Why?! I used to love scrolling through timehop and seeing all of my old memories but this most recent update makes it next to impossible to enjoy doing that. Why fix something that isn't broken? The automatic zoom is terrible and the snapchat click through thing? Stop. It's not a feature meant for timehop. This new update is absolutely horrible, if I could rate this zero stars, I would. This most recent update almost makes me want to delete the app. THAT is how much I hate it."
3933,Zanymexican,"January 1, 2017",1,"This update is awful The best part of this app were reading the comments and captions that came with each memory! I like that it's more like a Snapchat story, but not at the expense of the other 80% of a memory. I tried getting used to it but after a week of zooming out of every picture and having no idea the context of what the photo was about I'm just annoyed."
3934,Trperry79,"January 1, 2017",5,"Completely fell out of love after update! This used to be a daily favorite...now it just causes me frustration. I know I have memories and can't see them, or can only see part of it. I truly hope it changes back soon or I will be removing Timehop from my phone!"
3935,musikdoll,"January 2, 2017",1,"This update is awful!! I'm not sure the reason why they felt the need to change this app but it's awful. I used to check this daily to see past photos and repost my favorites. Now I don't use it at all....and apparently I'm not the only one. I used to like scrolling through and seeing them all at once, now I have to swipe through every single one. So annoying! Also, you can't do ""then and now"" side by sides anymore...not that I can find anyway. So disappointed by these changes."
3936,My 11th try,"January 2, 2017",2,"The update I hate the new update!! I used to love this app but now I'm considering deleting it because the update has ruined it! They change the way you view your old post, it went from a set up like a Facebook or twitter feed to more of a Snapchat story and they zoomed in on everything so you can only see a small part of it. Also they no longer tell you if it's from twitter or Facebook."
3937,beetsforbeets,"January 2, 2017",1,Please change it back I used to love checking TimeHop every day. What I also liked were the words that came along with the picture. With the new update the only time you see text is when it is by itself. This update pretty much renders the app useless and not very fun to use. Also it's annoying to have to hold down to see the whole picture that has no context. Just change it back to the old version. Please? The only reason I'm still using it is to keep my streak alive.
3938,SNSinNC,"January 3, 2017",1,"The new update destroys the point of this app I enjoyed Timehop and it worked fine. The ""Then and Now"" comparisons were fun. The latest update has ruined this app. The controls are clunky, I can't share pictures that were uploaded in a group, it won't show all photos from a group (which I know, because Facebook has a similar functionality) and they got rid of the comparison feature. I looked forward to checking in daily and now it just frustrates me. Not really an appealing feature."
3939,Katlindsay,"January 3, 2017",5,Horrible update. I loved Timehop until they did their new update. It's horrible. You can't look at all of the picture properly. You're missing parts bc of hoe zoomed in they show it. Everyone else is saying it better. But bring back the old version. Please.
3940,Mackinseyrae,"December 24, 2016",1,"I love Timehop BUT.... the new update is horrible. I had a 223 day Timehop streak until the new update. It's trying to be like snapchat and how you look at the story's. I don't like that about snapchat, so what would make me like it about Timehop? I love the app I love seeing old memories, but the new up date is too hard to manage. I can't just scroll through and look at things I have to tap through and hope I don't miss anything. I do not like it. And I hope they change it back soon or I will not use the app anymore!!!"
3941,kiss-me-like-you-did,"December 25, 2016",1,"HATE the new update Sure, it shows pictures in full screen, which isn't really necessary since anyone with a smart phone could have just zoomed into any picture. They took away the captions and symbols that show which social media app it's from, which is kind of a pain if you're like me and have 7 different platforms they come from. Also, it only shows pictures, I have yet to see a text post. I wish they would go back to old form of Timehop, it was perfect that way."
3942,Megboomall,"December 25, 2016",1,"Worst update ever I used to love Timehop. However, with this new update you can no longer see captions, comments, or even who 'liked' your previous posts. The entire point of reminiscing on previous social media interactions was exactly that, to see the interactions. This app is no longer worth having. Also, the automatic zoom feature is just obnoxious. Overall I'd give this app two thumbs waaaay down, and I will be deleting it until it features the comments, captions, etc again."
3943,Cf785,"December 25, 2016",1,"Hate the Update! I'm so sad about this current update. The layout is pretty but feels like it lost functionality üëéüèª To me updates should make it better, not worse. If there are multiple pictures it displays them all on one screen ... you can't click on the pictures or share them. You can only share ones that the program puts on one screen ... it's weird how it picks and chooses?!? It's a bummer. I've always preferred Time Hop over FB memories, but now FB may be more user friendly?!? üëéüèª"
3944,HeathRey,"December 26, 2016",1,"New version I have loved time hop from the beginning but this new version is a complete dysfunctional disaster. You have less sharing options then ever, if the posts will even share at all. There are filters on your posts so you don't even get to see everything you posted and God forbid you posted a video since not only is the video sharing unavailable but most of the time it won't even load for you. This attempt at a new time hop is a complete flop and I am truly disappointed."
3945,Dsnowacz,"December 26, 2016",3,"Hate the new update Loved the app then there was an update. the new way to view your history and timeline is terrible. Sometimes the share button works, sometimes you can see your pictures, and sometimes it updates the number of days you viewed it in a row. Not a fan of this layout. At least give people an option. Thanks."
3946,Laurn781,"December 26, 2016",1,"It's ok...AND NOW IM DONE One of the reasons I got Timehop was so I could look back at the comments of one of my friends who passed away/ she always had something to say. Well, ever since her profile was changed to a 'Remembering' profile on FB Timehop no longer posts her comments...yet it still posts comments of ppl I've unfriended or even blocked. Superstar frustrating."
3947,Mcrunnergirl,"December 28, 2016",1,"I use to love Timehop-until the update! I loved Timehop up until about two weeks ago when the update happened and they layout changed. No longer can I see people's comments from back I. The day, nor is it user friendly. I try to zoom out to actually see a picture that was posted, and it hops me forward like 3 pictures. I get that people like change-but this is a terrible change! Please put it back the way it was! At this point I don't even like using Timehop anymore!"
3948,Nana M from Germany,"December 29, 2016",1,New Update Ruined the App! I gave it a try but I must admit this new update has ruined my TimeHop experience. 
3949,Esvmo,"December 29, 2016",1,"Was great before the update I loved Timehop...loved checking it everyday & often shared my memories on social media- 5 star rating for sure, until the update. I can't stand it now! Can't share what I want, can't see everything because of the new zoom & collage features, and no longer offers (at least that I can find) the ""then and now"" option for sharing. This was my favorite app, makes me so sad to say it's now worthless and I don't even open it. Please return the timehop we knew & loved!"
3950,Paulalew,"October 28, 2015",5,"Update issues Trying to update today and it won't finish loading!!! I have tried to delete it and re-install, but it won't delete, but yet it won't finish loading. It has been hours. I enjoy this app. Hope it is fixed soon."
3951,Vmarkey,"November 10, 2015",4,"A fun little surprise every day I love time hop! I love seeing all my old posts and pictures from years past. I only gave it four stars because when I forget to check it one day it's gone and you can't see what you missed. But I guess that's the point, you only see that exact today in the past."
3952,Robbin08,"November 14, 2015",2,Where did the weather go! I loved being able to see what the weather was in the previous years and compare to what it is now. Since the last update it is missing. Please bring this feature back. Weather was back for a while but now it is gone again. That was one of my favorite features. Please put it back. I often have posts regarding the weather conditions and would love to compare
3953,Debmrn,"November 19, 2015",5,"Excellent App! I love this app! I use it everyday and it uses tons of sources, with your permission of course, to show you what you did on this day in the past years. It is nostalgic, interesting and fun! They also display some random facts which are very interesting! I recommend this app to everyone I know!"
3954,Jenb89,"December 11, 2015",5,üëçüèº I use snapchat a lot to stay in contact with friends and family all over the world! It's a great way to know what everyone is up too! The chat feature is wonderful as well as the sending $! I've had to do that and it was extremely easy! I love snap chat!
3955,EGM3195,"January 9, 2016",1,"Where are my posts? For the past several weeks, I've opened timehop to see that I have no posts on any forms of social media for that day. If this happened only once or twice, okay, it would make sense. But the fact that it keeps happening every day, even when Facebook is showing me things that I'd posted on that day the year before? Something is definitely glitching and I'm almost ready to delete the app because there's no point in having it if it doesn't work."
3956,I love emenim<3333,"January 31, 2016",4,"Issue with the new update I'm not sure if it's just my time hop, but when I go into the app, it takes twice the amount of time to load as well as while I'm scrolling it freezes and then I can't see anything. I try to restart the app as well as my phone, but nothing seems to work! HELP! I need my time hop! It's my favorite app! Thanks:)"
3957,dg0124,"July 16, 2016",5,"Love the memories but miss the comments It's great to see the memories of what I did that day. But I'd love to see the comments. And then sometimes I was commenting on a show I was watching but since it was a ""feeling"" or whatever, it doesn't translate over. So I don't know the context. But other than that, it's great for memories!"
3958,AliStiles,"October 2, 2016",4,Loving it It's a really neat app. I like being able to look back and see what I was doing a year (or more) ago and have it recorded in time. I also love the then|now feature.
3959,Lavender.Lilacs,"December 22, 2016",2,"Like the app, not the update I appreciate the amount of thought that probably went in to this update, which mimics Snapchat. However, I don't feel it works with this concept. I can't tell where the memories came from (Facebook? Camera roll? No clue.) "
3960,GypsyJackie,"March 15, 2015",5,"Great Fun! Love seeing older photos and enjoying the memories. Mine is usually a day or so behind though, wonder why?    Would love the ability to capture/save my photos if wanted and to see each of the photos taken when there was an extreme photo filled day. Thank you for the fun!"
3961,missjenno,"April 27, 2015",4,Great App! Dislike the Crop I love seeing my old pictures and sharing them on social media. So fun to see/read what was happening on this date in my life.  I dislike that they crop down my pictures. I also wish you could search a certain date instead of only seeing today's date in history.
3962,rjstone5455,"April 29, 2015",4,Great as a step back in time! Overall I have enjoyed using this app but I have noticed that sometimes it automatically will crop pictures in landscape mood and won't allow you to adjust the way it's cropped! Other than that I have really enjoyed the app. It's inspired me to post more on FB so I will have more to see next year!
3963,Ebeth616,"May 1, 2015",4,"Great app I love this app, it's very cute and does exactly what it says. I only wish it would let you send the posts to Facebook messenger in addition to Facebook itself. I have a lot of friends in different countries and FB messenger is how we keep in touch, it would be nice if this could be used in that outlet as well. Other than that, no complaints at all!"
3964,Ejpkin,"May 13, 2015",5,Nostalgic Overview I really like this app! Many times it contains old photos I no longer have immediate access to and can't get any other way. It has become a part of my daily routine to check it and see what I have posted in years past! Thanks for creating it.
3965,Sarahanne1984,"May 27, 2015",4,I like it It's fun and brings back memories. However it's annoying that you can't move the time hop logos around on the pictures because sometimes they're covering someone's face or even the whole point of the picture. That's annoying I'd suggest an option to choose where you want it on the picture.
3966,mandylianne,"July 1, 2015",4,"SAHM I really love the time hop app. It's fun to see photos from a couple of years ago, especially when baby photos of my toddler and preschooler pop up. I have had pictures that don't belong to me appear from time to time though, so I do wonder who might be getting pictures of my children. Otherwise, I've been really pleased with it."
3967,MegggRollllll3333,"July 19, 2015",5,"Great, except writing a review I love looking back on the memories I remember and being reminded of the ones I've forgotten. Only problem I've ever had is with writing the review- having to start over about 7 times because my ""nickname"" was always taken and then it would close my review."
3968,Bee2892,"August 20, 2015",4,Love the app I love being able to see what happened to me in the past! I also like how they include something historical each day. The jokes that Abe has at the end of the thread is great too. 
3969,damonsgirl81,"August 28, 2015",5,"Look at the past.. I love this app bc not only does it remind me of some posts that I wrote but it shows pictures that I have forgot about or ones I haven't seen in a long time, that aren't saved on my computer. It's a great time travel experience! Keep up the great work time hop!"
3970,Cat Craig,"July 9, 2013",5,"Nostalgia I love this app! I don't understand the negative reviews. I don't have a problem with loading and if you don't want another social media app, then don't download it! I love looking at past pictures and statuses. It's funny to see what I thought was important on this day in the years past! Great app!!"
3971,Jessca456,"May 27, 2014",5,"Oh, Abe. I love this app. I heard about it about two weeks before my third anniversary. It's been so fun to see pre-wedding and first anniversary updates. That being said, my very favorite part of this app is Abe. The little Dino at the bottom of the page always has something cute to say that makes me smile :)"
3972,AlphaGlitch,"May 29, 2014",5,Time Machine in my hand Really neat to see what I did that day years ago. I've even had reaper events on the same day and it wasn't planned! Like I went fishing May 26th last year and same day this year. I would've never put those two together without this app. Fun little stuff like that.
3973,Sksizh,"August 22, 2014",2,"This app is fine but I like this app it's fun seeing old things that I've posted and seen how embarrassing I really was a few years ago but I'm really frustrated on how I ""tweet a lot"" and has to give them my archive and I did multiple times and it still won't connect with my twitter. And I post a lot more on twitter than I have on Facebook so I'd like to see what I used to tweet about and so on but it won't even connect after so many attempts to give them my archive."
3974,BidBeat,"September 19, 2014",4,"Great! I'm loving it. This app lets me connect to the past which is really cool. It's my own personal ""on this day in history"". The only thing I wish it had was more things to connect to. I know all the major ones are covered but I want to be able to connect to a blog that only 50 people follow and stuff like that. Overall, though, really great."
3975,HaiEmmy,"October 20, 2014",5,"Back to the future! I was unsure of this app when I downloaded it, but now I couldn't be happier. It brings you back to the past and really, you will surprise yourself after seeing what you've said in the past. :-) 5 out of 5 stars for this blast to the past."
3976,cmalchus3,"January 26, 2015",5,Such a nice app I enjoy reading my posts from years before. It's a nice reminder and I'm glad I downloaded this app! It would be nice to be able to zoom into a photo or click through to a link but that's just a nice to have. I enjoy it without those features. :)
3977,iBrOOkiE,"March 2, 2015",5,Love looking back! I love that I can look back and see what I've posted about my kids. I post all the funny things he says and so every day I get to remember and a lot of things I had forgotten! I wish you could scroll back and forth through the days but it's not a deal breaker
3978,Bostaff,"March 4, 2015",4,"Oops Timehop was great until one day last week my wife found a series of selfies I took a year ago. Without going into detail, I'll just say that these pics were ""private"" in nature (I like to do it myself). She has a collection of really sensual ""intimate apparel"" that doesn't fit her any more, since the surgery, so I like to put it on sometimes. I just like feeling sexy."
3979,Candache torres,"March 15, 2015",4,"Fix Twitter feature I love timehop! The only problem I have is when I try to view conversations on Twitter from the past. It works seamlessly when the person's tweets aren't protected. However if they are protected, I have to go into the Twitter app to read them and then when I try to go back into timehop, it takes me to the Twitter page on the App Store."
3980,daveambrose,"October 22, 2012",5,"Absolutely beautiful and functional I read each day's Timehop email top to bottom for what I did last year. This app takes the experience to a whole new level. It's pretty. Super functional and yes, integrated oh so nicely with iOS 6 Facebook integration. Must have app on the homescreen!"
3981,Eyezach,"June 15, 2013",5,"A must for all iPhone owners The longer you own an iPhone, the cooler this app will continue to get. It's basically a digital scrapbook for all things social and on your phone. I highly recommend it... On a side note I have not had any technical issues that others are reporting."
3982,Katie marie Krieger,"January 22, 2017",5,My app will not load I have been trying for a week now an it will not open it just says re try over an over again doing nothing even though it tells me to check the app fix this please
3983,Yu kik as,"February 1, 2017",1,"Terrible update I have waited awhile now to write a review.  I keep thinking the app will be updated and go back to scrolling instead of this ridiculous update.  What is this touch to zoom garbage?  Why not just have the photos on there like they were?   I cant see facebook likes.  I have used the app daily since the update and there is not a single thing that is an improvement.  But by all means, u guys just keep strong and ignore ur users and continue with this ridiculous new format."
3984,Scottreuter,"February 8, 2017",2,New version is really terrible The newest interface is really confusing and has taken away a lot of my love for this app. Sharing photos is a very lagged and slow process that should have been tested more prior to releasing. There is also a new feature where photo sequences automatically scroll. Please get rid of that feature! I still use this app daily but I'm becoming more tempted to start looking for an alternative.
3985,N2gdf,"February 8, 2017",4,The old version was much better This new version makes absolutely no sense.  all it does is post your texting but it doesn't actually post the pictures or anything forwarded that you're commenting on so nothing makes any sense. Well I see is my words but I have no idea what I was commenting about.
3986,martialangel,"February 25, 2017",1,"The last major update was a disaster!!! Please release another update soon! I have to flip through all these years to get to an earlier year.  I miss the old interface where all years are in the same page!  Also the latest frame and having year in the middle is soooo ugly!  For this reason, I have not been wanting to share anything from Timehop!  Even shoebox sharing logo looks better now!!  It used to be so much more stylish without the frame and everything centered!!!"
3987,Frootedloopeds,"April 8, 2017",1,"Used to love it! I used to have a 200 day streak! It was my favorite thing to do every morning! Now it is so slow and terrible. The ads are obnoxious, i miss just being able to scroll down and see everything. (Why cant there just be one or two ads instead of an ad after every single status/photo?!) not to mention my photos never load. I cant seem to keep a streak past a couple days because i hate checking back. Bring the old versions back!!!"
3988,m_gan,"July 10, 2017",1,"Got a new phone, lost my streak I was at a 256-day streak, trying to make it to a full year. Got a new iPhone and all my apps were there - except with timehop, I have to re-login to everything and I've lost my streak! I don't want to have to sign in with my other phone for the next 100 days (even though I really just want to get to the full year because I'm neurotic like that). You need to have accounts, or something like gamecenter, where our info and streaks and everything else can be stored."
3989,Hoorayforjk,"August 16, 2017",5,"Was the best. *back to being pretty sweet* The best versions of your app are the ones with ALL of my content. When you remove statuses it becomes less fun. When one day you have 12 awesome frames and the next day 6, it becomes less fun. 275 day streak and it's changed three times- :("
3990,Maidaise598,"December 28, 2016",1,"New Update ruined the app Hate the new update with the passion of a thousand fiery suns.  Who in the world vetted this and thought it would be a good idea?  My pictures are disconnected from the text I wrote with them, and I cannot see the comments for context.  I hate that each entry is stand alone and that you have to tap to see the next one.  I liked scrolling to see it all in one go so much better.  This is one of those moments that I wish I had access to FB memories so that I could finally delete this app."
3991,Car's mom,"December 28, 2016",5,New format I hate the new format! It won't let me share some of the pictures. I also liked when I could look at all the pictures at the same time and decide the ones I wanted to post. Now they are all full-screen. Not as easy to use.
3992,AshWilli1986,"December 28, 2016",1,"Annoyed... no longer user friendly After this last update it is no longer as user friendly. In fact it doesn't want to show me past... only oh fiddlesticks... there is no progression anymore that I loved about the old one. For me I think it's better to use ""On This day"" w/ Facebook instead. Which makes me sad Bc I loved timehop so much! I am giving the new update * Bc I can't give it less. The old timehop was a ***** app all the way. Please go back to that style. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" -Annoyed Fan"
3993,kimkushner,"January 1, 2017",1,"Bad update I have never written a review before for any app. However the timehop App is literally the worst after they made the changes to the design. Although the concept is probably good in theory, it is very hard to use this app now with the changes. I cannot share photos easily, nor can I look at other updates from Facebook and Twitter. I hope that they change back the app given the feedback from many of us who have a lot of negative feedback with these updates."
3994,StephKB19,"January 3, 2017",1,"I have nothing positive to say about the app now The old Timehop allowed you to see everything full screen and now if you want to look at your pictures, you have to press and hold them. Stupidest thing ever. And if you have too many pictures from one day, they make it into some sort of collage but you can't look at them closely. Nothing was wrong with the previous update, so why crash and burn now? I no longer use the app and won't until it's fixed. Complete garbage."
3995,MEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"January 6, 2017",2,"Unsatisfied with Timehop We are no longer viewing our memories. Without the captions and comments from our friends, we are only seeing half the memory. There is no context to the pictures, hence we are unable to really remember what happened that day. Please show us the captions of our Instagram pictures as well as let us view comments from our friends on all our social media memories. Timehop is no longer fun."
3996,kfdjslfjds,"January 7, 2017",1,"Yeah still no Okay like that's great and all that the new ~update~ FINALLY fixed *some* of the problems, but it still cuts off the last 4-5 words of long tweets...Which is pretty pathetic considering tweets are only 140 characters. I still don't know what the sudden fad is amongst apps wanting to be like SnapChat with their whole ""tap to move on"" element, but it's got to stop. I like being able to *scroll* and see all my years' past posts in a nice, scrolling chronological order.  This tapping stuff ruins the aesthetic."
3997,STacieh16,"January 8, 2017",1,"Hate the update I used to love Timehop, but with this new ""update"" I hate it and probably won't use it anymore. Having the photos blown up so far you have to zoom out to see them was bad enough, but now I can't see who liked or commented on them or the dialog after a status in comments; takes away all the fun of even having the memory so now what's the point? Timehop really missed the ball on this one. I'll probably delete the app now. "
3998,memmar,"January 14, 2017",1,Most disappointing update ever I'm currently on a 300 day streak if that tells you how much I like Timehop. However if this update sticks around for long I'll be deleting the app. The update seems to be trying to copy snapchat's story view and it's terrible. I want to be able to scroll through and tap on what I want to view when I want to view it. Also can't share videos anymore! Today my timehop has a video from another country and I can't share it. Disappointed is an understatement
3999,TLamp2!,"January 19, 2017",1,Annoyed and Upset I actually really hate the update. Timehop was great/amazing how it was and now this new update is completely not user friendly. I really hate that I can't click on the image and then go back to the social media site to see the context of the image. I also hate the zoom in and out feature. It's completely terrible and y'all need to fix this ASAP. What's the point of having Timehop if I can't actually go back and see what was happening?! Fix this. Please listen to your users!
4000,laurennnn broooo,"December 23, 2016",5,"time hop! Im not happy with this new update. Nothing was wrong with the old version!! This one zooms in too much on all my pics. One was just completely gray, couldnt tell what that was. I feel the last version was just easier to see your pics/tweets and maneuver around"
4001,RachelMMC,"December 23, 2016",1,"HORRIFIC UPDATE. All of the reasons I use Timehop were obliterated with this new update. It's awful. Captions are important to me. Being able to go to my original post is important to me. Not having to zoom OUT to see my pictures is important to me. The timestamp is important to me. This update makes my photos look like crap (thanks to starting zoomed in on old low res filtered IG photos), and doesn't let me look at any of the details I need. If these issues aren't fixed I will be deleting my app. What a waste of an app used to love!"
4002,Frustrated as hell,"December 23, 2016",4,Bring back the old version! Stopppppppppp with the unnecessary updates!  This new one is horrendous!  Can't see the original lines or comments anymore and can't see the pictures posted along with the original statuses. Bring back the older version and stop trying to improve it. It's not working!!
4003,45890000,"December 24, 2016",1,Downgrade The update is terrible. Having to flip through each individual memory makes it difficult to go back and forth between them instead of just the list style memories where you could just scroll. Also not being able to see comments on my posts from myself or others really takes away from the memory. Won't continue to use timehop if it stays like this and definitely wouldn't recommend anyone to either
4004,Loren Finkelstein,"December 24, 2016",5,"Ruined Timehop was one of my favorite apps and, as you can see from the other reviews, has been destroyed by the recent update. The interface is horrible. What a shame. I can only hope the developers take these reviews to heart and revert to the previous version."
4005,DavaLu,"December 24, 2016",1,"Update is terrible I used to LOVE this app, but this new update is awful. You can't see all of the pictures when it puts several on a page, you don't have the option to zoom in on them, and when it's one picture on a page, it's zoomed in, and you have to hold to zoom out?! You can't read any of your friends comments on the posts, and everything is color highlighted, which is annoying. Please change it back? This is NOT better. I wish I could un-update."
4006,Aaashleyaliceaaa,"December 25, 2016",5,Awful with the new update!!! Please fix this!!!!! Very unsatisfactory since te new update yeah it's cool i guess but the fact you can't share or every time you try to it just goes to the previous or next photo/video . Not happy honestly bring back the older version
4007,taylorrhelms,"December 26, 2016",1,"W ∞ ∏ ·µó ∞·µâ f·µòÕ®·µè   ∑ ∞ ∏ I used to check Timehop daily and deleted it because I needed storage on my phone, I downloaded it again when I got a new phone because I missed it. Then two days after, it automatically updated and now I'm deleting it. The update is awful, I hate the set up, it's awkward and inconvenient and I can't work it. I just want the simple scroll through posts back. Until it's fixed I'm just going to delete the app because it's not useable. Don't fix something that isn't broken."
4008,Lisevacon,"December 26, 2016",1,"Thumbs down on the update I've had the Timehop app for a long time. I love looking at past posts and pictures! The app was so cute and simple to navigate.  This new update though...it's confusing, the pictures are huge, and there's no way to see the original captions or comments to the pictures or posts. This app is like a generic version of Timehop-- it's almost as if the app itself went backwards in time. This updated version  needs to update to the version that existed before the update. üòë"
4009,Andi Mandy,"December 27, 2016",4,"Hate it now Wish I could give negative stars! The new update is the worst, awful, and I no longer enjoy looking at Timehop :( Thankful Facebook has memories now because if this stays like this I won't be using it anymore. I used to love it and look forward to viewing it each day now despise it... being back the old Timehop please."
4010,Haydernoodle,"August 6, 2015",4,"THE FUTURE Love it! It's great to reminisce and share the old days with friends. If you haven't posted a lot in your lifetime it's probably not relevant. I wasn't active on Facebook really at all. So I don't see any Facebook statuses. Makes me feel like I should start letting the world know what I'm doing. Anyways, great app overall if you are quite the social networker you will LOVE THIS APP."
4011,AngelaIphone1,"October 4, 2015",5,"Very Frustrated with App Getting very frustrated with your app. Lately the photos don't show up at all. I used to look forward to my daisy dose of memories, but lately they just don't show up. Facebook memories are now on and ALL PICTURES from my past are showing up there"
4012,Klindsss,"October 25, 2015",4,"Love app, hate new format! :( Why did we suddenly switch to putting everything in squares? The squares cut off heads and entire people in my photos that I might otherwise like to share! Even Instagram has moved away from the squares-only design! I've loved using time hop the last couple of years. Please don't ruin a good thing. Nix the square!"
4013,Dani3323,"December 2, 2015",5,Couldn't live without it My kids are at an age where they are changing constantly and it's been really nice to look back at them three years ago even five years ago so I'm as old as eight years ago. I love the little reminders in the little memories. Great app

4015,SBA1,"February 16, 2016",3,Suggestion There needs to be the option to delete the posts you see on your Timehop. As of now I can only click on those that belong to a conversation instead of all of them. I'd rather I be able to click it and be hyperlinked to the post on the website instead of having to scroll down until I find a certain post
4016,Whatsupb,"May 24, 2016",5,App has gone down hill Use to be my favorite app to check in the morning but with recent updates and The bachelor advertisements instead of stuff from the past at the bottom totally done even opening this app
4017,Allie9‚É£2‚É£1‚É£,"June 19, 2016",4,"Not a fan of new update Instagram comment numbers are incorrect. Every single one tells me I have no comments but if I click on it (and it annoyingly takes me to Instagram) I'll see comments. Please go back to the format where I just stay in Timehop. If I wanted to see all my posts on Instagram and on Facebook, I'd go to those apps myself."
4018,Dhdxvsy,"December 5, 2016",4,"Great app, please fix the count I absolutely love this app. However, on the count of how many consecutive days I have used the app, it cuts off at 200. Instead of saying ""200"" it says ""2..."" so now I can't keep track up my days unless I purposely skip a day and we all know I don't want to do this. Please fix this minor flaw in this wonderful app!!"
4019,HandsomesMama,"December 23, 2016",1,"Change it back I used to love this app. Couldn't wait to check it in the morning to see everything from past posts, to pictures I took that didn't post. Loved that I could scroll through the ""history"" of each day. Now I need click or swipe sideways and can only see one memory at time. What the hell kind of crap is that?! It took me forever to get through everything. Why change what isn't broken. Please change it back, until then, time to delete."
4020,Photo eye,"March 3, 2015",3,"Updates made it worse! I loved this app when it first came out; with the updates, text status on Facebook now are not capturing all of the words; it used to be simple to just post it wherever, now there are too many steps to post anything. Return it to its original and I'd probably use it more; keeping it like it is, I may just remove it from my phone."
4021,Ichigocandy,"March 17, 2015",4,"The app is great!...although had some bugs I really like this app. But every time I try to sync it with social media like twitter or Facebook, it says it's loading but then comes up as a blank screen. Don't know if this is just a little big or something else but it's been like this for a while with mean and some friends."

4023,Ashes785,"May 15, 2015",4,Love I really love having the TimeHop ap. It is fun looking back everyday to see what was going on in previous years. It brings back a lot of great fun memories. And then of course makes me think 'why did I post that? I sound like a dork!' The only issue is occasionally I don't get the notification. But that's okay because I still look every day!

4026,The REAL Mia,"June 3, 2015",4,"Good, clean FUN I get such a kick and almost daily use of this adorable App. But now it crops people right out of my most memorable photos & I wish I could go back a day sometimes, when I just didn't have any moments to spare in a too-busy day.  Otherwise, we have to wait a year. "
4027,Breeee_xoxo,"July 4, 2015",4,Could update me on that day and add keek I love this app I just wish it updated and showed me the memories on the actual day. Like for example today is Tuesday and it will update me on memories from Monday and not today. And I think you should also add keek on here because that were most of my memories are. But other than everything is good!
4028,Butacson,"July 11, 2015",4,"Almost perfect! You have 2 tiny details missing that would absolutely perfect this app. Having the option of viewing the post on the original platform, and most importantly, letting us change the aspect ratio when we share photos (the majority of our pictures taken aren't square)!"
4029,Li'l Britches,"July 28, 2015",5,So valuable to look back on memories I look forward each day to seeing pictures of my kids from when they were tiny. It takes the hassle out of trying to dig through a million digital photos!

After all, we r all about our experiences and memories, aren't we?"
4031,SocialMediaManager26,"August 29, 2013",4,"Fun I'm guessing they removed the feature where you can see your friends old posts because of the new Facebook privacy settings where you can limit old posts to your friends. Timehop is awesome, doing the most with what they can. The app is a nice reminder of how far (or little) you've gone in recent years."
4032,jguerrie,"January 17, 2014",4,"Please Include Comments! I love that this app allows you to look back on past tweets and statuses, but it would be even better if we were able to see the comments on those statuses as well. I like that I'm able to click ""See Conversation"" for the tweets and I would love to be able to do the same for the Facebook posts."
4033,Nabbyadams,"January 22, 2014",4,One of my most-valued apps Easy and really cheerful. I look forward to opening this every day! The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that every few months it has an error connecting to facebook and takes a few days to fix the bug and let me log back in. Everything else is perfect.
4034,Instereowhereavailable,"July 7, 2014",4,"Interesting concept. I like the concept of the app a lot.  I've seen a few friends use it, so I've given it a shot and it's fun.  It helps if you have an established Facebook history and have posted frequently.  You really don't know what will come up from the past.  It's well designed, works quickly, all around good app."

This app is a keeper for sure! üåü‚ú®5/5 stars!"
4036,Breza0.o,"January 11, 2015",4,"Great app, glitches when sharing I love this app and I check it every day. It is great to look back on fond memories or embarrassing college photos! The frustrating part is that more than half of the time when I try to share a photo on Facebook, the caption transmits but there is no photo attached. I hope this issue is resolved soon."
4037,Addicted. x100000000,"January 13, 2015",4,"Great App I love timehop! It's so fun to look back on things you were doing a year ago today! :) I would like to see a section where you could post things to your private Timehop & reference next year that you'd rather not post on social media, though. (ex: Broke up with Steve, embarrassing memory about kid, other private occurrences). Other than that it's great! :)"
4038,MKC1224,"February 4, 2015",1,"Great concept, but... This app usually doesn't work. More often than not it tells me I have lost connection or time travel has failed. The new update, when it works, is tragic. I miss the old way of sharing where both the picture and original caption were shared instead of writing a new caption with an old picture with TIMEHOP plastered right on the image. This is one case where they should have left well enough alone, it used to work and the layout was nice, now it is a disastrous waste of space."
4039,eminetalic,"June 4, 2017",5,"Am I the only person who likes this format?? I enjoy timehop just as much as I did before the update, maybe even more. The app feels streamlined in my opinion. And I haven't had any problems with pictures not showing up... I guess I must just be lucky. ü§î"
4040,cjg986,"January 6, 2017",1,"Hate this update so much I have never written a review before, but my hatred for this update has inspired me. If 0 stars were an option that is what I would give this terrible update. I hate it for all of the reasons the previous reviewers have stated. What used to be an app that I looked forward to checking daily for a fun stroll down memory lane is now an annoyance that I check only for the sole purpose of getting rid of the red notification button. Please listen to everyone and fix this app."
4041,Marissa589,"January 7, 2017",4,"Thank you! Thanks, Timehop, for listening to the feedback and fixing the app! I love that I can see comments and likes again, and that it links to the original post. Swiping through the memories isn't my favorite feature, but I can live with it because the features that I love are back. Thank you!"
4042,Frustratedpickinganame,"January 8, 2017",2,"Meh The new interface is okay, it took some getting used to. The update was good because now we can see comments people left on posts and pictures."
4043,Cindiruss,"January 9, 2017",1,"Truly awful I do not take the time to write hardly any reviews on apps, but feel compelled to write one now. The new update is TERRIBLE. I've tried dealing with it for a few weeks now and I still hate it. I will be deleting this app off my phone soon if it's not back to the old format (mostly so I don't have to see the badge appearing for me to go look at it). CHANGE IT BACK!  I will deal with this another week and then it's gone. And that's coming from someone who has checked it 129 days in a row."
4044,Daddy tech,"January 11, 2017",5,Used to like this app I have used this app for the past several years and have really enjoyed it up until this last update. Unfortunately this current version seems buggy and unreliable on my iPhone 6splus.

4046,Dorin M,"January 16, 2017",5,"HATE the new format I used to love seeing what would show up in my Timehop.  Now the new update has made it ridiculous.  I can't share everything that comes up, the touch to zoom out is dumb, and it's a pain just trying to see everything."
4047,Madeline79780,"January 21, 2017",1,"Horrible update I used to love checking this app every morning. Now, there's no point in even using it. It fails to load at least 2 times before it even gives me results. But the worst is the new format. WHY would I want to have to hold down on a picture to see the whole image zoomed out? It's so bizarre that you wouldn't just show the whole image to start with. The new scrolling format is chaotic, and always skips over stuff. Why fix something that's not broken?!?"
4048,miatadan,"February 18, 2017",5,Mad! I have been using Timehop for years also other one this last update I can't get my pictures or what I did on Facebook keep saying I don't have anything but on Facebook it shows that I share time hot pictures from the year before! NOT HAPPY
4049,Msteele000,"February 21, 2017",3,"Counting feature I like the app. But i DESPISE the counting feature. I hate that it keeps track of how many consecutive days I open the app...i know it sounds silly but it adds unnecessary pressure and whenever I forget and it returns to zero, I purposely don't check the app for weeks. Unnecessary and unwanted feature. I would love the option to turn it off. Maybe I'm the only anxiety-ridden client, but I hate it."
4050,Someone who loves Timehop,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update I have never written a review  before but I feel very strongly about this one. I love Timehop and I love being able to see old photos but this update has made it very difficult. The new format makes it very difficult to navigate through pictures and it's close to impossible to save or share a photo. On many of the pictures, it won't even give you the option to share. Please bring back the old layout. "
4051,Squishy622,"December 27, 2016",1,"Sad times I used to look so forward to my Timehop every day. It was one of the highlights of my day. This update is frankly awful in every way. I've been trying to find the good in it but I've got nothing. I hate swiping instead of scrolling, and having to zoom out to be able to see the pics; pics take forever to load, and the flip book style animations make me twitchy. Please please put it back to how it was before. If not I think you'll be losing a disappointed user."
4052,JeriLiyn,"December 27, 2016",1,"Worst update ever! I've been using timehop for years! And it 'most always' has great memories... but the recent update leaves a lot to be desired! I always enjoyed being able to reread the comments and now I can't even go to what was posted! And the fact that you have to hold down on the picture to zoom out!?!  Please change it back to the regular timehop!!  I feel like we're being punked!!  With all the negative reviews, it seems like you would go back to what the consumer likes!"
4053,StephieCupcakes,"December 29, 2016",1,"What a terrible update! Timehop, please bring back the old interface. This one is absolutely awful. It's not user-friendly in the slightest. I miss being able to see my friends' comments on my photos. And why is everything zoomed in?! It's weird! I miss being able to scroll through with ease. Please get rid of the faux-storyline feature, or at least give us the option. From someone who does not have the Facebook Memories feature, this is my only option."
4054,Msladye5,"December 30, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE UPDATE! I have never missed a day on Timehop since I downloaded it almost 2 years ago at least. After checking my email, I check Timehop before I even roll out the bed in the morning. However, this most recent update is TRASH!! This update was not only unnecessary, but dumb!! I'm interested in knowing who came up with the concept and aesthetics, and what their thought process was because I don't get it. PLEASE Timehop go back to how it was before, or at least create an update that makes sense!!"
4055,Amy BK,"December 30, 2016",1,"Terrible update I agree with the many other poor reviews. This new update is awful. It takes too long for pictures to load. Live pictures are messed up, videos take forever, everything is cropped beyond recognition and I hate having to click through each individual picture, rather than just scrolling through quickly. Terrible, awful.  Very disappointed. It was great the way it was. Used to be a highlight of my day, now it's a chore."
4056,CrissiMedoro,"December 31, 2016",1,"Not even worthy of that one star I've never reviewed an app in my 30 years of life, but this merits a response. I can't even use this app anymore, it is on an unbelievably senseless format now that ruins the very nature of what it once was. Why, Timehop, why?"
4057,LDanko,"January 3, 2017",1,"New update was actually a downgrade Why on earth did you think that Timehop needed to become just like a Snapchat story? The mandatory zoom feature makes it so none of my pictures fit on the screen, which looks ugly. Also, I miss being able to easily scroll through and see my day in a minute. Now i have to click to go to the next thing, and it's annoying. This app is not longer usable, and I hope you see all of these similar reviews and fix it."
4058,Kiphorn,"January 4, 2017",5,Update is awful Before this last update I would've given 10 stars. I loved being able to look back at old comments. Now you can't even look at a picture right!! Please change it back!!!
4059,Kristin171,"January 4, 2017",1,"Why did you update??? I have never written a review before, but I'm so disgusted my the new update. Who wants to click through each photo? Past me had extensively tracked and I don't need to look at each photo individually because that takes all day. Further, it takes forever to load each photo. So half the time I'm just skipping to the next photo without having seen anything. I was on over a 120 day streak before the change and am thinking about deleting the app."
4060,Paige random cat? ...........,"August 3, 2016",4,"GREAT SUGGESTION I love this app so much but I have a new idea for it. I think there should be like a separate folder for messages. You can see what people you texted on that day and also be able to tap it to see all the shared messages of that day. Also, I think we should be able to see the messages from Facebook Messenger too."
4061,ChelsieüòÑ,"September 15, 2016",5,"Love it! The app shows me to see what stupid or weird things I put or shared on Twitter, Facebook, or whatever other social media site and it's hilarious haha! I check in with the app everyday and it's definitely worth downloading if you like to see where you were at a year ago!"
4062,MrsWest2014,"November 2, 2016",5,Awesome Statuses and pictures that I have forgotten about coming back to show me how much I have grown and changed as a person!!!  Please bring back what tv shows and music that have been popular over the years.  My husband and I enjoy that feature very much!!
4063,I heart yoga,"December 23, 2016",2,"New app update is Not Good The new app update is nice in theory but is super over-designed. I don't want to have to tap and zoom every time I want to see a new memory- allow me to look through memories effortlessly, make me take actions (like tapping) if I want to zoom in or do something special."
4064,suzran,"December 24, 2016",1,Not a fan of the new update I am a huge fan of this app. I have had it for years. But I want to be able to see the comments from the picture so I know what was happening in my life in conjunction with the picture. Other apps can time hop (google photos. Day one etc) but this one did it the best by pulling from social media so you got a more full picture. And TODAY it won't even open. Just keeps crashing. That has never happened in the years I have had this app. Please fix!!!
4065,@yanxrulles,"December 24, 2016",1,"Horrible update I think this is the first time I've ever written a review on the App Store, but this new update is so horrible, I felt compelled to write it. The new update doesn't let you see the captions of the pictures, doesn't play the videos, and doesn't let you follow the link to old tweet. Plus the tapping to get through everything is ridiculous. Stop trying to be snapchat. Just go back to the previous version (that was perfect) and we can all forget this even happened, okay?"
4066,HenCo1290,"December 25, 2016",1,"The new layout is horrible. Are they trying to turn this into a social media app? I don't go on Timehop to see posts in a Snapchat-like layout. I just want to scroll through and see stuff from years past. Please drop the slideshow format. It's terrible. Bring back the scrollable feed. And at the very least, if you keep the new layout, can you make it so that the pictures aren't sloppily zoomed in? This update is horrible. This layout is horrible. I'll be deleting if the app continues like this."
4067,Struggling Grad Student,"December 26, 2016",1,"Adjust picture settings Please fix the photo settings. With the new update the images are too close and I have to zoom out to see the full image. It would be great if Timehop would go back to the scrolling feature. The clicking image feature is not good and I have been using Facebook ""on this day"" more then TimeHop now. Please adjust... "
4068,JMBham,"December 26, 2016",5,Would give 0 stars but can't The new update has completely ruined time hop. As you can see from other reviews it has greatly degraded the features and speed of this app. It was such a great app but now it is almost completely useless.
4069,Coughlin96,"December 26, 2016",5,Horrible Update Why would anyone think this is a good idea? The cool part about timehop is being able to see the comments and likes on old conversations and pictures. Also I can't tell where pictures are from.
4070,somekindof_hope,"September 5, 2015",1,"I used to really enjoy this app! Needs update? It's always a blast to go look at your past.

Update: it has been a month since I've been able to see my past pictures. They still do not load. I have an iPhone 6 with all current updates for software and app. Deleting."
4071,vanitaesq,"September 7, 2015",5,"Memories I love how this app reviews all your memories. Especially if you have an annual event, this app lets you see photos on the day in the past year if you taken any. You have to allow it access to the photo apps that you may have old stored photos.

In the meantime, here is a video of a dog taking a selfie."" I love this app but it is unusable as of now. Please update with a bug fix! Also the ability to go back a day or so because sometimes you're too busy to check the app or like now it isn't working so I have to wait a whole year to see it."
4073,Jnanpei,"September 24, 2015",5,Always entertaining I love this app because it's easy to use and shows me all the fun things in the past. If you love reminiscing on all of your memories then you would love timehop! I even like how it connects to the photos I've taken in the past to compare to what I posted.
4074,Nnoel6,"September 25, 2015",5,"Twitter problems This is a good app. If it weren't for the problems with Twitter it would be a great app. Looking back years, it would be nice to see previous tweet that I replied to just by clicking on the tweet. However, the Twitter app loads and just says the page is not available. I want to see what I replied to!"
4075,Belly(:,"October 3, 2015",4,"Time Hop is a terrific tool. In my opinion, it's a constant reminder of the smaller things in life that ultimately are the most important. It's one of the ways to look back in time, reminisce, smile or see the lesson/s learn - growth because no matter how hard or tough if you work for it eventually happens and when you least expect it.

4076,Pola0211,"October 5, 2015",3,"Like it , but has some issues I love remembering it takes me to a good place! Some issues i've been having is that it has been repeating the same picture for over a week or a couple days and it has happen a couple times! And i know i didnt post the same picture over and over, also it doesnt load pictures half of the time"

4078,Mary_baby,"May 2, 2016",3,"What happened? I've loved timehop for several years now, but taking away the option to simply save a photo was a pretty stupid move.

Hope you guys change it back!!!!"

4081,The Unique One,"April 26, 2015",5,I look forward to using this app everyday! This app is wonderful! Every morning I look forward to seeing all my memories from past years. 
4082,Brit0413,"May 16, 2015",4,"Fun app üëç I really like the app, but sometimes it cuts off part of the picture, and doesn't post the caption that was intended to be for the picture when trying to share on fb. It would also be nice to be able to go back up to seven days in case someone wasn't able to look at their app everyday."
4083,Maplesmommy,"June 7, 2015",5,Fun Love walking down memory lane. Everyone likes my pictures when I share them and I love seeing others.  I wish that the pictures didn't get cropped.  Sometimes when I look at the pic on FB somebody's head is chopped off or the other person is missing!  Oooops!
4084,MsPetty,"June 15, 2015",5,"I love it! I look forward to looking back, daily at old posts. Noticing patterns of how I seem to be going through the same things at the same time every year. Watching myself and my family grow through posts- this was an excellent idea!"
4085,kitkatcassiecat,"June 24, 2015",4,"good but room for improvement it's overall a solid app. i've never had any issues with it loading or crashing, and it's fun to look back at memories. my only suggestions would be to add more social media websites, such as tumblr, and make it possible to be logged in on multiple Instagram accounts"
4086,Mirmysaurus,"June 25, 2015",5,"Always a pleasant reminder I've relived friend's weddings, my college graduation, birthdays, and even funny little tweets I've sent out over time. Even when it brought up the funeral of a dear friend, it wasn't bad, it was a bittersweet reminder of the life he lived. It's a lovely app to check in on your not so distant past :)"
4087,Pjopear,"July 12, 2015",3,"Issues I used to love this app until recently. The last couple of months pics from 2 years or more are not listed. I see this message. ""The photo did not reach 88 miles per hour"". You can see what I put as a caption on the picture below this message.  The daily devotional I post is always shown. Just not the photos 2 years and more. Needs fixed."
4088,Spunk'dRansoming,"August 20, 2015",4,"I only wrote this review so the app would stop bugging me to write a review The app takes a lot of tedious work to start it up, but other than that I suppose it's mildly entertaining. Timehop helps to pass the time before our inevitable demise. It allows one to reminisce on bygone days, when we were innocent and free. And see how horrible one's hair used to be. Like, dang."
4089,Tabithas mommii,"September 2, 2015",3,It's a good app For me I have this along with the Facebook memories enabled and I have noticed there's a lot of stuff that I have posted within the past few years that show up in my Facebook memories but not on time hop!  A lot of times it won't let me share certain memories mainly memes saying content unavailable but when I go to my memories on Facebook I can share it from there
4090,emscribbles,"November 7, 2014",5,"Nostalgia at your fingertips I love this app. Although I haven't used it much to share, I absolutely love getting my daily update showing me what I was up to years past. Reminds me of some really special times with friends and family, and also what a full life I've lived so far. Love it!!"
4091,Kevin Allen,"December 14, 2014",3,It's fun but not accurate I think this is a fun little app but I find a lot of it isn't accurate.  Like the other day it showed that 3 years ago I posted newborn pics and my baby was born in August and actually posted them in August.  Also it doesn't show everything!  I noticed it will show a video of the past but why it picks and chooses which ones and not all is strange and a bummer.
4092,EKMcGowan08,"January 17, 2015",4,Awesome! I love the concept of this app so much and I love using this app too! The only problem I truly have with it are two tiny fixable things. I wish that it would show everything I've posted on the day it searches for and that it would play the videos I've posted for some reason it won't do that! Boy do I love that dinosaur though!
4093,LTpickle,"January 31, 2015",5,"Awesome! Love love love this app! It is the highlight of my day to open it! Sometimes when I share to other sites it doesn't work but overall, great idea and fabulous app! üòÉ"
4094,damaris05,"February 12, 2015",5,Super fun! I consider the app to be super fun!  I love looking back at all my crazy adventures.  
4095,Jermanasu,"February 25, 2015",4,"Live the app---BUT Awesome and fun to live the memories on a day to day basis. The only changes I would like to see is the ability to travel back a few days if I wanted to look back in case I was out of any connected zone. Therefore, I miss sometimes the ""hop"". "
4096,Stacey Glenn,"March 3, 2015",2,"Go back to the way it was! I've loved this app from the moment I found it. Then you did some updates and now I'm very disappointed with it! I loved being able to share photos from the past and the memories that went along with the photo with the click of a button. Now the pics get cropped, the text that describes the pic is gone. I'm definitely not a fan of the new version. My theory, if it's not broke, don't fix it!"
4097,LGMilla,"March 3, 2015",5,"Absolutely love the memories! I love having the opportunity to review what has happened over the years in my life!!! I do wish, however, that there was an option to see more than one day when you view the entries. Either way, a memory is a memory! :)"
4098,itsthesherf,"March 15, 2015",4,"4 stars because nothing is perfect. ;) I really enjoy this app because it's like a blast from the past, when you open it and you see things from a year ago, two years ago even four years ago. Things you don't even think about anymore. Which is just really awesome sometimes!"
4099,Tastycake508,"March 18, 2015",2,A little scary... I've used this app for months and really loved it until the past two days when pictures started showing up in my feed that do not belong to me. I don't even know who the people are in the pictures. Mine are there too in addition to these random ones. Now I'm concerned that others are accidentally receiving my content as well. I think this is kind of scary and a security issue that needs to be addressed.
4100,Kw1029,"November 7, 2012",5,Timehop So disappointed with this app. The concept is amazing but the Facebook pictures do not come through. It's more disappointing to see the pictures not loading than to not remember you had pictures at all. Bust! Needs major bug fixing.
4101,Meesahshelly,"November 18, 2013",5,"A solution! I recently scrolled through the reviews and read a solution to the ""error"". Go to settings scroll down to Facebook, click on it and then scroll down to time hop, click on it to undo it and then reclick on it. I can now login with no problem!"
4102,jmw3184,"February 14, 2014",5,Love this app! Such a great app! I love checking it each day to see what will pop up from the past. Especially great to see how your kids grow and change each year. Wish I could scroll through and select a day though... Highly recommend this app!
4103,Rose Walker,"March 5, 2014",4,"Great app, wish it had more features. I love this app! I look at it every day. But I wish that it was connected to Facebook and twitter in a way that allowed you to go to the actual post to see if there were comments and such. I also wish you could see the day before and the next day in case you miss it."
4104,Pandoramom,"May 18, 2014",4,Fun app! But I would add one thing... This app is tons of fun!  I love seeing what was going on this day in the past... One thing I would add to make it even better though would be the comments that go along with each post!  I would love to see the comments made by friends and family in response to each picture and post.
4105,AColorado,"June 12, 2014",4,"Love this app, minus some of the bugs Absolutely love this app and would give it 5 stars in an instant except for some of the bugs cropping up recently. If you are getting the Key Object error, log out of Facebook in iOS Settings -> Facebook. Then log back in and access Timehop again. That fixed it for me. "
4106,m33na57,"June 18, 2014",5,"What happened?! I don't EVER write reviews, but I love this app and it's not been working for a month now! What happened? It cannot find ""key map"". Fix this and I'll fix my rating. (Update- you guys have fixed the issue so I have now given you the 5 stars you deserve!!! Thank you!)"
4107,Amybwell,"July 18, 2014",5,Great app!!! I love how this app takes me down memory lane and brings up the good and the bad memories... They're all precious and I enjoy seeing them again!
4108,g8trgrl619,"October 26, 2014",5,"Makes me smile Just a fun app to put a smile on your face. It's like a slot machine for your pictures. If you're someone that takes lots of pictures and doesn't have time to look through them all, this app is perfect. It picks out random picks from the past on that same day."
4109,Four square was best.,"September 11, 2017",5,Love this app I love being able to see l of my old pictures and posts! And whoever does this app is also a Whovian so it makes it even more fun! I love the fact that occasionally it has the serious stuff too. Thank you for including 9/11 and never forgetting.
4110,andisizzle,"January 7, 2017",5,"Thank you for fixing the last crappy one I am happy that we were given back features like comments, though the fact that the pictures are still so huge are irritating."
4111,Swaqqq,"January 8, 2017",3,Better but frustrated Thank you for listening to our feedback about the zoom and comments. 
4112,FOB Nation,"January 10, 2017",1,"HATE THIS VERSION Timehop, come on! This new version is AWFUL!! One of my favorite parts of Timehop was seeing the comments on past posts and now I can't do that (or if I can it's impossible to figure out how). This new version is AWFUL. I've used this app for years now and I'm about to delete it. It's not user friendly, the display is terrible, and it doesn't make me want to use it. Please fix this!!! The old version of scrolling down and seeing comments right in the app was beautiful. This is downright dumb."
4113,Wilfred Thunderbeard,"January 16, 2017",1,"Useless After Update This app used to be a really cool way to trip down memory lane, but after the most recent update it's no longer fun. Tapping through every post individually is a chore, and nearly all of the posts are cut off. Keeping my streak up should be fun, not a challenge. I know people are resistant to change, but this update has really ruined the app for me and i'll be deleting until there is at least an option to use something that resembles the old interface."
4114,BeatitudeBoutique,"January 23, 2017",1,Change it back!!!! Update: you didn't fix anything in the last update. Bring back the thumbnails and scrolling. You've ruined the app and everyone hates it. Change it back. 
4115,"Ms. Grey, Esq.","January 24, 2017",1,Losing your entire user base! I'm unfortunately in total agreement with everyone else on these recent reviews. I've only written maybe two other app reviews in the entire 6 years with my iPhone and the new updates of this app have driven me to complain. Timehop: GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL!! The side scrolling and only being able to see portions of pictures and you guys choosing which pics to show or be able to share is all just awful. You're about to lose all your users!
4116,Wilkel97,"February 20, 2017",3,"Don't like the update Timehop was my favorite app until the update. It seems like they are making some adjustments, so hopefully I can come in and change my review soon. The thing that bothers me the most about the updated version is that if you have a series of pictures, it scrolls through them very quickly and you have share any of them."
4117,Lilfitzer,"February 25, 2017",2,"Not performing well usually I have loved your app, lately though when I go to it on a daily basis it won't show anything that I have posted over the years. It goes strictly to what happened 57+ years ago that you guys put on. I know there is no way I have not posted something today for the last seven years on my Facebook say. But like I said I do love the memories of this app so please can somebody look into this and fix it"
4118,Dan Nolan,"April 13, 2017",5,"Wow... this update is terrible and now this app is too! This was great until the new improvements... give us the option to keep the old functionality and opt out of the ads... and now, you're ""freezing"" streaks to get users to watch a video. BAD FORM!"
4119,King.11,"August 13, 2017",5,Best. App. Ever. (One suggestion) I love Timehop. The streaks and your photos from a few years ago are awesome. I love the snapchat format by tapping. One thing to suggest: have a friends page with all the people that have timehop so you don't have to text them to people. Thank you and I love this app.
4120,mostlyugly,"December 27, 2016",4,"new update is so bad I've had timehop forever but it has recently been updated, and it is so non intuitive, hard to read, and just not as simple as the older version. I'm all for updates and trying to make things better but this last version as of 10/27 is so bad. "
4121,Rezupanda,"December 27, 2016",1,New update is terrible Captions and photos don't go together. Everything is zoomed way in. But my biggest grievance is that you can no longer look at likes and comments under you posts. I liked the old version that showed the likes and comments and you could click on it and read them. Honestly if this is the new feature I'm just going to use the Facebook on this day feature. I'm only checking right now because I have OCD and can't break the chain.
4122,LorenTaylor,"December 29, 2016",1,"Worst update ever Timehop used to be fun. I enjoy looking back on my old posts and see where I was in life. But with this new update, I can no longer see my captions to photos nor the comments people made on my posts. These two features are just as important as the post/picture itself. The only reason why I continue to check my timehop every day is because I like the fun fact at the end of the timeline. Please reneable these two features. The app is so much better with them."
4123,Nina Rodriguez,"December 29, 2016",1,"New update is horrible Going to look at my timehop is usually the highlight of my day but now I hate it. The update takes away just about everything that I liked about the app. I can no longer see all my tweets and retweets from previous years, I can't go back and retweet my favorite memories, I can't even see them. I really hope that timehop will be one of the few apps that actually listens to feedback and changes this, because it seems like no one is happy about it."
4124,LinseyBabs,"December 30, 2016",5,Don't get the latest version/update Timehop used to be awesome but they updated it so it works more like snapchat or Instagram but you now can't see the comments or descriptions on your old posts. So now you just see Instagram pics but no description/context.
4125,Skimm enthusiast,"December 30, 2016",1,"Please fix it! Update is terrible I've never written a review- but I love Timehop. The update is awful. I hate how the scroll works, I hate the fast pic scroll and I can't figure out how to choose one of the pics to share if it's in one of the fast scroll settings. I hate that I have to scroll back through every pic to go back and see a memory again. I hate this update. Hate. Seriously- Donald trump/Hillary Clinton kind of hate. Bite the inside of your cheek kind of hate. Step in dog poo kind of hate. Alabama/Auburn kind of hate."
4126,Some who reads CNN,"January 1, 2017",1,"Bring back the old Timehop I never leave reviews but I am hoping maybe, just maybe, the creators of Timehop will read through these and listen to what users have to say about it. I have looked forward to going through my Timehop everyday. Until now. The new update is horrible. There is no text for the photos, which was one of my favorite features. The zoomed in photos are terrible. It was so easy scrolling through the posts. Someone please bring back the old one."
4127,King922TX,"January 4, 2017",1,New update is horrible! This new update really stinks! I no longer enjoy your app. I do not like that you can no longer click on something and see the whole post including comments. The comments and getting to remember what my friends and family had to say about a post or picture was my second favorite thing about your app. First favorite is getting to see past pictures and posts. Please fix this update and bring back that option.
4128,Kkkaaatteeee,"January 4, 2017",1,"Why did you ruin timehop? This update ruined timehop for me. It doesn't show anything but the picture. It doesn't include the tweet that went with it and everything is so zoomed in. Also you have to swipe through each individual thing, which is ridiculous when it's linked to my photo album because I take like 46 pictures a day.. I enjoyed timehop so much better with the old layout. I had over a year streak and I broke that because I don't even bother looking at it now."
4129,MelB!,"January 7, 2017",5,"Kudos Really happy to see how quickly you guys worked to address user concerns about the recent update. Your fixes make the new design way more user friendly, and it's good to see so much of the app's functionality return so quickly. Much appreciated!"
4130,Julzlovesawesomeness,"May 24, 2016",5,"Love it! I've been using time hop for months and I absolutely love it! It's so cool to see my ""today in history"" for my social media."
4131,Deedi_b,"December 15, 2016",5,"Fix the loading problem!! It takes foreverrrrr for posts to load beyond the first few words. I like timehop, but not enough to sit there and just wait and wait. If it's not fixed soon I'll probably just stop checking it altogether."
4132,Theresa_Sunshine,"December 20, 2016",2,"New Update Struggles I love timehop, but since the most recent update, the app has been seriously acting up. To start, I've been keeping up with my streak and after I got to 118 days, it completely reset the day I updated the app. Also, many of the posts (from Twitter, FB, and IG) only show the first line of text from the post, and I'll have to click on each individual one (and be sent to the other apps)  to see the full post."
4133,Pitousa13,"December 24, 2016",1,"Terrible Update! I normally don't write reviews, and I normally don't complain about changes, but I actually really hate this new update! One of my favorite things to do was going through the notifications I got on my posts and seeing what people's reactions were and yet...I can't do that with this update. I don't want to have to scroll through my Facebook just to find that post to see if someone commented on it or not. Fix this please. Aesthetically it's a nice update...but not very functional..."
4134,atally1,"December 24, 2016",5,"Bad update This has always been my favorite app, but I hate this update! It's hard to see the photos, they don't fit in the frame without zooming out, and it's not easy to at a glance see how long ago the photo was taken. Please go back to the old format!!!"
4135,mags8407,"December 24, 2016",1,Terrible update I'm usually fine with new versions and updates to apps as they evolve but this update is terrible. It took all the interest out of seeing the memories and made them in to a terrible Snapchat rip off when the experience doesn't work with that kind of interaction. You can't see the comments you made to go with the photos or be linked to see the replies people left which takes most of the enjoyment out of it. Please revert it back. I'd hate to lose this app.
4136,gbowker19,"December 25, 2016",1,"Update is awful It's almost like the product team went ""let's take the features that people like and get rid of them, and then add in a new design and UX and not test it on anyone and then release!"" "
4137,MusicaReina,"December 26, 2016",3,"I miss some of the old features. :( Is there a way to add some of the old-but-loved features to this new update? I really miss being able to read the comments from past posts. Also, I may be the only one, but I'm the nerd who really liked seeing the daily high temperature for each day of the year. Is it possible to bring some of this back?"
4138,rawnt,"December 26, 2016",1,Miserable Update Why did they do this? It is awful. You have to zoom OUT on each photo entry separately. Why would you ever want to start looking at a photo zoomed IN?!
4139,EarthMamaMeagan,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update ruined my favorite app So many things wrong with this update. All images are automatically zoomed up on which really makes no sense when, for the last 3 years or so AT LEAST all social media images are square, so you get to see about 1/3 of your memory. Try zooming - it's completely counter-intuitive and you'll spend a few moments moving from previous memory to next memory just to figure out how to zoom out to see the whole image. All thumbs down"
4140,Collister5517,"September 7, 2015",3,"Fun, but okay.. I love the app it's really fun to see all the old pictures and status updates. The only down side is that I deleted a lot of stuff off of Twitter and it still shows that which is really weird. Also if you don't write a review it will never stop prompting you for a review, so take the time and write one! Overall it's okay it's cool to see how long I've been on social media sites."
4141,danielamg14,"September 17, 2015",3,"I love this app when it actually works 75% of the time I can't see the picture, it says ""photo did not reach 88 mph"". I refresh and cancel out the app and still nothing. I even restart my phone sometimes and it still doesn't work. It's annoying and really frustrating. However, when it actually works, I love seeing old posts and old memories."
4142,nancyljohnson,"September 20, 2015",5,Love It! If I didn't have TimeHop I would miss it terribly. Having pictures come up from five years ago (when first granddaughter was born) is awesome. 
4143,Sambam_______,"October 1, 2015",1,"Where's my pics? I had this app before when I had a Facebook and deleted it off my phone when I deleted my Facebook account. I didn't decide to re-download it again until about a month ago for my Instagram. Only problem is, I can't see none of my pics. I always get this ""your pic did not reach 88 mph"" don't know what that means, but it would be nice if it got fixed. I want to like this app because I already know what it is capable of and I would really like to reminisce a little."
4144,GirlMommaX3,"November 10, 2015",5,Love it! I have never had trouble with time hop. I love seeing pictures of my sweet little girls again that I have posted over the past few years. Makes me a little sad seeing how fast they've grown but makes me smile too at their sweetness and the memories. üòÉ thanks time hop!
4145,Sunnyseamama,"December 2, 2015",5,Love this app I absolutely love this app. My 10 year old and I open it every morning to get a fun look back on the last several years. And we have gone back and purposely recreated some then and now photos which are excellent. I highly recommend.
4146,Florzzzzz,"January 7, 2016",5,"Great App It's a really good App that keeps memories alive. I find it easy to use and navigate. I also like that it lets me save the photos directly to my phone as well as compare the ""before and now"". The ease of sharing on other social platforms is also a good feature."
4147,HappyGoose!,"January 12, 2016",5,"Cute! I love seeing what I was up to each day in years past! I guess I'm not like others who think the ""friends who have viewed"" is creepy... I don't have many photos with people who I don't care about.. Although I don't really want timehop to be another social network..."
4148,KEWTexas,"April 28, 2016",2,"NOOOOOOO!!! Was reviewing my daily hop and then all of a sudden ""you had a bad day"" starts blaring from my phone as today's ""retrovideo"". People are looking at me. I'm embarrassed. I have the sound OFF for a reason. Please respect that or give us an option to make the sound play. Nothing in settings. Thank God it didn't start with 50 Cent. "
4149,Cruesa,"April 30, 2016",1,"This update makes me want to delete the app. This new video feature autoplays and makes sound even if you have your phone silenced and there's no preference option to disable that. Being able to mute after the noise is already happening is insufficient. Then I went to report that this was a problem and the ""contact us"" doesn't work. The send button remained greyed out even after I included my email, a description, and a screen shot. Bad design all around."
4150,Ciarans grandma,"February 7, 2015",5,Memories galore! I absolutely love this app because it brings back all the memories of the pictures that I've taken in the past. Every day I see something new that I have posted or taken a picture of the in the last few years.
4151,JessicaLynn2552,"February 25, 2015",4,Needs to go back further than 5 years I love looking back at all the things this app shows me of my past and reminding me of different things I went through. 1 thing I don't like is it only goes back 5 year... I really wish it went back further. I can remember most of those things on my own.
4152,EddieDCNYC,"February 28, 2015",5,A fun way to make every day a throw back day App is a fun way to make every day a throw back day.  Being able to pull in the comments made by people would b great as well. Facebook should buy this company and integrate its functions. Not sure why this capability isn't native to FB already.
4153,JckWoods,"March 22, 2015",5,"I Have a Suggestion! Hi! My name is Jack Woods and I'm from Greenwich,CT and work for an IT company. I think you should be able to view other people's ,aka your friends, time hop! You would receive more information and be used more in general. I think this could get more men to use your app as well."
4154,Jess5277,"April 1, 2015",5,"Great but it could be a tiny bit better if... I too, love this app! Minor things but I've also noticed some pictures get cut off & I wish you could tag people on your photos. Again though, those are minor and this might be my favorite app!"
4155,Debbbieg,"June 17, 2015",4,Mostly good! Like this app but it sometimes frustrates me. Wish I could save long forgotten pics from various posts - and I know it is missing dates. Quite sure bdays and other important dates were celebrated and shared on Facebook in the past. Wish I could access a weeks worth and not have only a day to share.
4156,Alyduck,"August 13, 2015",5,"Could be better I love having the ability to look back on my years... When I do decide to share on Facebook, however, some strange cropping occurs automatically that I can't control. Cuts heads out of pictures, pieces off quotes, etc. VERY annoying!!"
4157,5 star game!!,"August 21, 2015",5,"Love it. I love this app. The only thing I would suggest to improve it would be to let us have access to all of the past pictures/postings it has previously shown. Other than that, it's great. I get a smile on my face just about everyday when I open the app!"
4158,Mcatarino,"August 28, 2015",4,Pretty awesome I love that you can see memories from years ago but I don't like it when the photos don't reach 88 mph. I would recommend getting me out though I love The van and now features you can see kids growing up...you growing up. Sometimes it's not always about you also get to revisit bad choices lol but I still love the app
4159,Linama11,"September 6, 2015",5,Lov'n it!!! When I downloaded this app I had no idea what a huge blessing it would be to me (and others as well--when I share the photos) My mother was killed in an auto accident last fall. Now timehop is bringing up photos of her regularly. Plus all the other memories it shares. I LOVE this app!!
4160,Kt0wn,"March 19, 2014",2,"Bug fixes? What bug fixes? The app was updated around February 20th. It's been a month since then and I have only seen my Timehop history twice. I have logged off and logged back on, I have deleted the app and redownloaded it. Nothing has worked. It would be nice if they can actually get the app fixed because I enjoy using this app. I give the app 2 stars because it's not working. If and when it's working properly I'd give it 5 stars."
4161,yacitus,"April 3, 2014",4,Social media feedback loop I love looking through my tweets and Facebook posts from years back. It provides a feedback loop to help me keep my signal to noise ratio high. And it reminds me of things I once thought remarkable that I'd forgotten.
4162,mrsmckay15,"June 28, 2014",5,Love it. Just wish I love timehop & seeing everything I've done in the past. But what I'd love even more is to see the comments & likes on the status or picture. Those are memories as well. And Facebook doesn't always have all your status'. Please make this new update!
4163,T-Booty,"August 2, 2014",5,Great if you don't put everything out there! I love this app. Everyday use for sure. I can totally see how some people would want names or words filtered out. That'd be cool if you could add the likes and comments with the posts without clicking on them. But I love this app. Keep up the good work!
4164,Grantsmommy09,"September 27, 2014",5,My favorite I absolutely love the Timehop app! It is one of the first things I do each morning before getting out of bed. It takes me back over the last 5 or so years. I absolutely love seeing where I was at just a few years ago! Thank you for a wonderful app!
4165,Tquintana13,"December 22, 2014",4,"Pretty good! App works just fine for me & I love the idea of it! How-ever I wish it would show comments from others to me, the comments that come with each post or onto a picture & more of the comments I make. Otherwise great app, I will continue to use it & hope the creator takes note of mine & everyone else's suggestions."
4166,jackfrys,"January 1, 2015",5,"Works well and fun I‚Äôve been using this app over the course of the past several years, and it remains as one of my most used. I look at it almost every day to be reminded of years past. This app works really well and the sharing features are nice."
4167,Mym2bw,"January 22, 2015",5,One of my favorite aps! I was just thinking that this is one of my favorite apps! Each morning I am eager to see what memories Timehop has offer. I have lost 180 pounds over the last 2 1/2 years and my friends and family love it when I share old photos. It is really a terrific ap!
4168,Bri8021,"January 22, 2015",4,Great but videos can't be shared Videos don't share properly and sometimes the audio is off. I also wish you could select a certain day and see what happened instead of having to wait for that date to arrive. Like if I missed a day. 
4169,Zestyshelby,"January 27, 2015",5,"Fun to see what you were doing on this day in history! I didn't realize my phone pictures would be synced up, too, so that was cool to see as well, not just what you shared with other people. Also, apparently I used to be super angsty. And I had a Facebook five years ago... Haha"
4170,Alymick,"January 13, 2017",1,"Bring back the old Timehop The new Timehop is horrible and the layout is really bad. I'm not sure who thought this would be an easier way to see all your memories. The ""now and then"" is gone and swiping through every picture (not to mention how long it takes for every single one to load) is time consuming. Even sharing the memories through text or Facebook is a pain. Bring back the  old Timehop. "
4171,Sweeney1987,"January 16, 2017",1,Still crazy While slightly better the update still makes the app unusable. It used to be awesomely user friendly but now it's a ton of work.  I have history with a ton of photo albums and I have to spend an hour just to look at them.  I want to see a bird's-eye view of it.  The user interface change is the biggest issue here and right now it's still a problem and unusable.  The user interface redesign is what's killing the app and you guys refuse to listen
4172,Piscesabitdreamy,"January 30, 2017",1,"Was great until they changed the format I have to say timehop was a great application, it's format used to be easy to use and easy to view photos and videos.  "
4173,Rayofsunshine85,"February 6, 2017",1,Still missing then and now Please bring back then and now!
4174,Jax LamByrne,"March 21, 2017",5,"One of my favorites I love being able to look back on past years. I'm so happy you brought back the ""then & now"" feature. I am currently having issues posting my memories to Facebook. It just locks up. There's you a bug to squash!"
4175,RockStarryNight,"March 30, 2017",5,I Love It! I see the comments from folks grousing that the older version of this app was better than the new one. I just started using this app so I don't know what it was like to use the previous version but I absolutely love this one and the way curates content.
4176,Falken Z08,"April 8, 2017",5,Not a fan The old app was more functional. You can see your photos correctly and not super zoomed in! I do not like how you have to swipe or tap to move to the next page. The old version was fine! Please go back to that!
4177,Kablanis,"April 12, 2017",1,"Crashing I have loved this app for a long time. However about a week ago it asked me to log in to all of the services again, no problem, kind of annoying but it happens. Well my nearly 300 day streak was set back to one. Well that is super annoying. No problem. Now a couple days later it will not update and I think I will have to uninstall the app and reinstall it resetting my streak again, but this time I will only lose 4-5 days rather than 250+. Please fix."
4178,Jtrain61268109,"April 14, 2017",1,"Hate this app, used to love it I love this app until all these stupid ""updates"" changed it. I hate that you have to tap to go to the next page. I preferred being able to scroll down. It was easier and you could compare years better. Another new irritating thing is it keeps messing up my streak even though I always check it every morning. This app needs to go back to the old version and then it's star rating would increase exponentially."
4179,coolcrissy1,"April 27, 2017",1,"Fix this app! Loved this app 3 years ago, because it actually allowed me to read the tweets and captions on posts. It also gave me the day of the week when posted. I HATE the advertisements. Does not scroll smoothly. Takes too long to load a post. There are always updates but never anything to make it better. Please allow me to save the photos that are posted in the app, where I'm unable to do so. I would like to read the entire caption of photos as well."
4180,Lynds2566335,"December 29, 2016",1,"Worst update ever The new update is terrible. I have always liked timehope and that I could scroll up and down, see comments and see my pictures. All my pictures are too big now that I have to make them smaller, I can't see anyone's comments and it's very inconvenient. Please at least make an option to go back the way that it was. I will probably stop using the app and just use facebooks memories since they are better organized now after that update."
4181,Sailorshel,"December 31, 2016",2,"Completely dislike the new update! The new update is so frustrating. I dislike that I can no longer see my pictures in an album from my memories. Instead, ""Abe"" has preselected what he thought was the best pics to share with me. I can't even copy the image to my current pics to be able to share with my children. Please read the reviews and listen to them. We the people, do NOT like the changes."
4182,Me679427,"January 2, 2017",1,"Hate the new update I hate that you can not see the captions to pictures. Also, the new format is too easy to accidentally skip to the next. You can't see your captions or comments from your post. Even the memory timehop provides from the past you can't read or know what it even is. I usually check everyday because it compiles all of social media together, but I think now I'll stick to Facebook's on this day. Also, can't share videos. Hate hate hate."
4183,Bwil9,"January 3, 2017",1,"New version is terrible I've never written an app review but will do here in hopes of timehop changing the new version. The old version was great! This new version is a mess. You can no longer view individual photos when they're put in a collage for you, you can't view comments from photos, and the tap screen to switch pictures is annoying. I loved viewing the old version but this new update is just awful. Please go back to the old version everyone loved!"
4184,Sevyn Mindoro,"January 5, 2017",1,Change it back already! How many of these negative reviews will it take before Timehop realizes the changes they made to their app have KILLED it for everyone?!?! Was this simply their devious ploy to add a little more salt to any of the 2016 wounds people were already feeling? Or perhaps it's a social experiment gone awry?
4185,KaraMcKeage,"January 6, 2017",1,"Frustrating I like to give change a chance. Usually you don't notice after a couple weeks. Not in this case. You can no longer share videos. The 3 framed photo pages are too small to see, you can't zoom in and you can't share them. I can only find the settings page occasionally. This is my first bad review on an app. I will be deleting my account and will check reviews in a couple months to see if improvements have been made."
4186,555Namaste,"January 6, 2017",1,"I wish I could give zero stars I have never written a review before, but this new update is absolutely awful. Please go back to the old version, as this one is not user friendly. I no longer check time hop daily. The photos are automatically zoomed in, which are unattractive. You're no longer able to see likes or comments, which added to the excitement of seeing past posts and photos. The format is terrible! Timehop you've updated to the worst!"
4187,thepinktink,"January 7, 2017",1,"If it isn't broke ~ don't fix it Up until the last update, I was so in love with this app. How fun to get to relive years of memories every day. "
4188,Buckeyegirl7,"January 7, 2017",2,"Unimpressed I have looooved this app since it came out, but the updates are not necessary. I updated today bc I was only able to see the first line of my posts for a few weeks and now the entire format is completely changed. It isn't cohesive or simple to use anymore and is actually sort of annoying that each post has its own page now. Take us back, it didn't need changed!"
4189,lolododjdkwndkxks2,"January 9, 2017",1,"Please revert to the older version (second review) This is my second 1 star review, as the newest patch only fixed minor features of an update that should have never occurred. I really hope that the developers see the outcry to bring the old Timehop back. It used to be such a nice dose of nostalgia, but now it's frustrating and burdensome to use. Repeating what I stated earlier:"
4190,GacayanPepper,"December 9, 2016",5,I love time hop Time hop is such a cool thing. It's so awesome to be reminded of things that happened on that day years before. So many great things happen that you forget about that just get lost deep within Facebook. Time hop helps make sure that you remember all those amazing things.
4191,W. D,"December 16, 2016",2,"Glitch makes apps nearly pointless While I enjoy using this app for awhile, recently it only buys a few words on posts so the full tweet or post isn't viewable unless you choose to post it. Since Facebook has its memories and Instagram is just pictures, this means that Tweets are the hardest hit by this glitch and it's the app I use most. But until this glitch is fixed, there is almost no reason to use the app at all."
4192,ShayDrizzzy,"December 24, 2016",1,WORST UPDATE EVER! Like a lot of you all have already said I never write reviews about anything. But timehop is something that I look at every day and really enjoy going back to see how far I've come. But this new update is the worst thing they could've ever done. Why would you take away the ability to see the comments and likes on a post? Now I have to try to find another app that has the same type of thing. And as soon as I do I am deleting this app because it is horrible.
4193,App Nickname,"December 24, 2016",1,"Do not like new update I love timehop. I love getting to see my day in history every day! However, I do not like the new update at all!!! You cannot scroll through your years. You have to go through each individual picture, no matter how many you have. Each picture shows up zoomed. You have to hold it to unzoom. If there are a couple pictures that are similar, they flip between them quickly and won't let you unzoom. I'm really not pleased with the new update."
4194,Platapuss avenger,"December 25, 2016",1,Don't like the update! This update is stupid.. I can't even save or share pictures that come in multiple.. just the single onesüò° and I can't even screen shot it them because there zoomed in!! And when I zoom out I have to keep one finger on the screen and then figure out how to hit the home and lock button?!?!?!? I understand that things change. but I feel like the developers thought to much about keeping up with everyone else. The app was WAY BETTER THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE!
4195,Eric1777,"December 25, 2016",1,"New update is worth 0 stars Like many others have stated I have been a long time Timehop user with absolutely no problems or complaints. It's something I've enjoyed using everyday since I first got it. That being said this new ""Timesnap"" update is not doing it for me. I miss the old scrolling portion where you could see through the years, even if maybe you didn't have any updates. Hate the way they show you your history now. Would give it a 0 stars if I could."
4196,Juniors1102,"December 26, 2016",5,Can I time travel back to the good version? Terrible update! Can I use a TimeHop to go back to the good version of this app? I loved it before the update. Please go back. I will not be using anymore if this is the new format going forward. Don't know who thought this was a good idea!
4197,aaronadel,"December 27, 2016",5,Stop Zooming My Pics!! This latest release is so difficult to view and navigate. UGH!! Everything is zoomed in so far you have to pinch and move around every single picture to see the whole photo. I don't like change. Not at all.
4198,Brewer8,"December 27, 2016",3,"Not crazy about the update I love checking this app everyday to see my throwback pictures but I really don't like the new update. I'd much rather prefer scrolling through my pictures rather than tapping through them. It's also really inconvenient that I am not able to see the entire picture on my screen, I have to hold down to zoom out."
4199,Jazzcatsuzieq,"December 28, 2016",1,"Horrible update I loved this app. I used it every day. Now, this recent update has made it so awful that I broke my streak because I didn't even want to try to deal with flipping through. I miss being able to just see the pictures. I don't like that I can't see things without zooming out, and sometimes it does that flipbook thing and you can't see the whole picture anyway. Disappointed, and will most likely delete the app until its fixed. Not a fan. :("
4200,Mikedoritos,"November 29, 2015",5,"Very fun! I really enjoy this app. I love being able to see my past photos and sharing them with my friends and family. My favorite thing is when you scroll all the way down you get a fun "" this day in history"" fact!"
4201,krubistuben,"December 19, 2015",1,"I hate this app now There should be a way to turn off the ""photos with friends"" option and the annoying little notifications about who viewed a photo that we shared. Of course they viewed it, they have the same photo. "
4202,yanababyy,"December 23, 2015",3,"Good, unnecessary notifications I've been using the app for some time now but I think the creators are trying to progress too much, It feels like it's getting overcrowded and slow. All the social aspects are unnecessary. Also, I really don't need to know everytime somebody VIEWS a picture that I was tagged in. Who cares? At least have an option to choose what I want to get notified about."
4203,Kedomi,"December 24, 2015",2,"Dislike Update I really liked Timehop until the latest update. The box telling me who's in the picture (I know who they are, I took it) and whether they are on Timehop (irrelevant) is a distraction to the photos. I looked in settings to see if there was an option to disable this, which there isn't. As another reviewer said, I am on the verge of deleting the app even though I love the concept of it. It has become too cumbersome to be enjoyable."
4204,TheGrimmSleeper,"May 5, 2016",1,Retrovideo - Terrible Addition Most often I use TimeHop at my desk at work to kill a few minutes of downtime. My phone is always on silent. The Retrovideo settings apparently don't care. That's not okay. My sound is off for a reason and this app should abide by that. Or better still the video shouldn't auto play. Awful update. Might just switch over to Facebook's memories feature. At least then I won't disturb the dozen people sitting around me.
4205,Kailali2,"May 9, 2016",4,"Y'all too much Wahhhh the retro video my anxiety every time I open the app :,( turn your volume off or put headphones in but not in your ears. People complain about the dumbest things. The retro video was super cool I loved it but I guess it's gone because little kids (that's what the sound like to me) keep complaining about it. Y'all ridiculous."
4206,Crystal81802,"May 18, 2016",5,"Doesn't work I used to love Timehop but for the last few wks every time I open it, it says Photo didn't reach 88 mph. I've tried deleting the app & adding it back, I've also tried resetting my phone but nothing works. It's very frustrating üò°. Please fix this!!"
4207,Kurt7403,"June 9, 2016",1,"Stopped working I've had the app for a few months and at first it was fun and worked fine.  Then suddenly it quit working.  When I upgraded my phone, it suddenly started logging me in using my daughters Facebook account, so I was always seeing her history, and she doesn't even have the time hop app.   I deleted it three separate times and deleted her account, tried logging in several times over.  Nothing. "
4208,Camannv,"July 13, 2016",5,"Favorite app I love having my memories there daily. Being reminded of significant moments in our lives or just silly things my children have said,A picture posted in a moment that may have otherwise gotten lost in the shuffle. Truly my favorite app."
4209,Megan demars,"November 7, 2016",5,Ugh!! I hate the fact that this app used to show what I would post word wise and now it only shows the pictures I posted. Go back to the old way. I had some good quotes I posted in the past that I would like to see. Not just the pictures!!
4210,FrogBabee,"July 1, 2015",5,"Favorite. App. Ever! I absolutely love this app! It's simple to use, and I adore being able to glance back into the past each day. Seeing the faces of my little ones over the years brings tears to my eyes, and it's so fun to relive my fun and exciting events in my life over and over. Definitely a keeper!"
4211,Carebear123456789101112,"July 26, 2015",4,"Would love to give this 5 stars but.... First I love the time-hop. It's pretty awesome to see what I posted years ago and forgot about it but.......the timeline photos started coming up as tiny pics and if you click on them it's blank. It wasn't this way when I first downloaded the app. If that's fixed, it would be 5 stars."
4212,Nostalgic user,"July 29, 2015",5,"Good memories, good trigger alerts I have a hard time remembering events in my life and I'm glad time hop helps me remember the good ones. Love that they have screens like ""are you sure you want to look?"" on days like Valentine's Day so you have the choice to not look if there might be a sensitive memory."
4213,twm3reid5,"August 9, 2015",5,One of my fav apps! Love this app! I look forward everyday to what TimeHop has for me to remember! It helps us take the time to slow down and appreciate the little things in life...and often helps me keep in touch with family/friends as I share its findings with them!
4214,Mrs. Swanny,"August 21, 2015",5,Memory Lane for Social Media I really enjoy this app. It's a fun way to look back at your activity on social media through the years. The only interesting thing though is it gets some things but not others. Still fun to look back though.
4215,Blue Skyi,"September 11, 2015",3,"Increasingly upset. I used to LOVE this app and use to check it religiously! But it's actually been a couple weeks since I've opened it and checked the years before posts. When I open it everything shows up with an error and tells me to ""First, reconnect service in settings"" I check on it and everything is fine.  So why won't they load!?"
4216,Whim-zee,"September 21, 2015",2,"Disappointed Timehop worked only one day for me after downloading, it stopped loading/being able to use wifi or cellular data. When my other apps work just fine. I have an iPhone 5s. I've tried deleting the app and downloading it again but I continue to get a pop up message saying ""something went wrong! Sign in with Facebook?"" Which I do not have. I'm kind of disappointed it won't work for me."
4217,BandGeek723,"September 26, 2015",4,"Good app! Works fairly consistently, and the ui is nice. I've seen the""time travel failed"" screen many a time, but that kind of stuff probably happens with a lot of apps. It makes me wish on occasion that I wouldn't have let myself get a facebook in the early years of high school, but I brought that one upon myself."
4218,Jeweleyes,"October 12, 2015",3,"My photos????? I've noticed that it seems most of my photos have been deleted on time hop, it says something like this photo has been deleted, looks like someone is tryin to get a job in politics. I know my photos have not been deleted on Facebook so why can I not see them on time hop??? I like to see posts from years ago, I think it's really neat! But can you fix this issue?????"
4219,Jaystarr041995,"November 10, 2015",2,"Seriously timehop? I usually love timehop, you know I check it every day and I especially love the little tidbits of information I get at the bottom of the screen, but today, November 10th 2015, timehop said that the first episode of that's so raven aired in 2007. Anyone who grew up in that era like myself knows that that's not true. So while this is a dumb thing to complain about, it makes me question whether anything timehop puts on there is real or not. By the way, it was aired in 2003."
4220,Ch3rryüçíMatth3w,"January 23, 2015",5,"Love it I love this app! Being able to go back in time and to see what you were doing last year, year before, a few years ago. It's amazing to be able to re-live those memories. And sometimes re-kindle with old friends. I love to watch how my sons grown etc... LOVE THIS APP!"
4221,NanaMichele69,"February 14, 2015",5,"Love this time hop app I look forward to checking it every morning to see my old pictures and posts , that  I made 1 yrs. , 2yrs., 3yrs. Up to 5yrs. Of the stuff I posted yrs ago and comparing to it now and how things changed and how pictures of my loved ones have changed . Love love this app."
4222,LeahK9,"March 8, 2015",5,"Love this app! Ingenious! I look forward to checking my Timehop every morning. Especially with having 3 kids, it's fun to see how they've grown and changed and what funny things I've posted about them from years ago. And I always think past me was hilarious!"
4223,KimberMartin99,"March 15, 2015",4,Fun Memories This app is great. I love getting a daily flashback to see what I was doing and going through on this day in years past. It bring back fond memories and let's me acknowledge how far I've come.
4224,Bwayfan Mary,"April 28, 2015",5,Not perfect... But it's free! While I have the same problem as others when sharing - or trying to share - I cannot complain. More often than not I'm thrilled with the memorable moments I get to see and feel again! Thanks and keep it coming!!!
4225,Akbbka2244bkA22,"May 6, 2015",3,"Login issues I  was recently logged out and can't get back in. It give me an error message saying they need access to all my stuff, which thy already have access to, but then doesn't give me the option to let them have access again?

4226,Bbunz420z,"May 7, 2015",5,Super cool!!! It's crazy seeing old photos and status from years ago!!! 
4227,Onesmartmamma,"May 11, 2015",4,"Remember when... Opening TimeHop everyday allows me to look back on how much and how quickly my children have grown! My only peeve with it is when I share photos it crops down further than I wish it to and often cuts people out of pictures inadvertently. Overall, a great app to have - really nothing else compares!"
4228,ShortyinCL,"June 5, 2015",3,"Not bad but... So I originally had my main twitter account hooked up with it, and then I deactivated that twitter account, there for I unconnected that account from timehop. Soon after, I went to go hook up my other twitter account and when I click on ""connect"", all that pops up is a blank page and it never loads the page that let's you hook up my twitter account. This really frustrated me."
4229,Amyrobin1,"June 16, 2015",5,"Blast from the past! I love seeing how far my family has come over the years through Timehop!  How much the kids have grown, life events we've overcome and it also acts as a reminder of life events to reflect back on! Love the back in history facts Timehop adds!  Great app and lots of fun!"
4230,rachmew,"October 22, 2012",5,"Finally, an app! I've been using timehop as an email for about a year now, and I love seeing my posts from years back. It's nice to have an introspective moment each morning. App works great, and seeing multiple years back at once is an awesome feature add!"
4231,JilltheThrill,"November 4, 2012",5,Really great app I love the idea behind this because let's face it - there are great moments that we forget the exact time and place of. I would love to be able to scroll back and look at yesterday's as well. It seems right now you can only look at the present.
4232,Henley Ian,"December 21, 2012",5,"Mind blowing memories! This app is very interesting and mind blowing. It gets to remind you on the things you posted some long time ago that you might've forgotten already, it reminds you of the best memories you shared with friends & everyone in the past. It's just euphoric time travel."
4233,YourbroKY,"August 6, 2013",1,"Horrible new update! I use to love this app. It was fun to see your own facebook posts from years prior along with seeing your friends' past posts. With this new update u can only share ur stories onto facebook, twitter, etc. instead of to other Timehop friends. I dont want all of my facebook friends seeing these posts and neither do others so nobody shares them. That ruins the fun! Whats the point now?? I will delete this app unless they bring back the old version of sharing ur posts with Timehop chosen friends."
4234,Liz fizzle,"March 14, 2014",4,"Entertaining, yet flawed This app always provides either a nostalgic smile or all-out laughter at past immaturity in only about 5 minutes. It's legitimately how I start off my day, everyday. The app does crash more often than it should, so I didn't give it 5 stars. But I would definitely recommend downloading this one!"
4235,Abonner,"April 10, 2014",4,"A little surprise everyday! Searches your photos and social media and reminds you what you were doing in the past, on that day. I have come to look forward to these little looks back at my life. It's a good reminder of how fast time is passing and how great your life is in retrospect ( or even how trivial some problems were.)"
4236,Chhhelsss90,"August 23, 2014",4,"Fun but needs more stuff I think the app should let you choose a date you'd like to look at in addition to showing you today in history. Also I wish that it would let you see the likes and comments you got on the posts. Otherwise I love this app, it's fun to look back at old posts!"
4237,smilesarepink,"August 28, 2014",3,"Great at first.. This app was really fun at first but now every time I get a notification or try to open it, it gives me an error ""tap to retry"" and never works anymore. This is worth perfectly fine service because I am able to open all of my other apps. This is very frustrating which is why I rated low. Hope the issue gets resolved as I'd love to keep using it."
4238,AshleysSmile,"June 9, 2017",1,"How many times am I supposed to open the app??? It's really freaking annoying how it expects me to open the app 4 or 5 times ""so I won't lose my streak"" I used to be so excited to check my stuff but now hate this app and will probably delete it once it tries to notify me to check AGAIN WHEN I ALREADY HAVE. Not okay and not worth my time when there's so many awesome apps. I hope everyone deletes it so that they'll actually bother to improve or just fade away, I don't care at this point."
4239,tmrose23,"August 3, 2017",4,"Much better Edit: Not sure what everyone still hates about this app. It is a million times better than it was a few months ago....Different than it originally was, yes, but it's good now, you just scroll a different way. Unless I'm missing something. I'm enjoying using it again üëçüèªüëçüèª"
4240,KSue21,"January 4, 2017",1,"Please change it back I have never written a review for an app, but I despise the new update, so I had to express my feelings. I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. This new version is the absolute worst! Looking at Timehop used to be my favorite morning activity before I got ready for work. Now, I don't even care to look at it. I do not like the Snapchat effect! I also don't like that I can't see any of the comments from people. Please change it back to the way it used to be!!"
4241,SGG 2016,"January 5, 2017",1,"Not a news flash I see from the other recent reviews y'all are aware your update is horrible. Nothing about this update is user friendly unless you like the swipe left process, which I do not. As for sharing, I have to fumble through it every time making it difficult and not worth the process. And videos, you I can just forget about those. So now what is the point of even having this app? Nothing was wrong with it before. Very disappointing."
4242,Anna28173946,"January 7, 2017",1,New version= TERRIBLE I used to love waking up in the mornings and reviewing my social media's past with this app. But ever since the new update it's been anti user-friendly and sometimes it doesn't even show up a picture I posted. I hate tapping to see the next post now. The old version was SO much better- it was so simple and with less glitches. Considering deleting this app for good unless they change it back. At least give us an option to have the old or new layout!!
4243,AllisonWendy,"January 9, 2017",2,"New format First of all, let me say that I love the Timehop app. It really is a fun way to look back on fond memories. That said, the new format is almost unbearably bad - I hardly check TH anymore because of the way it's laid out. Why are the photos automatically zoomed in? And the tap scroll-through method is bizarre and unwanted, particularly when you compare it to the old easy scroll-down format. Not sure why TH was updated this way, but please, please fix."
4244,jasonallison76,"January 16, 2017",5,Thank You! For fixing the default mode for photos from zoomed to full frame. Now I can enjoy my images and memories without constantly zooming out to view complete images. It's refreshing to see a company that's this responsive to its users.
4245,AhsupebfyKjnffhavsk,"January 22, 2017",1,"Terrible update not user friendly. Not visually appealing Since the ""update that killed Timehop"" my photos in Timehop are hyper zoomed. I can't even look at the whole picture unless I pinch it and hold it. It's like the app actually went back in time and found an old version of a visually unappealing app and decided to bring it to the present. "
4246,MIKMA111,"January 31, 2017",5,WHY SO MANY BAD REVIEWS I will tell you. TIME HOP tried to fix something that was not broken. They have made something that was fun to use. And turned it in to something that is not. All the reviews about this last update. Are true and accurate statements. I do miss the THEN AND NOW
4247,BellasMomma1116,"February 7, 2017",2,"Nice thought, badly executed... I loved this app...but you're new layout makes it very frustrating to use. I no longer see a ""then/now"" option, which was my favorite aspect of the app. I think I figured out why all my single photos were zoomed in all the time, but this doesn't make it less frustrating. I understand that you were going for a fresh, new look, but this needs a serious overhaul. Good luck!"
4248,radicat,"February 10, 2017",1,"zero stars im literally just gonna delete the app entirely if yall dont go back to the old big picture timehop. this is impossible to navigate. whatever intern came up with the swipe idea should be fired. autozoom is constantly on even when i try to turn it off, things take forever to load, and i HATE the swiping. Go back to the big picture timehop!!!"
4249,KnitNinja23,"April 28, 2017",1,"It just keeps getting worse Timehop is getting greedy. Now they want you to watch an add to ""unfreeze"" your streak. In addition to having to swipe through ads while viewing your content. The new format where we have to swipe instead of a scroll down makes this app way more clunky and inflexible. I can't find what I want quickly. Timehop please give people the option to scroll or swipe so those of us who want to can go back to the old version!"
4250,Gcpfeife,"December 26, 2016",1,"New update is terrible. I loved timehop. But with this new update it's become pointless. I can't see my memories all on the same page and see how things have changed over the years, instead I have to flip through them like Snapchat. And what is the point to every picture being zoomed in? It's just annoying. You should also bring back the comments and likes, that was half the fun! Now it's just gone! If timehop stays like this I won't be using it any longer."
4251,Ria55555,"December 26, 2016",4,One issue only I love this app but now the update.  I can't tell on which social media I posted the picture to a year ago today or if it is just on my camera roll.  That is my only complaint.  I just want to be able to see where the pictures are coming from.
4252,toshpointohh,"December 27, 2016",1,"EW Not sure this update deserves one star. It blows. I don't want to have to zoom out to see the whole picture. Half the time I can't even tell what forum it was originally posted on, and I can't see the words that went with the picture which is half the fun. Normally on an update when I don't like 1-2 things I think oh I'll get used to it.... but this is just on a whole new level. It makes me want to delete the app. Please fix this asap timehop. I don't wanna have to delete this app"
4253,Jeff13534,"December 27, 2016",1,"Used to be a fun part of my day until the new update I used to look forward to seeing my past posts and things each day, but the new update has totally ruined that. Some of the pictures are so zoomed in you can't even see what they are. Also you can't see who previously liked your post or what the comments were which was the best part! I hope they change it back, or someone makes a better app more like the pre-updated version."
4254,DesignedByBH,"December 27, 2016",1,"Awful Update I used to love Timehop. The new update is a major fail. I'm probably going to delete the app. I don't want to tap through everything--the scrolling was fine with the option to tap/share. You also can't actually use the share feature because tapping on it makes you skip to the next item. Nothing appears right on the screen, either. It's stretched and doesn't show it all. Was this tested with any regular consumer before being released?"
4255,Sheri Nash,"December 29, 2016",1,New update is awful! I have been using this app for years and will soon delete it unless this update is rolled back. The pictures don't load properly and it's not worth the effort to try and see them. I'll just use FB's version if it's not corrected. This is my first review of any app that I can recall. From the other recent reviews I can see I am not alone in this opinion. Congrats on making the app update so horrible that you have prompted a ton of first time reviewers to hammer it. üëéüèª
4256,Michelewith1L,"December 30, 2016",1,"GO BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT PLZ DEAR GOD I guess I'm not the only person to come here solely to write this review on the new update. I've never in my life written a review of an app but I HAD to come here. I've never seen such a horrible design in my life. How this was ever pitched and approved and actually rolled out to the public is beyond me. I am so confused, I can't see my memories, I can't read the comments on Facebook, I can't see my caption, half the photo is cut off.. WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING?! I'm deleting this app today. It's absolutely useless to me now."
4257,Stasiaeve,"January 1, 2017",1,So sad! Update ruined the app! Not fun anymore.  It WAS one of my favorite parts of my day. 
4258,Crashula,"January 1, 2017",3,"The Update- Awful I'm going to say what everyone else is saying. I rarely leave reviews, but I can't just be quiet about this update. It's terrible. You can no longer read comments, change your border, and it's hard to read the full posts/share them. Usually when an app updates, it gets better, not worse. Change it back!"
4259,NickLeone14,"January 3, 2017",1,"Terrible update, switch it back I'm sorry but the update has ruined Timehop. It is no longer navigational and I hate the way it is set up. I don't like having to tap through every single post to get to a certain one. Also, I can't check to see when exactly things were posted or conversations I had with people on twitter. I also can't tell what source what I'm looking at came from. Please just switch it back to the way it was before this terrible update."

4261,PattieBrown,"June 29, 2016",5,Annoyed ... About a week ago this application stopped loading memories. I have uninstalled the application restarted the phone and reinstalled the application twice to no avail... Very frustrating as I used to love this app. Will this be fixed in the future?
4262,Leviathansonnns,"July 29, 2016",3,Good It's nice to look back and see what you did years ago and it's not just Facebook it has your camera roll and Instagram and other stuff if you like but the app can share photos for you and mine has been glitchy when I try to share so I have to save the photo and repost it which isn't a big deal just should get that fixed
4263,Stinie215,"December 9, 2016",3,My streak is VERY important to me I love timehop so much! Since I've gotten the app like 2 years ago I've seldom ever missed a day. And especially since the Streak feature was added. I'm at like 200+ days. But I couldn't tell you the exact number because the streak feature isn't made for 200+ day streaks! I'm so upset that I have to wait for a multiple of 10 to see my streak number go up.
4264,N6f9p,"December 23, 2016",3,Bring back the ability to save old videos This interface is reminiscent of snapchats and that's fine. You're able to easily share photos but now you have no way of saving old videos. I liked not having to go back years to find one particular video and now you guys took that away from us! Bring it back!
4265,Jen Daniels,"December 24, 2016",1,"It's a no from me Hope they read their reviews because, yup, this is another person that hates the update. It's just inconvenient and weird. Can't see comments, pictures are cropped and the design is a little weird. It's better to see posts in their original format of a feed-like setting. I don't know what the new obsession is with snapchat format?? Scrolling through full size pictures and normal fonts is much easier on the eyes. Hope they change it back soon."
4266,Chaz757vb,"December 24, 2016",1,"Lame New time hope is lame. Why would anyone think we wanted to see a zoomed in version of our pictures that we have zoom out to see? Like which chad, zack, Jared or Steve turdhead thought that was a good idea. And now we can't see comments, the dern hell is that. That's the best part is going back and seeing old conversations (good or bad). Bring back my comments and give me my full image. I don't mind swiping the stories. That's cool. Just give me my stuff back please and thank you. Happy holidays to all."
4267,Ericaschiehsl,"December 24, 2016",1,"The new update doesn't load! I have closed the app and tried many times today, and I even tried deleting the app and reinstalling it, and it still won't work. It keeps jumping to the sponsored part to explain how to use it, says happy Hanukkah and then the end. The old version was much less complicated and doing this with glitches right before the holiday is extremely annoying! This app went from 4 stars to 1... clearly you guys made a serious mistake"
4268,EhrenKU,"December 26, 2016",1,"App went from pretty good to pretty terrible The concept of timehop is awesome! The app they designed previously was adequate. The update they've made absolutely ruins the experience of trying to view your old post, pics and vids. I legitimately hate it. I would give a zero star if I could. Can't view videos on full screen or share them. Can't easily scroll back to review stuff again. Overall functionality is a major leap backwards with this update. Do NOT update if you haven't!"
4269,WckdTwstr,"December 26, 2016",2,"Terrible Update The update is terrible. I much preferred the vertical scroll of the last version to the page-by-page that is part of the latest update. I really don't like it. Hopefully we can have an option to go to the ""classic"" view in a future update so that people who like the new layout have the option to use it, and those of us that prefer the scroll option can use that."
4270,IddyBittyKoala,"September 25, 2015",2,"I used to use this app everyday I really enjoy this app a lot, but now I can't even check it any more because it just says that the photo didn't reach 88 mph or I need to check my internet. I used to think it was my wifi or my phone's LTE connection but it has been happening every single day. I even deleted it and redone loaded it it fixed it for a day then it started doing it again, this needs to be fixed."

4272,fiona_quinn98,"November 4, 2015",1,"I want my tweets back! This used to be my favorite app because i could read my tweets from a year ago and laugh at them everyday. Then my tweets stopped showing up so i read somewhere to upload my Twitter archive to time hop, which i did. But still no tweets appearing. Definitely a disappointment because that's all i used this app for. Also the ""contact us"" option on time hop allows you in no way to contact anyone if you have a problem. Time hop needs to get my tweets back!!!"
4273,Hightower8655,"November 11, 2015",5,"Great app This app is awesome. I like that you can link to Facebook, Twitter and foursquare and you home computer to look at your old pictures and places you visited. A must have app, especially if you have a kid: it's fun to watch how much they have changed over the years."
4274,Sciencelady11,"November 13, 2015",3,Good app-needs some adjustments I really enjoy this app and looking back at old memories.  I do wish that it would let me look at previous days. I wish it stored photos better from the cloud. We switched hard drives in the computer and I can't access any old pics now unless they were in Facebook. Facebook already provides this so it isn't as fun.
4275,Caris King,"November 15, 2015",5,"I don't see what the fuss is! Timehop is such an awesome app, I enjoy looking at my old photos and even something big that happened. I'm not one to share these photos unless they're really important, so I don't have the perspective of the Facebook sharing problem."
4276,Skyüëë,"November 29, 2015",5,Love the flashback I love seeing all these old memories! And I also love how many sites they pull from and the way the organize it!! The only thing that could make it better would be to add more!! One of my favorite things to look at every morningüòä
4277,Houls61,"December 20, 2015",2,"Awful Update This was a great app at one time. Now they are trying to force you to share Facebook photos by obscuring part of the image with a ""friends in this photo"" share option. I don't need help deciding which photos I want to share. Do they not realize that the Facebook and Instagram photos that they are gathering have already been shared? Do I need to repeatedly share the same photos on the same day every year?"

4279,ajsieloff,"May 2, 2016",1,Latest update removed oft-used features Many times would I elect to save a picture posted in my TimeHop to my camera roll prior updates; best of luck doing so now. Others have also voiced disapproval for the Retro Video introduced in the latest update. What forces compelled the designers to auto-play these videos? I would happily pay to use TimeHop (read: one time fee) and to have access to saving photos and disabling the atrocious video near the bottom and I'm sure others would as well.
4280,ScrapperKaren,"May 3, 2015",5,"A fun trip down memory lane! Really simple, really fun app that does exactly what it says.

4281,Brynnsnyder18,"May 11, 2015",5,I have an idea If we could write a little blurb about what we did during the day that would be private it just on time hope that would be perfect because we could compare what we did through the years
4282,doggtpr,"May 12, 2015",5,Love it I love the app I like to see what I was doing a year ago or 5 years ago plus looking at the pictures from over the years brings back a lot of memories and you can see how much people change in just a years time
4283,Smarena8407,"May 19, 2015",5,Update a few things I love this app and use it a lot. I too agree that the cropping issue needs to be addressed as well as putting posts up to include around 5 days as events from years earlier don't fall on the same day the next yeAr
4284,Darcydoo75,"June 9, 2015",3,Fun App but won't format correctly when you share photo I love this app but since the most recent update it will not let you adjust the photo properly to share on FB. It looks like it lets you adjust it but no matter how you adjust the picture it still posts incorrectly on FB and cuts people off in the photo. Please fix this as I use this app regularly and I love it!
4285,NoahSmith,"July 4, 2015",5,"Great for an egotist like me I really enjoy this App. It's great fun to start the day with a peek back at old tweets and posts. Is it a little grotesque to start each day with a dose of ""gosh I was brilliant two years ago!""? Of course it is. But sometimes I see something dumb I wrote, too, and get brought down to earth."
4286,Kjacker,"August 1, 2015",5,Fun app Love the way this app helps keep memories. I can share them with family and friends a day at a time. There's no way to go back a day unless I haven't figured it out and that's ok because I appreciate the way to look back I've the years a day at a time!!

4288,Vampirebby,"September 3, 2015",4,1 thing I'd change.. I like this app a lot!! I love to see how I've changed over the years and see old status updates.

4300,Andrewdamato,"May 22, 2013",4,"Good but needs improvement Awesome idea. I look at it everyday. The app is relatively need, so they are working out bugs and creating better features. My only real suggestion is that you should be able to see any likes or comments on any shown status or picture. That's half the fun of seeing old statuses."

I hope you go back to the old format but since you probably won't I'm looking for a new alternative and will delete TimeHop.

But suddenly it switched to only showing the first line of each post instead of the whole thing. Awful. I don't want to have to click every single post to read it. I want to be able to scan, like before. At least make this a setting (condensed version or something). Really, the app is great, leave it alone! :-( So much to dislike now. Giving up on this.

4312,Mrs. Jessica EC,"January 8, 2017",1,New update is awful I love time hop. I loved the old version that is. The new update is terrible. I can't see all my pictures. I hate when they put some in tiny frames so small you can't even see them and you can't zoom in on them either. I hate that you can't see posts longer than one sentence unless you click on it like you're going to share it. I really just hate the update. I'd give 5 stars if it was back how it used to be. The update stinks though.
4313,Rabbit6776,"January 8, 2017",4,"Thanks for the update Thank you for listening to all of our complaints, Timehop! I'm so glad the captions are back, and you can see comments and likes. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I don't like tapping the screen to go to the next page. I liked scrolling better :("
4314,EmRan69,"January 8, 2017",5,Great when it works I love this app but since the last update it won't let me share pictures anymore only giving the option on old statuses. I am really sad to have to change my rating from 4 to 1
4315,allyboop72,"January 13, 2017",1,"Don't bother, save space on your phone I am only making a comment to save the next poor b@2$&*d from downloading ur app. "
4316,mirror23,"January 17, 2017",1,"Still not impressed I used to love looking at memories on timehop. As pretty much every review I see now, since this new update I hate it. I hate that photos and posts are STILL zoomed in. The ""Then|Now"" feature seems to be gone again. There's not one thing I like about the ""new and improved"" timehop. Please bring back the old version. As an app for showing the past you guys try to make ""new and improved"" updates to often that most, if not all, people seem to hate."
4317,dosborn,"January 18, 2017",4,1 request Love the app but have one request: 1) I open the app fairly early in the morning and a couple hours later still get an alert asking me to open the app to view the day's history. Can a change be made so that it knows it's already been opened each day?
4318,xKatrinaF,"January 20, 2017",1,"ugh Honestly, if I could give this review 0 stars, I would. I HATE THIS UPDATE!!!! I'm not one to leave reviews on here, but I'm so annoyed. Timehop is NOT Snapchat... Checking up on my old self is something I like to look at and laugh about, but now that I have to tap through EVERY. LAST. POST. drives me absolutely crazy. It's a whole lot easier to read text posts while scrolling, not tapping!! I'm clearly not the only one who feels this way, so please listen to your users and go back to the old layout!!!!!!!"
4319,RLY11,"January 29, 2017",1,"Deleting If I could give you no stars I would. I do not like this update at all. You need to go back to the original Timehop. There is no now/then , l can't save videos anymore. "
4320,Bgsiiirdsss,"December 30, 2016",1,"This new update... I NEVER write reviews, but I'm so irritated by this new update I had to. I don't understand why everything is zoomed in and I hate the layout. I miss the old one and wish I didn't update my app. Why fix what isn't broken?! I love being able to see all my past memories but looking at them like this just annoys and frustrates me! I just look at my Facebook memories and forget the rest now. Holding out to see if it gets resolved but not even worth using currently. üò≠üò≠"
4321,Joub08,"December 31, 2016",1,"Update makes it non functional After the update, many of the photos can no longer be shared. The share option isn't there. If there are lots of photos taken on one day, timehop goes through them extremely fast (without tapping) and there is no way to slow it down. There's no way to crop photos before sharing and the fact that every photo is zoomed in is frustrating. Timehop tried to ""fix"" something that wasn't broken."
4322,iJess1ca,"January 1, 2017",1,Worst Update EVER! Return to Previous layout PLEASE! I absolutely hate this new layout! It's ugly and make viewing the full entirety of each my posts annoying. I shouldn't have to zoom out of every single item to view it in it's correct size. Get rid of the full size image view. I hate scrolling left to view. I LOVED the previous layout. Like seriously you need to revert back to the original layout and viewing set up. This update is making me decide to discontinue using this app.
4323,Sad in Lima,"January 1, 2017",5,"New Timehop Please give us back the old Timehop! It was fun, you could add frames, post then an now photos and you could upload. Now you show me lots of pictures and they just keep rolling thru. You can only view themüò≠üò≠. Why did you make it unusable. üò°üò°"
4324,Fix bugs 12345,"January 2, 2017",1,"HATE the new update!!! The new update is terrible. You can't even look at, zoom in, or see the framed pictures which are usually the ones I'm most interested in. The need to zoom OUT on every picture is completely ridiculous and makes no sense. I don't enjoy this app at all anymore. I also don't like that the posts don't show with the picture so I can't even remember the context of some pictures. I can't find one good thing to say about the new app!! Terrible!!"
4325,TImehopsucksnow,"January 3, 2017",4,"Still not fixed? Really? Hopefully this was a programming mistake, and you are working feverishly to fix the issue. If this was intentional, whoever thought this update was a good idea, needs to give up on building apps. Quite possibly the worst app update ever. Why this hasn't been resolved yet is baffling. EVERYONE HATES IT, and your ratings are in the gutter."
4326,Viztek,"January 3, 2017",1,"The worst up date This is the worst up date Ive ever experienced. I hate when apps try to be another app, the snapchat story format does not work, like AT ALL! You can't see where the post was originally posted, no captions, no then and now comparisons, no filters. It doesn't even show all of my tweets! Why mess with something that was working. Now I hate looking at my time hop every day and I'm not gonna sit around and wait for it to become bearable like I have done with Instagram, bye bye time hop."
4327,jofkeiter,"January 3, 2017",1,"Was a great app, new interface is terrible I've been using timehop for years and always liked it. The new user interface is HORRIBLE. It is difficult to navigate, zooms in on every picture for no apparent reason, separates Facebook status updates from the pictures that were used in the status update. Sharing is much more difficult and impossible to share videos via text message. Bring back the old interface or I'm done with this app!!!"
4328,smks6844,"January 3, 2017",1,"Hate the update Looks like I'm pretty much repeating what everyone else has said. I've never written a review for an app before, but I hate the update THAT much! I loved Timehop until the update. I miss being able to read the captions that go with the pictures, I hate the full screen, I hate having to tap through each picture one at a time. The whole thing is much more difficult and I feel like I'm seeing less of my memories. I liked it MUCH better the old way!!"
4329,Callieb24,"January 4, 2017",1,"The update ruined everything Timehop used to literally be my favorite app until this new update that ruined it. Hopefully some app developer will see how much we all hate it and develop a new app that's just like the old timehop we can all download. The most frustrating part is the over whelming amount of hate for this update has not motivated the timehop people to do anything or value. So, go ahead, keep your heads in the sand and watch all of us delete this app in the next month."
4330,MissyLiss!,"December 23, 2016",1,"Nooo I don't normally write reviews, but please change it back to the last update. I've always enjoyed and been impressed by the design and I can adapt to change but I feel like you're going to lose a lot of users. I already had issues with mine and I love TimeHop, but I would consider deleting it. It's so hard to navigate through. Mimicking Snapchat is not a solid design for the service you provide. Not to be negative, but from a loyal user of your app, I just wanted to be honest."
4331,Jim of the Jungle,"December 24, 2016",1,At some point‚Ä¶ The new update is abominable. They took everything that was good about the app and tossed it out the window and replacing it with a useless mess.
4332,Little Meesh,"December 24, 2016",5,"Won't Load I highly dislike the new update just in general, but it updated again last night and now when I open the app it just keeps saying there's an error and it can't load my memories."
4333,StacyC99,"December 24, 2016",1,"Change it back. Please. We beg you. Obviously, no one likes the new update. Stop copying Snapchat. You were original in your design, but you had to ""join society"" and be like Snapchat (and now Instagram with their stories). Why? STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF TIMEHOP!!!! "
4334,Missing my THEN/NOW feature,"December 25, 2016",1,"Very sad about this new version! Where is the THEN/NOW feature?! I wanted to use this for sharing Christmas photos of my growing babies, and it's suddenly disappeared! üò¢ This feature has been the main reason I use Timehop instead of Facebook Memories. "
4335,J.FloÓÑé,"December 26, 2016",2,"Terrible Update Why go and mess up something that works and makes people happy??? The new format on the most recent update is terrible! It's all zoomed in on pics, some won't even zoom out, funky color on worded memories, it's not good. I really hope that they take their customers seriously, doesn't seem like anyone likes it now. Ever heard of a beta group to test something out on before you go and ruin everything?"
4336,Deathcomesin3s,"December 27, 2016",1,"New update ruined the entire Timehop experience I have been using this app for a very long time, and this new update has led me to not getting excited to open the app anymore. It has confusing features and why are all the pics already zoomed in on? Looking at all the reviews already, it seems like you are going to lose a lot of users quickly if you guys don't make a change. Timehop used to be simple and fun and now it's confusing and frustrating."
4337,DMWolf,"December 27, 2016",1,"New Update Has Ruined a Fantastic App I used this app almost every day, especially since Facebook refuses to give me the native ""Memories"" feature even though everyone else has had it for years. This latest update has made it nearly unusable. I can't see some of my photos, I can see captions or comments like with the old version. Statuses are chopped up. The navigation and interface are awful."
4338,dancingdiva939,"December 28, 2016",1,"Terrible update I used to love this app despite its many downfalls, but I'm on the verge of deleting it unless the update is fixed. It's useless for one thing and it also doesn't tell you the source of any pictures. It could be from Twitter, Facebook, iCloud, or a ton of others but I'll never know. It also stopped showing captions on instagram and twitter timehops which is extremely frustrating. If they don't change the update they're going to lose a lot of app users."
4339,Jdecap17,"December 29, 2016",1,"This update is BAD One of the worst updates of an app i have personally seen, way to complicated for an originally simple easy to scan through app.  Not being able to see comments and convos was one of the best parts. Only shows one picture when i know there was more to the post. Also like knowing the day and the weather of the original post that has since been removed. Needs to be changed soon or im deleting this waste from my storage."
4340,Gifehvhi,"October 22, 2015",1,Stopped working I used this for a year. A few small problems but nothing major until a day or two ago then it just stopped loading. The pics from the past are usually cropped down and can't be changed back to full size. Now the small stuff isn't an issue because it's completely quit working. No problems with my phone or any other app. Just this one. Deleting this now since Facebook has this feature anyway.
4341,Cdayzee,"November 11, 2015",2,"No Bueno I used to look forward to opening timehop each day but now, not so much. Why? Because apparently it no longer is set up to sync pictures from my desktop, which is where the majority of my pictures live because I don't share a lot on social media. So without that feature, this app is disappointing. I've sent emails/help tickets but I'm ignored. I guess it's what we now get for free, so shouldn't complain. Not amused."
4342,emmiiiily,"December 24, 2015",1,"No. I loved TimeHop until the most recent update that sends notifications for when another person looks at your shared photos. Not only is it borderline creepy, but really awkward if it's a photo with an ex. If we want people to see what comes up in our TimeHop, we have the ability to share with them directly. If this feature is here to stay, please allow us to have the ability to turn off these notifications or I will no longer be using the app."
4343,Pargo626,"January 21, 2016",5,Love time hop I really enjoy time hop.  Sometimes it makes me sad with pics of loved ones lost but the memories speed the healing which makes me happy again.  Time hop helps me reflect on years past and helps me focus to make this time 1-5 years later happier healthier and wiser!!
4344,EIIE25,"February 7, 2016",5,"Life...right at your fingertips! I absolutely love the Timehop app!  I appreciate the work the developers put into it to consistently keep it fresh and updated too!  It's so easy to create fun ""then and now"" frames to see how the littles in my family have grown through the years!"
4345,Patti-Kell-and-Kate,"July 6, 2016",4,Get snapchat I was not part of the Facebook generation so I personally don't have the problems people are having logging in. Personally the only thing that bugged me was the ad but that was since moved to the bottom. My only request is to be able to see old snapchat stories!
4346,T_yay,"September 10, 2016",3,"Love. However... Great app. Great idea. Super fun. HOWEVER. The ""streak"" thing is stupid. I went all the way to 80 days and then the next 3 days or so the app wouldn't open. So I lost my streak. And ever since then i will get to 10 and I'll open it the next morning and it will be back at 0 (no I didn't forget to open in the day before). Disappointed because I really wanted to keep the streak!"
4347,SGold93,"December 6, 2016",5,"Why have the days I go on? The reason why I deleted this app is because it counts how many days you go on it. I was at Day 75, missed a day then had to start over. If I make it too 100 will I get a prize? Eliminate the count down. Was a lot more fun without it."
4348,addison_montgomery,"December 19, 2016",1,"Was a Great App...until they updated the way the tweets appear. I love seeing memories appear each day. However, after one of the updates, it takes forever to read through the memories as it takes so long for each tweet to fully open. Why was the change made? If I reading Timehop, I want to get through it with out having to wait 2-3 minutes for each page to open. Put it back to all of the tweets appearing as soon as the app opens please!"
4349,bruinlovesgaga,"December 23, 2016",2,"Latest update needs some work Not sure how I feel about the new update. The tapping to progress works for Snapchat and Instagram, but I preferred scrolling for Timehop. Also, one of my favorite things about Timehop was being able to read comments from past posts and going back to the actual post on the social platform it was originally on. Was this feature taken off? Kinda regret updating now!"
4350,##photogirl##,"June 7, 2015",4,l o v e !!! It's awesome. Can't believe it took me so long to discover this!
4351,Juicy239,"June 25, 2015",5,Always something to look forward to I love this app. I look forward to get my notifications everyday. Always makes me smile and laugh. It's so nice to be able to see those old pictures you forgot you had taken.
4352,K4i7,"July 4, 2015",3,"Cool in theory I use it mostly just to look back on myself, so for that it works well. The only time I wanted to post something from the app back to my FB, it didn't work, so as far as actual functionality, it's not so hot. Never did see a then and now feature, but it's apparently gone after this update. Can't miss what you never had, though, right?"
4353,BrittFattyy,"July 14, 2015",4,Awesomeness Really enjoy looking back at what I did years ago. I think generations to come would
4354,hsewell87,"July 17, 2015",5,Love this app! Love this app! I love seeing what I was doing in the past. Things I don't remember doing I'm reminded of. I love seeing the old pictures of my hubby and me and of my three year old. It is really neat to be able to go back and see those. I don't know how Anyone wouldn't like this app'n
4355,Lulubell13579,"July 21, 2015",5,Awesome! I check this app daily like a morning newpaper!  It's awesome to see what you've done years ago!  The only thing is that I feel like the dates on certain posts weren't correct. Like my 4th of July pictures that I uploaded on indenpence day were on time hop around the 6th.
4356,Times Guy,"August 3, 2015",5,Best way to view old photos I love getting old photos delivered almost everyday. What a great way to pinpoint your history. My favorite app. I don't have any problems on my phone or iPad. Opening this app has become an everyday event for me and I have few of those.
4357,WellsyL,"August 12, 2015",3,"What happened??? I've loved this app since the day I installed it but the latest update won't even let me open the app! When I try to open it my screen goes black & shows the white Apple like it's starting up & then goes to my lock screen. The app update states that there were ""Bug fixes"". Seems to me like there were ""Bug additions"". Please fix ASAP! I miss my timehop!"
4358,PearlHiba,"August 29, 2015",4,"Love memories I use timehop every single day, and it is really amazing.  Seeing your old posts on social network, and tracking how you've changers over ears is just heart touching. The only downside about it though is how far back you can go back, especially on Twitter, as you can't go further than 3000 tweets back!"
4359,Princess Pink 005,"October 4, 2015",4,"For the most part it's great I just downloaded TimeHop about 2 weeks ago, and while I love seeing the old pictures and FB posts, sometimes the app will not load for the day. This has happened twice in the past 10 days. Hoping it will be fixed soon with an update"
4360,Jbennygold,"March 3, 2015",5,"I start my day with Timehop Timehop is one of the first apps I open every day. I can see what I was up to almost 10 years ago. Most days I find at least one thing to make me laugh (or sometimes wince.) Either way, it's a great daily reminder of where I've been."
4361,JazzyGirl2525,"March 7, 2015",5,Great app for remembering sweet moments So I have a family of 5 with 3 small kids. Watching the changes from year to year is fun. My kids love looking at how much they have changed over the years! Good family time and conversations have occurred because of this app.
4362,ElbowStrudel,"March 18, 2015",4,"Nostalgic fun It's really fun to relieve past moments. You can share via email, FB, instagram, text and many other ways. I wish they hadn't reverted to the square format - or at least gave us the option to choose, depending on the outlet. But it's also cool that it picks up pics from your phone and cloud not just social media."
4363,Dsmith241255,"March 20, 2015",5,Privacy Alert Don't use App For the second time this week I am getting other people pictures. Very concerning that someone else may be getting your photos. Major privacy failure and no response back from customer service.
4364,Bsm480,"March 22, 2015",5,Amazing!! I so love TimeHop because it reminds me of what was going on in previous years. It has been such a special blessing to me this year because my husband passed away in November 2014 and now I have pictures that periodically come up that helps me remember him in such special ways!!
4365,LABS743258,"March 29, 2015",4,"LOVE IT BUT QUIT CROPPING!!! It hasn't always done this, but now when you share a TimeHop pic, it gives you the square format like Instagram pictures. If I shared the pic on FB and not instagram then the original is not cropped and therefore when I TimeHop share it I often end up not sharing it bc the pic wasn't meant to be cropped. Please change that back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4366,4txboys,"April 5, 2015",5,"Love it!! I love seeing that changes over the years!!  I wish I could go back to the previous day. Also, I'd like it to show that specific day and not just the date. Holidays, for instance. With Easter, I can't see my pics from last year until tomorrow."
4367,Goldlion54,"April 27, 2015",5,Great App I love looking back to see what happened a year or more ago. And than the Than/Now feature is great to compare how fast my baby boy is growing up! Even has little weather dates and facts about what happened in history. Learn something new everyday!
4368,TashaReece,"May 12, 2015",5,Great app! This app has become a morning routine of mine. I just have to check it daily to see what I posted or did this day years ago and shows my growth and maturity since then. Also how my son has grown from 2 years ago when he was first born ‚ò∫Ô∏è
4369,Htownpostman,"May 20, 2015",5,"Great way to relive memories... Every day I open this app it's reliving memories.. Some good, some bad, but none of them I would spend time scrolling and scrolling looking for... It's been 6 years for me, and as a stage 4 cancer patient for 4.5 of them, I see all of my ups and downs.... A great app for everyone!!!"
4370,ThatShanaBanana,"June 4, 2014",4,"Mostly amazing I love this app for the most part. Every morning, I look forward to seeing the dumb stuff I deemed worthy of posting or tweeting. The only issue I have is the connection to my iPhone photo gallery. Every photo shows blank in the app every day. It might just be that I have too many photos. Still a great app."
4371,AdamismyIdol8,"July 4, 2014",5,Wish you could jump to specific days. I love this app. Love seeing what I did years ago. I just wish you could jump to a specific day. I'd love to read certain days again. And I was with out a phone for a few days so I missed out on some time hop days.
4372,Perfectance,"September 25, 2014",5,"I check this app every day If you often post online, this app is a fun look back at what you were doing in the past. Each day is another trip down memory lane reminding you about something you might have forgotten about."
4373,br'ed,"December 10, 2014",3,Update error For some reason all of my other apps will update except for timehop.. And due to the fact that it will not update it also will not let me me go into the app j click on it and nothing happens .. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could do to fix this problem ? Other than this technical error u live timehop it's such an awesome app!!
4374,MandiMo,"January 22, 2015",5,"Nostalgic I love this app!  I love seeing photos and events that I had forgotten about, and it's been fun to accidentally be doing the same event or activity on the same day in following years.  This year I realized that I had hung out with one specific friend on the same day for the fourth year in a row!"
4375,Energie2,"February 9, 2015",5,"Great app I shared something on FB that ended up being ongoing and was sad that I didn't save the info in other places. It's almost impossible to back that far on FB and to capture every single post. Now I'm able to save it as the days go by, thanks to this app."
4376,Orbit Storm,"February 9, 2015",4,"Fantastic, despite some flaws First and foremost, this app is incredibly fun to use. It's unfortunate that a handful of bugs persist over several releases (i.e. quirky daily update times, some content not loading, etc). None of that is app-breaking, however. Look forward to future updates and hopefully new features!"
4377,Pup Tank,"February 10, 2015",5,Amazing At first when I got this app u was hesitant to use it. Very little every showed up for choices but as the time went on the amount of memories that I have had recalled from the pictures or means that are available made it really worth it!
4378,Jw32809,"February 10, 2015",5,Best app ever created There's nothing I love more than opening up this app every morning and reminiscing over the last many years! I get to watch my babies grow all over again! Thank you to whoever created this!!! It's really a beautiful moment every day!
4379,D3gray,"March 3, 2015",4,"Great app I have had this app for the past 2 years and it is great. You can sync all of your social media accounts and have daily nostalgic moments and reminisce on the good, the bad, and the ugly that happened to you throughout the years. Definitely recommend getting it f you have had social media sites for a while."
4380,Fridays_Child,"November 23, 2012",5,"A real life purpose Such a great idea. I enjoy seeing where I was a year ago, how I felt, what made me happy, sad or angry. Very enlightening to see how I've grown & changed ... or not. Really enjoy that I can share on FB. Least important but notable, the notifications and the app are bright & sunny - a very good way to start a day."
4381,Juandamz,"February 17, 2013",5,"Cool concept I give it 5 stars not only bc the app works perfectly, or because is a great and original idea; but, because when I had a problem with it, I just email them, and in less than 24 hrs they fixed my problem."
4382,Brittany Magrini,"November 16, 2013",5,Amazing app IF ITS NOT WORKING GO INTO YOUR SETTINGS FOR FACEBOOK AND TOGGLE TIMEHOP. IT WORKS! 
4383,ElizabethLaw629,"February 6, 2014",5,"Bring back the previous time hops button!!! Great app! But somedays I never get the chance to check it. I enjoyed the arrow button at the bottom that allowed you to view the past few time hops incase you missed it, but now it's gone!!! Bring it back!"
4384,Jorge5557,"March 30, 2014",5,"Favorite App I'm so nostalgic so I live waking up and seeing what I was doing on a particular day in the past. This app syncs up with your Facebook, Twitter, and iOS album to give you so many posts that I never to a day without having a time hop to look at. Highly recommend this app!"
4385,Katie21784,"March 16, 2017",1,"New update broke app My app won't ever load content since the most recent update! Timehop used to be a pretty good app, then they tried to get fancy and completely ruined it. Doesn't show the day of the week originally posted anymore, selects which content it shows rather than showing everything, pictures from FB are horrible and you can't even see the whole status that goes with it. Overall the app needs to be completely revamped!"
4386,Chucko86,"March 25, 2017",5,Your update is terrible.... and still is terrible. I'm giving you 5 stars because your app is fantastic. Your update though... ever heard of new coke? Yeah. Exactly. Stop it.
4387,Sdjacks,"April 14, 2017",2,"New format is clunky I'm not of fan of this clicking to the next page thing. I much preferred how it used to be that you could scroll down. A lot of my tweets were continuations of another, or are part of a conversation. Trying to share was easier when I could screen shot multiple tweets at once instead of saving and sending someone multiple pictures. I loved Timehop before."
4388,Skyttle428,"May 22, 2017",1,"How can an app actually get WORSE??! Oh Timehop....you've got this all wrong. Before the huge update I would have given you 4.5 stars, but now if I could give 0 stars I would. This update is horrible. HORRIBLE. I was on a 243 day streak before the update and now I don't even care to check it because it's so frustrating to use. The boarder options are gone, the words are gone, the rotating seasonal boarders are gone...how can you go backwards???? This app is not worth my energy. I am DELETING this app."

4390,txgolf,"January 4, 2017",1,"Sad update The update still has bugs and functionality missing. Not worth using in its current form. Pictures are distorted, no captions, can't click through to content, no then/now, no frames, share feature is not intuitive and half the time just advances to next page. "
4391,knfw,"January 6, 2017",1,"Wow this is awful I used to love Timehop but this new version is awful. Way too hard to skim multiple similar updates, less options for sharing pictures (unless I just can't find them-- which would be poor user design), and it's just harder to read because words get cut off on the sides of previously reposted items. I'll keep checking to see if an update fixed this but I'm less likely to enjoy my experience with this app now. So disappointed."
4392,MorganFreemanSemenDemon,"January 6, 2017",3,"Fixed problems aren't actually fixed The new update says they made auto zoom optional, so I went to settings and turned auto zoom off. It still auto zooms. I hate that. If I wanted a picture or video that close up, I'd have taken it that close up in the first place. This is a horrible feature no matter how you spin it."
4393,TagsDaddy,"January 7, 2017",1,"Update - Terrible I've NEVER written a review about an APP, but I felt obligated since this new update.  It is an abomination.  I haven't found one person that doesn't think it is horrid.  Whomever came up with the Zoom application should be terminated immediately.  This will be the death of Timehop.  If I could give you negative stars I would.  I especially cannot comprehend the arrogance and ego the top brass must have to continue on with this update seeing how the majority of your users think it's terrible?"
4394,Brandelicious83,"January 15, 2017",5,Used to love it I used to love Timehop and used it daily. Then they updated it and it sucked. Then they updated it again and now it doesn't work at all. I'm hoping they can revert back to the old version that I enjoyed and that worked!
4395,EvilBeagle05,"January 16, 2017",1,"Latest Update = Please Return to Previous I love timehop... correction, loved. The latest update that changed the basic format was a mistake. I loved the vertical scrolling view. This new view is frustrating to look through: each photo is overly zoomed in and massive. The photos can't be sized easily. I used to be excited to see what photos were on my time hop... I am no longer. Actually considering deleting the app which makes me sad. Please return to previous user interface."
4396,Bclaus,"February 7, 2017",5,"Timehop vs Memoir After much gnashing of teeth and general anguish over the new Timehop update I test drove the Memoir and Timehop apps side by side. Even in it's much diminished state, the Timehop app beat Memoir hands down. I grudgingly upgrade my rating to two stars. I still hate the new format though. Not that anyone is listening."
4397,Hikachu,"February 16, 2017",1,"new update still inefficient It still takes ENTIRELY too long to go through timehop, especially for people like me who have anywhere from 8-10+ years worth of history to go through. Tapping through everything one by one and having to hold down to see an entire photo is a joke. It's incredibly inefficient, not user friendly at all. Some things don't even show up properly. This has got to be a joke. Go back to the scrolling already!!!!"
4398,jill_knapp,"February 21, 2017",1,"Don't Like New Layout Stop trying to be Snapchat or Instagram with the new layout. Old one was easier to navigate. Plus the new layout doesn't allow me to click on the status/tweet to expand it to see comments/likes. And the pictures are cropped weird to fit the screen, like Snapchat. I want to be able to see the entire picture not part of it! Please allow users the choice of scroll or swipe, but scroll was so much easier and cleaner."
4399,lgracemarlow,"February 26, 2017",2,"Used to be a five-star app - update stinks Timehop is the sweetest concept and such a fantastic app. HOWEVER, their new format just stinks! Besides this auto-zoom feature which will not disable and does not allow you to see your full photo, you have to swipe instead of scroll and you can't see your Twitter convos so it's all pretty dumb out of context. "
4400,RyDo90,"December 29, 2016",1,Horrible Design It's all been said before so I'll keep it to the point. This update is horrible for the following reasons:
4401,musicfreak13,"December 29, 2016",1,"Convoluted UI with poor usability This new update introduces a convoluted UI that seriously hurts the user experience of the app. The idea of the timeline seems entirely removed. The new swiping and tapping motions are not intuitive and, at the same time, are ultra-sensitive ‚Äì so you find yourself skipping ahead three memories without realizing. I'm all for innovation in the experience, but what Timehop forgot to copy from Snapchat are the  icons and hierarchy in place so the swiping and tapping can eventually become intuitive. This is a mess!"
4402,um why,"December 31, 2016",1,"The Update The update really messes up the point of timehop for me. It only shows the pictures but not the caption, and maybe I remember using that picture but why did I post it? Where is my explanation? I think the update was a cool idea but you have to make sure the app continues to function properly. It not showing the whole memory anymore and that is a problem for me and others who actually like to use timehop to see how we were like 6 years ago."
4403,Ariana Dupeche,"January 1, 2017",1,"Horrible update!!! What is the point of this new layout?? It's ridiculous and completely negates the purpose of Timehop.  You can no longer see the comments from the past stats, the pictures and stories come up huge unless you try to share it and you can't even read the full memory.  It needs to go back to what it was before and from what I see in other reviews, looks like all of your users feel this way.  Horrible decision Timehop.....HORRIBLE!!!!"
4404,mrsrossjr,"January 2, 2017",1,"Worst update ever I used to love this app, they messed up royally with the newest update. My primary issues are that you have to zoom out to see the full picture and you can no longer see the source (instagram or Facebook, etc) and your original caption is no longer visible -- and face it, sometimes when the pictures are old you need a little jog as to what you're looking at or maybe the caption was the funny part. "
4405,Mfleco,"January 3, 2017",1,"Awful Update It's been said before, I need to say it again: the new update is absolutely awful. Not only does it automatically zoom in on your pictures, half of the time they don't even load! I never had this problem with the previous version so I was very disappointed when I realized that nearly 75% of my pictures don't load. It has nothing to do with my Internet connection; all of my other apps and Safari works fine."
4406,Ruwieutufoeow,"January 3, 2017",1,"UPDATE IS HORRIBLE Why did Timehop think it was a good idea to emulate Snapchat?! They are two totally seperate things. Everyone used to look forward to opening Timehop daily and checking their memories. But now they took all the memory out of it. No shown captions, comment threads, nothing. Now theres no meaning behind anything I'm looking at. I'm just randomly scrolling through (so stupidly) zoomed in half photos??? Worst. Update. Ever. App becomes useless. Not sure why Timehop tried to fix something that wasnt broken."
4407,Nicole Mantooth,"January 3, 2017",1,I HATE the new update. I used to love timehop it was the first thing I looked at almost everyday when I'd lay in bed while waking up. Now I don't. I hate that you have to press to zoom out to see the entire photo. I can no longer see what I wrote about the photo when I posted it and I loved that because that too brought back memories I may have forgotten. 
4408,lpodge,"January 3, 2017",1,"Bring back the old format!! I guess I'm going to say everything that many other people have said but I do not like this format at all! I hate how I have to hold down to zoom out. I also dislike how I can't see any of my original likes and comments. This had been my favorite part before the update. I've stopped using time hop and just using the ""on this day"" feature on Facebook instead. Hopefully the next update will fix these issues."
4409,Emidun4633,"January 4, 2017",1,Timehop is sad now Timehop didn't need to be fixed... I used to be able to share any videos I had and now I can barely save anything... the update is dumb and it is kind of makin me and a lot of others not want to use timehop anymore... I think you all need to fix the sharing and this BIGGER version because that is obnoxious as well.... why fix what IS NOT broken....? I would love to save the 3 videos from a year ago but I can't due to whatever you all changed... it's really sad....
4410,Gman216840,"December 24, 2016",1,Aweful!!! This new version is absolutely terrible and I hate it. I can't see any of the original comments or what I wrote about pictures I had posted. I can't go from timehop to my original posts on twitter or anything else. I have to zoom out on pictures which I don't understand and doesn't make any sense at all. Timehop needs to fix all of this. I don't want this to be like a Snapchat story. They should keep it how it was or make some major adjustments ASAP. you messed up timehop.
4411,macdaddymd,"December 24, 2016",1,"Ugh. Anyone else have issues with swipe up to share? I rarely write reviews, but this update is awful. Zoomed in pictures? So I can't see anything except the center? I have press to see who else is in it! And I have been trying to share one for quite sometime. Swipe up doesn't work 99% of the time! Oh, I get the iPhone control panel quite easily. Why doesn't just PRESSING that little Share icon do it?? I hate this update, downdate, lateraldate, whatever it is. It is NOT an improvement."
4412,HzZLEyEdGrLL,"December 24, 2016",1,"Who approved this update??? This is my absolute first review ever. I loved Timehop, until this absolutely horrible update. Who wants to hold a picture to zoom out? Go back to the regular way and let us see the whole picture and zoom in if we choose to. Go back to the scroll so we can see what we want and not have to click through each picture for how ever many years of photos or events there are. Just go back to the version before this update."
4413,faimarie,"December 26, 2016",1,"Very disappointed Very disappointed with the new update. I'm not a fan of the layout or the zoomed in automatically feature. The main reason I liked Timehop to begin with (aside from seeing past photos) you could also read the old comments and see the likes you had on that photo. You can't do that anymore. Will probably be deleting this app before the new year. My resolution is to not have things in my life that upset me, and this app upsets me now."
4414,Raeeeeee222,"December 26, 2016",3,Why??!?!!! To this new update! I don't like this new update! I get that you have to keep new things coming but this is update is really unnecessary. I don't like that you can't see captions and comments anymore! I can't laugh at the crazy things my friends used to say anymore. I hate to complain but I really hope this new update has some changes coming.
4415,Almaverick,"December 26, 2016",1,"You're new update is awful You completely blew it! There's nothing I like about it. If you wanna make it able to slide side to side, fix it so I can look at yesterday. Making me zoom out on photos is crap. Also if it's a picture with a caption at the top you can't read the words because your ""1 year"" is plastered across the top. Put the year on there when we post it maybe but give the option to move that around. You failed miserably this time."
4416,Jen516seriously?,"December 26, 2016",1,"Zero stars. Updates are supposed to make things better. Updates are not supposed to take away functionality. I'm so mad I updated. Being able to see the comments and posts for the pictures was HUGE!!! The only reason I even cared!! Now it's just a bunch of pics... I could go into my photo cloud to see those. I want the comments and words that were posted with the pic back!!  I also enjoyed the cute frames that are now gone. Big mistake, timehop. Huge. So mad!"
4417,Melly22778855,"December 28, 2016",1,"Go back to old version or it's worth deleting I used to love opening timehop, now I can barely even see my old memories. No longer can I see comments or likes, it's honestly horrible. I didn't even want to give it one star. If you guys don't fix the app back to the old version I'm honestly going to delete the app. Many of my friends feel the same way too. To anyone thinking of downloading this app, if they don't fix it back to its old version- don't download it."
4418,Miargillespie,"December 28, 2016",1,"Can not describe how much I dislike this I absolutely cannot stand the latest update! Put it back to the way it was. I want to be able to see the full image or video without feeling like I'm tapping through Snapchat. And also I don't want to see my photos in little tiny frames. Let me scroll through full size versions of my past photos. I will not use this app again till it's more user friendly. -Sincerely , an angry 20 year old. Stop trying so hard"
4419,Dremama248,"December 28, 2016",1,"Update ruins product for me I've used timehop for quite some time and I've always enjoyed it. Checking it in the mornings and enjoying the memories. I have never reviewed an app but this update has urged me to do so in hopes that it will be reversed. I really dislike the fact that the pictures appear to be zoomed in quite a bit and I miss being able to ""scroll down memory lane."" If things do not change back in the near future I sadly admit that I will discontinue use of this app."
4420,Britt leighh,"November 11, 2015",5,"Nostalgic My friend kept sending me links to her time hop and after some months of seeing them I decided to download it. I wasn't let down, this app is awesome, it shows me some pictures I forgot even existed. It brought back a lot of memories that made me smile."
4421,ThatPersonBree999,"December 18, 2015",5,"If you like to reflect and be nostalgic; This app is perfect for you. It's set up simply and easily accessible for anyone to use! I recommended to my friends and family, which all who downloaded it, also enjoy it. Great job to all who helped create Timehop."
4422,Venti soy latte,"January 3, 2016",2,"Bring back the old version I've never felt compelled to write a review for an app until now. Loved Timehop until the creepy feature appeared that shows when people who are tagged in a photo has viewed that photo and vice versa. Horrible. It's awkward and completely unnecessary. At the very least, have an option to turn that feature off! There's tons of social media apps.. Timehop definitely doesn't need to be one."
4423,Locklearmaggie,"January 18, 2016",5,Always there when I need it This app brings back all our good memories. If I ever feel down I know I can click on the app and find something from our past to make me smile. Funny how a little thing like an app can make a person smile.
4424,PammieJo35,"April 27, 2016",5,"Usually I love this app, but.... I rated it 5 stars cause I do love this app, but today I can't stand it. It opens, but keeps loading and loading. I see everyone else has an update for it yesterday, but I never had one. I have the iPhone 6. Please figure out what's going on!!!"
4425,PreciousKisses,"April 30, 2016",3,"Can't save my own photos üòï I love TimeHop because I have so many photos that it will ""remind me"" of some of the photos I have taken on a day in the past. I would resave those photos because I have no clue where I saved the original. But this update took that away! üòñ I do like the RetroVideo add. I wish it wouldn't auto-start."
4426,Sisilencio,"May 13, 2016",5,Thank you for stopping RetroVid I love the TimeHop app. Thank you for stopping the music on RetroVid. I don't mind there being a video as long as I control if there's music or not. I love being able to look at my previous posts and share them with my friends and family.
4427,Ani3308,"November 6, 2016",4,Snapchat memories Great app really gives a laugh to see old photos and what year you have them. I just wish there was a setting so you can link with snapchat memories because I use them a lot and it would be nice just to see those also pop up as the years go by.
4428,Limeinthecocnut,"December 23, 2016",1,"TimeFLOP First off, I just wrote a huge review and they deleted it. I guess timehop doesn't want this negative review. "
4429,Dparkford,"December 24, 2016",5,"Horrible update Timehop is awesome, I have been using it for quite some time. But the new update is absolutely horrible. You have to zoom to see every picture, can't scroll anymore, it's like a mix between Snapchat story and some kind of collage. BRING BACK THE OLD TIMEHOP!"
4430,Bratz711,"April 8, 2015",4,Request Love this app... But with the update it does not show what was typed with the picture when put on fb.  Also wish we could group more pictures together instead of having to post them one at a time.  Other wise it's the first thing I check in the morning !!!!  Awesome.
4431,Sick dog 901,"May 3, 2015",5,"Best part of the morning I can't believe every morning when I get to see what our life was like 1year, 3 years or even 6 years ago!

4432,ballerinagirl92,"May 21, 2015",5,"Dino-isms I never ever write reviews for any app. However, I felt the need to make it known that I've been on Timehop for over a year now and one of my favorite things to do every day is read the little snippet at the end from the dinosaur. Please don't take that feature away!"
4433,ladytig247,"May 24, 2015",5,LOVE I am in Love with this app! No one has time to reminisce through all their old pictures and posts every day... Thanks to Time Hop we don't have to! It's like a wonderful surprise...every time you open the app there is an blast from the past waiting for you!
4434,gleefan2001,"May 25, 2015",1,Struggling to understand how to use it I have seen many of my friends who use it and it works just fine for them. but when i try to use it the program for the Timehop does not show any of my reccdant photo uploads that i just added to the timehop photo sync. the only things that i see when i create an account with Timehop through facebook are the ones that the app company puts in there and i would like to see more of the photos that i have uploaded instead.
4435,Loolooloolooloolooloolooloo,"June 1, 2015",4,"It's really entertaining but... It would be great if you could add multiple Facebook accounts. I have an old Facebook that would actually have a lot of things to pull up that I don't use anymore, and I have a newer Facebook that isn't quite old enough. Other than that, I like this app!"
4436,Sekmommy,"July 1, 2015",5,"Love this... I'm really enjoying this app! I love looking back at my old posts by day. The only thing I don't like is that I can't look at other days. If I miss one, I can't go back to see it. Or if I want to see something again, you can't. You can only see that day's TimeHop."
4437,Fun fun game game,"July 5, 2015",4,Missing Then and Now I would rate this 5 stars if you bring back the Then and Now frame. It was my favorite. Also maybe not so many teenager sayings and not have the added parts cover the pics. Love the app and use it daily. Miss what you took away. Bring it back please and I would make it 5 stars.
4438,Dkurutz,"August 2, 2015",5,Always makes me nostalgic I'm not sure why I waited so long to download this app but I'm so glad I did. I love taking a walk down memory lane when I wake up in the mornings. I love seeing my kids childhood relived through past photos and being reminded of our fondest memories. :)
4439,kfike73,"August 2, 2015",4,"Good, but stop alerting me! It's always fun to see what was going on years past. The problem! It alerts me (with the little '1') three or four times a day.

I really look forward to taking my little trip back in time each day :)  I just wish there was a way to view the original comments from the posts and to manually choose what date to timehop back to.  that would earn the app that 5th star in my book ;)
4443,Yo momma kool,"January 24, 2015",5,"Makes my day, everyday. Such a genius idea. Not only does it give me something to look forward to, it is something my 3 year old does too.

4444,ShannCass23,"January 27, 2015",5,A sentimentalists dream app Sometimes it can have glitches but the newest update new format makes it even easier to share past photos/statuses/ etc! I love seeing my social media past and so easy to send to friends for a trip down memory lane!
4445,Cxshe,"January 30, 2015",3,"Hate this update I love this app. It was perfectly fine before the update, however. I hate the new layout. The ""year ago"" bar is in a super inconvenient place, usually over someone's head and you can't move it. It was so much easier to share them before the update happened too. Plus it doesn't even show the caption anymore. Kinda sucking Timehop :("
4446,Stev87e,"February 10, 2015",5,It's great This app is a great way to look at the past stuff that I have posted over the years it's great to think about the stuff you've done. I've seen soo many posts that I have forgotten over the years and it's a great way to look and catch up on
4447,Shartstorm,"February 20, 2015",5,Wonderfully simple Well thought-out app that does exactly what it's supposed to do: offers a snapshot of a point in time. The fact that you can't scroll between dates makes it all the more special; every day is its own unique surprise.
4448,kulliecakes,"March 3, 2015",4,"Fantastic app I have the iPhone app installed on both my iPad and iPhone. I start my day with this app because it brings a smile to my face.

4449,Nottohot,"March 12, 2015",5,"Love it. There is nothing better than opening this app and seeing what I posted years ago, or watching videos of my children when they were just babies. I definitely look forward to my Timehop daily :)"
4450,Evan Aravich,"October 17, 2013",2,"Twitter will not link to app This app is a great idea, however my twitter account fails to connect to the app. Sometimes it will connect, I will leave settings and go to my feed and nothing from twitter will be there.

Other than that no complaints, what a great idea."
4453,Misslyz,"June 11, 2014",2,"I like it when it works I love the concept of this app but it's a little ridiculous that it just stopped working for me. There were two days where I could get any pictures, only statuses from the past. Then I tried to log in this morning and I'm getting a concept mapping error and it won't even let me sign in. Fix the bugs! I've deleted the app for the time being until bugs are fixed."
4454,Nw59559,"July 3, 2014",5,"Wonderful app I love seeing what I did a few years ago. Brings back good memories that I had forgotten, I only wish it went further back in history and that I could see the comments attached to the status and pictures"

Ha I'm glad I've grown up a lot more and it dose bring back some pretty cool memories! Works great if you have an iPhone so you can screenshot the part you want and not have it link it to your fb or Twitter!
4457,Lp4ever!!!,"November 8, 2014",5,"Great This is a sweet app. The only thing I would suggest is that the app should show how many likes you got and the comments too! Sometimes I'm like ""wow that old status was actually kinda funny, I wonder if anyone else thought so"" "

4461,Hilbrick,"January 3, 2017",1,"Worst update of all time I hate it. Why, Timehop, Why? I hate everything about this version. It's terrible. It's missing so much. The ""full screen"" pictures are just zoomed in to where you can't see what you're even looking at until you zoom out. What is the point in that? And you can't save videos anymore, which I hate. I loved sending old videos to my friends and family. Now they're useless. Please change it back! Nobody is happy with this update."
4462,CalooCalay,"January 4, 2017",1,App so bad now I stopped creating memories I used to wake up and immediately check my Timehop and I would luxuriate in the simple layout that showed me my whole posts with the comments. The past was alive again and I could simply scroll through time without thinking. Did I have to touch it to zoom out? No. Did I have to swipe left or right like it was some dating app? No. I just scrolled through it. Smiling. SMILING!!
4463,Jessicaannie,"January 7, 2017",1,"Didn't fix the biggest problem I always LOVED scrolling up and down through the years so I could choose the ones I was most excited to remember and click on THAT bunch of pictures to really look at. But I cannot feel like I'm being held hostage by EVERY SINGLE PICTURE from every year of my life in order to get to the next single picture. I don't have time for all this, and it's not fun. You're going to have to fix THAT problem before you lose everyone."

Idk what they were thinking on this. This is not an improvement its more aggravating than anything and most days now i don't even look at it because of it and thats just sad. Please stop the pictures from mashing together like a movie and make them easier to share again please fix this b4 u lose to many ppl. Thanks, JT"
4465,Cpwilson85,"January 9, 2017",1,Terrible update I use to love looking at Timehop now I hate it since the new update. I hate how the pictures are zoomed in. And I can't read any of the comments or even the text that was put with the picture when it was posted. Today there was a picture of cookies I posted 4 years but I have no idea why I posted it because it is only a picture and not the actually caption I put with it. Not user friendly at all. Please bring back the old format.
4466,Tricia 14912,"January 25, 2017",1,Not a fan of the update at all!!! Boo Update: I used to love this app. Then they took away my desktop. Ok- I lived. But now I can't see (literally) the pictures without pinching them down. Makes showing them to friends hard!! I hate the scrolling!!! I loved it when they were all in a straight line. 
4467,Dope Mia,"February 1, 2017",5,If the layout doesn't change I'll be deleting the app I really do not like this recent update I barely use the app now from before where I used it every single day. If it doesn't change I'll be deleting the app
4468,torn_into_one,"April 13, 2017",1,"Used to be great I used to love this app. It was very user-friendly, but now it's a hassle to look at likes and comments. Half the time the likes and comments won't show. Also, there have been several times that it says I've broken my streak when I check it every morning without fail. It seems every 3-4 days it says I've broken my streak even if I really haven't. Stop worrying so much about the fancy looks of the app and fix your obvious problems first."
4469,Jasrasr,"June 6, 2017",3,Daily user for a long time You can't win with the swipe vs click UI. People will complain either way. I do like the albums back. Less clicks for a group of photos. And I take lots of photos! 
4470,TetrisFun23,"December 29, 2016",1,"Very Disappointed I never leave reviews on any app, but feel this one is warranted. I've used this app since it started and am tempted to free up some space on my phone now. I just looked at one of my pictures that had my daughter in it, only you couldn't see my daughter unless you held the screen. I really enjoyed the easy format it was in before. It is like they want you to spend more time in the app so they made it a nuisance. Really hope they Change it soon."
4471,orangejamie13,"December 29, 2016",1,Not a good update I understand that things need to update but I was NOT happy with this update because the app was changed completely. Too similar to Snapchat and I do not like the zoom feature. Also I'm really not happy that comments are not there that was the best part of the memories. Please change the app back to the way it was before because this was NOT a good update and I don't know how much longer I will be using it because of the update. Thank you.
4472,Cspir200,"December 29, 2016",1,"Terrible Update Looking at the others review about this new version, I guess it just wasn't me. Bring back the older version! Missing a lot of useful features. I thought with the old version you can share videos but with this one the ""swipe"" to share doesn't show up. Hopefully with all the feedback, you would revamp before we all bail and rely on FB On this day, which is not as good as the previous version of Timehop or find another app out there."
4473,Fra812,"December 29, 2016",1,"New Update I never write reviews however with this recent update I had no choice. It's confusing and the fact that you have to zoom out on photos is awful. I liked how it used to be and it's getting to a point where I don't even want to check my Timehop anymore because of the recent layout that came with the update. I suggest reverting back to how it was, way more convenient. The swiping I don't mind but the fact that it's so zoomed in makes no sense."
4474,AlexRaeKiernan,"December 31, 2016",1,"The new update is not user friendly This is the first time I've ever written a review for the app but I have to say I am beyond disappointed with the new update. It takes way too long to scroll through the years, doesn't let me swipe down to send pictures and zooms in so close I can hardly see the picture. I am hoping you will go back to the older version or come up with a better idea. If not I will just use Facebook memories going forward."
4475,AMcKWolf,"January 1, 2017",1,"A failed update The new UI that came in this update is worthless. It not only can't frame whole pictures, but it usually can't even fit whole posts. Scrolling through a list was much better, and I hope the developers realize that they made a mistake with this update. Usually I'm all about UI updates, but they have to make the experience better and easier, and this didn't do either. In fact it's a step backwards entirely."
4476,Dani iStuff,"January 1, 2017",4,"Why the update? I have loved having the memory lane of Timehop, but now it's just frustrating! I can't see comments, half the pictures don't show up. It has completely lost its value in my opinion. This was an unneeded change and the format is not good. Change it back or I'm out."
4477,Carolinacupcakes,"January 2, 2017",2,Old is better than new I absolutely hate the update of this app! I used to check it everyday and thoroughly enjoyed sharing old pics with friends and family but the new update is so frustrating that it makes me want to delete the app. You can't see some of the pictures no matter how hard you try. Please go back to the old version of this app! I didn't need an update!
4478,DKFinnegan,"January 3, 2017",1,"Terrible update With the new update it's pretty much useless. Can't view an entire picture without holding down on it. Even doing that sometimes just makes you go to the next picture. I can't look at comments left ok old Facebook posts. Something I had really enjoyed before. It's not a good layout at all. I'm holding out for a fix. I'm all for updates and making things better, but this is impossible to enjoy as it is right now."
4479,Qstorm916,"January 3, 2017",1,"My streak will end I understood when the sponsors start coming across the feed. I get it, the app generates revenue. No biggie. But to go ahead and change the whole structure and it's functions?!? It's ridiculous. I see myself as competitive and I don't like to lose. But I'm willing to stop my continued streak of logging in on this app daily. It's painful to use now. I've been checking the updates the past few days just to see if you guys have switched it back. But no luck. Farewell Timehop."
4480,Suzy87,"December 24, 2016",1,Don't update. This is terrible. I never write reviews. Everything is blown up. The scrolling was way better so I could click things I wanted to see again not have to swipe and see every single thing. Some pictures were in a very fast collage which I could see the pictures I actually wanted to seem. Don't update if you want to save yourself trouble. You can't even see the comments people left on the picture or video you took. Awful.
4481,susan hippo,"December 25, 2016",1,"New update is NOT user friendly Timehop is my favorite daily app that I've been using for several years now. The new update is not user friendly, does not show captions for instagram or FB posts, and takes WAY too long to scroll through! I check the app every morning when I wake up, but now it's just not as fun. I can't easily share a lot of items and don't enjoy having to tao back through every single item. Bring back the list style!!!!"
4482,candicejune,"December 25, 2016",1,Frustrating- this update is terrible This went from being my favorite app to my least favorite. The photos being zoomed in is terrible. Also for some reason it shows a bunch of photos in a row (almost like stop-motion) but doesn't let me save them. Where did the captions & comments go? I just really hate this. The ONLY reason I'm not deleting the app is because I'm hopeful they will either revert to the past version or quickly push a fix.
4483,Princesskrit,"December 27, 2016",1,"Horrible update I'm with all the others here. The new update is horrible. I've had this app forever but if it stays like this I will be deleting it. Super unfriendly for the user. You have to swipe up to see the entire posts, you can't see the comments for your posts anymore and it doesn't tell you what day of the week it was posted etc. Worst update ever. Not sure whose idea this was but maybe y'all should have tested it out. Absolutely terrible. You ruined a decent app."
4484,QueenBea_,"December 27, 2016",1,"The update is garbage Enjoyed timehop almost since it's conception in 2013 however I have stopped using it completely since the update came out. I don't like that it scrolls through like a snapchat story. I also hate the fact that pictures are automatically zoomed in. The update also cuts off words and phrases in the bottom part of the text. I deleted timehop this morning because until the update is fixed, the service is rendered useless to me."
4485,Soccer Superstar 11,"December 27, 2016",1,"HATE THE UPDATE Timehop has been one of my favorite apps for years, but I HATE this new update. You can't see any of the captions on the pictures, taking away half the fun of the app. If I just wanted to look back at old pictures I could scroll through my camera roll. I loved seeing the stupid captions my old self had put, and all the conversations in the comments of the pictures. If this update doesn't get changed in the next version, I'm not keeping this app."
4486,QueenV85,"December 27, 2016",2,"Go back to the old view with scrolling ability I'm with everyone else. I almost never write reviews but this latest update is horrible. I don't necessarily want to open every single picture, I want to see how many ""likes"" and comments I had, look through quickly. I don't wanna to have to tap every time to go to the next item. Please.... Go back to scrolling through the memories."
4487,Kshdine,"December 28, 2016",1,"Goodbye Timehop, nice knowing ya. Ditto to the person that said ""if I could give this a 0 rating I would."" So many things I could say about the update but by far the worst thing is not being able to see the caption that goes with the extremely zoomed in pictures. Seriously what's the point in that? I miss being able to scroll through and I hate that I can't see the likes and comments. I used to love Timehop but I can honestly say I hate it now. I want the old timehop back! Please!"
4488,Yoioo,"December 29, 2016",1,"Horrible update I loved Timehop and enjoyed going everyday to see what it had to show. I updated the app not realizing what it would turn into and I regret it. It is very difficult to see things and it was better off the way it was before. I get they tried to do what Snapchat did with the tap forward and tap back, but it doesn't work for this particular app. I hope it gets changed it back to the old way because at this rate, I'll be deleting the app."
4489,rileyMUC,"December 29, 2016",1,"So so bad Pleeeeeease listen to these reviews & go back to the old version. This update is not something people can just ""get used to"". With no comments or captions to read, you've taken away 50% of the reason people love this app! And when there's a whole album of pics from the day, you choose 3 random ones that we can zoom in on, and where are the rest? Bad bad bad. Please listen to the people you're making this app for & change it back!!"
4490,BOSSladyCECE,"March 22, 2016",4,"Good, but could be better I love time hop but there should be an option to go back to yesterday's posts. I forgot to share something I missed and it doesn't allow you to back track a day or two! Will definitely give 5 stars once this option is created!!"
4491,Shancat209,"April 29, 2016",2,"New features are terrible I've had Timehop on my phone forever and a usually mindlessly check it in line, at work, etc. now it has these loud obnoxious sound features that you can't turn off or disallow that blare from your phone if you scroll over them. Cannot tell you the various embarrassments. What's the point of having this app if I'm afraid to open it? Please fix this or I'll probably delete."
4492,Loves Abe,"June 24, 2016",4,"Don't like update I love this app. I used to be able to click on the comments and likes of my pictures and just read them on the app. Now, it takes me to safari and wants me to sign into Facebook to be able to see the comments and likes. Please switch it back!!"
4493,Shantastic84,"July 23, 2016",5,"What if I told you That you don't have to write a bad review to report a bug. As with all new technologies, glitches happen. Click ""app support"" and then write them to inform them of the issue. It's an overall awesome app! I love it. I'm sure they're working on a fix. üíó"
4494,No more skips,"August 14, 2016",4,"Love it but want the videos back I love this app, but I wish a few things could come back "
4495,sj1776,"August 14, 2016",2,"Disappointed I don't know if the updates of downgraded the performance of TimeHop, but it is certainly gotten more buggy. Even some of the former posts, when I attempt to share, either do not include the picture in the post, or it cuts off some of the text. Many times it will not allow me to even repost a reference back to the original post. This app needs some serious attention"
4496,MAPowpix,"December 22, 2016",5,"Getting worse not better Hate that only first line shows now. Some can expand, some won't. Really annoying to see half a thought. And please fix the number not fitting in the circle issue."
4497,Astine23,"December 23, 2016",3,New update I really loved Timehop until the new update. I'm really tired of other apps trying to be like snapchat. I liked being able to see what I actually said when sharing photos or posts and see what others said when posting on my wall. Please please please release an update that allows us to choose between old and new.
4498,14Wiley14,"December 23, 2016",2,The Update The concept of the update isn't bad but it's awful. I did prefer having it all on a list but if it has to be in a flip-book format they did a terrible job. You can't click and view comments or captions anymore. I had a photo post from twitter show up and it wouldn't show me the words of the tweet! You also can't view comments and likes. A change is needed immediately.
4499,Shelly128569,"December 24, 2016",5,"New update it horrible This new update it horrible. The new way to view everything is the worst way I have ever seen. They need to go back to how it was before this update. The pics are cropped so bad, the videos are not viewable and sharing is a nightmare."
4500,Lexycamp,"September 11, 2015",4,It's a great app. It's would be better if...... I love this app cause it brings back great memories. The ONLY thing I would want added is that when videos and pix show up I wanna be able to save them. So I can have them on my phone. That would make it 10 times better. But other than that it's an awesome app
4501,Mvlarson,"September 28, 2015",5,"Rating I really do love time hop. It brings back good, bad, and funny memories. I love how I can do a before and after. And I love how at the end of the feed it has someone about history on there. That teaches me things about history I never knew or forgot about. I like this app :-)"
4502,Itsmenicolerl,"September 30, 2015",3,"Please fix issues Tire pop used to be good until a couple months ago when I switched and told me to reconnect service in settings. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the corresponding apps as well. I have tried everything I possibly could to fix it but I still get the exact same feedback, please fix these issues!"
4503,arialgirl,"November 11, 2015",5,"Makes my heart happy!üíóüíóüíó I love seeing old memories! Seeing old pictures of the kids, friends and family puts a smile on my face every day!  I never have problems with the app, I can share on Facebook with no issues at all!"
4504,PeopleMoveNickname,"November 16, 2015",3,"Love it BUT Almost 90% of my pictures don't show up and I receive a notice saying ""picture did not reach 88mph"" which means no pictures appear!  I've tried the suggestions but nothing works. And here I am almost a 2 month later and still the same problem AND the cropping is driving me crazy! I'm probably gonna quit using itüò∞"
4505,Michele Sparks,"November 28, 2015",5,"Mrs I love this app. Definitely love getting to see what happened years before on exactly the same date. However, I do think we should be able to go back or forward on days for our own convenience."
4506,PC08,"December 1, 2015",4,Great way to reflect Love looking back on times and especially the photos shared. Would love a feature to go back to a specific day other than the current day. So sad when I forget to check it and miss the photos of that day. Makes me wish I would have started FB earlier!
4507,Kbintexas,"December 5, 2015",5,"Love it It's great to see the posts from past. I love seeing what was going on with family and friends. Great app, no big issues. Every once in awhile it won't load but I think that is a problem on my end, not theirs.  Love the updates."
4508,TropperJohny86,"December 20, 2015",5,"Sentimental staple I love timehop! I start almost everyday looking at pictures from years before. I get to see my niece and nephew grow up and remember good times I may have forgotten about. Sure, sometimes a not-so-pleasant memory hops up, but I learn from those times too. I love this app!"
4509,Soul_O_Nice,"March 19, 2016",5,I like seeing what I posted a year ago! I like the TimeHop app and the ability to re-post pictures or stories.  I like the features of doing 'then' and 'now' pictures and the special features for holidays!
4510,Erisad,"May 8, 2015",3,"I love this app but... It never loads my photos or videos anymore. I just get a feed of blank pictures with the caption, ""this photo was deleted. Looks like someone is trying to get a job in politics."" I get all my statuses ok but I know most of those pictures should still be on Facebook so what gives? I still love looking at this app for a wave of nostalgia to start my day though. :-)"
4511,staysoclose,"May 19, 2015",5,I look forward to my Timehop alert everyday! I love this app!! It's fun to travel through time on a daily basis rather than just when the mood strikes us! My family and I are often shocked at how long/how soon ago a past thing has been. üòä
4512,Fufunumber1,"June 14, 2015",5,"Joy This a great app, I highly suggest it to anyone considering on downloading. There our simply great features in here, one being seeing exactly what I posted on the date how many years ago. It's always a nice surprise and a good remembrance of how everything changes."
4513,Sport73,"June 25, 2015",5,"A fun surprise every morning Nostalgia is a common emotion, and nothing feeds it better than Timehop.  Seeing where you were and what you were doing years ago offers the opportunity to reflect a bit every day on what's changed, and what matters.  Great app!"
4514,ava_abedi,"June 29, 2015",3,"Go to post! The app is great! I love being able to look back on things from the past, but I do wish that there was a way we could go to every post. Maybe add a link or something of the post. Because there are many things I wish to delete but I can't because I don't want to go through the trouble of finding the post."
4515,Tamdug,"July 17, 2015",2,Great until recent update I would have given this app 5 stars but the recent update it ridiculous. I have to select to share then select facebook then click to post. 
4516,Mfmarlowefamily,"July 25, 2015",4,Great little throwback I look forward to opening timehop every so often to see what I did in the last years. I have little kids and it's interesting to see how they are growing and changing. Sometimes it doesn't update when pictures have been deleted though.
4517,1739fairhill,"August 4, 2015",4,"Love it, but... I really enjoy the concept of this app, but find it frustrating when it says things like my pictures didn't make it to 88mph or some such  malarkey and to try again.  I'm guesstimating 2/3's of the time my pictures fail to load.  That said, when it works, it is wonderful!"
4518,Candyonchrome,"August 19, 2015",3,"Started off great... The app was great for about a month and now recently it's been saying that my ""photos could not reach 88 mph"" which basically means they can't find it or they can't display it but all of my photos on Facebook and Instagram are still there. This is really just pushing me to use ""Facebook moments"" instead of timehop so I'll probably delete the app soon."
4519,TimeHop is my Coffee,"August 24, 2015",4,"One suggestion I love being able to go back and look at ""This Day in History"". The only thing I would request would be to have the ability to not only look at the day it is but be able to scroll through a calendar and pick a day!"
4520,Breeeee83,"February 10, 2015",4,"Love the app! Love the app! Just have problems with sharing to facebook. Others who have the same updated version that I do, have the option to share with the caption on facebook. I do not have the option for some reason. Love looking at old posts though. Puts a smile on my face most days. üòä"
4521,MS SouthernBell,"February 16, 2015",5,"Time hop is a great hop in time! It is a wonderful app.  I love the memories and re sharing them.  I especially love when new friends see them and experience them for the first time.  I have found it helps with grief... Looking back reflecting the sadness, the joy, mostly the joy, the good, the love."
4522,PrincessPeach üë∏,"February 23, 2015",2,"Could be a lot better. Although I do like the app itself, I do not like how it will not let me log into my Instagram account, always tells me my passwords are wrong when in fact they aren't, and also gives me a lot of trouble with Twitter also.  I believe the intent of this app was good, but it does need improvements. Until then, I only find it right to give it 2 stars.  Hope to see this issue resolved!!"
4523,Kiera60,"March 2, 2015",5,"Genius Idea for an App! I kept seeing the timehop posts on facebook, tried it out myself, and am completely smitten!

4524,Katieee612,"March 14, 2015",2,"Latest update?! ""fixes bug"" isn't true. I can't even open my TimeHop anymore because it crashes. A year ago yesterday, March 13th, was an important day and I couldn't even check my TimeHop to see what I posted and tweeted??? I've been missing looking at my posts for about 3 days now. When you update it I hope you give us a chance to look at the previous day's because the UPDATE prevented us from seeing them."
4525,FlacaJay,"March 15, 2015",5,Great I really like this app... Some of the pictures I've taken I completely forgotten about... Great way to see what pictures you've taken and see how time has changed... I would recommend this app to anyone who will listen lol.. Have a great day everyone üòä
4526,Leslie8_13,"April 27, 2015",4,Love It!!! This app makes my day on a daily basis! See things I've forgotten about or pictures from my iCloud that were never posted puts a smile on my face :) My only complaint is sometimes it shows you that you have pictures available but they won't load. Other than that it's PERFECT!!!
4527,Guacamolepauley,"May 1, 2015",4,Great but wish it had more options I love seeing the daily pics from the past! I love how it even shows posts that I wrote and even videos!

4530,LK824,"July 16, 2014",5,Memory lane at your fingertips Love it! Took me a while to jump on the bandwagon but I'm glad I did. I like how it pulls photos that are no longer on your phone but in your stream from years past. Makes you smile looking back in an instant every day!
4531,Bling City,"August 22, 2014",5,"Adorable! Fun! I really enjoy this app. The only thing I would like is a little more ease saving the photo again. Also, it would be awesome to link to the original post and be able to see it's comments! Otherwise, so much fun! Love the eastereggs at the bottom!"
4532,MrNickSr,"September 1, 2014",5,"Memories Absolutely love this app.  It gathers pictures from my iPhone, iPhoto on my computer as well as Facebook to give me an awesome pictorial history.

4533,Polhinds,"October 2, 2014",3,"App crashes Prior to the update, I was getting push notifications every 4 hours to remind me to look at my time hop even though I had selected to not receive them.

Its a must download app."
4535,Marynj307,"October 13, 2014",3,Timehop It's a pretty fun app to reflect on things that you shared on social networking sites in the past. I wish you could see the day before and the day after as well as the day of. I also wish it uploaded at midnight. I've tried changing the time setting on it but it always seems to show the current day after about five in the morning.
4536,OMG its carli!,"November 14, 2014",4,"Love it but not perfect! For awhile it would continuously remind me to look at my timehop even when I already had, but it seems to not do that anymore. Also I don't think it shows every single Facebook status I did because I know I posted a lot more than it shows back in the day"
4537,Momma clone,"January 17, 2015",5,"Awesome, enticing, relevant A highly recommended app that any user can love and use with ease. As simple as learning to walk.

4538,Zyppoe,"January 22, 2015",5,Nostalgic fun It's like having a time-traveling news feed! My new friends don't always get to see some of the older posts because they don't take the time to look. TimeHop is an easy and fun way to share the highlights from the past :)

4540,Caroline - CT,"November 16, 2012",5,"One of my top 3 apps! I have been using TimeHop for a while now- first via email and now the app. Not only do I love seeing memories from a year ago, but the quirky messages that TimeHop adds onto each update really make this unique. Keep up the good work, TimeHop!!! I'll be a loyal fan for life."
4541,Clevelandette,"March 24, 2013",4,"A small window into last year! I absolutely dig this app; my sole ""complaint"" is that while it shows the streams from years ago, it only shows that day's streams for today only; tomorrow, it will all be gone, replaced by a new day's streams. But hey - time travel in any form is WICKED cool, especially when you have been an active Facebooker like me!"
4542,gjcope,"April 4, 2013",5,"A stroll down memory lane This app is fabulous. Every morning I get a notification that my TimeHop report is ready. I open it up and am reminded of things we did last year, the year before, and so on. "

4546,Kisluvkis,"July 3, 2014",5,Throwback Everyday! I look forward to my throwback treasures every morning. And my friends laugh at them all to when I share them to them! 
4547,Thomas508,"June 16, 2017",1,"Same ole crap *Update 3 months later and I still hate it! To think this was once my favorite app! Congratulations on ruining a great app, trying to be like Snapchat!* I haven't opened this app in a couple weeks but saw there was an updated and was hopeful. No luck, it's the same old crap. I have no use for this app anymore but continue to look for a return to the old Timehop. In the meantime, I will not use this app and only check it for improvements after updates."
4548,Lexxasaurus33,"June 26, 2017",3,"Has definitely downgraded I used to be able to save my photos WITHOUT the dumb ""# years ago"" header on them. And I can't save videos anymore due to a faulty system that doesn't work properly.. ever. I lost my old phone a couple years ago linked to my Timehop and look at videos of my son from it but can't save them? It's realllly frustrating."
4549,Mamalissa1984,"August 22, 2017",5,I'm no longer impressed with Time Hop Since the new changes I'm not getting near as many items on my time hope hop. Like getting half of anything I've put on and the other half is advertisements!!! Disappointed!!!  ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
4550,NaROC,"January 18, 2017",1,"Terrible Update!!! App is USELESS at this point. The ""Update"" and redesign of a functional and enjoyable app has rendered one of my used to be favorite apps USELESS. I don't even know where to start. The odd interface, the inability to read comments under old FB or IG post, the non existent flow of new format. And after reading the vast amount of reviews it appears NO ONE likes the new format and the company has not listened. Timehop will soon stop wasting space on my phone if they can't listen to their supporters."
4551,vampwolf333,"January 23, 2017",5,"Bring back scrolling Love this app. However, I am disappointed by the new update. I like being able to see everything together by scrolling. Would prefer that to be brought back--thanks!!"
4552,Littlred03,"January 25, 2017",1,Never left a review before I've never left a review for an app before but I HAD to!  I hate the new Timehop update!  I can't see any descriptions or status updates that went along with the photos/videos.  The photos are all blown up to fit my phone height even though most were originally square photos on Instagram.  I used to be able to see comments left by people on the original posts and now I can't.  It's not even worth looking at anymore!
4553,ditsyandi,"January 29, 2017",2,"She's All That So today I noticed that you added something about She's All That. One of my favorite 90s teen comedies. It was Abe supposedly dressed up and Rachel Lee Cook's character from the movie... but he is holding a math book, like he is a book nerd. Janie wasn't a book nerd. She even mentions how she can't help Zack get good grades because she's not smart like that. She was an art freak.... So y'all should probably at least watch movies if you're gonna add them at the end."
4554,T90girl,"March 2, 2017",5,Enjoyable I just love this app because I have small grandchildren and I love to see pictures of them through the years and how they have grown. I also like to remember the fun times we have had with family and friends.
4555,Ekored,"March 9, 2017",5,"No longer able to share on FB Whenever I push the share button up to post on FB, and then hit post--- NOTHING HAPPENS, so the only way I am able to post is to save the pic and post from my saved photos. Disappointed"
4556,Missajoy90,"April 9, 2017",1,"This app gets worse with every update I hated the new format of time hop and they've made other changes since that have made it worse. The app is FILLED with ads now and on top of it the ""number of timehops in a row"" now ""freezes"" and to break it from the ice you have to watch a video ad. So stupid. I think I will probably be deleting this app soon as it is no longer as user friendly as it previously was and is spammed with too many ads."
4557,Arwen Mosher,"April 20, 2017",1,"New version is terrible I liked this app a lot in its previous iteration, but since they changed it to a Snapchat-style format where you have to scroll through a new screen for every single tweet or picture (and I sometimes have dozens per year) it is very tedious. Furthermore, the app is much slower and occasionally (about once a week) just refuses to load at all. I loved the old, simple version of Timehop, but I've very close to just quitting this one all together."
4558,HonestAbe1111993003,"May 5, 2017",1,"Don't waste your time..ADs> Users üòíüëé I used to check Timehop literally everyday, but now I am deleting the app completely. "
4559,Quitdeletingmyreview,"May 28, 2017",1,Stop the Madness! I have LOVED timehop ever since I got it!  The new update is so bad. It's hard for me to see all my photos and it doesn't have the comments or likes.  I hate it all.
4560,Latelya,"January 1, 2017",1,"The new update is the WORST Never have I ever written a review for an app... but this new update has my blood boiling. There was NO need to change the app. The layout is awful. Why is every picture automatically zoomed in? That's pointless. And on top of it, they no longer show the captions for the pictures which is basically the whole point. I use Timehop to check out the things I used to say and post and now it's not even worth it. PLEASE go back to the old layout"
4561,Yzarc1616,"January 2, 2017",1,I wish I could timehop back to an older version I wish I had read the reviews before I updated my app. I would not have done it. I don't like the way the pictures are displayed and you can't see any comments that were posted when you originally posted your stuff. Sometimes that was the best part of the memories!! I can go back through my camera and look at my pictures on my own and get the same effect as I get from timehop now.
4562,ashdcarp,"January 4, 2017",1,"New design made me abandon app In addition to all the negative feedback about pictures being artificially zoomed in, there are other basic bugs/design flaws with the new layout. Previous posts are cut off if they are longer than a few lines. The ""swipe up to share"" feature is too easy to trigger, I did it accidentally numerous times trying to make my way through the feed. Too annoying to stick with this app any further."
4563,greg_soccer,"January 6, 2017",1,"Bring back the old format!!! This new Fullscreen format was a great concept, but horrendously and poorly executed. Why do pictures have to automatically zoom in to the max it can go? It's awful bc most of my picture are zoomed in to much and I have to hold down my finger just to see the entire thing. Also pictures that I have tweeted/Instagrammed or retweeted do not show the caption attached to the picture. This update needs to be fixed asap before I delete the app!"
4564,KyPackerFan,"January 7, 2017",5,"Improvement! Thank you for listening to the feedback and making changes. This update is vastly better than the previous one. Timehop  is back to one of my ""must check"" daily apps."
4565,O.3eed,"January 7, 2017",1,"Still terrible Wish I could give you 0 stars. I never write reviews for anything, but this is the worst update I've ever seen any app go through. In my 7 years of owning iPhones and downloading and updating apps I have never had an app become this much worse AFTER an update. I still don't understand why you're pushing for this new update so hard. Everyone obviously hates it so just revert to the old one and we promise we'll all act like nothing ever happened."
4566,Wheredidmystreakgo,"January 7, 2017",1,"Used to love it I used to love this app. I was on a 235 days streak, I checked it everyday religiously, checked it yesterday and all of a sudden today I'm reset to 1. Don't know why. The ""update"" or so they call it makes it impossible to share your timehops because it posts things weird and it's soooo hard to go through when you look at it. I also used to love the retro video they had on here. Then they stopped that too. Old Timehop I'd give. A 4 or 5, new time hop I'd give a 0 if I could."
4567,Kvrana,"January 11, 2017",1,"A wonderful app ruined! What the heck timehop! What did y'all go and do? Did this process not get thought through before releasing? I hate the update. I can no longer see my memories as I could before. Three pictures pop up and you cannot even skim through them all. I literally looked forward to getting up every morning and seeing all the memories that came up on my screen. Now, It's confusing and irritating. Fix asap or I will be deleting!"
4568,Memmilee,"January 14, 2017",1,Awful update- still awful. The new layout is awful. I like to look at my memories in a feed format. Now I'm forced to see every photo I took that day. I tried to see if there was a settings option but I can't find it.  
4569,Caaaaarleeeee,"January 17, 2017",1,"new update awful this new format is terrible, having to click thru every post when you're a frequent poster takes far too much time, and is inconvenient when tweets are connected and you want to screenshot them all. also I have no idea how to find settings and do not want my full name on every old post I choose to share and have no idea how to remove it. I used to love this app but now I can't use it. if I could give zero stars I would."
4570,8131990,"December 25, 2016",1,"Wish I could give the new update zero stars Used to love the app, looked forward to opening it up each morning."
4571,Megflanny,"December 26, 2016",3,"I used to love it I used to love Timehop, I've had it for years. Unfortunately, I can't stand the new update. They set up your memories like a Snapchat story that you have to tap through. The older version I could scroll through what I wanted, choosing to look at picture or not, now it seems much more in your face. It makes me not want to open it."
4572,TimehopDaniel,"December 28, 2016",1,New Update is Terrible The new update has removed some of the best features if the app which is so confusing. Why have comments and likes been removed? It's half the reason I enjoy taking a trip down memory lane. 
4573,VL in KS,"December 28, 2016",1,"Update needs bugs fixed My first review in the App Store...Timehop was never quick to load and had quite a few bugs before with saving and sharing, but the update made it worse. Difficult to scan through all the years (almost a minute to load sometimes), and saving and sharing causes app to crash. I had a 120 day streak going, but the five days since the update have made me want to quit for sure. Please fix these bugs!"
4574,Cheryl 89,"December 28, 2016",1,"I HATE the new update Oh please go back to the old format! All I see are pictures/posts and how long ago it was. I can't view the caption or the comments anymore, and the pictures are automatically zoomed in. I don't get why that needed to be changed when there was nothing wrong with it! I'm glad Facebook does something similar to Timehop because that is now my source of memories until this Snapchat crap gets fixed. If it's not fixed, I'm deleting the app."
4575,HMAKieserman,"December 29, 2016",5,Not a fan of the update I really enjoyed Timehop before the update but the new format is so disappointing. I can't read the captions or comments and the pictures are zoomed in and cut off. I hope you decide to change it back.
4576,Dani12349876545678,"December 29, 2016",1,"Terrible Update You used to be able to read all the comments on your posts. Now you can't. Also why am I having to zoom out to see the picture?! That makes absolutely no sense. It's just all around terrible. It makes me not even want to open it because there's no point to look at anything. You can see comments, likes, etc. to look back on. This definitely needs to be fixed and go back to the way it was."
4577,Dudewizard6458,"December 29, 2016",1,"Yikes I really don't understand what problem you were trying to fix with this update. If after reading all of these reviews, you do anything but just revert the app back to the way it was, you are clearly not seeing the point here. The new update was bold, but it failed big time. I've yet to find someone who likes a SINGLE component of the new update. Don't try to salvage it. Go back to the way it was or I can promise you you will lose users left and right"
4578,SmiJoe,"December 30, 2016",1,New Update This new update is really bad as everyone says... the swipe method is annoying. The old scrolling down the timeline method was easy and shows each image clearly without having to zoom out to see the whole picture. Also for each picture it would show a status and now it's just a picture with nothing to go off of... I can't remember what some of the picture were about... please change it back Timehop... :(
4579,maysunbee,"December 31, 2016",1,GO BACK time hop was great and i loved using it and ever since the new update i don't want to use it anymore because it's too hard to navigate and it was 100 times better as the only one where you could scroll up and down instead of swiping through pages. i don't like that i'm swiping through pictures that i have no clue what they are because there's no info with them. please go back to the way it was before you updated it
4580,Evswing,"August 14, 2016",5,"My favorite! I believe this is the best app ever made! It reminds you every day to check your memories and shows your posts and pics from years past. Now that I've been of FB for 10 years, I get to see moments I had forgotten about."
4581,Liv4Dance,"August 16, 2016",5,"Super Amazingüòòüòú All my friends had this app and I just had to buy it. For them it was just a short time and some deleted the app but some, like me still have it. I will never delete this app. It tells me cool facts everyday if I don't have enough timehops too."
4582,Topper Pot,"August 23, 2016",5,"Memories!!! I like this app. At first it wouldn't stay open. The app has since been fixed. I wish you could go back and look at yesterday's (or past days) events instead of just today's. Overall, I like this app!"
4583,Caw_gofast,"September 12, 2016",5,"Thank You Timehop! Since Facebook has decided to be selective and not allow everyone to have access to the Share a Memory feature, Timehop has filled that gap! Besides that, I really love opening the app and seeing some great blasts from the past!"
4584,WifeyEcho180,"October 19, 2016",2,No Mewtwo after 150 streak...... I keep sending emails referring to the Mewtwo updated which you guys offered and I haven't received anything yet. Plus you guys don't even explain how to get it. I keep checking the FAQ and still nothing about what I am asking for. You shouldn't offer something if you guys can't back it up. Very upsetting. I sent about 5 emails and still nothing. Please keep your word about what ever you offer.
4585,Spaz0311,"December 21, 2016",5,"Not that great anymore. I liked timehop when I first downloaded it, now you can't read any comments and I know I'm missing photos from it. Seems like it will randomly select photos instead. I'm not impressed with it anymore."
4586,mwgbu19,"December 22, 2016",1,"New update too confusing The new update today makes the app way too confusing and hard to use. Don't waste your time getting this app because you'll spend more time trying to figure out how to use it than you will actually using it. People always seem to fix things that aren't broken, so they need to change it back to how it was before the most recent update. It's like it's trying to be a confused version of Snapchat."
4587,iMom0930,"December 24, 2016",1,Make it stop!!! I absolutely hate the new update! Please take it back! I miss being able to see old comments and likes and it makes it difficult to just quickly scroll past stuff you don't care to see. I also hate that it keeps pulling up photos in my camera roll from last year. I finally figured out how to get to Settings to turn that off but they are still displaying. Please take us back to the old version!
4588,erose021,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update is terrible I've never written an app review but I used to love checking out my timehop every day but this new update is really bad. You can't see your photos without having to zoom out on each one. You no longer can read friends comments on your posts, so what is the point? If I want to see old photos I can scroll through my camera roll faster than navigating this new layout. It's really bad. Please bring the old version back."
4589,Aspen Hunter Davis,"December 25, 2016",1,"New Update Is Horrible! This app used to be one of my favorites. I loved being able to look back on all my pictures, videos, comments, etc. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the original format. If timehop doesn't change back to the original format I will most likely stop using the app. It's very confusing and not user friendly. All of my favorite features are now missing. Why fix something that's not broken? Super irritating..."
4590,#Embarrassed,"November 8, 2015",3,"Delete button! The app is alright, doesn't crash on me usually but it takes too long to transit from one day to the next. Doesn't update until mid morning. Also, this makes me want to delete my past posts! Definitely should make it so you can erase posts from the app instead of manually finding it yourself."
4591,hollywoodrache,"November 21, 2015",1,"Major Problems I used to love Timehop. I liked being able to see all my social media memories in one place. Since the new update, the app will only show my Instagram posts. I have other memories because Facebook tells me themselves. It keeps disconnecting my Facebook on its own. This app has become a nuisance. Hopefully they fix it because it seems like everyone is having this problem. Not a good reputation for the developers if it continues to operate this poorly."
4592,Noahbee01,"November 26, 2015",5,Love this app! I think it's a really fun and creative idea. I love going back and seeing my old pictures and posts. You can really see how much you've changed over the years with this app and it does it in an easily accessible way!
4593,Nik lass,"December 7, 2015",5,Great app It's kinda fun and worth the invasion of privacy. It's not like someone can't get the pics on my phone anyway. I think it's neat because I wouldn't look back at all my photos in one day but this spans it out and brings back memories at a decent rate in time.
4594,FrankieG410,"December 24, 2015",5,"I enjoy this app I really enjoy TimeHop. In fact, every morning I wake up to check it. It's a great app and an iPhone essential. I would only recommend more interaction with Abe. It seems that Abe is very limited to what he states at the very bottom of the day being shown."
4595,Vray1205,"February 7, 2016",5,"Won't connect to Facebook Time hop worked just fine on my old iPhone, but I just a new one and it won't let me connect to Facebook at all...and seeing that's where all my stuff is there's no point in even having time hop."
4596,Ga_girl07,"May 4, 2016",1,"What were you thinking? This app was just fine up until the update. I've had to repeatedly delete and reinstall because Timehop keeps telling me I don't have anything to repost. I got Timehop to share MY past, not miscellaneous crap in history and definitely not random videos that are not mine and that I don't care about. So today when I again opened the app and Timehop had nothing for me except a video clip that is not mine, I deleted the app. For good. Get it together, guys."
4597,TracefaceMcGee,"July 7, 2016",2,"Disappointing Support I really had fun seeing the time hops - but when you can't get a response to support multiple days in a row and the app isn't functioning- leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth & wondering why bother.  Might change snider giving it another shot at a later date, but can't say I'm overly inclined to reinstall down the road if they won't even acknowledge when I submit an issue - twice!!"
4598,PrincessKeyaa,"July 9, 2016",4,"GREAT but... I love this app it's great (I'm reaching for an 100 day streak).However I find it upsetting that you can save pictures from your past,but not videos. Videos have meanings too the past only lasts one day in timehop so please for future references allow us to save out videos,then you will definitely get 5 stars :) xx"
4599,Vaniana,"July 24, 2016",4,WAS perfect Everything was absolutely perfect until I saw a new update & decided to do it. Regret now. Now app immediately crashes after it opens title screen for a half sec. Was going on 25 days... almost a month of nothing now... Thanks. Nothing was wrong & nothing needed fixing until now.
4600,michstalum,"May 4, 2015",5,My favorite App I check my TimeHop almost first thing every morning.  Forgotten memories remembered again with just one picture.  Would highly recommend.  I also really like the then/now feature when sharing.
4601,Puggie2013,"June 10, 2015",5,Memory I love the idea of looking back at post pictures an who like and who didn't like what I posted. If I can't find a post that I really liked for instant a recipe that I didn't write down all I have to do is wait and it show on here when I posted.
4602,Xav6455,"July 9, 2015",3,"Blurry, and Facebook always on Timehop photos are often blurry, and never load to a full resolution photo. I deleted my account and started fresh, but it still happens almost every day."
4603,Cottoncandy6,"July 20, 2015",3,"Ah I like this app , but one thing I don't like about is that we can only see one picture a day . Tbh I think that's pretty boring and it's not fun . I was anxious to see what pics would pop up & have a laugh but I could only see one. I was disappointed to be honest. You should improve that by seeing 3 pictures maybe . Please . It would make the app more enjoyable."
4604,Cutet11334,"August 6, 2015",5,"Great reminder of this day in the past I enjoy seeing what has happened over the last 6+ years. It's especially nice to see the kids grow, vacation memories, and family that is  no longer living."
4605,TiffaniUntitled06,"September 24, 2015",4,"Crashes a lot This is a great app but a lot of the times, it doesn't load up the pictures. Also it would be even better if you have access to a couple of days behind. "
4606,Larrythemagnificent,"September 24, 2015",3,"Good, but... It's great sometimes. Like when I first downloaded it months ago, but now with the new update my pictures don't load, says some be deleted them from my Facebook, but when I get on my Facebook they are there under my memories. And on some days the whole entire app doesn't even want to work! Won't log in, or let me do anything."
4607,LindzLou82,"September 27, 2015",2,"Needs A LOT fixed! Love this app. It's awesome to see what you said in the past. However for the past 2 weeks it says I have had no posts. The first couple days I thought that could be true but when it came to the day my brother got married I knew I had posted several times that day and yet it says there were no posts. Now, 2 weeks later, it says no posts every day. Very frustrating."
4608,Jaylynn Reid,"October 5, 2015",5,"Fun! Love being able to see all these things from the past! There are occasional times when it won't load the app, but they always fix it quickly! I recommend it!"
4609,hydratedheaux,"October 25, 2015",2,Amazing app except for one thing I love the idea and seeing things that you've posted and tweeted from past years is hilarious and awesome. Unfortunately I have not been able to see the things that I've tweeted for the past couple of days. I had uploaded the most recent archive so all of my tweets should definitely be in there but they are not. Please fix this because it's my tweets I want to see the most.
4610,MrsIxnay,"October 31, 2014",2,"Fun...when it works It's a fun app but it works how it should maybe 20% of the time. I'll get the notification that my TimeHop is ready but when I open the app, I always have to log in again and sometimes that fails. When I can log in, I get the ""time travel failed"" message no matter how many times I retry. I don't want to delete the app but it's starting to be not worth the space it takes up on my phone."
4611,Anna09475,"November 23, 2014",5,"Makes My Day! If you've had Facebook forever like me (since my freshman year of HS in'05), then this app will probably make your day too! It's so nice to be reminded of all the fun I've had growing up. Over time this app has encouraged me to capture more moments and reconnect with old friends."
4612,Kfurst,"December 2, 2014",1,"Doesn't work well, but great idea Soooo buggy!"
4613,Mera4397,"December 5, 2014",3,"Neat idea but doesn't work correctly It's a near idea but often I have trouble posting. It says it posts but doesn't. Then I try again and hours later it posts multiple times. Also, it won't post to Instagram and Facebook in the same upload. I love how it finds pictures from years back but the posting is annoying."
4614,BaBeezandMe,"January 22, 2015",2,"This WAS a great app I used to look forward to taking a look back and posting my memories on Facebook but since you updated the app...not so much anymore!!  Too many steps to post on Facebook and when you attempt to post pics with captains it posts just the pic!  That's an important part of the memories!!  I want the old version back!!  If it isn't broken then don't fix it!?!?!?  Sincerely, Disappointed in Timehop in Philly!!"
4615,5nickle5,"January 23, 2015",4,Almost perfect I love Timehop!  It's fun and brings things you'd forgotten back to you. I only wish you could see more than just what's available today. Sometimes I'll miss a day or want to go back to a good one but are unable to. Still love it though. Great idea. My hubby had been saying this should exist for years!  :)
4616,smcneely21,"February 8, 2015",4,"Fun app. I love this app, there are so many things that pop up that I've forgotten about over the years. The only thing I that I think would make it better would be if they could get into your old myspace account, so that way you could have even more memories to reminisce about."
4617,Mars14901,"February 23, 2015",4,Love and hate I love the app it's wonderful to see posts from past years and to see how much my life has changed BUT I am an early bird I get up at 4:00 am to get around. They do not update until later in the day so I can't see it until later in the day. My opinion update it sooner in the morning
4618,Avrilbrady,"February 26, 2015",5,Love it!! I absolutely love being able to view things that happened on today's date on previous years! Brings up some pretty cool things! 
4619,JordPhillipine,"March 4, 2015",5,"Great app!!!! Who doesn't love reminiscing? Also, Abe is so cute!!! I really love how great this app communicates with its users. If there's ever anything wrong with the app or if it's not working for some reason, they're always tweeting keeping you updated. And can we just talk about how great the app was on Valentine's Day?!?"
4620,connor___,"September 18, 2013",3,"Not terrible I like the idea, but I don't like how they obviously put a liberal spin on pretty much everything they can on this app. Their ""this day in history"" section hardly ever is about something actually interesting/cool that happened in history, it's just a republican bash party.   I would like to see this change because no one is using this app for political reasons."
4621,Kelly4569,"October 4, 2013",5,Nice app! Pretty cool app!  It goes back 7 years for me but I only wished I could see what others said/commented on my post from back then. Other than that its a awesome app if you love seeing what you were doing on a certain date so many years ago!
4622,MichaelMiori,"July 19, 2014",5,"2 üëçüëç Way Up! When my friend showed me this app about a year ago, I instantly loved the idea. It's always fun everyday when I remember to look to see what all ""happened"" on that day via my social networks/iPhone pics. Great app and I have recommended it to friends."
4623,Aheeah,"August 2, 2014",5,Love it!!! I absolutely love this app! Especially because i have a macbook and it accesses all the pictures i have on iphoto. It's awesome to see pictures from like 8 years ago! I also love seeing the facebook posts i wrote years ago - some are so girly and immature! Lol. Totally recommend it!
4624,JWaut831,"September 7, 2014",3,"Love it but..,, I love this app! I have two daughters and I post a lot of pictures of them. It's nice to see how times have changed, how big they've grown, and how fast time flies! But the last few days my picture won't load. Just my statuses. I tap to retry it but it keeps telling me there is an error. I'm a little upset about that. I hope I'm not the only having this issue."
4625,d0pedupd0lly,"September 15, 2014",5,"Wobbly wobbly timey wimey... stuff Love this app. It's super clean and simple, it's pretty hilarious seeing myself up to five years ago. I just wish I could pick what date I see in case I miss days :/ however, I'm thinking the creator(s) of the app are doctor who fans. Today's message said now ties are cool :) So rad!"
4626,StudentsForDrive,"October 7, 2014",5,"Blown Time hop has really stepped up their game with the ability to take a ""Now"" photo to compare with a photo from the past! The simplicity of the app makes it one of my favorites. I know they'll continue doing cool things to enhance the memory experience."
4627,Star5810,"October 22, 2014",3,"Nice app but needs improvement It's nice to be able to look back at old pics but I wish there were more pictures to chose from. Some days you get one picture or one status and if you don't like it than you just have to wait til tomorrow. It gets boring. Some days the app will fail to work at all, that can be frustrating."
4628,teresa4dalejr,"October 29, 2014",5,"LOVE THIS APP I love this app and being able to go back through the years and see the different posts on FB and Twitter and I just LOVE seeing the pics of my kids, grandkids as well as family members that we have lost. It brings back so many special memories."
4629,Stils,"August 2, 2017",2,"Disappointing decline in quality Timehop went from one of my favorite apps to the app I loathe. Their new UI updates are terrible, the amount of ads plaguing the app are getting ridiculous and it won't even let me connect some of my accounts. Timehop needs to make a significant redirection if they want to remain a successful app. Also, making me watch a video to keep my streak? Dumbest thing I've ever seen. Bye timehop."
4630,Rottsy,"January 7, 2017",5,Finally fixed it. A previous update had ruined this app. It looks like the developers listened to our feedback though. Much improved. Easy to use. Always a good laugh looking back at the fun times had.
4631,MsGlmRpuss,"January 7, 2017",5,Excellent Fantastic job listening to your audience and fixing the issues of the last update. This new version is the perfect amalgam of the old version and the newest version. Thank you for fixing one of my favorite apps.
4632,Jmo36251,"January 8, 2017",3,Horrible I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone working at Timehop would think this new update was a good idea. It is so incredibly frustrating to use. If they don't fix it then I'm deleting the app for good.
4633,JMaguire1991,"January 13, 2017",1,"Bring back the old Timehop and maybe I'll reinstall This new version is stupid and unmanageable. Even with the update, it's hard to use, you can't view comments or likes, the pictures are all zoomed in (yes, I have auto-zoom turned off) and you can't zoom out without opening the original app. On This Day in the Facebook app is way more useful than this piece of crap that they call Timehop. Why do people insist on fixing things that aren't broken?!"
4634,Anon1139631,"January 16, 2017",1,"Horrible update!!! I never write reviews but this update has me so annoyed. The new layout is incredibly frustrating. I have zoom turned off so I don't understand why I still can't read entire tweets unless I click on each one individually, and I hate having to swipe through one at a time. I just want the big long image back that I can easily scroll up and down and quickly find something. PLEASE let us go back to the old one!!!"
4635,X0xoellyxoX0,"January 17, 2017",1,Loved the app until the update I used to love logging in and scrolling through timehop quickly and being able to focus on specific sections. It was so organized and it was one of my favorite apps to check. Now I have to scroll through one by one and it makes the app really annoying. At least give users the option to go back to the previous format or something! This was one of my favorite apps and now I'm really upset.
4636,Yeah not so happy,"January 17, 2017",5,Give us back our old stuff I want my then and now back! I want to be able to share my videos again... and what happened to the amazing retro video!!! I hate these updates !! Give me back the good stuff !!!
4637,Beezer122,"January 29, 2017",1,"Bad move, change it back! I've given the new app changes a try for some time, as accepting change can take a while. I find myself not even wanting to look at timehop now because of the ads between and the new scroll (left and right) method is much less user friendly/desirable than scrolling up and down through the old photos. "
4638,Amieshep,"May 4, 2017",2,"No longer a decent app I used to like this app- being able to quickly see my posts from the past all in one place. But in the past few days, it has been pointless. I open the app, see only one ad and none of my past posts, and that's it. "
4639,Minako53378,"June 15, 2017",3,Fun to see old memories I enjoy the reminder of old memories and what was I thinking back then hitting me as I see old posts and pictures. It would be nice to see the comments for pictures and posts along with the item. The ads don't bother me as it's easy to click past them and Timehop does need to make money to stay open.
4640,Irene Almighty,"January 2, 2017",1,"‚Ä¢ TERRIBLE UPDATE! ‚Ä¢ If I could, I would give this app ZERO STARS. The new update was completely unnecessary. First off, there is no need to have the photos zoomed in... Secondly, I hate that I can't see any LIKES or COMMENTS. The only reason I downloaded this app was to be able to look back at my memories. This new update has somewhat robbed me of that opportunity with not being able to look back at comments from friends on memorable photos and posts. THIS UPDATE WAS NOT NECESSARY. Please, TimeHop staff, fix this issue."
4641,klbg2010,"January 3, 2017",2,"Better before I've always loved this app until the most recent update. It was much cleaner to scroll through years instead of having each ""memory"" be one full page. Plus, it was great to be able to read comments and interactions between friends on old photos and statuses, which is completely lost now. This ""update"" really missed the mark."
4642,Cheer-io,"January 3, 2017",2,Was great until the update I love to see my memories but with the new update I am not enjoying it anymore. The pictures are zoomed in way too much and I can't see the comments any more. I like how they keep track of how many days in a row you check. I'm at 233 days but I'm not looking forward to it as much any more since the update. I'd give it a 5 star review if they were to fix these issues.
4643,Goofinlhb,"January 3, 2017",1,"Sad I do not like the new update! The number 1 reason is I can not see the comments on the post, those are what made some of the best memories! Tomorrow is my daughters birthday and I always look forward to reading Birthday wished that people post on her birthday picture especially from those I can no long share those birthdays with anymore! Breaks my heart! I am sure I can scroll back through somehow on Facebook. I loved Timehop but will now be looking for other apps to use!"
4644,justinwalz,"January 5, 2017",1,"This app just went from 5, to 1 stars. Not worth downloading or keeping anymore. You can't directly access your old tweets, captions on old photos don't show up and pictures are all zoomed in for no reason. Not only that, but instead of being able to plainly scroll and see your memories displayed in order, you now have to tap from one to the next. Big mistake by the developer. Bring back the old Timehop. If it's not broke, DON'T ""FIX"" it!"
4645,bbatterson,"January 5, 2017",1,"Use ""On This Day"" instead If I could give less than one star, I would. The new update is completely unsuable. All fo the photos you took on that day now show up as a sort of gif which you can save. If you posted an image on social media, sometimes the image shows up, and sometimes the caption shows up - never both at that same time. Most of my history doesn't even load and shows up as a gray screen. Don't bother with this app."
4646,Caseyb1233,"January 5, 2017",5,Please go back.. I used to religiously check this app daily. And now I can't even save or share videos.. I have to zoom out everything. And I can no longer see captions to pictures.. super disappointing update. üòï
4647,Sbrockgirl99,"January 6, 2017",1,Worst App Update Ever..! Timehop used to be an easy to use and enjoyable app... since the last update it's been horrendous. It never loads correctly and when it does it takes forever! I don't understand why in order to see full pictures you have to press and hold. That's dumb.. just show me my stuff in a timeline form. I don't need another app trying to be snapchat. Just please put it back to the way it used to be before I delete the app from my phone! Please!
4648,Lnzybt,"January 7, 2017",1,"I HATE the new update!! I hate the newest update on Timehop! I hate that every picture is zoomed in. Who came up with that genius idea?! If someone wants to zoom in, all they had to do was zoom it in themselves. I loved timehop before, except when swiping through the pictures you would accidentally swipe the wrong way & have to start all over. PLEASE fix it! Facebook has almost the same pictures, if hate to delete it, but it's really that annoying."
4649,almcatamney,"January 7, 2017",5,"Fixed the issues All of the issues everyone addressed have been fixed. The new update is nice, but I still like the classic scrolling the best. Thank you for the fix, and I will continue to use Timehop as normal again!"
4650,Jam889,"December 27, 2016",1,"One year ago today... Cheer up, maybe next year around this time Timehop will have post ""One year ago today Timehop ruined its platform and drove away its user base by releasing the worst app update in history"" and we can all look back and laugh. Or maybe I'll just delete the app this week because it's now useless. Put back the ability to see likes and comments, and why in the WORLD would you need a zoom feature the way you guys built it?!?!? Awful!"
4651,Vkitki,"December 27, 2016",1,"Hate the update I used to enjoy looking at my Timehop everyday, but now I can't stand it. It's just mimicking snapchat and the stories they post. The pictures are all zoomed in and some of my memories don't show the whole post. For example if I retweeted a photo with a funny caption, it'll only show the photo and not the caption. I don't like this at all. If anything, give users the option to switch back to the old layout or stick with the new layout if they so please."
4652,tiny-timebomb,"December 27, 2016",1,"Deleted I'm glad to see so many poor reviews about the latest update. This is another one. I can't see my comments anymore, the format is obnoxious. I've been using timehop every single day for years. I haven't been a fan of all the updates, but it was always more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing than the other apps/settings on other websites. Not anymore. I deleted it and opted to be notified to check my memories on Facebook. Huge bummer."
4653,bumblypink,"December 29, 2016",2,"Used to love it Timehop recently changed the way we can view past memories. I HATE IT!  Everything is blown up, blurry, and hard to enjoy... pictures get put in frames and are tiny and I can't make them larger. Simple is better. Stop trying to be fancy. I would have given the old version a 4 star, at least... now I'm only giving it 2, and even that is to high. I'm ready to delete it."
4654,Burnbby,"December 29, 2016",1,"Just, why? The new update is terrible. Why fix it if it isn't broken? I loved the app before, it was simple and easy and enjoyable to open every morning. Now it seems like a chore, but I still want to see my old photos. Not nearly as enjoyable as before, there are no captions and zooms in on photos automatically. You have to touch the screen to zoom out, and it's in slideshow format. What? I've never reviewed an app before but this update called for one. :/"
4655,Mad753256884,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worthless I'm actually laughing out loud while reading the current reviews because it's nice to know that others share in my misery. Along with the annoying things many people have pointed out, I can't even share the pictures I want to share! Why even show me something if I'm not going to have the option to share the update? I'm giving this crappy app like a week before I delete it forever. Maybe dinosaurs are meant to stay extinct..."
4656,UNC Blows,"December 30, 2016",2,"Used to love it....then they ""updated"" This app was great.  It was simple to use and gave me what I wanted to see...a glimpse into my past.  The new update is flat out terrible.  I don't understand who thought the zoom feature was a good idea but they should be fired.  I gave it 2 stars based on....5 star for previous version and a -3 star for current version.  Please don't make me rely on the Facebook app and fix this thing."
4657,Supreme Ruler SRQ,"December 31, 2016",2,Fix it! I love time hop I've been on it for over a year now and I check it on a daily basis in fact when I had 185 days in a row and I was sick and I miss them all I was pretty upset. Not as upset as the new format I find it very difficult to use and you girls/guys need to work on it I don't even know how to share a video anymore WTH. When you get back from your winter vacations you need to fix this nobody's happy with it.
4658,Loganite,"December 31, 2016",1,"Update made it worse The latest update is awful. It's almost pointless to open now because the captions, time stamp and likes/comments aren't shown. And photos are automatically zoomed in, making it annoying to have to zoom out to appreciate the image. Timehop should remember that it's showing the past, so it needs to balance contemporary features while accommodating past devices, styles and formats. Overall, this is a dinosaur-sized failure."
4659,asiipring,"January 1, 2017",1,Fix it quick!!! You have to go back to old format! I'm two days in and ready to delete the app! This use to be the first thing I opened up in the mornings and now two days in a row I've been extremely confused and irritated! 
4660,Rattlergrl,"October 10, 2016",5,"Why do you keep taking away Retro Video?!?!! I love this app! It's fun seeing old posts and pics. My only complaint is that I don't like when the ""Retro Video"" portion of the app is removed. To me, that's one of the best parts!!! Keep Retro Video permanent and I'll change my review to 5 stars!!!"
4661,Core514,"October 21, 2016",5,Great reminder of past life This app is a great way to remind myself of how much of a mess I was in past years. It is also a great convo starter with your friends and gives you a chance to reconnect with old friends. Some glitches but great app overall!
4662,Lisajvandy,"December 23, 2016",1,Don't change what's not broken This update is terrible. I very much enjoyed the last one. I like to see the post as it originally was posted with the comments and the number of likes. That's as much a part of the fun as seeing what you posted. I don't like the full screen pictures either. I often crop my pictures square to begin with I don't need to see them blown up. Please change it back. Don't change something that's not broken.
4663,MicheleAC,"December 24, 2016",1,"Please roll back the ""upgrade"" This new UI is just awful. I would say decent idea, poor execution - but the idea was half-baked at best. "
4664,Sad user 96,"December 24, 2016",1,"Worst thing they could of done Who was the genius that decided the app needed a redesign? Because I would love to look them in the eye as he tells me how it was such a wonderful thing and then punch him because it all BS! If I could go back a version I would this makes it feel to much like Snapchat stories, which doesn't work for an app to look at what I have posted in the past.  Good thing you can't leave. What I've reviews -10/10 don't recommended update"
4665,mf92p10,"December 24, 2016",1,"Awful update I used to use this app frequently- it was fun to see what you've done on the same date in the past. The new update is awful. If Timehop was up to date on web design they would know that scrolling is the way to go- so it's all on the same page. Just like how it was before! Any up to date website or app is set up this way. I will be using the facebook ""on this day"" feature instead until this app changes its design."
4666,Aaron Duren,"December 25, 2016",4,Needs a little sump'n sump'n The new format is okay. A lot of reviewers are right in saying it's kinda copying Snapchat stories. But it does have its own little flare. I'll give it a try. 
4667,Jernigal,"December 25, 2016",1,"Love Timehop, Horrible update! I love looking at timehop for the great memories but I want the old version back! I don't like that I can't get back and forth quickly from the beginning to the end. I don't like the zoomed in picture. I don't like that the page with 3 pictures on it won't let me see them individually big. I miss seeing the comments from Facebook. "
4668,CupcakeGirl105,"December 26, 2016",1,"So disappointing I have never written a review for anything before...until now. This new update is so awful. The layout is the reason why I deleted Snapchat and now I'm considering deleting Timehop. I have loved checking this everyday and have made it a part of my morning routine. But now it is so confusing and not as fun. Where are all the comments and likes? In my opinion, that was half the fun of checking old memories. Please please please fix this awful update!"
4669,CraftyJenguin,"December 26, 2016",1,"Not a fan of the update Well, I used to like scrolling down memory lane, but I am not a fan of this new update. I have to tap and hold to zoom OUT on a photo?? Why not make it fit the screen and let me zoom in if I want to? And why don't my Instagram photos have the associated captions? Let's be real, I do y remember what that was a picture of from 6 years ago. Also, what happened to the then/now feature? I'm struggling to find anything I like about this update."
4670,Poisonfish,"July 23, 2015",5,Great app I love being able to see what I posted in years past! It's truly wonderful. The only thing is like to change is to be able to see what other people posted on my wall on Facebook and the like.
4671,Sarahbickyo,"July 26, 2015",5,"Cute app to share memories with friends and family It's always nice to see your history from the years passed, even when it's embarrassing. I enjoy sharing these memories with the people I lived those moments with years ago. Thanks!"
4672,Mommy2369!,"August 16, 2015",1,"Unimpressed I still use it for Instagram but this new update absolutely stinks for FB. Even status updates are posted as pictures and the  frames block parts of pictures. If you share old pics you no longer see captions, if you post old status updates you might only see part of them and none of the comments. I used to like this app and probably would have given the old version 4 stars but I'm so disappointed."
4673,Pocket75,"August 18, 2015",5,"Fun Memories!! It is fun to look back and see what was happening 2, 3 or 5 years ago! I especially love days like the beginning of school to see my kids now vs what they looked like back then. "
4674,bossMarqus,"September 9, 2015",5,Worth the download.. I love this application. This app lets you view posts/pictures/whatever that you posted from years ago. Some posts I didn't even remember posting until TimeHop showed me. I would recommend this app.
4675,Abbayye,"September 16, 2015",2,"FIX THIS For the past few weeks all of the pictures that are on the app says that it can't download them or ""photo cannot reach 88 mph"" when I'm on perfect wifi.

4681,SarahR728,"May 19, 2015",5,So much fun!! My favorite part is being able to sync ALL the pics from my computer. Seeing Facebook or Instagram posts are cool but the ones on my computer are usually the funniest since they didn't make the cut to post publicly. Great memories!

4699,.:Maria:.,"May 3, 2015",5,"AWESOME!!!! Love this app. I love seeing what has happened through the years and remember what I was doing back one, two and even five years ago.  The ability to do different kinds of posts makes it even better. Thanks so much for this app!"
4700,Warm Blooded,"May 15, 2014",5,"A killer app I have been using this for a while and I still enjoy checking it. It's fun to see and remember the things you did, how you talked, what you looked like/dressed like. It's also very well designed. The copywriting and illustrations are unique and clever as well."
4701,Malfucusjay,"June 25, 2014",5,Next update?? I love this app! Love seeing all my old stuff from good days to bad day! But maybe for the next update you could add in a way to view the comments without having to go through the actual Facebook one post at a time lol
4702,Kimmie102485,"July 21, 2014",4,"Love it I absolutely love this app! It's exciting to wake up everyday and see what I was up to a year or 4 years ago, the only thing is I wish there was a way to see what people commented on in fb I always find myself wanting to see comments... If u could somehow add that feature this app would be perfect!!"
4703,GLed2,"July 30, 2014",1,"Facebook Login Timehop requires you to log into Facebook before you can access their app. I do not have a Facebook, but I communicate by other forms of social media. I am giving this one star, based merely on the fact that I cannot even log into this app. Please reconsider not confining it to Facebook alone, so others such as myself can use Timehop to laugh at memories from other social media sites. If you do not have a Facebook, do not bother getting this app until they fix this."
4704,Brewahh93,"August 12, 2014",5,Love it! It's so fun to see what I was doing or saying years ago! A great way to turn back time without having to search through your entire Facebook. Also a helpful reminder of where you've come since then. So clever! Love it! 5 stars!
4705,Southernlady87,"September 8, 2014",4,"I love it, but... So I would've given this 5 stars since I really do love this app. But the past week it is not loading properly and I cannot see any of the photos. Even after hitting retry and restarting the app and my phone. Kinda disappointed I loved seeing all the things I posted from years pasted."
4706,Cjoxo,"November 6, 2014",5,Love this app!! This is like one of my favorite apps. It's so cool to be able to see stuff that happened exactly a year ago or so that day. I look forward to it every morning when I wake up. It's the first app I check. Definitely recommend this app.
4707,Rfoster09,"January 1, 2015",4,"Totally worth downloading. I take so many pics that I barely ever have room for apps. Time Hop has never taken up much space, it's quick and easy to use. And it brings tears to my eyes to go back to yeeeears ago. I absolutely love this. It is the best idea ever, besides needing some obvious updates and features and fixes. Good luck:)"
4708,Peperpwni,"January 19, 2015",5,"Does just what you want it to I can't complain, this app has brought back a lot of memories by showing me my old Facebook posts. Sharing them when you want to is easy as well. I'd get it just for kicks if I were you."
4709,SusieRoflcopter,"January 21, 2015",2,This app WAS great... But now I will be uninstalling the app. It now requires you to have the Facebook app installed to share to Facebook (which I refuse to do). So I thought I would try the save image function instead. This just put the time hop stamp right over the face in the image I was attempting to share. If they fix either of these issues I may reinstall. But I see no reason when I can't share images properly.
4710,Demolitionluvr_123,"July 10, 2013",2,Great Idea for an App...BUT It doesn't work and it only shows the one day in history. There should be a feature that lets you look through every day of the year. For instance like not actually having to wait for your birthday to see photos and news about that special day in history. Going to keep the app and keep updating until it can function properly or get more creative.
4711,Hopper_4325273618183638910,"July 21, 2013",4,"Like it, but... I love this app! I like seeing all my old pictures, and posts, and I like how far back it goes. But I wish we were able to link to whatever post it was. Like jump from timehop to Facebook or twitter to see the comments people posted. Other than that, everything works good!"
4712,Danpppp,"August 20, 2013",5,Really awesome. Needs whatsapp. I love the Dropbox integration. I see photos from 7 years ago and it's a ton of fun. 
4713,NickHolden13,"August 29, 2013",4,Lame update Worst move ever with the new update. What used to my favorite thing to check each morning has become something I totally forget about now. My grown daughters and I loved looking at each others pics and reminiscing.  Bring back the original Time Hop please! You had a great thing going!
4714,LauraJill413,"November 12, 2013",3,"Log in The latest update automatically logged me out and now I can log in. ""An error occurred while.."" appears. I've tried deleting the app and redownloading it twice now."
4715,ajonesdesign,"April 19, 2014",5,Love App. Don't like app icon I love this app. I use it daily. And tell people all the time about it. But the newest update changed the icon on my home screen to the dinosaur and it makes my phone look childish. Which I'm not stoked about. Please pick a different look for it. Please.
4716,KissMe89,"May 14, 2014",5,"Walk down memory lane Really cool app. I like to see what I posted in the years before, especially the pictures."
4717,BethMas,"March 8, 2017",3,"What is with this new update??? I really like Timehop and have been using it for a couple years. Whatever they did with this new update, has completely ruined the app! It's freezes and basically doesn't work at all most of the time. Clearly not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things but definitely annoying."
4718,Kipo_13,"May 14, 2017",1,"It used to be good... ...but then they tried to ""improve"" the app by adding all kinds of stuff. Some pictures don't load, just the caption, pictures are blown up so you can't make them all out, you can't see who ""Liked"" your post anymore, they don't show all the posts, just the ones they think I'll enjoy. "
4719,nursecaroline,"July 23, 2017",4,"4 stars!! Even tho I liked the original better, and I think you're getting too fancy now (IMHO), I still enjoy the TimeHop app, and look forward to opening it every am to see my ""memories""!  I don't need all the fancy schmansy gimmicks you've added, but I'll deal with them, so I can keep the app."
4720,Elleirbag1221,"January 11, 2017",1,"Update is absolutely terrible Like everyone below me wrote, this new update is simply awful. For starters, why is every picture zoomed in?? And the fact that you need to scroll through every single picture instead of being able to scroll through days at a time is absolutely terrible. "
4721,Alannanoelle,"January 11, 2017",1,"I Hate the New Update!!! I used to adore Timehop. No more. Why are the images huge now? I'd like to be able to zoom in if I want to, but having to zoom out for every single image is incredibly annoying. And what happened to the Then/Now feature?! That was the best part!!! I did like the frames in the old version, though I would have liked to have a horizontal/vertical option rather than only square. Please put Timehop back the way it used to be!!!"
4722,BriBri-nana,"January 17, 2017",2,"Disappointed üòîüòî I like the old style better, I got to see everything that I posted not just what you guys think is the best out of that specific year. The only reason I have this app is for all the sites other than Facebook, but I seen 2 post from other sites vs all the others were Facebook. I'm very disappointed and I have been using Timehop for like the last 4 years or so."
4723,TravelingVeg,"January 25, 2017",1,"Come on, guys... It's almost like you guys are intentionally sabotaging the company. Down to one star, yet you're still not fixing the issues. You keep asking for feedback, yet we don't see positive changes. I've never written an app review, but I was so frustrated that I couldn't share a video, I came here to make sure I wasn't alone. Nope. Tons of disgruntled users. Why? I hope you'll truly listen and bring back the reasons we loved this app. Thank you for listening."
4724,Cmariet1988,"January 30, 2017",2,"New version The new version is so difficult. I can't figure out how to share old videos. When multiple pictures are in an album, only a few show. And once I click on one it scrolls to the next page. This new version is not any easier than before. I personally don't like it. Id rather scroll through my Facebook than use this app at this point."
4725,Jenkreaady,"January 30, 2017",1,"Please please please fix it! I'm not usually one to review but I have been trying to keep this but I can't. I'm fixing to delete time hop have my stuff doesn't show up, I hate scrolling sideways, and have the time my app just crashes. I don't know why this is still not fixed it I watch everyday for something!! This is ridiculous I miss the custom frames and the then and now for whichever photo I choose not just some random ones!! Time hop do something!!"
4726,AmyPinTX,"January 31, 2017",1,"Horrible Update I wish I could give it zero stars. I've been a Timehop user for several years and can't figure out who would think this new interface is a good idea. It takes forever to flip through every picture, videos don't load and the collages are pointless. It used to be so simple and fun to scroll through all the thumbnails and memories each day. Now it's just a chore. Please please please bring back the old interface."
4727,RSKnapp,"February 1, 2017",1,"Horrible, horrible update Just as everyone else is saying, the newest version of this application is atrocious. I never go out of my way to write reviews (in fact this is my first) and Timehop is so awful now that I cannot hold my tongue. The sharing hardly works on photos and the new scrolling through every photo is so far from ideal. This application is in some serious need of an update or a downgrade to older version when I actually enjoyed using it"
4728,Mary8819,"February 17, 2017",1,This update is terrible I hate that I can't scroll through my memories fast now I have to look at every single one. Also now I can only share limited memories. This is absolutely terrible. I'm going to stick with Facebook memories until this is fixed.
4729,Time-nope,"February 27, 2017",1,"Comments I really miss the old version. This new version is so sensitive, if I want to go back on a picture I end up going forward 20 more pictures before getting back to the one I wanted. Also, I hate that y'all took away where we could view the comments on our past posts and such I always enjoyed reading those and now I can't. The new version just isn't that great all around and I really don't like getting on timehop anymore."
4730,Barbs711,"December 29, 2016",1,"Horrible new update!!! I LOVED this app so much and shared memories from it regularly. It was great for business anniversaries and milestones. But this new update has made it one of my most hated apps. All the photos come up zoomed in to just a small portion of the photo, so I have to zoom out on EVERY PHOTO to see what it is. Things take forever to load. It is total crap now and I am devastated that I won't be able to use it anymore. It's just too awful. Please, please change it back!!!!!"
4731,windagel,"December 29, 2016",1,"I've never reviewed an app before but... The Timehop update had to have been mixed up with a version made in 2006. This is THE worst update I've ever seen. Timehop went from user-friendly and accessible to completely useless. The new interface makes pictures difficult to view, tweets hard to read, and picture saving hard to do. I have used Timehop for a long time and this is the first time I've ever considered quitting it. This update literally ruined the app."
4732,K789789789789,"December 31, 2016",1,Terrible update I used to enjoy this app. The new update completely ruins it. I can't easily scroll through all of my pictures and see them at the same time. On top of that it unnecessarily zooms in on each picture so you can't see the whole thing without going to extra effort. The new format makes no sense and needs changed back ASAP. This isn't snapchat so stop trying to use their concept. If it stays this way I will be deleting it.
4733,s. m. f. f.,"January 4, 2017",1,change it back timehop! first review i've ever done! and only cause NOW im reminded daily of how much i hate the new update! i liked it better when i had the option to go back to the original post as well as not only just see the pic or post on here. i want to go back to being able to read all the comments and captions for the pictures and posts! it was more than half of what i was looking forward to when i checked it! CHANGE IT BACK TIMEHOP!
4734,Lynnie870,"January 5, 2017",1,Please go back to previous version!!!! I never write reviews but the update is horrible! I can't see any previous comments (which are part of my memories not just the post itself). And the pictures are sometimes cut off. I use Timehop since Facebook memories isn't available to me but now it's not even worth opening this app. I check the App Store every day to see if there is an update to go back but every day I'm disappointed there isn't
4735,MrsHeidiC,"January 6, 2017",5,Don't like the new update Everything I loved about this app is gone.  Bring it back and I will change the review.    If you continue this format then it is time to delete this app.  I can get my memories another way.
4736,Billbob777333,"January 6, 2017",1,Don't fix what isn't broken! To sum up what everyone is saying: The app was great before this update and now I can read any of the captions I put with pictures and that was sometimes one of my favorite things to see! Now we are stuck with a Snapchat style feed that is really annoying to go through because I can no longer scroll quickly to the bottom if I missed something earlier or wanted to see it again!
4737,BBG-girl-NYC,"January 7, 2017",1,"Terrible update The new update makes it very difficult to read anything or see photos. I have used Timehop for a long time, but may not continue if it stays like this.  Please switch it back to the old view!"
4738,Suthurms,"January 8, 2017",5,"Hate the new revision I'm really having a hard time using the Timehop since the newest update. If I try to enlarge or share it, it just automatically goes to the next thing. I've always enjoyed timehop until now. Please fix!!"
4739,Angflick1,"January 8, 2017",1,"New version is AWFUL Why try to ""fix"" something that wasn't broken in the first place? So disappointed and frustrated by new version. I keep going in every day like I used to hoping that it's reverted back and it's still the same new terrible version. It doesn't display pictures that went with a post, the collage of pictures from that day on a particular year is very frustrating.  Please go back. I will delete it if I doesn't:("
4740,jfredettejr,"July 28, 2016",4,"Love the App, But The app itself is really nice and easy to use. I only wish that you could go back and fourth through the time hops. Some days I'm just too busy to take the time to post things and if you miss the day it is gone. Seems like a simple fix that would add so much more to the app."
4741,Flutternfly,"October 31, 2016",5,Love the Daily Reminders of Yesteryears I love to see things from prior years. It's especially fun because my photos have some of my sister's photos and she passed away 4.5 years ago. It's unexpected hugs from her in the past. Try to log in daily!
4742,j_698272628281,"December 22, 2016",4,"Like it, but needs one more thing I love timehop and this new update is really cool, definitely like it. But I would love it if you could see your captions on Instagram photos when swiping up. somewhere like under the photo when you swipe up to share it. that would be perfect! thanks"
4743,Krys23,"December 24, 2016",1,"New Update is TRASH Why oh why would you take away the best part of the app?!! Everyone LOVES the comments section!! It's the best part and is what truly makes timehop unique b/c it's like you really get to relive that moment, and y'all just up and took it away! BRING THE COMMENTS SECTION BACK PLEASE!! Also, the old version of scrolling down and seeing each post on the same page is way better and less intimidating then what y'all have now. Just go back to the way it was. Y'all messed it up."
4744,Timehopgirl,"December 26, 2016",1,Bad update There is absolutely NOT a thing I like about the new update. It's so hard to work. Pictures being auto zoomed? Having to click through things is just weird. It was way better when it was scroll so you could see everything and if you wanted to show someone you could easily get to it. I'm really hoping they change this update really soon. I'm on a huge streak that's the only reason why I don't quit checking it.
4745,AnthInChicago,"December 26, 2016",1,Sooooooo disappointing. I think Timehop is my favorite app. I look forward to checking it every morning. But this new update has completely ruined the app for me. My favorite part was seeing how I captioned photos and reading the comments that were left on my photos. That aspect is completely gone. Also the zoomed in default for all photos looks messy. 
4746,Gapeach30518,"December 27, 2016",1,New update is awful. I miss the old TimeHop where you scroll through your timeline. Issues with the new update are:
4747,Fbtoomuch,"December 27, 2016",1,"Horrible update I never write reviews but I had to let you know how awful your update is. I really dislike the whole format. And why did you take away the option to view comments from Facebook and Instragram posts?  I don't get the zoom out thing- why do that at all? And I can't figure out how to view pictures where many were posted on the same day. Before, you would list all of them, now there's only like 3? I don't get it."
4748,SGillett,"December 27, 2016",3,"Nope. Why fix what isn't broken? The update has made the app slow and not as easy to use. The previous version provided a fun and quick way to look at your memories, now each ""page"" takes for ever to load and you can't quickly scroll through. That's to bad, I really enjoyed using it before."
4749,WorshipView,"December 28, 2016",1,"Reverse the Update I understand that updates happen and there are always bug fixes that help apps run smoother, but this one was unnecessary. I always loved timehop and the convenience of being able to scroll through the app but having to click through it is bad. I have thought about getting rid of it multiple times since the update and relying on facebooks ""memories"" and calling it a day. Please reverse the update so I can like this app again."
4750,Jackamoemo,"September 7, 2015",5,"Very fun app. I look forward everyday to what Timehop has in store for me. It's easy to share your Timehop post on any social media platform or text message. I also enjoy the little historical tidbit that's included with each day. It's usually pretty obscure, which is fun."
4751,Lizzyvega808.,"September 12, 2015",2,"Used to love it until the latest update I don't understand how now some photos that are shown can only be shared on Facebook. If I originally posted that photo on Facebook, it only gives me the option to share it on Facebook. Sometimes I just want to share it on Instagram only or simply text it to someone else. Upgrades should make it better. Now I just feel restricted. Downgrade."
4752,Bellassa,"September 22, 2015",4,Fun but you should be able to link more I like timehop. I check almost daily. but I think it would be nice if you could link more than one Facebook. I have an old Facebook that has tons of old photos on it and I'd love to have those come up as well! 
4753,Mhenry08,"September 23, 2015",2,"Frequent error messages Well, it would have been a truly terrific app if it ever worked! I get push notifications that I have something to see (along with a preview) but then it will quickly disappear and i get an error message on the app. I have tried deleting and reinstalling, logging out and logging back in, and disconnecting then reconnecting the apps it features. Nothing! What a shame :("
4754,Kixetteroxit,"October 6, 2015",4,"Love timehop! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is that on my Facebook ""on this day"" I see the stuff other people posted on my timeline and timehop doesn't do that. And sometimes I see photos sometimes not. But I hope timehop incorporates that and no matter what I will keep using it because I really like timehop Abe."
4755,Ksimpact,"October 15, 2015",5,"Missed Memories My mom passed away and I miss her so much. She used to write on my fb wall everyday telling me good morning, she loves me, and have a nice day. It's meant so much to me to see those posts from 6...7... Years ago. I want to see these posts 30...50...years from now."
4756,Jess Rockz,"October 25, 2015",4,"Genius idea!!! Wonderful idea for people who love making memories!! I get a lot of memories that say ""oops photo has been deleted"". That's the most frustrating and just stupid!! It would get 5 stars if I could look and yesterday's TimeHop photos or even the previous few days/week. But I still love it!!!"
4757,ginadambro,"December 8, 2015",3,"won't load, keeps crashing I really love this app I love being able to see my old tweets but the last couple days it hasn't been loading for me at all. It'll be stuck on the loading page forever and then just crash. I've deleted and re downloaded it but it's still not working. fix it pls @ time hop"
4758,CrystalBlue1028,"May 3, 2016",1,"Why?? I rarely review apps, but this update is so bad I felt I had no choice. Timehop used to be one of the first apps I opened in the morning- now I'm afraid to because of the obnoxious RetroVideo that auto plays with no regard to my phone being silenced.  I'm not sure why I can't view all of the comments on my posts anymore- maybe to give me something to look forward to next year when it pops up again?  Fix this please- you had a great app until you ruined it."
4759,YOYO_Star,"May 31, 2016",5,Snapchat Stories I really love this app and I've never had anything go wrong with it! One thing that I would really love to see on timehop is your snapchat story from that day however many years ago it was! Snapchat Stories would be AMAZING!!
4760,I Óå≠ JUSTIN BIEBER!!!!,"May 10, 2015",5,Update idea! I love this app. I wish in the app though there was a space where you were able write what you did that day. A private space. I don't post a lot on social media but still love to see what I've done over the years.
4761,Melly! <3,"May 11, 2015",4,"very fun ! This app is awesome for anyone who has social media and who's interested in seeing what you did years ago. It brings back good memories !!! The only bad thing I have to say about this app is that every now and then, my pictures doesn't load? But other than that, it's fun and interesting !"
4762,michelfire237,"June 3, 2015",5,Love it! I really enjoy seeing what I've done the past several years on that specific date.... it's always fun to look back and see your kids when they were babies and how much they've grown! Great app easy to use!
4763,ditashay,"July 4, 2015",3,"not sure i do think its neat to see photos from the past-great concept....however, had seen my daughter post then/now comparisons but dont see that for me...and see other comments saying that was a recent change w/update"
4764,\Amber/,"July 13, 2015",4,"Time Capsule Time Hop is a fun app that allows people to look back at their events, pictures, and posts over the past years. Everyday I look at the app and get to see a little piece of my history! It goes back eight year for Facebook and I laugh at all the stuff my friends and I use to post!"
4765,Evility,"July 18, 2015",5,"Identify Cycles I have been using Timehop for years. It has helped me realize some amazing patterns. I'm nearly always sick around Labor Day. A few weeks ago, I had just finished eating fish sticks for dinner then checked my Timehop and exactly one year ago I had fish sticks for dinner! Sort of scary!"
4766,Nannysherry 51,"July 20, 2015",5,"Time hop I really enjoy this app. Having the ability to look back and see the things you posted and important dates and events is so enjoyable. To see your thoughts, pictures and mind set regarding certain events and situations are totally awesome."
4767,anicole0428,"August 9, 2015",3,Pretty Good App BUT I love that it allows me to look back on what I was doing and thinking on an exact day years ago I wish you could go back to a day after you miss it! Also my pictures that I REALLY want to see never load and that defeats the purpose of the app! Luckily Facebook also does the same thing so I can Atleast see the pictures on there!
4768,73106,"August 9, 2015",3,"Time Hop Logo too Big The Time Hop logo is too large, and this detracts from the post, particularly if the original post was serious -- about a tragedy or a notable death.  The boxing gloves are just dumb, and they are almost always inappropriate."
4769,Christie2201,"August 10, 2015",5,Fun idea for an app It's fun to look back at older memories from social media. It's easier than digging through tons of posts on a bunch of different apps to find a picture. With timehop it will eventually show up and remind you of a fun time.
4770,Not Mr. W,"February 10, 2015",5,"Memory lane I LOVE this app and literally tell everyone I know about it, and guess what? Once they try it, they love it too!

4771,nikhilbt,"February 14, 2015",5,"I <3 Timehop This app is simple, and that's what makes it awesome. You get to see what you did this day in history across social media. I have it connected to Instagram, Twitter, iPhoto, Dropbox Photos, Foursquare, as well as Facebook, and it works really well! Also, #valentimehop is the greatest."
4772,MallorieJ,"February 22, 2015",5,"So much fun! I love this app!  I love seeing how my posts have changed over the years.  Also, the app has helped me remember important dates that things happened, like when I bought my iPhone or when I visited someone, just random things."
4773,summertime62191,"February 27, 2015",5,My favorite app! I absolutely love this app! It's so fun to see my social media past. I have one very important request: please add Tumblr to the social media accounts we can link! I use Tumblr more than any other site and I would love to see my old posts! Thanks! :)
4774,Trenticus of Illini,"March 1, 2015",5,"Daily Dose of #tbt A lot of my friends have this app and I was wondering what it was all about. I love how far back it goes, sometimes stretching to 2010 on me. I love the little blurb from history at the end and that dinosaur is really cute. Overall, I give it two thumbs up!"
4775,Toohottoostop,"March 4, 2015",5,"Like this app Love seeing flashbacks of my personal pics and posts, but most of the other things they bring up I really dont need to see a second time, like the saying/quotes were funny the first time. But love this app for the most part."
4776,KimmieJones,"March 6, 2015",5,Love it What better way to see all of the important events in my life day by day within the past few years?!  I only wish I could see my pics the next day if I haven't had a chance to view it that day.
4777,Cappiello,"March 21, 2015",5,My favorite app! I love seeing all the pics I took years ago. It makes me want to take a picture every day so I have a reference for the next year. I check this app daily and I also use The Little Memory app to journal each day.
4778,Kenworthysammi,"March 31, 2015",5,Blast from the past!! Love this app! Love being able to look back on life and see what I was/had been doing! I recommend this app for everyone! It's great to just have random stuff u use to do or did back then. Very fun and interesting app!!
4779,Kevinamiller1,"April 26, 2015",5,"Great App I use it daily. Love bringing back the memories. However, you should be able to save the photos directly to your phone or be able to use the default share sheet. Would love to see that in a future update."
4780,Kat0082,"October 19, 2014",4,"Love Super cute, but it would be really cool if there was some way you could delete embarrassing tweets or pictures or whatever in the app or the app would take you to the tweet/picture and you could delete it. Looking back at what I posted as a thirteen year old is more mortifying than I can express."
4781,Mellie74,"October 28, 2014",4,"Love it! Love this app so much!! It's amazing to see waft occurred one, three or four years ago.. Absolutely love it! The only thing I would change is I would like to be able to see the comments from others on my flashback. See what others said at the time too. That would make this app perfect!"
4782,PuppySara,"November 9, 2014",2,"Still not working I love the app to look at old memories, but with the new update it will no longer let me open it on my phone."
4783,The last GDR,"November 24, 2014",5,Fun I really enjoyed being able to look back on the last few years worth of Facebook posts. I just wish that it was able to reach back further then four years‚Ä¶
4784,haley at clc,"December 3, 2014",4,"Love it! Time hop is one of my favorite apps. I love looking at old pictures of my kids and seeing where we were in life just a year ago (or 3 or 4, etc). The only thing I wish you could do is go back a day or two in case you missed a day and didn't get to see your time hop for that day."
4785,Anthony5279083,"December 3, 2014",1,"Abe Abe Abe... This app overall does not find moments from certain dates when you expect it to. Another topic to bring up, that Timehop Abe guy.. He said something around the lines of ""remember when your mom said you couldn't do anything?"" I don't remember my mom ever saying that to me so he directly attacked me. Then he has the nerve to say that he has ""had no friends since the ice age."" He can't just say this kind of stuff directly towards someone, especially when he's always in his underwear."
4786,Dec1anz,"December 11, 2014",4,Catch up! I've only had the app for less than a week but it stays a day behind. Or is that how it works? It's Thursday and it barely changed to Wednesday. Would be cool if it actually kept up to the actual day. I even changed my time zone to NY time when I live in CA but that didn't help. Otherwise it works.
4787,Rlslate,"January 21, 2015",3,"Love this app but... The latest update was not the greatest. It's more difficult to share pics now as it has to be done for each place you wish to share it. I also don't like that they no longer post to an album on facebook, just the timeline. I enjoy looking through the album to see previous posts!"
4788,OpheliasND,"January 27, 2015",2,"This app was 5 stars before the upgrade I wish I could roll back to the previous version of TimeHop.  Originally, I loved it - 5 stars.  It was easy to share and view.  I looked forward to looking at it every day.  Now it doesn't post my original comments automatically and only posts a zoomed-in view of my pictures.  I still check it, but I don't share on Facebook anymore.  Please fix it!"
4789,Daisies1978,"February 7, 2015",5,Photos load half the time Some times the older photos won't post to my Facebook wall even though the rest of the event will.  Pretty frustrating when it is something I want to share.
4790,AMM0702,"March 16, 2013",4,"SO MUCH FUN! I love looking at my TimeHop everyday! It's so much fun seeing what I was up to 1,2 and even 5 or 6 years ago. The only thing I would change is that I wish we could go back to a certain day. I hate that if I forget to check it one day, I can't go back and view it. Other than that, this app is amazing! :)"
4791,neildogg,"November 12, 2013",1,"Don't Even Bother Download this app if you want to ruin what could have been an enjoyable day. Otherwise, schedule a reminder for a month or two from now to download the app. By then maybe Timehop will have the constant bugs fixed and maybe (but unlikely) they'll reintroduce a method of sharing your updates to only the friends who are interested in nostalgia, and not force you to purge the boring rehashing of your life to everyone who has the misfortune of having friended you."
4792,mrsbrady,"April 13, 2014",5,"Great, but would gladly pay for a premium app Love Timehop. Only thing that would improve it (definitely happy to pay for this) is to be able to scroll back through a set number of days. Love the dinosaur comments at the end :)"
4793,Tim1983IRL,"May 19, 2014",3,Bring back.. One of my favorite features was the ability to copy the original facebook link and check out the original post. I liked seeing what people wrote under the post that was time hopped that day. That feature has since been removed and it's removed some of the entertainment value of this app for me.
4794,Emceerog,"July 10, 2014",3,"No way to check yesterday I like this app, but sometimes you forget and would like to go back to yesterday, if nothing happened today and there is no way to do that. Some people might not have the time to check their app every single day or think to do it. Just think you should be able to go back."
4795,YoshiABCC,"July 23, 2014",2,"Data mining I really loved the idea of the app, especially how it allowed me to tell it what things I would like to review (share information about). Today, about 2 weeks after I got it, the app suddenly won't let me do anything unless I give it full access to my Facebook account. "
4796,Rio12605,"August 17, 2014",4,Could be better I really like this app but it doesn't go back as far as it could. It is awesome to see some of the posts for the past 4 years. (For some

4798,AmyHeider,"October 13, 2014",4,"How fun! Love seeing my old photos. I haven't had any problems or issues with the app. I wish it had an option to pick the date you want to see, or to be able to go back a day or two...I don't always remember to check it every day- even with a reminder."
4799,chelleparti5,"August 2, 2017",1,"Redownloaded after a long time away to a nightmare When I got a new phone months ago I didn't bother downloading the Timehop app again, and didn't really miss it. Today though, a friend sent me a timehop and I wanted to join back in on the nostalgia. This new layout is *awful* and not at all conducive to viewing memories - feels like a plot to get a full screen ad on the page, with no option to pay to remove them. Back to no timehop for me!"
4800,pdxsurreal,"February 7, 2017",1,"Used to be great This new UX just isn't good. I used to enjoy scrolling through things. Now I don't bother looking at more than one or two posts. I feel bad complaining about a free app, but the new design guarantees it will end up being deleted from my phone."
4801,chiaralovespink,"February 9, 2017",1,New update is not good I've really tried to give this update a chance. They've fixed some issues people have been complaining about but now this app blatantly misses photos from past days. It doesn't make it fun anymore and I'm always looking through my camera roll to find past days. Considering deleting it soon because it would be more efficient for me to scroll through my old stuff than this is.
4802,Iwanttheoldupdateback5,"February 23, 2017",2,"Can't watch videos I hate this new update. I hate how I have to slide to the next page to look at more. I liked scrolling down. But that isn't too bad, what is really bad is that I can't watch gifs or videos on here. That is the most important thing. I have posts that say ""this is so funny, you have to watch"" and I can't watch them again. It is so annoying. I just want them to fix it."
4803,Annabelle M,"February 27, 2017",1,"It's like a poor knock-off of itself I used to love Timehop. I loved the Then and Now. I loved how easily I could scroll down my feed and pick something, customize a border, and share it effortlessly all over social media. The latest update does nothing to fix our complaints. Still no Then and Now. Still tap tap tapping instead of scrolling through a news feed. Still a poor knock-off disappointment to the glorious original app we all fell in love with."
4804,Ajibberz,"February 28, 2017",2,"Ugh Tap to scroll is fine if you also give me a list view option. I used to love quickly scrolling through everything at once. Getting a cool snapshot of the last 10 or so years. Also video functionality is SO SO SO BAD. They never load and when they do and you try to put the sound on it closes the video, which then starts loading again......."
4805,MommaRach10,"March 5, 2017",2,"Sharing feature doesn't work anymore üò£ I have had this app for a long time and have been patient as updates have been made. With the latest update, however, the sharing feature doesn't work. That was one of the most fun things about the app. Also, the then/now feature is completely gone. Please hear these reviews and fix the app."
4806,Jenn7924,"March 8, 2017",4,Worst update of all time Newest update does not load. Not functioning at all. 
4807,Agirl2523,"April 15, 2017",5,"Suggestion maybe it can hook up to snapchat, and show you when you started a streak with someone, or if its been a year since you downloaded the app or something along those lines."
4808,Catiedontcry,"June 23, 2017",2,"Useless The UI is not great but beyond that there is so little content showing up. On the app it shows me 1-2 posts from 7-9 years ago but when I look at ""On This Day"" on Facebook I have dozens of posts from much more recently back to many years ago. It's useless to use this app. Today it showed me ZERO posts but there were at least 10 on Facebook. "
4809,Pan Robert,"June 25, 2017",3,Promissing app but too many unimportant notifications I like the idea to remind me old photos which happened in this day years ago.
4810,Fish Durr,"January 5, 2017",5,"New version is terrible I used to love this app. Now I open it daily still, but I hate it. There is no information about what I am looking at. It used to be there but isn't now! Please fix this and I will give it a good review again."
4811,Jetfan24,"January 7, 2017",2,"New update Even after the update to the new update I still don't like it. I really wish everything would go back to the way it was with the scrolling feature and not tapping. Don't normally leave reviews but I just felt I should put my two cents in and maybe it'll help things go back to the way they were, Otherwise I will just end up deleting the app"
4812,Shoe02914,"January 7, 2017",1,So sad You took an okay app and made it terrible. Even the updates are just an attempt to try to get back to what you had. Why not just go back? The collages might be the worst. You can't zoom in so all you see is a quarter inch by quarter inch thumbnail of the picture. So helpful. You still can't see who liked your old posts. And there's no link to the original post. There is nothing about this new format that is better than the old.
4813,AshDye,"January 11, 2017",1,"Really used to enjoy this app I loved checking it each day to see the prior years pictures, especially of my kids. This most recent update is a bit much though, you have to tap through the posts and cant maneuver very well. You can't do the then and now anymore (or maybe you can I just don't know how to do it anymore with all the changes). More than likely going to delete and just use the Facebook feature."
4814,Godzblessedme,"January 12, 2017",1,"The new update is awful. I rarely leave reviews for apps but the new Timehop is so frustrating to use I'm considering deleting it--as much as I love reflecting and walking down memory lane every day! I can't tell what captions I left on pictures on social media, the images are blown up too much on the screen and you can't see the image properly and it's a pain to share anything because it's incomplete. Not a fan. Go back to the update before last."
4815,meljohn62,"January 14, 2017",3,"I don't like the update I'm sorry, I'm sure it was expensive but it's the worst. It's tough to use, you can't see the reactions or comments to an old post, so it's just not as valuable to me now. If it's possible to undo the update I'd do it. "
4816,"$4&;&.!.)-&@>.>,¬£|'","January 14, 2017",1,So frustrated I am one of the unlucky ones who can't access Facebook's On This Day. My complaints echo everyone else's. When I try to share a memory this app force closes. The status updates are out of context without being able to see what people commented. The hold to zoom out is counterintuitive. The only reason I keep this app is to look back on my son's development and milestones. The newest update did nothing to fix any of the above issues.
4817,KGS9,"January 18, 2017",1,"Garbage now I used to love this app but ever since it changed its entire layout, it's been trash. My pictures are always cut-off, and the functionality is not intuitive. I've looked at this thing for the past 240+ days, and now I'm completely annoyed every time I open it and want to delete it altogether. Time to revert changes or lose users because this is a terrible excuse for an application. I have a feeling the beta version was better."
4818,jjbb29,"January 20, 2017",1,"The original was better!!! Terrible update! I have never written a review for an app, but the new update is so useless that I had to! Please go back to the original! The reviews from the past compared to present reviews prove what all your users are saying!!! It almost makes me think you're trying to have your app fail!!!  I don't even see the now/then option anymore. Change it back before you lose tons and tons of users!"
4819,Son D.,"February 2, 2017",1,Terrible update Timehop was great until the most recent update that only displays one thing at a time in fullscreen. Other reviewers have already stated how annoying this is so I won't repeat them. Please go back to the format that was working perfectly fine before. This problem is still not fixed in the most recent update after thousands of negative reviews. I'm deleting the app until this problem is fixed.
4820,skimmilk70,"December 26, 2016",1,"Horrible update Omg, I'm almost ready to uninstall Timehop with this latest update.  Seriously...hard to share pictures.  All the pictures are by default zoomed in so I can only see half of it.  Please bring back the old interface.  Your ratings are now 1 star overall because most people hate this new update.  I haven't written a review in a long time but I had to write one so the developers and company recognize how terrible this new update is..."

Like that was literally the best part... What was the point of taking it away???? Also WHY TF IS EVERY PICTURE ZOOMED IN AUTOMATICALLY THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL AND NEVER WILL. Like at least if you bring back the best features I could deal with how ugly the zoomed in pictures are but like there was literally no point to this update at all, it was perfect the way it was. Why did you do this to me, timehop, why??"
4822,Mandy0401,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update üò° The new update is extremely frustrating. I dislike having to tap right or left, scrolling was 100xs better. Also I dislike that I cannot see comments. The swipe up feature is the most frustrating because I often swipe up and get the control screen for my iPhone instead. Please revert back to the old version. This version is too frustrating to use and is no longer enjoyable."

4824,cookiedoodlefan009,"December 30, 2016",1,New Set Up is not functional I recommend not updating if you haven't yet. The new set up is unfunctional and annoying for you have to swipe to see all your events. Also any picture events are super zoomed in so you can't see what they say. Also you can't easily tell the difference between Facebook post and tweet. The newest update was not necessary the app worked best the way it was before. No longer do I enjoy going through my memories.
4825,HopeHeldHigh,"December 30, 2016",1,"Worst Update The fact that I'm going out of my way to write my first app review in nine years of being an iPhone user is proof of how horrible this update was. Please put it back exactly the way it was. Everything you've ""improved"" has only made it impossible to navigate while removing some of the best features. I deleted the app on the day of the update and returned tonight hoping it would be fixed (changed back) by tonight. Bad move, timehop. Bad move."
4826,Funbuyn,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible update Trying to make TimeHop look like a Snapchat story makes the whole app worse. It's much harder to interact with the posts being displayed. Feels very boxed in, doesn't show photos well, overall just bad. It also doesn't give you the option to see original posts as far as I can tell; if you want to share something, you're forced to use the annoying TimeHop filters. Change it back to how it was before."
4827,Gma jerrie,"January 2, 2017",5,"Newest version Don't care for the newest version of time hop at all. Miss all the frames, miss the look and ease of using.

4828,Nfkdkfe,"January 3, 2017",4,"Terrible update As seen in comments below, I support all the one star ratings. No need to write more, they've accurately written the same complaints I have.

4829,Amber9898989898,"January 3, 2017",1,"New changes make app unusable I'm really disappointed in the new changes made to the app. As many others pointed out, most of my pictures don't fit in the required full screen setting. It's very stressful to use and I am probably going to delete the app since I really don't use it anymore. This app really needs a complete overhaul. It was user friendly before this last update and has take some huge steps in the wrong direction."
4830,Cookiebang,"November 17, 2016",4,"suggestion the app works great, the only thing i don't like about it is that it only allows you to do one instagram, one twitter, one facebook account at a time.

4831,Nathan Trinidad,"December 23, 2016",1,"Why Timehop?!?! I liked the old layout much better! It didn't seem so cramped and the ability to scroll up and down was much more convenient. For Facebook posts; and now you can't even read the old comments. On top of that the viewing pictures only works if they are the size of the screen, otherwise you have to zoom out. But then every time I tried to zoom out the slide would accidentally change. ""DON'T FIX IT IF IT AIN'T BROKEN"""
4832,Brendansmommy,"December 23, 2016",1,"Awful update!! I don't do negative reviews much, but this has to be said. They took a fantastic app and ruined it. Completely ruined. It's not laid out in a nice neat list anymore. The pictures are gigantic. You can't read the comments anymore. It's clunky and more difficult to use. WHY?? Just WHY?? I can understand updating and changing things sometimes to keep up with the times, but this was completely unnecessary and a major step backwards. Just awful."
4833,Chelsea Michelle,"December 24, 2016",2,"Incredibly disappointed with update I'm not sure why so many developers feel the need to imitate other apps, but Timehop did not need to imitate Snapchat. Please go back to the former version of Timehop. This is a miserable update and the added music doesn't allow separation from the in-app music and the sound in videos that appear from history. I'm disappointed and Timehop used to be a favorite in my daily routine."
4834,aurora49,"December 24, 2016",5,New update stinks! I can't read comments anymore. I never liked that all that disappeared when I went to share something but now I can't even read to begin with! Time to look for a better app.
4835,Orange Room,"December 24, 2016",1,"Update is AWFUL I've never written a review of an app in my life--but I have to say that this update is awful. HATE how big the pics are as you scroll through. Pictures are grainy looking. I've tried to share one pic and it just took me to the next pic in the scroll. And by the way, what's wrong with simply scrolling up? The sideways scroll is counter-intuitive. Pretty sure that, if it doesn't change soon, I'll be delete my an app that I previously enjoyed."

I can't figure out how to see the captions of pictures I posted. I used to love opening up tweets in Twitter and can't do that anymore.

I loved being able to see comments and likes on each memory, and easily see if it was from Instagram or Facebook etc. Now the pictures are so zoomed in and I don't like the viewing format.

4843,Kimtisha,"December 26, 2015",3,Awkward! I don't want people alerted when I view a photo and I was a bit freaked out when I was notified someone viewed my pic.  Really an unnecessary feature. I'm probably going to uninstall based on that alone. It could be a great app if it stuck to the original concept of taking us on a little time warp without announcing our trips down memory lane.
4844,Skfifhabckfn,"December 29, 2015",2,Irritating. I used to love this app before it constantly started telling me that it cannot connect. I have Internet and I have even tried to just use my data connection but it still tells me it cannot load. I'm not understanding the issue with the app. I had this issue once before and I deleted the app until I got a new phone. So I guess I'll just have to do that's again! So irritating!
4845,Jayni EP,"January 9, 2016",1,"Terrible This app used to be really great. I think after a few updates as well as started to change for me. I used to be able to see all of my tweets from Twitter now, it doesn't show me any of my old tweets anymore. Sometimes only showed me a few posts from Facebook, but when I go to Facebook and press ""On this day"", it shows me all of the ones that Timehop didn't.

But I like this app and would miss it if it were gone.
4857,Time hopper girl78,"October 3, 2015",5,"Hopper girl78 I love time hop. It brings back a lot of great memories from past posts. However, it does get annoying when the majority of the pictures say ""this picture has been deleted"". Other than that I love it."
4858,***pinkpantherlady***,"October 5, 2015",5,Great app Time hop is great! The only problem is that sometimes I uploaded pictures somewhere on a day after they happened so sometimes it's wrong. And it's crazy to see how fast time passes!  But is also full of wonderful memories :)
4859,Tiakatt,"October 7, 2015",5,"Time happy Love this app- really nice 2 look back & remember what was happening w/ur life in the years past & get 2 see just how much u, ur kids, grandkids & all of ur loved ones have grown & changed. Also can be a real eye opener 2 see how u have grown & evolved as a person thru the yrs."
4860,T's moms,"March 10, 2015",4,"Good, not great I enjoy looking back but dislike the cropped photos when you try to share.  I also wish they included a link to go to the actual post so you could re-read some of the comments on the post.  That would be fun.  Almost a 5 but not quite."
4861,C. D. C.,"March 22, 2015",5,"Love it dearly Timehop remains one of the few apps I'll check every day. The premise is so simple, but it winds up being incredibly powerful. Using Timehop gives one a sense of historical perspective; it's a diary you don't have to write. It will change how you use the Internet."
4862,BarakatsBurrito,"March 24, 2015",3,"Just an idea to make this app better I wish there was a way to turn off a certain year. For many people who struggle with depression, there could be a certain year with rough triggers, but other years worth remembering. Or even just someone trying to get over a bad relationship. It would make this app so much more accessible."
4863,random dude on an app review,"April 28, 2015",5,"Love it Been ignoring the Rate pop-up bubble for too many years now lol, love this app, check it every morning. I also like how experimental you guys are when it comes to testing out new things for the app, keep the ideas comin you guys are sweet."
4864,Queenieann,"May 18, 2015",3,Can't open everything I love looking back at pics I've posted of my family it really brings back memories. There are a lot of things on my time hop though that I am unable to open to see if I would like to repost. It's very frustrating. If this was fixed I would definitely give this app a 5 star rating.
4865,VStryker,"May 22, 2015",5,"Super fun! I'm always showing pictures from here to people. Also, it goes by DATE not day, so it shows you things from the 16th, not things from Monday last year. I think some of the other reviewers don't get that."
4866,Not_Milk,"May 29, 2015",1,"Disappointing for iPad users App does not seem to function well for iPad users at all. Scrolling does not work (have to scroll up to scroll down) cannot share, cannot go out to other apps (not even sure what other apps are available as button does nothing), and clicking on a photo throws the whole app into a strange shape that cannot be recovered without restart."
4867,TLTrex,"June 1, 2015",4,"Fun app, could use updates Love it, but has a lot of glitches. I can not post from timehop to twitter, I always get an error. When sending timehops as a message it deletes the captions. Otherwise love the app and check it every day, just wish it would update and fix little issues"
4868,68mustangs,"June 13, 2015",5,Cool app....But The app is slow to allow any use or function. It crashes the phone when used there and only uploads to Facebook about half the time without an issue. Work out the bugs and it will be a great app
4869,1097jenniej,"June 25, 2015",4,Love it!! I love to wake up in the morning and being able to be reminded of events years ago with pictures or posts. Only thing I would change is to make it possible to save old pics or videos (only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5)!
4870,Mandyjane71882,"September 7, 2014",3,"Love it when it works Lately I've been having issues. Before this week, I've loved the app and would have rated it a 5. But lately none of the pictures want to load. It keeps saying ""time travel failed"" I tried deleting the app and starting over but still getting the same messages. Really disappointing."
4871,JSB082367,"November 10, 2014",5,"Fun Time Hop is a fun app & I like the review of the pics & things I've posted in the past. Sometimes I crack myself up @ the things I've said. I do not however; repost anything, once was enough, but it's a neat feature. I enjoy the time travel each day."
4872,Jkallen1107,"December 28, 2014",4,"Needs Flexibility! I love this app! Seeing the events of my recent past on a daily flashback in time is awesome! My only suggestion would be to have the ability to pick a date in time, enter it, and randomly check to see what your entries were that day. Otherwise, I think it's great!"
4873,Mimzymay,"January 13, 2015",4,Love TimeHop I love this app. I can't wait to look at it every morning to see what's on it and let the memories come back! I do wish that it showed the comments also. Especially since some people that comments in some of the stuff aren't here anymore but we can still see that!
4874,JaimeBthatsMe,"January 22, 2015",3,"Needs to update days quicker This app is fun, but takes forever to load the new day. I am frequently up late at night and would like to check the app for new activities from past years, but it's never up until way later the next morning. I wish it would update at midnight to stay current."
4875,Wootyful,"January 23, 2015",4,"Better before the update Previously I would have given this app a five star review. But since the update, an ugly Apple/Droid  watermark is added to the top of every picture and it looks like crap. I liked it so much better whatever it was on the bottom and not blocking any of the photo!"
4876,Alp6262626262,"February 4, 2015",5,Love this! I love all the throwbacks from one to four years ago. I wish it went back further but it's so much easier than scrolling back through Facebook or Twitter etc. and I love when others share what was on their timehop!
4877,SHMom,"February 12, 2015",5,"The Good, the bad, and the memories I love this app! Some times the memories are so good or hilarious, that they can totally pick me up on a gloomy day. At other times, the memories still sting and hurt a bit. But it's where we've been that shapes where we are, so it's all worth remembering!"
4878,u-kno,"February 13, 2015",5,"Oh, the memories Such a great way to remember old times and laugh with your friends about the stupid things you did years ago. I just wish Timehop allowed you to delete the embarrassing posts/pics from the past."
4879,Maximums ain,"February 20, 2015",5,"Love it best app out today I love this app, it is the best way to look back at your past. An then it gives you something in history on that day. Love it every one should try this app at lest once. Once you try it you will be on it every day"
4880,AlexWeber.IS,"January 29, 2013",4,A fun way to remember your history Overall this app is fun and straightforward. I like getting the notifications every day that my day is available to view. The only thing that could make it better would be if I could go back to previous days in the app.
4881,Adrian Aghinitei,"September 18, 2013",5,"Great little app It's great for taking a look back at your life, especially if you post a lot on social networks. I love the little details with the dinosaur, like the one where I can see it's underwear when I try to scroll more than the page. :))"
4882,Rox lillard,"July 5, 2014",2,"Ehh While it does pull up things from Facebook up to five years ago, it would be nice if it showed things from all social networks it let's me connect to, as well as all posts from the day and not just random ones. It would also be nice if it worked all the time, I know for a fact that five years ago I was posting all day everyday, and my app hasn't given me posts in two days."
4883,Cf20174,"July 18, 2014",3,"Needs improvement Although I have it set for the correct time zone, it never updates until later in the morning around 4-5am. Also, it would be cool if you had the option of going back and looking at any day rather than it disappearing the next and you can no longer access it."
4884,Rbeneski,"September 6, 2014",3,"Love app but pictures rarely load I love checking my Timehop everyday to see previous posts. However, lately it's become less and less reliable at loading pictures. Always just says ""Time Travel Failed"" I rarely ever get to see pictures anymore. Would give 5 star if pictures actually showed up all the time."
4885,Not-so-pleased Chica,"March 1, 2017",1,"New update stinks. If I could give this zero stars I would. It won't let you. Trust me, I tried. Ever since their new format or update or whatever I've had constant issues with my account. Most days I don't even get to see my old posts. An app I once loved and constantly checked and shared pictures from has thoroughly disappointed and aggravates me. I'd like the old and simpler version back. At least then I could see my pictures every day."
4886,Dressenup,"May 16, 2017",4,Update is a big improvement So glad the update fixed the share photo issues and now the whole picture is shown when viewing photos of the day. But I still can't view or share videos
4887,Eloelyse,"May 19, 2017",2,"Google photos don't load :( I used to love this app, but it seems to work less and less well with every update. Now google photos and videos don't load at all, and I can't see my swarm checkins. It would also be great if the app would take into account duplicate photos so that I don't have to see every photo several times just because it exists in more than one place."
4888,Amandafloydrn,"June 17, 2017",5,"Love this app. Watching my kids grow up, I get to see how far they have come! The then and now is my absolute gave!"
4889,AlliRo,"August 22, 2017",1,"Take me back to an early version I am glad that I can make this short and simply say I agree with the thousands of other users who cannot stand this current version. Timehop needs to be simplified. Also, it notifies me even though notifications are turned off, and even though I don't have any posts in history for a given day. Listen to your users. It's a great concept, that I used to love, but I'm uninstalling for the reasons stated below."
4890,A-Elizabeth,"January 22, 2017",1,"Used to love this app Like everyone said, the new format is no good. Plus, it stopped showing me my old posts and was only showing me ads. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it and then I couldn't see any way to say ""no"" to things like connecting my camera roll and instagram (which I don't even have). I had to pretend I was going to connect them and then X out. Ridiculous. At least my old posts are now showing up again. I miss the scrolling."
4891,Aaaaaaaaaaaaanie,"January 26, 2017",3,Click Should change how when you click at the top the settings automatically drop down. 
4892,Dino Fam üå∫,"January 27, 2017",5,Hate it I really really HATE the new update I want the old Timehop not this new crappy way to see my old pics. Not cool! I don't even wanna look at the pics anymore. Such a bad change nothing really has changed I want the old time hop
4893,Love it but... From Dekalb,"January 27, 2017",1,Poor update I feel like the app has gotten more difficult to use with the most recent update instead of better. I find it irritating that I can't look at individual pictures and I'm giving collages I feel irritated that I can't seem to usually enlarge the pictures so that I can look at them from years past and there are ads all over the place I wish you would go back to what you had originally
4894,Drew4956,"February 6, 2017",5,What update still awful Still can't see your check in from swarm so I am done deleting app after 3 updates you guys can't figure it out everyone likes the old version
4895,Fishin4asong4u,"February 9, 2017",5,"GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS I do not like this ap since they so called 'updated' it or changed it, drastically! It has sucked ever since! Go back to the old version it's better than this one!! Fixing to have to find something else!"
4896,CrystalPistol05,"February 10, 2017",1,"Total failure! The update is a total failure!!! Total bugging out so no ""bug issues"" were fixed and it crashes every time I try to send a timehop I can't even send one!!!! What's the point! When I have the app open in the background it make my phone act buggy too and not only crashes on the timehop but will make my phone freeze up! So stupid. No problem with my phone either it's up to date on any updates. It's the app. Total crap."
4897,Rodekuhr,"February 18, 2017",2,Bring back the old format! I used to open timehop every day but now over the past few months I open it maybe once a week just to see if they have fixed it. Everything is so slow now and having to swipe through the pictures instead of being able to scroll down is a big step back.
4898,Melizabethgard,"February 23, 2017",1,What is this new Timehop? I love Timehop and their idea. But they lost me when they changed up the entire interface and added way too many ads. I understand every company needs to monetize at some point but not at the cost of their user base. They need to bring back the interface that is reminiscent of Instagram. Keep it simple stupid! Timehop will not be a company who goes public so their strategy should be maintain the users it has. Poor decision making.
4899,JenFritz,"February 25, 2017",1,Awful Updates This app was one of my favorites and I am so disappointed after the updates. The pictures come in huge and you only see the center of it. I can no longer see all of pics posted that day and often the best ones are the ones not shown. I am highly disappointed that this has not been resolved since the last update it was exclaimed that they listened to feedback. Apparently not.
4900,righty316,"January 5, 2017",1,"Bring back the old Timehop! I never write reviews, but I thought I'd join the 7k+ who feel the same as I do. Broken record here. Totally bugged by the new update. It has completely ruined the timehop experience and it makes me not want to even use the app any longer. I hate that I have to hold the screen to zoom out. I hate the swiping/tapping. But most of all, I hate that I can't read the captions or comments from the posts. Huge fail on this one."
4901,intensekt,"January 6, 2017",1,"Newest Update Does Not Address ""Strong Feedback"" Latest update doesn't address the core feedback provided for the previous version. This feedback includes the level of effort now required by users to consume their daily timehop. Tapping isn't much better than swiping. People liked the single view rather than memories lined up in a slideshow-like view. You need to admit this format isn't what your users want and incorporate this outstanding feedback."
4902,tcd135,"January 7, 2017",5,"Nothing But Ads The latest version no longer shows your history, just ads.  An update is badly needed or I will delete the app going forward.  Prior versions were great but this is crap."
4903,Darthnod,"January 7, 2017",2,"Ugh üòí Honestly, I love reading my old posts, seeing pics of my son when he was a baby etc. what annoys me though is the way they have changed the interface of the app. The old way was like a page that you could scroll down and the way it is now I have to flip through all the old posts. They made something more time consuming than it had to be."
4904,Kingpftheeorld,"January 13, 2017",2,This app is terrible now The changes you have made over the past few weeks are just awful. Supposedly you fixed the issues but not so. Just restore it back to how it originally was.
4905,Kait13,"January 15, 2017",1,"Update not user friendly The new timehop is not user friendly at all. Every memory that is shown for the day is zoomed in, so that the only way you can see the entire post is to begin to share it. If multiple pictures were posted on a day, the most you can see is three and you can't zoom in on them. Go back to the old timehop where everything was on one page and you could just scroll up."
4906,Ha297,"January 15, 2017",1,"Terrible update Will be deleting this app because the new update is not user friendly. I tried sharing a video today and it's like app had a seizure, zooming in and rapidly scanning through the pictures. So disappointing. I loved the old version and the user friendliness of it. This new update is terrible."
4907,My4boyzrule,"January 16, 2017",3,Almost there I definitely see some improvements already. It's great that you guys are listening to your users! Now if you can address the little cluster of photos that get put into picture frames. I don't mind the frames however it would be nice to be able to see the photos like normal as well!
4908,Itsmebj11,"January 18, 2017",1,No good... I was gonna my to just write a quick review about how much I didn't like the changes you made to the app and see I am by no means alone. 
4909,GiGi219,"January 19, 2017",1,Won't even load It wont even load for me anymore! It just crashes the second I open it. I tried to uninstall and reinstall and still wont load. I dislike this update very much. Timehop was always so much fun to look back at and now theres not even an option to compare then and now!? I also loved the different themes/frames the older version had. This one is so plain and boring! Please fix ASAP or I will most likely be deleting.
4910,Fdehon,"December 30, 2016",1,"Not happy I used to love Timehop and reading through each post from years past.. along with the comments on them. This new update won't allow me to do that. I strongly dislike the update. I can't enjoy videos of my children from years past, read comments on an old post or anything. Most of my posts get cut off so I have to try to remember what I wrote anyways. I used to love reading through time hop. Now I hate it. Don't change a good thing."
4911,Nessa1705,"December 31, 2016",1,Can I timehop back to the old version? I seriously LOVED the old version. The update ruined it for me. I loved being able to see the comments on all the pictures and the caption that I wrote for each picture. The zoom in is really just to much and I already have an app with the whole 'touch to see the next picture' feature. I'm good with one snapchat thanks. Please please please go back to the old version. Nothing was wrong with it üò´
4912,Elissa V.,"January 1, 2017",1,New update is Horrible. Bring back the older version I don't usually write reviews but this update makes me so mad. I used the old Timehop all the time & I miss all the old features.

4914,Sanfran637,"January 1, 2017",1,"Horrible update I've never written a negative app review before but this one clearly deserves it. None of the new features are actually helpful or make sense, the app is not at all intuitive or user friendly, and having the pictures zoomed in and then holding to zoom out is a terrible user experience. I'm about to delete this app because I hate this update so much, and I'm a daily user who had come to love checking timehop every morning."
4915,k.zonca,"January 3, 2017",1,"I'm so sad! üò≠ I loved your app. LOVED it. Before the update. Now, I can't see any of the text on photo posts or comments or likes on my old posts (it was really fun to go back and read them) and I was a log-in-daily addict (I was so sad both times I wrecked my 140+ day streaks and had to start over) because I loved looking at the artwork that you guys took a LOT of time to create! Now you can't scroll down and see any of it. Total miss on this update. Please fix it! Please!!!"
4916,Imadams,"January 3, 2017",2,"üëéüèªbad update! Like everybody else is saying: the automatic zoom on the pictures is bad, having to zoom back to see the original is dumb! And, what did you do with the before/after feature?! That was the best part of Timehop! I enjoyed looking at my grandkids' pictures and creating b/a pictures of them as they are growing and I can't now! üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª"
4917,dizneephyllis,"January 3, 2017",5,First to worst I used to love this app....now I hate it....you can't read the comments on a post....the format is bizarre.....I would give the update a negative five stars if I could....if you don't fix it I will be deleting it from my phone.
4918,lnd2012,"January 4, 2017",1,"Bring back the old version I DO NOT like this new update. It is harder to use and annoying. Before you could see likes and comments from instagram/Facebook but now you can't, all you can see is pictures and posts. The old version was way better and I personally saw nothing wrong with it! Please bring it back. I used to enjoy looking at Timehop and the memories it brought back but now I don't look forward using the app."
4919,S. Conley,"January 5, 2017",2,"I really dislike the new update I like the fact that this app gathers all of my past pictures and posts but I do not like the new app update! The old layout was easier to share the pictures and view all of the pictures. Now, with all of the new features, it's hard to view your past pictures, especially if it's in one of the new framed layouts. It's pretty terrible!"
4920,TWichern24,"December 26, 2016",1,"Update is terrible. I never take the time out of my day to write reviews for an app. Seriously. I really don't think I've ever done it before. But I use time hop every day and then new update is one of the worst updates I have ever seen. There was nothing wrong with the old time hop. The fact everything is zoomed in and you can't move from year to year without clicking is horrible. And it seems like everyone agrees with me. Please, change it back."
4921,Hmelea16,"December 27, 2016",1,New update stinks I have been using Timehop for years and I am about to uninstall the app after this new update. It won't even let me share photos anymore because of the way you swipe left and swipe right and zoom in! What were you thinking? This is the worst update to an app I have ever seen and if it doesn't change within the next couple of days I am just going to delete it and depend on sharing my memories from Facebook.
4922,KitKat1618,"December 27, 2016",1,Worst Update I've used Timehop for about a year now and I loved looking at old pictures and status updates that I forgot about! But with this new update it doesn't have the same effect on me. Needing to hold a picture to zoom is weird and now it is harder to look at the status and see who commented or liked it. With this new update I feel like Timehop is trying to be like Snapchat in any way. Please just go back to the original version.
4923,J. Byron,"December 27, 2016",1,"No longer fun to use Other than it being ungodly zoomed in on everything (which is hard to look out and makes it work to have to look at a 'memory. I want to be able just to scroll through), a big part of it for me is looking at the comments, and now I'm unable to figure out that. Also, swiping to move from memory to memory makes the whole experience feel disjointed. Fix soon please"
4924,Marnijami,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update is terrible I used to love going through my timehop everyday, but now I only click on it to clear the notification. The new update is absolutely awful; scrolling through every picture I've ever taken is not something I want to do when I used to be able to preview them all at once and select the individual ones I wanted to see. If you've never had timehop before, I would not recommend downloading it now."
4925,Buzzkillbetch,"December 28, 2016",1,"Long time user not happy I am so disappointed with this update! I've been using timehop as long as I've had an iPhone and always loved it! With this new update I can't figure out how to do any of the usual things I would do with it like a then/now picture or sharing with friends. This update is terrible and so hard to use I'm debating deleting the app, the only reason I have not already is because I've been a long time user and supporter of it."
4926,kymberliapril,"December 28, 2016",1,"New update needs to go the way of the dinosaurs I have no idea why Timehop goes through a wholesale change about once a year. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This update is garbage - makes my memories much more difficult to view and zooms the photos in all weird (when the photos decide to show up!). Not a fan and hopeful they will restore the old view or at least the option to roll back for those of us who would like to."
4927,Ash23mo23,"December 28, 2016",1,Not pleased! I'm not impressed with your snap chat like update! I've spent several days trying to be okay with the update and get use to it! I'm not! I don't like that the albums can't be viewed and you've framed them and can't zoom them and while other photos are so zoomed you can't see what it is and where is my caption of what I posted so I can have some memory of what it was that it was from in case I have forgotten! I totally do not like this update!
4928,Halerrr0808,"December 28, 2016",1,"Horrible Wish I could give it zero stars... Timehop what the hell were you thinking with this update. I've never written a review of an app ever. But this was too terrible to pass up writing about. Get it together guys. I like seeing my memories laid out like how they were before. It was perfectly fine the way it was. I hate swiping through things AND it's zoomed in on every picture??? Listen, maybe you've heard this one but, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Period."
4929,PrettyPirateParrot,"December 29, 2016",1,"Absolutely terrible By far THEE WORST update of any app I've ever had. Sometimes a new version of an app takes a while just to get used to but ends up offering way more when you finally figure out how to navigate it.... but with The ""new"" TimeHop it's like it was redesigned to how it should have been when it FIRST came out... ??? The only thing that makes sense about it now is the dinosaur because the ""update"" is prehistoric. They'd be smart to change it back. üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩüò°"
4930,KellyHam,"December 24, 2016",1,Why did you ruin my favorite app??? This latest update is HORRIBLE. Where are the descriptions of the photos? Why are the pictures so zoomed in? Why did you go and mess everything up? 
4931,YouWillKnowMyName,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update has ruined the app. I've never had an update for an app so drastic that it completely flips my opinion of the app. I used to love checking this everyday, but now, it's a pain. Pictures need to be zoomed out to see the full image, you can no longer see comments, it's navigation is horrendous, and it's a chore to just see what was posted. Facebook's ""On This Day"" feature does it so much better. If there's not another update or revision, I'm uninstalling."
4932,sprbbmoon,"December 24, 2016",1,NEW UPDATE IS AWFUL The new update takes all the fun out of looking back at your memories and instead turns it into a chore. I liked glancing through my posts and seeing what happened that catches my eye. I have no desire to look through every single thing I posted on social media individually. The app definitely needs an overview option or it needs to change back to how it was. This update literally does not make anything better at all.
4933,AMP35128,"December 25, 2016",2,"Current Update Ruined It I love Timehop. But one of my favorite parts was being able to reread the comments from family and friends on photos and status updates. Now that that option is gone, I don't even want to open the app. "
4934,HIT211,"December 25, 2016",1,"Why did you mess with a good thing?!? This update is AWFUL!!! I was so happy with timehop and always looked forward to seeing my daily memories. I'm likely going to get rid of this app now. I can't see the whole photo without keeping my finger on the screen?!? It creates a ""collage"" of my pics and I can't zoom in on the pictures so they're tiny. No way to see old comments from FB. The list goes on and on. PLEASE fix this...sooo many faithful users are going to leave!"
4935,BaseballSam7,"December 25, 2016",1,"Please go back, update is confusing I've had Timehop for about two years and I used to check it everyday. I loved the old way where you could just scroll and see everything that you needed to. It was very simple to maneuver through. The new update is very confusing and seems like you're trying to do too much. If you don't fix this, I, along with many others will probably end up deleting this app. Fix it please."
4936,tonideem,"December 25, 2016",1,"Why Ruin A Good TimeHop? Why?!?! This update is HORRIBLE! Please make it back to look like a news feed... like every other app. We were able to see videos, vertical and horizontal pics without any issues. The new update makes it hard to see what pics are vert or horiz- even if you hold down on the screen. That feature works about 2% of the time. I'm now on the lookout for another app that does what Timehop used to do. Don't waste your time on this version!!!!"
4937,altryne,"December 25, 2016",1,"Bad bad bad update I'm not sure what happened to you guys there at Timehop, maybe you thought you need to address the younger market, but this made the app horrible."
4938,Mia_H,"December 26, 2016",1,"Hate this new update I have been using Timehop for a very long time. I hate this update because I can't see my pictures without zooming out. I also can't see my past comments or likes. That was half the fun for me! I personally don't like the whole ""swiping"" thing. I liked the scroll. It's less buggy and it's easier for me to see and compare my past posts. Please change it back. It's not as fun anymore without seeing past comments."
4939,Lyss72222,"December 26, 2016",1,Update is horrible Loved this app until the update. Every picture is zoomed in so big that you can't see the whole picture unless you hold down to zoom out. I want to be able to see all of every picture at first glance. Why should I have to zoom it out every time. I don't mind the format of the new update but it was much better before. Not good changes. If they don't fix it I probably won't use it anymore. So inconvenient. :(
4940,patiencejo,"January 10, 2016",5,Met expectations But....did not exceed them. The functionality is limited. Would love to be able to see more historical posts than just the current day in history.  Like search on specific dates.  Oh well.
4941,Smm7z,"February 4, 2016",5,I love Timehop! This app is the best! Takes you back! It's nice to see my posts from all the way back to 8 years ago when Facebook and everything was new. It's hilarious to see how terrible we were at social media back then üòú
4942,Jaclynx27,"February 5, 2016",4,"It's great!! Except one thing. I love Timehop. The concept is great and I really enjoy looking back at my social media activity every day. There is, however, one thing I would like the app to improve. I currently manage more than one Twitter account, and I would love to have them all connected to my account."
4943,Hagertyw,"July 31, 2016",5,"Do not like this app What is wrong with this app? Why will it not post a memory to Facebook. Please do not tell me to uninstall the app and restart my phone, because that hasn't worked and I have tried 10 times!"
4944,Dogsarefun,"December 19, 2016",2,Buggy I love the app but lately it's only showing me the first line of all my posts..it's annoying. I want to be able to see all of what I posted. Also I think there should be a way to filter out memories with some people. Whether it be with a keyword or a name but I have a bunch of memories that come up with someone I'm not friends with anymore. It would be nice if I didn't have to see them.
4945,Saw_bhs07,"December 22, 2016",2,"Cool BUT lacking The new layout is cool and is more up-to-date with say, Snapchat and Instagram with the new swiping feature. However, we have now lost the ability to read comments that have been left on our social media posts. This was the coolest thing about this app for me, and now I don't have the ability to do that anymore. Please add it back. This app is pointless for me without it."
4946,JonB57,"December 23, 2016",1,"New update is horrible The new update is horrible. There was nothing wrong with the old setup and it was easy to read. The new one is a hassle to get through, especially if you had a lot on one day, and it just looks terrible. I don't like having to scroll through 8 tweets like a slideshow at all. You also can no longer click on the actual link to old tweets anymore either. Completely bombed this utterly unnecessary update"
4947,kristaonpurpose,"December 24, 2016",1,"The new update is TERRIBLE Are you kidding me, Timehop? You've made it impossible to use this app now! So much swiping and things that don't actually make any sense. Who wants to look at a zoomed in photo -- why not automatically show the whole thing? Where are the picture captions? I want to see the number of comments and likes. I won't be using timehop anymore if this update isn't changed back. It's become too hard to use and just not worth it."
4948,rianvdm,"December 24, 2016",1,"A slow descent into chaos This used to be such a wonderful app. Then weird things started happening with statuses getting cut off, photos not loading, etc. But at least it was still functional. This latest update boggles the mind. It takes much more work to get through your day - what's wrong with scrolling? And what happened to the text you shared with a photo? Not *every* app has to have Snapchat-style swiping. Scrolling is still cool, y'all."
4949,Amcarbaugh,"December 24, 2016",5,New update This update is terrible. The pictures are all the wrong size and you have to resize them in order to view. The navigation is overly complicated and chunky. Bring back the old version.
4950,crossb0nes,"September 9, 2015",4,"Easy to view, nice to share I like seeing everything i did and it reminds of events and the growth of my kids and can compare with then and now. I just wish there was a few more share options. I get that tagging the program is there but the frames are gaudy"
4951,Afinn8,"September 23, 2015",3,Great idea I really loved this app. It fun to see how much you have changed over the years and what you shared/posted. However recently I can never look at it. It says time traveling failed. I have deleted it and redownloaded. I have tried the Facebook link but nothing works. 
4952,MARSTE1967,"September 28, 2015",5,Love it I love this app I love being able to look at pics that we may if forgotten about that were taken in the past. I use this app everyday and I've never had any problems with the app.. Everyone should get it
4953,The one and only Tangid13,"October 4, 2015",4,Dates I used to like this app so much but every time I go on lately it says my photo has been deleted. I can only see my memories when I see something on FaceBook that say share you memories. I wish the problem with my photos disappearing could be fixed.
4954,Lux Tuxe,"October 19, 2015",5,Love to Time Travel I love this app and how it gives you a view of several years back! My only warning to new users is to know what is on your social networking: it can bring up bad memories just as easily as good ones!
4955,Mjessop,"November 9, 2015",4,"Modern day time capsule I love this app and tell everyone about it, it brings me joy on a daily bases as I can store all f the photos I would like to on my phone. The latest upgrade either to the app or the phone caused it to not use my computer like it did to archive my photos. Other than that, great app."
4956,Minister of Order,"November 26, 2015",5,My new favorite I tell all my friends about this app.  I have three kids and getting the old picture of them every day is the highlight of my day.  Otherwise the pics just sit there I watched.  Totally useful.
4957,Luckybugs,"November 28, 2015",5,"Fun nostalgia daily reminder! Fun app that brings up memories from 1,2,3...and up years ago from social media. Sometimes when sharing a pic to FB, the photo won't fit for some reason. Doesn't always happen though."
4958,Love Love!,"November 29, 2015",2,"Big fan, but what's with the comment section? I have loved timehop for over a year. It's great fun to look back 1-7 years ago every day. It takes me back just like it was yesterday. "
4959,HipsterX3,"December 18, 2015",2,Activity It's was good till my Twitter tweets won't show because it's so called have a limit.. Can't even get in contact with them to fix it.. This app isn't the same as it use to be... Half the time pictures won't even load.. Or days when it says you have nothing but you do.. It's not the same.. Not worth downloading honestly.. I even complain to them and they never got back to me
4960,sssapphireee,"April 10, 2015",4,"Request I hope we can access timehop through other apps aside from it being connected to facebook because I usually deactivate my facebook and I can't see my old posts from twitter/instagram through timehop. It's asking me to login to facebook first üòÜ all in all, great app! I love it!"
4961,Weksos1,"April 27, 2015",5,Great APP! I check it daily! It's great to have a app to remind you about your previous important moments in life! It's a great to check it every morning because you'll never know what you did last year or four years prior!
4962,Cimony,"June 2, 2015",4,"One flaw for me.... I love this app!  It has brought back some great memories.  However, I really wish you could see a few days in the past.  Sometimes on those special days (birthdays, holiday, vacations, etc) I don't open the app for a day or two and would really like to go back."
4963,Nana Claus #1 Ho,"June 22, 2015",5,Look into the past I love being able to look into the past few years and watch my children and grandchildren grow again.
4964,Sousa_palooza,"June 28, 2015",4,"Fun and meaningful app I really enjoy glancing at this app and reconnecting with old memories. It shows you the good and the bad, you can really get to see where you came from and how much you've grown. I just wish I would be able to get my tweets up there but I keep having an issue."
4965,LakeshoreChick,"July 8, 2015",5,First thing I check every morning My daughter told me about Time Hop and I absolutely love it!  I look forward to checking it every morning.  I love see previous photos and posts that I had completely forgotten about.
4966,Anyuser123456789,"July 14, 2015",5,"I Love this app! It's such a blast seeing what I posted and even just the pictures I took years ago. It's a trip down memory lane every day. My kids adore seeing what they were up to last year, the year before, etc."
4967,PSayceFan,"July 22, 2015",5,One of my favorite apps! I love how Timehop has enabled my social media accounts to become one big scrapbook. I haven't experienced any problems and love the new features that were recently added. It's a really cool app and definitely a must have!
4968,HulaVal,"August 18, 2015",5,"Sorry Timehop gotta pass now! I love Timehop! Who wouldn't. However Facebook now has a ""memory"" feature so I'm gonna say goodbye.  Honestly sometimes items couldn't ""be seen"". I like just getting it from Facebook! Thanks for the great memories though!"
4969,ZeekTheZack,"August 28, 2015",5,App Works Ok The only complaint I have is the app likes to tell me to check my time hop 3 times a day when I've already reviewed everything for that specific day. Simple fix is to just turn off notifications lol
4970,edna million,"January 28, 2015",5,"Look back in time This app is so much fun, and it's simple as well. I've really enjoyed a morning look at what I've posted on FB during the past few years. Also enjoy how quick and easy it is to use."
4971,phoebefromfriends,"January 28, 2015",3,"Not a fan of the update I used to absolutely LOVE timehop, however now it won't show my history. It wk show Facebook statuses but not pictures even though I constantly go back and find many pictures I had taken on that day 1, 2, or three years ago. NOT a fan of the update at all. However, before the update the app was perfect."
4972,Bribabe23,"February 11, 2015",5,Love it! But not new update I love this app!! Use it every single day! I love how we can look back and see things we have forgotten. 
4973,AmandaPearl,"February 16, 2015",4,"One gripe The app is cute. The only thing I would suggest is having the captions from pictures be shared along with the picture. Right now if you share a picture from Timehop on FB, the caption isn't shared as well. Also, it would be nice if the app also showed things you were tagged in."
4974,simplymissamanda,"February 22, 2015",5,"Years are off. Over the past couple of days my years have been off. Just today it showed a picture from 2011 and it had the ""2 years ago"" tag. Please fix"
4975,NikNakNicoleRene,"March 3, 2015",5,"Fun fun fun! Love seeing memories from the past. Fun seeing that you do the same things at certain times of the year. Great improvements regularly (then and now, text, etc) But sometimes I feel like the dates don't exactly match up."
4976,FREEZESSSSSS,"March 16, 2015",1,NOT HAPPY This app is decent but the fact that every morning I have to delete and reinstall to use the app is super annoying and a waste of time. If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to get pictures of my son from years ago that I lost I wouldn't use this app at all. Please fix this asap and I will write a better review but if this continues I'll end up not using the all and making sure everyone knows how time consuming it is to reinstall EVERYDAY!!!
4977,ThePathIsNarrow,"March 20, 2015",5,"Trip down memory lane You forget, you just can't help it. Life is busy, crazy, all over the place. This is a wonderfully simple app to help you remember those times and be able to enjoy them a second time."
4978,Matt abs,"March 20, 2015",5,"Fun app to have It'll tell you posted X years ago from each day from various sources and allows you to share it. Could be improved by letting you pick a date, or by increasing number of networks you can add."
4979,Baby Cup Cake,"March 26, 2015",3,"WONT OPEN Usually LOVE this app with no problems. Lately it will freeze when it asks if I want to write a review. Other times it won't even load. If I close it, it won't reopen U les I lock my phone and try again, and it still won't load. I've uninstalled it twice before and it will work for a few days. PLEASE FIX!!! Then you'll get all 5 stars from me!!"
4980,Leamacv,"August 3, 2014",4,"Great, but.... I agree with a few others that have posted, I wish I could see previous days or even search for a specific date. I also wish it would show comments and likes. I does often take a while to load for me as well."
4981,guswrinkledog,"August 8, 2014",5,A daily mini scrapbook I look forward to checking this app each day. It's a mini scrapbook of memories on my phone. It let's me enjoy all the photos I have locked away in my computer and all the memories I've stored on social media.
4982,Susieq43,"September 1, 2014",5,Love this App!! My friend was posting on FB and I asked her where she got the app. It refreshing to see past pics of my grandson. The only thing I think they need to do is were the date is on the Pic it needs to be in BOLD so it can be seen better other then that it's AWESOME!
4983,KayKrunk,"September 6, 2014",5,"I love this app!! I get to see posts and pictures that I forgot that I posted years ago! Today, I'm having a hard time getting the pictures to upload. Please fix ASAP! I would love to see the 5 pictures I have to see!"
4984,Babyballa1992,"September 8, 2014",4,Good app. Love this app! But the past week it has not been showing any photos on it. I tried everything I could think of to try and get it to work. I get any of the status'. But it tells me that time travel failed on any photos that were on there. Otherwise a good app.
4985,Hibabee,"October 4, 2014",5,"Love it I love this app. I like seeing what I did in the past few years, especially since I moved out of my home state and no longer see my friends that I used to hang out with and post about. It's good to remember everything I did!!"
4986,Deemfain,"October 18, 2014",5,Great fun In a world where we are almost immediately nostalgic about everything thank goodness for the Timehop app because now we no longer have to do the work ourselves and we can reminisce on that time we did that thing everyday.
4987,Bestndee,"January 20, 2015",3,"Loved this app I loved this app until you did the update on it today.  Now it's all messed up.  Won't scroll, won't stop scrolling once you finally get it to scroll.  Won't let you share anything on your accounts.  Can't even see the share button.  I don't know what you did to it but please fix.  It's one of my favorite apps."
4988,Highplainsprincess,"January 22, 2015",5,"Great walk down memory lane! This is a great app.  So much fun to see photos and FB posts from one year ago or more.  It is like your own personal ""flash from the past"".  I love the creativity of the folks who made the app and the cute dinosaur with his cheeky sayings.  Quite amusing!"
4989,Luvvvyyy567,"January 27, 2015",5,Love the app I really do enjoy how the app can show up to so many years back. I just wish it could show the likes and comments from each picture or profile status (from Facebook & Instagram) üòä
4990,Melissa Strange,"January 3, 2014",2,"Crashes I have had this app for quite a while. But the past week it has refused to work. No matter what I do, the app crashes as soon as I open it. The only reason this review has 2 stars is because it has worked in the past and I really enjoy the idea behind this app. But it's incredibly frustrating when it doesn't work. It has become a waste of space on my iPhone."
4991,marebear88,"March 15, 2014",5,Perfect This app basically let's you ride a memory lane roller coaster everyday letting you relive everything you thought/said/did in past years. Pretty awesome to look back and compare where you are now. One of my favorite downloads!!
4992,DogMama69,"April 10, 2014",5,Huge fan Not many bad things to say about it but I do wish that when you clicked on a photo or status it would take you to that status on the third party site or whatever.
4993,Jessicamay06,"May 23, 2014",5,Blast from the past! Love it!!! It's so great to bring all these forgotten memories back without having to scroll through years of facebooking!!! It's my new favorite app! Talk about a blast from the past! It's amazing how much life changes from year to year!!!
4994,tekn0wledg,"June 18, 2014",3,Fixed bugs but lack of new features is underwhelming I was glad to see they resolved a major bug in this release with logging in.
4995,And handmaiden,"July 7, 2014",5,"Great application! Download I love this app! It's always working perfectly and it never crashes. This app brings up old posts and pictures from exactly one, two, three, etc. years ago and it works wonderfully."
4996,Jkb123456789,"July 17, 2014",5,"‚úåÔ∏è definitely a good app. Tells very interesting events from day earlier in history, while giving you your time travel with status updates and photos from years' past."
4997,hazeleyes06,"July 21, 2014",3,"Bugs & Crashes I'm a sucker for nostalgia, but the problems I have with this app are constantly interfering with that.  I consistently have trouble getting Timehop to load (it keeps saying to ""try again""); I've had to delete and re-download the app way too many times.  On top of that, it frequently crashes while I'm using it."
4998,PBerns143,"July 31, 2014",5,"Neat app Love being to look back on what I did on this days years ago. It brings back great memories. I wish you could look back longer than a day, maybe a week or something. I just signed up and am curious what I missed."
4999,Tyjkhhgrgv,"July 9, 2017",5,"Streaks clearing Thanks Timehop for clearing my streaks when I viewed my page at least 3 times yesterday. Then you ask me to watch a stupid video to restore, it restores then resets anyway. Disappointed this is the we one time after 250 days.üò°"
5000,Kenauto,"January 17, 2017",1,"It used to be good. Don't fix what isn't broken. I loved just scrolling through my old photos. Now my vertical photos get cut off--and yes my auto zoom is turned off. If I took several photos in one spot, I cannot choose to just look at each one (I have to watch them in flip book form), which could be cool but should be able to be turned off. It's not clear how to access settings. Overall, I just don't like the aesthetic as much."
5001,Steffswo,"January 19, 2017",2,"I use to love this app This app use to be wonderful , I loved looking at old memories and that you could share all the pictures and memories and compare them from then to now , this new updated version though is awful they took away the then and now option. Really considering deleting the app at this point because of the new frustrating design."
5002,TaylorCaper,"February 1, 2017",5,Hate new layout This WAS my favorite app. I rarely check it anymore and when I do it just frustrates me! Most of the pictures are zoomed in on (yes I changed my setting)
5003,Dorizzle,"February 4, 2017",5,"Sucky updates I really liked this app... until the upgrade.. now the photos are too large and blurry, and it's much more annoying to navigate. I'd prefer it if they downgraded it back to the old Timehop"
5004,SleepyJLS,"February 6, 2017",2,Lost all picture caption options with these recent updates I really liked being able to customize a pic before sharing. No more. The way it divides the text of a remembered picture post away from the picture doesn't make sense either. I really liked the way it functioned before the new year. Please change those things back.
5005,Ipsissimus,"March 8, 2017",1,"Terrible update *Just updated - still not fixed the Facebook bug (just a blank screen whenI try to post) which renders this app useless to me. Will wait one more update, then delete if not fixed*Cannot post to Facebook after this latest update - just a blank page. I've never given an app 1 star before but this is a horrible update. Impossible to see all the year's statuses at once, the pictures are terribly zoomed."
5006,TAFD,"March 18, 2017",1,"Really?? LISTEN TO US!!! WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN???? We HATE the horizontal swiping. Please please please return to the vertical display. Some of us take a lot of photos, and oh my god, it takes forever to click through them. Takes all the fun out of it; using this app has become a chore. Thank you for giving us the frames back, at least, but they're clunky and awkward to use and not nearly as cute and customizable as the old ones. I'm sad. I'm about done with this app."
5007,JuliaAnn777,"March 25, 2017",1,Trash trash trash. Update **** there have been a few updates and I still can't share anything. Nothing has been done to fix. I'm about to delete the app. 
5008,sparky5108,"April 1, 2017",5,"Why the change This was once one of my favorite apps, I'll probably delete it soon."
5009,Coded Games,"April 3, 2017",1,"Horrible design Timehop, your purpose is to show me stuff that I posted in the past. Before I could see everything with a single swipe of the screen. Now if have to tap multiple times to see everything and then tap multiple times to go back. Honestly it's just absolutely inexcusably terrible interface design. You should be ashamed that you created this monstrosity. I moved onto Memoir and hope everyone else does too."
5010,Briboda,"January 4, 2017",5,"Absolutely love this ! I love timehop, it brings back so many memories of events that had happened over the year. It really let's me see all of the wonderful things I had experienced in the past. Reminiscing always!‚ò∫"
5011,Leanneeee30,"January 5, 2017",1,"Not worth it I used to enjoy Time hop everyday, but now, I don't. I hate the new update. I know that others have said it in other reviews, but I just don't understand why the update even had to happen. The full screen pictures have removed my captions that were originally posted and that was part of the fun for me was seeing what I had originally said with the post. Please go back to the original format and make it fun again."
5012,Dd2808,"January 5, 2017",5,"Newest update is terrible! Latest update changed the format of viewing and it is terrible, makes it hard to view everything."
5013,NicStew,"January 5, 2017",1,"Awful update, 0 stars Echoing what everyone else has said: this new update is terrible! I absolutely hate the app now. If I wanted something like snapchat I would download snapchat. I do not like how everything is zoomed in and I especially do not like that I cannot see the likes and comments (one of my favorite aspects of the old format). It seems that the consensus is that this new update is horrible so I hope the developers change it back."
5014,TubaSaxT,"January 6, 2017",4,Timehop is back!...mostly Thumbs up to the Timehop crew for listening to feedback and making some changes. This update did a good job of meshing the new style with the old features. 
5015,Collyfleur,"January 7, 2017",5,Thank you Timehop Thank you Timehop for listening to your users and fixing those glaring mistakes from your last update. Seeing those comments is a major reason I like to look back at these precious memories!
5016,summertime(:,"January 7, 2017",1,"Worst update ever I hate that I can't see comments on old Facebook posts anymore. That was the best part! I also hate that there's nowhere on the memory to tap that will take you to the source app. Recently I've liked retweeting old tweets that popped up on my timehop, but now there's no way to get to the original tweet on Twitter. So many great features of timehop were just taken away and for what purpose, to look more like Snapchat? Bring back the old version!!"
5017,Christina Kalyuzhnaya,"January 8, 2017",1,Updated Review....including previous thoughts I don't know why they changed how this application worked but I hate it now and have deleted it. 
5018,Kfisher316,"January 11, 2017",3,"Okay app-great to browse through I liked this app prior to the updates, but I get it.. they want to be more like Snapchat how you scroll through. Facebook offers a better review of events that happened in the past, but they do not catch all. I appreciate this app for what it is and will continue to use it for what it is worth. ‚ù§"
5019,price.gaines,"January 15, 2017",1,"Terrible design update I rarely write reviews for apps, but the latest major update was so bad that I feel the need to have my voice heard. There was nothing wrong with the old, vertical-scrolling design. Everything was easy to see. The new design is absolutely horrendous. Please, oh please change it back. Nobody asked for it to be updated. It's awful and I've stopped using it because I literally get headaches trying to navigate through it."
5020,HaTayHa99990,"December 29, 2016",1,"Fix this stupid update This update is a complete waste of time. If thought about deleting the app. I don't like the tap to see each memory, it feels like you put in zero effort in the concept of the actual app. I also hate how I can't see comments or likes on any of the posts. The people the commented are half of the memory. Waste of time. The app was fine before the latest update. I wouldn't even give it a star if I didn't have to."
5021,Shadance89,"December 29, 2016",1,"Sometimes Change Isn't Good... I don't usually write reviews for apps but I felt like I needed to. I absolutely hate the new Timehop. The old setup was so much better and I enjoyed looking at it every day. With the new style, I came very close to just deleting it. That's how awful it is. The pictures are very large and there's no description under the photos. I miss my status updates. It's not worth keeping on my phone. I hope they change it back!"
5022,Bill Barol,"December 29, 2016",1,"Version 4: A giant step backwards I promise you I'm not one of those users who reflexively hates major rethinkings of apps. But there's no world in which the latest update isn't a catastrophic step backwards for the once-fun, simple, and efficient Timehop. The latest version is functionally obscure and aesthetically lousy. It's broken, basically, in a way that's baffling to a longtime user. It no longer makes any sense. Listen to your users, guys: Wipe the lipstick off this pig and roll the app back."
5023,MrsOtten,"December 30, 2016",1,"New Version is Terrible If I were writing a review a month ago, it wouldn't be one star. I loved Timehop. Now I only open it up out of habit. The new version is just terrible. Every photo is zoomed in and blurry. I can no longer read the comments on photos. If I tap the screen, it automatically goes to the next photo, even though I'm technically supposed to ""swipe"". You messed up Timehop folks. Your ratings are an embarrassment. Your app did NOT need an update."
5024,King23232495,"December 31, 2016",1,"New update is not good.... I have quite literally never written a review for an app before, but this new update is so terrible that I felt I needed to chime in. Some of my favorite parts about Timehop were being able to view the comments and captions of my past posts, and now I can't do that. The way that you now have to tap through the memories and the way that the photos are all super zoomed in makes the app unpleasant to use. Please fix this."
5025,mandi cokes,"December 31, 2016",1,"Fix update My favorite part of TimeHop for me is seeing all the old comments and things from the people of my past that are no longer here, but the app no longer allows that. You had a good thing going but with this new update I doubt I'm going to keep the app much longer, there's no fun to it anymore. My old status' were only fun to read when I could see equally as young and naive comments from friends. Please put it back."
5026,Mommy iPhone user,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible update!! This is the most terrible update, I don't know who your focus group was!  I hate that I can only see part of photo because it's so zoomed in.  I can no longer see any past comments, which is half the fun at looking at past posts.  The weird tap through feature is clumsy.  I used to love looking through my memories and reposting and now it is just sort of irritating.  So bummed, wish I could get my old version back."
5027,jenAnne00,"January 2, 2017",1,"Please change back! Please, please change it back. This was one of my favorite apps and now it's really hard to use. Why zoom in on the photos making it hard to see the entire thing at first? Placing my finger on them to zoom out only obstructs the picture. On the framed pic view, the pics are too small to see and I cant zoom on those!! So sad. Really really sad. üôÅ Scrolling down through a timeline made sense. This does not."
5028,CyberSufer1862,"January 2, 2017",1,"HATE the new update - makes it unusable Firstly, a picture or status update without a caption or check-in doesn't make sense at all. Secondly, having every picture zoomed off the screen is ridiculous. I have been using the app for ages, but am going to reluctantly discontinue as I absolutely cannot get used to these changes. Half the info for the day is missing and the photos are over enlarged. I hope these changes are undone asap."
5029,MGoBlue2010,"January 3, 2017",1,"Hate the new UI I'm not usually one to complain about updates since I know change is difficult for people. However, after giving this some time to set in, I still don't like using the app now that I have to tap to advance. It's difficult to see images as they are often zoomed in too far and prefer scrolling down to see my history. This doesn't have to be like a snapstory, play to your own strengths Timehop!"
5030,GoFasTA,"December 24, 2016",1,"New version ruined the experience I love checking Timehop every day, but with the new update I'm going to stop. It's hard to look at actual photos as they are sometimes made into a collage or animation with no way to view and share the individual images. The zooming is an odd choice also. I'm not sure if someone new took over the product direction, but they definitely seemed to choose form over function and ruined the app for me."
5031,GrayGhost49,"December 25, 2016",1,"Not a fan of the new update I really don't like the latest update.  Zoomed pictures actually destroy some memories.  I have a number of Christmas dinner pictures over the years and the new update doesn't show me all the friends around the table and some can't be zoomed out.  Also, seeing a pic and then having to swipe to see the associated FB comment is poor design.  Finally, I liked the continuous vertical scrolling.  Please bring back the old UI."
5032,PokeBallerLuke,"December 26, 2016",1,"Bad This update removes so much of what made timehop good. I can't even see the pictures from a year ago, let alone the captions to these pictures are nowhere to be found. I also have zero idea if I am able to open the twitter app and look at the tweets there anymore. The app now copies the way snapchat stories work. It just doesn't work at all. Please bring back the old format that we all love :( It was so perfect. If it ain't broken, don't fix it."
5033,5rls82,"December 26, 2016",1,"Horrible New Update The new update takes away all of the good features of this app.  Not being able to see the captions on photos or the dates and comments on posts, really weakens the experience.  Also, when there is an album of photos, only being able to see zoomed in pics of three of the items is not useful or memorable.  I don't really see the point of using the app anymore given the new update."
5034,caitygraceee,"December 27, 2016",1,"So completely disappointed I loved Timehop, truly it was  my favorite app. But this update has left me completely disappointed. The new format is not user friendly at all- it struggles to load, then I'm forced to see everything from one year before moving on to the next- you used to be able to view a few pictures and click to open more if you wanted. Not fun anymore, not worth my time, probably deleting."
5035,Timehop Terrance,"December 27, 2016",1,"Hey I have never written a review in my life. I have been a daily user of Timehop for quite some time and this update is the worst possible update I have seen in a while. I understand the need for change and staying current, but I stayed faithful to this app because of its ease and reliability. Please, please change it back. This is a terrible update. I loved being able to go back to my original tweets and Facebook posts. Change that back too."
5036,Taterbug0313,"December 27, 2016",1,"Update? No thanks. I've been using timehop for a few years, and I have to say that I can not stand this update. The zoomed-in pictures are strange, but my least favorite part, the part that I hate with a passion, is that I can't see captions to pictures. I have no idea why I posted a picture of a baby otter drinking out of a bottle. I mean, I do.. it's cute and everything, but I'd really like to see captions again. And comments. Those were the best part of the memories!"
5037,LexieJoLove,"December 28, 2016",1,New Update I do not like that the captions have been removed from the photos. It takes away a part of the memory when there is no memories to read. They become just random photographs instead of memories. I also am not a fan on the new flip-through layout. It makes it more difficult to just look through your memories by having to click through each individual memory.
5038,Msp0712,"December 28, 2016",1,I hate the latest update! Please bring back the list view so we can skip things we dont care to revisit and click into to see more of what we want to. I don't want to have to scroll (or tap) my way through everything this way. 
5039,LeslieK:),"December 28, 2016",1,"What a Mess In attempt to simplify the app, Timehop has made using this app 10x harder. I accidentally click forward and backward trying to zoom in. And features such as seeing comments and likes have been taken away.  Please bring back the ability to click on a link and see the post on the specific social media app. Sometimes I want to see the comments that were listed under it. Everything is just a mess."
5040,Muymuyyamyam,"February 20, 2016",5,"Fantastic for the nostalgic... and incredibly helpful for the memory impaired. I love seeing what I was involved with on Facebook 1, 2, 5 years ago! I only wish there was a way to go and search through past dailies for reference."
5041,Lmomma82,"March 5, 2016",5,"Really great app I check this app every morning and usually 9 times out of 10 it gives me a huge smile to see stuff that was going on a year ago, 3 years ago, etc.  It was a really great idea to make an app like this."
5042,Beamse,"October 13, 2016",3,"Ok but glitchy Main complaint is if i open app but don't pull screen and hold down to refresh after the video, my streak doesn't usually count. I open app EVERY morning and still get at least 1 alert/day that my streak is going to end bc I haven't opened. Yes I have, often more than once. Lost my 160 day streak because of this."
5043,Punkydunky12,"October 30, 2016",5,"Enjoying Time Hop App I'm enjoying the Time Hop app so much since I installed it! It's like opening a few minutes of ""special memories & good times from the past"" everyday. It's fun to sometimes share pics with my family or post them on FB/IG too."
5044,sydmg6797,"December 21, 2016",5,Need to fix ASAP Please fix the glitch where it only shows the first line of every post! SO annoying & debating on deleting the app if it doesn't get fixed. Also shouldn't of taken away retro videos
5045,Amberrrrburger,"December 22, 2016",3,"Needs Some Improvement I love the app, it's great to see my posts from years ago. Unfortunately, lately, with the posts it hasn't been showing the whole thing. It'll show the first sentence of whatever the post is but if it's longer than one sentence, it cuts off. Sounds like a problem, doesn't it? Please fix it (:"

5047,Traxxas141,"December 24, 2016",1,"Horrible update I have had this app for about 2-3 years now, and one of things I liked about it was it showed you what the weather was however many years ago along with things you have posted. That was gone which I can deal with it was still a good app, but now you can't even look at comments and likes on your posts and the picture quality is horrible it showed them really zoomed in. Good job time hopüëçüèª....."
5048,Bhudzietz,"December 24, 2016",1,"Awful Update! I get it, after a while the developer wants to create an update. Fine, but don't remove the best features and make the app WORSE than it was! Timehop used to be incredible but I can't stand this update. Where are the comments/likes from friends? Also like other people I much preferred scrolling through my memories. There's not a single thing I like better about this update so far. Timehop, you failed this one. Time to fix it!!"
5049,zetalady2010,"December 24, 2016",1,"WORST UPDATE EVER. I'm a huge fan of timehop. I LOVED reading all my posts/tweets (when I remembered). I was going to make my New Years Resolution to check it every day for a year. With this new update, I want to uninstall it and never use it again. Let Snapchat do their own thing. I hate the full screen memories, I enjoyed scrolling. You can see likes or comments anymore. You have to zoom pictures out to see them. Like everyone else said, if it ain't broke don't fix it."
5050,Mikedesu,"July 26, 2015",4,Pretty good Alright alright I'll write a review. I've been using Timehop for a bit over a year now and it has been a fun way to look back on my past and not only see what has happened in my life but also how the universe syncs with itself. No other app has allowed me to do this. Thanks!!!
5051,Kwasfloyd,"July 28, 2015",5,"Love I love that I can see things from years ago. Sometimes it gives me things I know aren't true, but that's not a big deal. I have had to reset the app a few times because it won't post to FB. Otherwise. I love it!"
5052,Chewnami,"August 2, 2015",5,Awesomeness This app has brought back so many great memories. Not only does it do its basic function but it's also cute and well designed. The little dinosaur is a great mascot for such an already well made app. Kudos to the team for making it so fun and awesome!
5053,EDLimn,"August 29, 2015",3,"Great, but... I love this app & the whole entire concept. I do not love that the thing doesn't even work. I can see things that I've posted one year ago, but anything older than that ""did not reach 88 mph üò∞"". I'm not even sure as to what the means, but the app is basically useless if I can't see more than half of what I've posted. Please fix this."
5054,MrsToeLivz,"September 25, 2015",2,"Used to love it This app was great! I loved using it and seeing all of my old posts. But the last few months it has not been working well. Most of the pictures say the photos have been deleted and something about politics, when I know the photos still exist. So I barely use this all anymore. What's the point of using the app if it doesn't actually show my older posts."
5055,Fade2black719,"September 28, 2015",5,Great throwbacks everyday hah I've never had any issues with this app and I've been using it for several months.  It's crazy seeing things I posted or were posted on my wall up to 9 years ago when I joined...great app!!
5056,Mad at time hop,"September 28, 2015",5,Fix the problem I have been very disappointed with time hop lately. None of my pictures are showing up!!! I get all excited and then nothing. Everyone is complaining about it!!FIX IT
5057,cat0831,"October 11, 2015",3,Great but... There are always some kinks with this app. It displays for me days ahead (things I know happened tomo this day in history rather than this day in history). I can't add multiple twitters which would be nice seeing as I have more than one. I LOVE being able to reminisce even if it's mostly embarrassing. I like it but I'm starting to not love it lately.
5058,Bcavaz01-,"October 27, 2015",5,Memories I thought were lost now make me smile When I see something from a year ago or several I smile remembering the good times plus my friends enjoy reminiscing the old days before we had priorities :)
5059,Jennymo1213,"November 7, 2015",3,It's Okay This app is just okay.  I would like to option to see the past weeks hops. I like to see the events from the past but I thing a week worth should be available at any given time.  I also feel that it doesn't catch all events from the past. Facebook flash back is giving more lately.
5060,DonnaME1,"May 2, 2015",5,Great app!  FB just created a copy cat of it! Love this app. Love the memories and love that it goes back 5 years (although if sharing a link sometimes they no longer work).  User friendly and only posts what YOU choose to (re)share.
5061,Jill de Ville,"May 18, 2015",4,"I like it but there is a cropping issue Some photos need to be cropped, adjusted or viewable full size and not always are you able to share them because like IG it will only allow so much in their share screen. Some changes need to be made but overall it's fun."
5062,Cani1313,"May 19, 2015",4,"Love it! Just fix the cropping issue! It really makes me happy to see all these old pictures I've forgotten. Just wish when I decide to post one, it would keep the original size or let me fix the pic. Cropping issue causes you to lose people's faces of whatever."
5063,Meghan Patricia,"June 2, 2015",4,Fun but could be better I like Timehop but there's one thing missing. It would be cool if you could also see previous days. Sometimes the app doesn't always update daily and it would be nice to be able to go back and see the days you missed.
5064,lillynwilson,"June 6, 2015",5,Doctor Who references This app makes me happy. It shows me photos and status updates and tweets from the past which is awesome but I think the one reason I haven't gotten bored is the random doctor who references! They just make my day.
5065,tiedyedowl,"June 9, 2015",5,"A Must have For Facebook Users! It's so fun and interesting to see what was going on in your life a year ago and be able to post those things.  I like that it engages all forms of media networks, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and not just Facebook. A must have!"
5066,**clee**,"June 19, 2015",4,"Some things don't show up Sometimes when u click to share, the pic will be blank on your FB. The biggest complaint I have through is if you find a pic you want to reshare, it crops it. So sometimes that takes entire people out of the picture."

5068,Tabbyroserod,"July 5, 2015",5,My favorite app I love being able to look back and see what happen like a year ago or five years ago it's just crazy to think that Timeslips by so fast and it's good to have an app that lets you go back and see
5069,Jeff Grigsby,"July 25, 2015",5,"A daily walk down memory lane! I just love this app. It's now one of my morning rituals and jets me relive some of the great memories I've had with my kids. Yeah, if I want share, sometimes the photos get dropped a little too much, but still a fabulous app!"

5071,Halli Melton,"March 3, 2015",4,"Nearly perfect! I love this app - I'd just like to be able to click a link to open the post in the app it was posted in! That way I could delete, edit, or save the posts instead of just looking at them. Having access to my old stuff would be nice."
5072,Nacilbuper,"March 5, 2015",5,"Probably really good! I haven't used the app for long so I don't have a very studied opinion as to how it could be improved. That said, I love the idea of Timehop so much that I'm willing to honor it with my first App Store review. Let's say 4/5? Great, with probably some room for improvement."
5073,MC923,"March 15, 2015",4,Good App But... I like this app! There's only one issue I have with it! I wish the videos could last longer than 10 seconds! I have to send multiple snaps to my friends when trying to tell them something. Other than that though! It's a thumbs up from me!
5074,krickettbug,"March 18, 2015",4,"Timehop It's pretty awesome seeing what you had to say 5+ years ago. It doesn't seam to go any further back than 5yrs. It also does cut photos off so when you go to re post them that can be annoying. Lastly the dinosaur need a change in boxers, you'll understand if you get the app."
5075,Biggwhammajamma69,"April 12, 2015",5,"Love this app! It's always interesting to look back and see how my life has changed over the years. While it reminds me of some bad times, it also shows me how far along I have come from those bad times."
5076,Marked131,"April 15, 2015",5,Delete option I like the app but hate some of my old posts. They should have the option to delete the embarrassing posts from 5 years ago for you. Great other than that.

5081,TaniaLynn55,"October 31, 2014",1,Latest Update Awful I have a few issues with this app. 1 it doesn't show accurate posts for a given day. It shows posts that were deleted off my page.

5082,GothyKitty,"November 5, 2014",4,"Interesting This is a super fun app. I love getting to see my own ""this day in history"" posts. :) every now and again it gets a little glitchy, but usually within 24 hours it either fixes itself or there is an update released. I check it every day."

5084,Taryn925,"January 22, 2015",5,"Love it I love this app. It's usually one of the first notifications I get in my day. My favorite part is reading the cute things the little dinosaur says at the bottom. Even if I didn't have any posts, the dinosaur makes up for it with a witty comment/phrase."

5086,cooljkaz,"January 29, 2015",5,Memories make me happy :) This is usually the first app I open every single day. I just love browsing the photos from the past years around the same time. I have shared tons of the photos and everyone I know loves this app. Fantastic idea! Thanks
5087,Cuffem74,"January 31, 2015",2,"Bring back full status share It was 5 stars when you could actually share a whole status from years of past. Since loosing my wife two years ago to breast cancer, it's one of the only ways I can remember and share a status with what we done or what ever else. No use in sharing a Facebook status to only be cut short. Bring back the old app or I will delete"
5088,MissRenaC24,"February 11, 2015",4,Love it! Love this app! Only thing about the new update is it doesn't include your caption anymore and you have to share it on multiple sites instead of being able to click which ones you want in one window. Bring back the old way!
5089,Tara922,"February 14, 2015",5,Everyday I look forward to looking at it each day. Especially now that we have a new baby. It's fun to compare the kids with old pics. Plus remind me of all God has done in our lives thru the years.

5094,CodyChurch343,"July 15, 2013",5,Great app! Be patient! I don't think people realize that they might not have posted anything on Social Media 2 years ago. The app works great and brings back great memories. Can't wait until more people start using it and the community grows
5095,HaleyAnn1,"October 28, 2013",5,"Love it Freaking love this app! It's awesome seeing what's still the same or what's different about then and now. Just saw a status I made several years ago about being excited for senior pictures, and right now, I'm almost a senior in college! Very cool!"
5096,Kellie Rowe,"March 28, 2014",5,"Hilarious. This app shows you just how truly annoying you were in high school and how you assumed vague statuses or ones about your everyday life ""work noon-5, then class"" were really crucial for your friends and family to know about."

I looked forward to checking timehop each day and now I rarely bother.  I loved that it even had pics from my camera roll (not things that I posted).  It just brought back little memories and it was just... nice.  Now I can't even click on a picture to enlarge it without it hopping to the next post.  Grr.  Frustrating.
5107,Kr8472847,"March 2, 2017",1,"Deleted after update Timehop used to be my favorite app. I loved scrolling through all of my old memories down to Abe who would keep track of all of my checked days. It was like an accomplishment! Now with the swipe feature I HATE it. As do a lot of your users. I'm not sure why you aren't listening to your consumers, but I've deleted my app and I'm sure I'm not the only one. "
5108,Babygirl022805,"April 10, 2017",1,"Too many issues Everyday I check my time hop. And even after I have checked it, I get a notification that my time hop is ready to view. Then even after I have viewed my time hop, the next day it says my streak has been broken. "
5109,Zoelle5,"September 6, 2017",2,"Ads, Video Crashes, Oh my! I enjoy looking back on pictures and videos from the past, but it is truly sad that the ads, Timehop retro video and animations load, but the videos I want to see (my own) either crash/freeze the app or fail to load. I don't rank it at one star for the sheer fact that I can at least look at postings from various apps in one location."
5110,Rharvey619,"January 7, 2017",4,Much better I'm so happy I'm able to see all the old stuff like comments and likes and the picture is no longer zoomed in. This update fixed all of my concerns and still allows for the newer style of time hop. This update was much better.
5111,HarmonyStar,"January 7, 2017",3,"Thank you Thank you for updating this!!!! Finally the comments are back! However, you still can't see WHO liked something and the pictures are still huge (and now can't be resized to see whole picture). I am hoping these things will also be fixed soon."
5112,kyleüëÖ,"January 7, 2017",5,"Thank you Timehop! The newest update fixed all my greatest concerns! I think the new ""story styled viewing"" works out well now that the captions are back. Thank you for listening to the concerns and comments of your users!"
5113,Cjmasino,"January 8, 2017",4,"The New update Horrible!!!!!! I'll no longer use this app due to the new look of the update. ****UPDATE after the new update it's much better. You can now see the comments again. I do miss the ability to just scroll up and down, so it's back up to 4 star."
5114,Lilbaum,"January 9, 2017",1,"Devastated I had been up to a 200 day streak... this new update is awful :-( if they bring back the old format or a different format I'd consider using it again.  As it is... I don't understand why I want zoomed in pictures... and it's virtually impossible to see photo albums.  Unfortunate.  The latest update is better.... but the original is significantly better, literally can't see one reason this is better than the original :-("
5115,Wtf15742,"January 11, 2017",2,Slightly Better The newest update is a little better than the bomb that was dropped as the last version. Please keep listening to the reviews and bring back the then/now feature! It was my favorite way to show progress over the years. 
5116,Antjeya,"January 18, 2017",5,Terrible Update I used to love Timehop until the recent update! I liked the way it was! Now half the time the pictures and videos won't load!! I'm not impressed at all! Please go back to the way it was!
5117,RedBatman101,"January 22, 2017",1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Come on guys. It was perfect for a long time but u just went and ruined it. I've seen countless complaints about this piece of crap update, and every single one of them tell u to go back and fix it. "
5118,Fun mom of 2,"January 23, 2017",5,Used to love it Latest update is horrible. Go back to the old format. You can't even see the whole picture unless you zoom out. Stop changing things. You're blowing it.
5119,Finally free 29,"January 26, 2017",2,"This app doesn't deserve any stars for their rating. I really dislike the latest update. Pictures are automatically zoomed in. Why? No matter what I do to try to adjust the screen, some of them still are too big and I can't see all of it."
5120,Jaqx89888,"December 28, 2016",1,"THE WORST UPDATE If I could give zero stars I would. Do not update to th dec 26th version. It is awful. You have no control of the pictures, it's this weird swipe right crap, and the images are so zoomed in you can't even see the whole picture- and you can't click anything either. Hell I don't even know what I'm saying but I'm upset because this is my favorite app and I never want to use it because it just makes me angry when I open it. CHANGE IT BACK."
5121,Morgan416,"December 29, 2016",4,Hate the new update This new update is awful. Now when a memory is noted I have to resize the picture to see the whole picture. So annoying. Also the swiping from memory to memory. Ugg. I liked the old way. Bring the old way back.
5122,Artsylydia,"December 30, 2016",1,"Terrible update The auto zoomed in images makes the app non-functional. I have to individually press and hold on each photo to see the full photo? Nope. Super annoying. Most of my photos are square, so now when I open the app I can only see a third of each image. Why??"
5123,BFRO88,"December 30, 2016",1,"new update ruins the app The new update of this app is terrible. I used to love looking at timehop every day but now I'm considering deleting it. The format is annoying and makes it difficult to look at photos, and you can no longer see the captions on photos. It also ruined the fun of the streak - the new update made me lose my streak and now you can't even tell what's different each day. Go back to the old format! Accept your mistake."
5124,Jen*S,"December 30, 2016",1,"Never written a review before I have had time hop for a few years and loved it. This recent update is awful. I read the instructions over and over and no matter what I do, I can not share my posts plus they come up so squashed on my phone it makes no sense. It really makes me sad to see something I enjoyed so much so useless now. I tend to go on fb and get into the ""on this day "" page now instead. Please re think the newest re vamp."
5125,cmp179,"January 1, 2017",1,"Terrible Update!! I often post stuff on Facebook just to see how many likes it can get or to see if it gets any funny/witty comments. The update has taken that away. I also used to like it when I'd see something like, ""December 2014's most liked post,"" or whatever it said. Also gone, apparently. And seriously, zooming in every. single. picture!?!? What on Earth were they thinking? I really hope they change it back soon."
5126,genniel,"January 3, 2017",1,"Horrible update completely ruined the app I came here to write a bad review of the new update only to see that many other people already have, so now I can only hope their attention is grabbed by the amount of disappointed people."
5127,Steffylynn,"January 5, 2017",1,New version is no good :( I absolutely LOVED the old Timehop app. This new version is so much harder to use. Especially the photos that end up in frames- usually they are cutting off half the picture and if there is a way to see the whole picture it's not explained very well. I've tried everything and it will just swipe to the next picture or last picture. The old version was soooooo much better! Please bring it back!!!
5128,Taytaybuffet,"January 5, 2017",1,Update is trash Before the update Timehop singlehandedly used to be my favorite app on my phone. Ever since the update I barely even bother checking it because the new version offers so little to look at. I liked how you could see the conversations between you and others from your old tweets and how you actually knew what context the pictures you posted were in. Please please change back to the old layout.
5129,MrsMommyMarie,"January 6, 2017",1,"Update is not showing all of my photos I have Time Hop installed on 2 separate devices. The old version on my old device still works fine, showing me multiple photos daily. The updated version on my new device has only showed me 1 photo for yesterday and ZERO for today! (According to the old version I should have 8!) I'd like to use this app on the device I actually use daily. Can you please fix this problem! üôÅ"
5130,OKGoGirl,"December 23, 2016",4,"Fun app, new version meh I like Timehop. It's fun seeing what I was up to years ago on the same day. But am I the only one who doesn't care for the new updated version? I don't like not getting to scroll down through everything like before. It felt more organized before."
5131,CA OG,"December 23, 2016",5,fantastic! This app has become part of mine and my girlfriends daily routine. Awaiting the surprises of each day and sharing with one another. Haven't had a single issue out of the app. Works well everyday every time.
5132,Mom2Cs,"December 24, 2016",1,"LOATHE the new update! I LOVED TimeHop before, but this new update is AWFUL!  Pics are blown up too large, and it makes you hold them to zoom out.  The new layout makes it tedious to flip through your pictures, and those that are the same ""flicker"" back and forth between them - annoying."
5133,rgleason87,"December 24, 2016",1,"Seriously? Possibly the worst app update of any app ever. Wow... just wow. Who the hell though this was going to be a good UI? This could be the single worst update to any app in the history of the App Store and I'm only joking a little bit. Talk about destroying any semblance of usability and an enjoyable in app experience. Timehop really needs to rethink this ""overhaul"" if they have any interest in keeping users around. On the bright side it's a 10/10 if your goal was to design an utter piece of unusable garbage. Bravo."
5134,I'm only rating for the game,"December 24, 2016",1,Awful new update The new update is the most unappealing layout. It makes your past posts into a snapchat story like line of tap-able photos. It's difficult to navigate and you can no longer click on the individual posts to see likes or comments. The snapchat story layout is an awful idea. I spend most of my time tapping through other people's stories and this only makes me want to skip timehop altogether
5135,Thisismybigname,"December 25, 2016",1,"Update is TERRIBLE! I SO LOVED TIMEHOP. The update on Dec 23 is TERRIBLE! 10x more clicking and swiping. I just used to love simply scrolling through to get a quick update. Now, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold, swipe, press, hold. << And that's just 10 updates! Not good! So incredibly disappointed. At this point they can't go back, but this was just a disaster..."
5136,AngelGraver,"December 26, 2016",1,"Horrible Update I can't even remember how long I've been using TimeHop.  This newest update is HORRIBLE.  The format is awful.  You can't see full pictures.  Scrolling up and down was much better and allowed easier access and viewing of your social media history.  This new swiping back and forth leaves lots out and is cumbersome.  If this doesn't change back to the old format within a couple of days, I'm deleting the app."
5137,Jaeohh,"December 26, 2016",5,"Usually the best app on my phone, since the update.. not so much Please change the format! Don't get too fancy! It's unnecessary! We want to be nostalgic not hip to the newest trends! Save those updates for snapchat! Bring back my pictures!!"
5138,Nuttyteacher,"December 27, 2016",5,"I agree I agree with the more detailed reviews of recent days. I really dislike the new update. Please return to the old version where we could read comments, see all pics, etc."
5139,Katrina Scaccinoce,"December 27, 2016",1,"Why can't I give this no stars? This by far is the worst update known to man, I am happy that I'm not the only one that thinks this way. Updates are supposed to help improve apps and this just destroyed timehop all together. I don't know what you were thinking with this update , I hope you have already fired the person who had this idea because this is awful. Please just go back to the old version before I hang myself this is awful."
5140,Just Vy,"February 10, 2016",4,"glitchy It was working perfectly fine until the last update. Now it's all glitchy and it freezes whenever I touch it, and the pictures aren't loading. Otherwise the all is great! Please fix the glitch!!"
5141,Wassdia1,"April 29, 2016",5,A fun reminder I love this app. I have only had issues with it once. It was fixed when it updated and my iPad restarted. I love that it reminds you of things that happened years ago. It's a fun app... I hope it stays around.
5142,Traveler8222,"April 30, 2016",1,"TERRIBLE update I have never written a review before but I am so annoyed by this update I had to. I used to look forward to checking my timehop every single day it was a great reminder of past memories. But now I have to see these pictures as tiny and I cant zoom, I cant easily save the photos, and I have to be afraid to open up a video in public because of the sound. This update has ruined the app and not a single good thing was added. FIX THIS."
5143,tylrsmth21,"May 16, 2016",2,"Bad updates Every time I update the app, it won't load for a few days. I reset my phone and the app itself will open but the content doesn't load. It's gotten to the point where I either don't want to update anymore or I'll just use the Facebook version of ""timehop"". This is a popular app that's been around for a long time now. Get it right or stop doing it all together."
5144,Zhgyiersan88,"June 18, 2016",1,"Horrible update This update is awful. The old version was great. On this version, when it brings you right to Facebook to show you the comments on a post (which in and of itself is a horrible feature), it also now shows you the comments of people you've blocked (which it didn't do before). This is super frustrating to me, to the point where I'm likely going to delete timehop if there is no resolution. Mega bummed."
5145,Hetubdrub,"August 28, 2016",5,"Love it I've been slowly using it more and more, trying to keep my day streak going.  At 13 right now :)"
5146,Chris from Washington,"December 10, 2016",5,"Remember what you've forgotten I can't help but love Timehop for surfacing years past. Photos, posts, it works beautifully and sharing most of it is easy. As long as you're okay plugging in your accounts, this app and service is awesome."
5147,Haybos,"December 23, 2016",3,Timehop update I loved looking at timehop each day and reminiscing on years past.  Today I got the app update and was disappointed when I couldn't view the comments on old posts.  That was my favorite part to see the interactions with people I was close to at different periods in life. I hope timehop adds this feature back.
5148,SLBAGA,"December 23, 2016",5,"Please bring back the scroll I do not like the tap feature and the zoomed in pictures. Also, the pictures don't have the captions that went with them. Not fond of this update."
5149,SADennis816,"December 23, 2016",1,"Downdate Not a fan of the update, why would you think we would benefit from not being able to see the full pictures? It's honestly annoying to have to click through each memory (I wasn't in love with that update on snapchat and this is worse). Why can't we see captions on our photos? Why can't I click on my tweet to go into the app and see context? None of these seem like very smart ""updates"" to me."
5150,Slushy926,"August 11, 2015",4,"So Far, GREAT! I love looking back at what I did years ago. Brings back fun memories or reminds me of things or people I miss. Maybe the little characters (heart, thumbs up/down, etc.) could be smaller. Sometimes they cover up too much of a pic, so I end up not using them. Really like this app, though."
5151,rachellerkd,"September 8, 2015",5,Love it! This app is perfect for being able to look back and view your photos and activities.  It creates a fantastic timeline and works as a sort of digital scrapbook. I have not had any issues with it.
5152,Cll1211,"September 16, 2015",4,Almost great I love seeing past post and memories.  My only issues are the videos don't always play and the same when sharing or texting them to family.  Lots and lots of bugs.  Pictures are deleted but you can find hem in FB
5153,baypol,"October 10, 2015",4,Like it Enjoying watching us age before our eyes. Only thing I don't like is not being able to look at the pic again the next day. Realize that keeping them would be difficult but there should be a one day option
5154,Kwerd,"November 12, 2015",5,One of my favorite apps Great app‚ÄºÔ∏è I rarely have zero complaints about an app but I have none about Time Hop. It's awesome to be taken back and see how time has flown by and be reminded about some things I'd forgotten all about. Keep up the great work‚ÄºÔ∏è
5155,@$h!hb,"November 19, 2015",4,"Year ago stuff gone Ever since the update my ""one year ago"" section has been completely empty. I know I used my phone and went on Twitter daily so I'm confused. Tried signing in and out and redownloading the app but still nothing. Good app but I think there's a few bugs"
5156,Kelsie0116,"December 10, 2015",4,"Only one problem Love the concept of TIMEHOP! I check it everyday and I love seeing old memories!!

5157,prttypnt20,"December 20, 2015",1,"Notifications and commenting in-app is no good I loved time hop for he last couple years, but this newest update almost has me ready to delete the app. I don't like the notifications about friends seeing a photo, or letting my friends know when I see a photo they are tagged in. I liked time hop because it was a private walk down memory lane, where I could share something from the past if I wanted to. Now, it's like it's forcing me to. So not great."
5158,HannahLuv,"December 27, 2015",5,Lost Links New update caused my connections to no longer feed to the app. I haven't had any updates since December 22 (date of the last version) although Facebook memories says otherwise...
5159,Jkdubose,"January 5, 2016",5,Good app This app lets you see memories and pictures from this day of the year in past years. Basically the same as Facebook memories but for all your media. Makes me cringe seeing what I once posted.
5160,Thesamboulter,"May 19, 2015",4,Let's do the Timehop Today TimeHop is a pretty cool app. I just wish you could view multiple days at once since some of us don't have time to check our phones everyday. I also wish you could save pictures. That's pretty much it. You'll probably like owning it. I know I do.
5161,Mamaglass2001,"June 2, 2015",4,"Fun App! I enjoy looking at my pictures/posts each day, but I agree with some previous reviewers, it would be nice to be able to access the previous day or 2 in case you missed it. Otherwise, I love the app and the little blurbs at the end of each day."
5162,1120a,"June 2, 2015",5,"Awesome! I use this app every morning! It's soooo awesome to reflect back a year ago..2 years..and 5 years ago! It's shows all the pictures you uploaded, statuses you posted and updates you made to Facebook, it's jus all around the best!"
5163,Annoyed Up To Here,"June 3, 2015",5,Lovely app I enjoy looking at pictures from today in my history. It's really cool to see what I was doing and sending it to my friends is simple as two taps. Additionally the messages at the bottom are really creative and funny
5164,Apeke,"June 6, 2015",3,"Good app, but....... I've been using Timehop for a good year now and just recently noticed when you ""Share"" your memories on facebook, timehop has added framework that crops out text and images!"
5165,Rach307,"July 4, 2015",5,Love this App This is one of my favorite apps!! I love seeing what happened or what I was doing 5 years ago! Perspective and cherish memories sometimes!! It is funny and it gives you other things that happened on this day in history!

For the past (approx) week I cannot see any pictures I have shared or posted. It says ""photo did not reach 88 mph üò®"" it says on cell data and wifi. I don't know what the problem is.

5169,Mrs Captain69,"August 5, 2015",5,Mrs Thank you for this app!!  My family and friends enjoy seeing our memories. I enjoy it more now that my mom passed away six months ago today and this app lets me enjoy seeing and reliving the happy times with my mom and family.
5170,mandalin_d,"March 14, 2015",4,Great app! User friendly! I love the concept of this app. It's a brilliant idea and it's very easy to navigate. Plus the Dino is pretty darn cute. If only the app knew when something really happened instead of just when it was posted which can be really confusing with find and tbt hashtags on Instagram
5171,Bkh223,"March 16, 2015",4,"Fun app but... Great fun to look back at the date. I like the editing features (side by side, add text) before sharing."
5172,CC994,"March 16, 2015",5,Love It!! I am IN LOVE with this app. Seeing my old posts without having to scroll through my entire feed is so great & I'm such a nostalgic I love it!! It's so fun to see what I was doing at this moment last year or two or three years ago. This is fabulous üòç
5173,Onlybeatle4301,"March 17, 2015",5,MadisonsNannie I like Timehop a lot but what I'd like to know is there anyway to change the year. On many occasions a picture comes on TIMEHOP and 
5174,Matt chute,"March 25, 2015",5,"1.1 giga watts! I love this app! Hardly write reviews but this is a great app! Also I love the dinosaur mascot and the random facts.

5175,Scorch07,"April 16, 2015",4,"Simple but fun! It's an amazing simple concept, but it can be so fun to look back and see what you were up to back in the past. The app has its buggy moments, but they are few and far between. Overall it's a well designed experience, and good to have around!"
5176,Saydra,"April 26, 2015",4,"I love this app I absolutely love this app. One of my favorites. I also love sharing the random historical I for you share on a daily basis. For some reason since the update that doesn't share properly. Other than that, the app is awesome. Works well and it's fun to see what I did/posted in the past."
5177,JRocc8,"April 28, 2015",5,Fun App I've really enjoyed Timehop so far - I get a little 'lift' each morning opening it and seeing my past posts & pics. I especially love that I can save the pics to my camera roll. Oh - and I love the lil Timehop dinosaur and his words of wisdom each day - very cute :)

5181,Steve-MA,"September 29, 2014",5,Fun nostalgic app Puts the timeline of your life in perspective and gets you into a reflective mood. Very low maintenance and I love not only to see what I did on a particular day many years ago but also additional throwback historical events that Timehop comes up with.
5182,JamieGail4,"December 11, 2014",5,Really fun! I love seeing the daily time hop!  Brings back memories!!  One thing I wish I could do is delete from the time hop. I have occasionally posted to win something or whatever....is like to be able to edit that out!!  Peace!!
5183,Just Ressie,"January 16, 2015",4,"Memory Lane I love this app because you can see how much you have or have not grown. BUT I just wish there was a way you just view the day before and the current day. I don't always have time to play with my phone, so I tend to miss some days that actually were important to meüòî."
5184,Top notch 1978,"January 23, 2015",5,Absolutely love Timehop I love this app! It's so great to look back on my old posts. I always have a good laugh when reading some of the posts from 1-4 years ago. Timehop is one of the only apps I have that works perfectly all of the time. I absolutely love Timehop!!!!
5185,Monsalmeri,"January 24, 2015",3,"Timehop needs work I love the features that time hop offers however it is frustrating that I cannot go to the actual post on Facebook cans see the comments on it. Often times I remember a funny post from years ago but am missing the interaction with others. Overall a cool concept, it just needs more development!"
5186,Leah Beesmer,"February 2, 2015",4,"Memories I like going back and seeing what I posted. Sometimes I can't remember what made me say the things I did. It's also great with the ""then and now"" to compare how my child has changed. The only downfall is the screen will freeze and I can't scroll through the list."
5187,mykswan,"February 7, 2015",5,Review Incredible. So amazing to see how ridiculous you were years ago and how little things matters back then. Definitely keeps you positive remembering things could be worse as 
5188,EditingPro,"February 7, 2015",4,Video sharing. It may not be a timehop issue but when you share a video to Facebook the video isn't right there on the page you have to click a couple times to get to it and very few people are going to do that.
5189,AlexFZ,"February 8, 2015",5,"Awesome App, look forward to checking it each morning! It's fantastic to see what you posted a year ago. It's ranged from hilarious to mildly depressing, but it's always something that I look forward to each morning!"
5190,Jonathan Quiroz,"May 24, 2013",4,Great nostalgia app. I heard about it through TechFeed and I love it so much. The integration of all the social networks is great. The only problem I'm having is connecting my computer's photos. I installed it on my computer but it's not entirely clear on how to connect it to the app itself. A clearer guide would be great but no problems here.
5191,HannahV21,"February 3, 2014",5,Fun blasts from the past Timehop is a fun way to go back and see what was going on over the years. It's especially fun as I get close to my daughter's birthday... To see how I felt etc before she was born and then to see the pics of her each year.
5192,Brackdady,"April 2, 2014",3,This app needs to be fixed This is a great app and I love it but it always glitches and like freezes and it's annoying when it doesn't work I can never look at my pictures that i have taken through the app and I wish it to be fixed but it's still cool and fun to be able to look back in the pastb
5193,gearing96,"April 9, 2014",5,Other dates I really like this app. It's great to see what you have said in recent years. The only thing I was was there was the ability to go to any date not just that single day. I think that would be a great update!
5194,Br1g1t,"May 3, 2014",5,Awesome App I love this whole idea and concept. I have this synced with my iPhoto and Facebook and love seeing pictures even as far as 5+ years back. So much fun. Just wish I could share them via email or SMS instead of screen shots to share. Otherwise LOVE THIS APP!!
5195,KathyB-inAZ,"June 2, 2014",4,"Love this fun app! It really is like opening a time capsule. It's delightful. My only real beef is that I can only see the day that lines up with today three years ago, four years ago, etc. If I miss opening the app one day, I have to wait a whole year for the day to roll around again."
5196,STEPHANIE H HOLLAND,"July 29, 2014",4,Overall good I like this app but think it could use a couple of upgrades: 1) sometimes I forget to look at my timehop for the day. I would like to see the previous days post. 2) I wish it would show the friends comments that were made on a post.
5197,Pinkdddd,"August 9, 2014",1,"Only Facebook option.. I'm mad because I'd seen my friends using this app and I wanted to try it out, but the only option to sign in was through Facebook. Facebook now owns Instagram so I would only think it made sense to have an option to log in through Instagram. I don't have a Facebook so I have no use currently for this app. Hopefully it adds an Instagram (or even twitter) option soon. I see many other people angry about this as well"
5198,Buggo-ogguB,"September 5, 2014",4,"Love Timehop Absolutely love this app and it's ""blast from the past"" way of sharing old memories that you may have forgot. Like any app it has it's days where it doesn't work properly but it's to be expected. Also love the little dinosaur, he makes for a great giggle, and it's usually right on time!"
5199,Sunflowergirl541,"September 7, 2014",2,"Needs to be fixed This app needs to be fixed. I added the app a few days ago. It started out working great. Now I can't see the pictures and when I click retry nothing happens. I want to see the pictures. I think that is a big part of this app and why people want it. It needs to be fixed, updated, or something to keep people interested and using it. Please fix!"
5200,iAshtastic,"May 21, 2013",3,"Great fun, but suffering stability. The TimeHop app is wonderful, I have such a fun time sending memories to friends. "
5201,Dmoney579,"February 1, 2017",4,"Old version better Don't like this new version. You can do the ""then and now"" comparison anymore and I hate having to click click to go through the memories of the day. Bring back the old version!! I'm about to delete this app."
5202,üë∏Aimee,"February 6, 2017",1,"You still don't get it Timehop, get it together. This is like the fourth update and you have not gotten back to your roots. I want the scrolling down the page, not swiping layout. I want to see what I was talking about, not just the caption. I'm glad you added frames and it's not auto zoomed, but seriously, how wedded are you to this new design that most people clearly hate? I'm deleting again. I hope you start listening harder to your patrons."
5203,Royicepoo07,"February 7, 2017",1,"Better before The last update made Timehop harder to use. You can't share your past videos, not all of your past posts will show up, the captions for your pictures don't always show up, and neither do all of the comments from past posts. The new viewing layout leaves something to be desired, scrolling down was much more convenient. Hopefully, these problems will be fixed."
5204,dmc1418,"February 21, 2017",1,"Horrible Update! I've used Timehop for years, but this new update makes me barely want to open the app. The format cuts out all information except for a picture. No seeing the rest of an article you shared to reread, no dates, nothing. Please bring back the old format."
5205,Yo lax bro,"March 9, 2017",3,"Please Fix ""Broken"" Message I agree with people that the idea is great and I generally like the app but it is a little buggy. The one thing that I hope y'all change is when I deleted my twitter account, it tells me every single day that there was an error in my twitter account connection and I can't change it."
5206,Marjgol,"March 16, 2017",2,Don't like new update You can't share all pics now some of them randomly flash together as one and I'm not able to share and if you posted a major album you have to click through every single picture rather than have the ability to go into an album. If the next update doesn't fix this I might be done with Timehop.
5207,Bassador2,"March 31, 2017",1,"New update stinks I have loved using Timehop for the last few years, but this new update is awful. The formatting is bad, you have to scroll through each item to get to the next, and it won't let me share anymore! I have tried deleting my accounts and re-adding them, but it's still not working. I don't think it's worth it to have an app access everything on my phone if it won't work correctly"
5208,Frankthefourth,"April 10, 2017",1,You need to get it together... At first I absolutely loved timehop.  Now...not so much.  It's not only obnoxious that adds are everywhere.... but now it constantly says my streak has ended...and I can watch a video to keep my streak...*I open this app at least twice a day* no matter how many times I open it is still says my streak is lost.   Get it together guys...I am seriously contemplating if I should just delete this app.  You guys lost your way.....
5209,Kaitlyn155,"June 21, 2017",5,Love I absolutely love the way I can look back on my memories. I am over a year on checking everyday. I love seeing how big my daughter was last year it makes me so excited to see what she'll be like next year.
5210,Sondurrahh09,"January 12, 2017",1,"Was great until the update Timehop used to be one of my favorite apps to check out daily, but their update has made me more annoyed than nostalgic. I can't read the captions on any of the photo posts, nor can I access the comments from those posts. It's frustrating, really because I truly did love this app, but now I can't even bare to deal with it. This is coming from a person who had a 250 day streak on the app. Disappointed."
5211,KSU-Catbacker,"January 15, 2017",5,"Bring back the old Timehop!! I love the concept of reminiscing over old photos and Facebook posts, but this new update has caused more headache than happiness.  PLEASE rewrite this app, or go back to what you had before.  I'm on the verge of uninstalling."
5212,Peaceupdfal,"January 16, 2017",4,"Appreciate that Timehop listens to feedback I'm not as big a fan of the new layout (this will just take getting used to). However, I appreciate that Timehop listens to customer feedback, and has worked out mostof the technical issues from the previous update."
5213,StrengthKG,"January 16, 2017",5,New Update Not a fan of the new changes...I really liked the big picture view and not having to click through...do not enjoy the new set up...not sure if I will keep it...
5214,Rookie1867,"January 16, 2017",1,"Latest update The latest update was supposed to address issues from the update before that... I don't see any difference.... I don't like the tap through memories, don't like the zoom, don't like the share, really miss ""then & now"" ... we can't share videos.. and I feel like it has filtered out a lot ... also I guess when there's a memory of multiple photos it is a slideshow that you can do nothing with ?! Pointless..."
5215,ms.peace,"January 17, 2017",5,Last update Still after the last update the pictures are zoomed in and when i try to zoom out and then let go it zooms back in.
5216,John Dem,"January 20, 2017",1,Not loading For a week straight my timehop hasn't loaded.  Tells me I have new photos but never loads them.  I tried deleting the app then rebooting my phone then redownloading it and still get the same stupid ooops message to try again.  Whatever update you did really screwed up this time.  Fix it soon cause later I'm just deleting it and finding another app.  And also like someone else said the new format is awful.
5217,BarryHappy,"January 26, 2017",1,"What happened? I used to love Timehop, mostly because Facebook hates me and I am the only human who doesn't have memories. So now Timehop has disconnected from Facebook and on one of the most important days of my life I couldn't go back and read all the sweet notes people left on my status. "
5218,brandon lev,"January 31, 2017",1,Go Back!!! Before with the app if you have multiple photos on the same day it would allow you to view them individually and share if you want. Now if there are multiple photos it bounces between them at a rate that makes it nauseating to look at and there is no share ability. What's the point of looking at memories of you can't see them or share them with those who shared the memory?
5219,SportDGurl,"February 1, 2017",1,"What happened? I've been waiting for the app to get fixed- the photos don't fit on my screen, even when I zoom out it won't stay. Everyone obviously hates this ""update"" as it has a 1 star rating, we would all give 0 stars if possible.  We don't want to tap through everything, we want to scroll through like we used to. Also, you can't share stuff easily.  Or at all. I have an iPhone 6, for reference."
5220,HoneyBee82,"January 3, 2017",1,"HATE this update! I'm just going to say what everyone else has said. This update is terrible. Please go back to the old version. I hate that I can't see comments from my old Facebook posts anymore. Now everything seems out of context. Also, if I posted more than one picture I can't share just ONE of those pictures. But that was actually always a problem. PLEASE go back or I probably won't use it for much longer."
5221,Turnemal,"January 4, 2017",1,"Just awful Everyone's already said it: I never leave reviews but this new Timehop is awful. I'm deleting the app and just using the version I can get from FB. This is completely unusable. How did this get through any sort of testing and actually have people saying ""yeah this is great people will love it!""?!? It's also sad that as of the update literally every review is bad and there's still been no changes made by timehop. Well, I'm done with the app"
5222,dylandmk,"January 4, 2017",1,"Awful what happened? Before this update Timehop, was wonderful it was perfect. Checking it everyday seeing what I tweeted, posted on Facebook, etc. for the last 6-7 years, was hilarious and fun. But this new update has made it painful to want to see. It is unusable; when will people understand not to fix something that isn't broken. Well congratulations you broke it, I'll be deleting the app soon hopefully they go back to what it was."
5223,Woooooowoo,"January 6, 2017",5,The new update is horrible I loved the old timehop but this new update is terrible. I am only writing this review because I feel so strongly and would like the change back to the old style. Pleeeeeease bring it back!
5224,Dgolla,"January 7, 2017",2,"Better the way it was before I really don't like how they made the update because you can't see the texts on the pictures you posted and a lot are zoomed in so much you can't see. They need to stop trying to be like other social media and work with what's the best format for this app, which shouldn't be like Snapchat. Hate this update thinking of deleting this app"
5225,Laurenm1011,"January 7, 2017",5,Happy with the latest update Love the newest update so much better than the last one!! Finally able to look at my Timehop again without getting frustrated.
5226,Jaylenlea,"January 7, 2017",1,"Used to be better Since the updates it will not show the captions of pictures, no matter if they had been posted on Instagram, Facebook or twitter. So that is pretty much useless. Now it's also cutting off the end of my statuses. If I want to see the full status I posted, I have to click share, and then it'll come up and I can read it in the share box. And every picture is zoomed in now, which is also dumb."
5227,OHSTATEMOM,"January 8, 2017",1,Bring back the old version I used to start everyday with Timehop. I looked forward to it. The new version is so awful that I want to delete it. I am now using Facebook memories instead. I loved the old version. Please bring it back. I want to scroll through my pictures not tap. That's a snapchat feature and shouldn't be in this app. Please offer both versions for your long time fans or you will lose lots of us.
5228,Mandapanda1105,"January 8, 2017",1,"Enough with swiping through every page!! I used to look forward to timehop but even with this update, I cant stand to look through it. I was hoping that they would have listened to everyones complaints. It is still the most inconvenient ""update"" I've seen. Facebook's ""on this day"" is much more user friendly and I'd rather spend my time there. Maybe timehop should take a hint if they're still getting crap reviews."
5229,hollyberry612,"January 9, 2017",2,Do NOT Like the New Update The new update is confusing and hard to use. It takes a long time to load my time hops and i want to be able to click the link so i can view the post on twitter or instagram but with this update i can't do that. i like the idea of time hop i just wish it worked better because i'm deleting this app right away.. it's not worth my time
5230,its_me_emali,"December 29, 2016",5,"üôÑ I totally USED TO love this app. Now it's just crap. Who wants to see a your pics zoomed in, and not be able to see what people said on them? I don't get why you would change it from the old format to this nonsense."
5231,macmillannn,"December 29, 2016",1,"Hate The Update I used to love using Timehop every day because I could easily scroll through all past activity quickly and see content from different platforms at once. The new update has killed all of that. It is ugly, hard to use, and gives less information than the original. What's the point? It seems like the designers have prioritized aesthetics over functionality. Please revert to the old format!!"
5232,aehall26,"December 30, 2016",4,"Unnecessary update I did try to give this new update a fair shot but find the new format to be too terrible to use. I have stopped using the app since the update. I miss the captions, comments, etc. and the zooming out is uneven dart and annoying. This app is no longer enjoyable."
5233,Rhonda bruhin,"December 30, 2016",4,Worse update This is the worst update that I've ever had I like this app but it is no good now you cannot get it to go to Facebook and I do not like that you need to fix this problem now we're trying to get it to go to Facebook and it will not go thank you
5234,LZ375,"December 30, 2016",1,"Update is not user friendly The latest update to time hop makes the app far more difficult to use. I have used the app for a long time and prefer it to the memories feature on Facebook. However, it is joe more difficult to use. Please put memories back on the same page with a share button by each, the swiping to different memories and swiping to share, etc. is not user friendly."
5235,Lcsb,"December 30, 2016",1,"New update awful Timehop isn't the same thing as Snapchat or Instagram stories, so why make the tap through structure? It was easier to scroll and see your whole picture at once. Also, where is the then and now feature? I had the old version this morning and when I updated this afternoon, some of the pictures I had this morning weren't showing up. Are you picking and choosing what it pulls in? Bad new UI."
5236,Laurenmgt17,"December 31, 2016",1,"Terrible new update I have stopped using the app after this most recent update. It doesn't allow me to share the photos I want, it skips through multiple photos quickly, and is a terrible change from the way it was. Please go back to the way it was, or at least create an update that allows us to quickly and fully see and share all of our photos. This is so disappointing."
5237,Djp061977,"January 1, 2017",1,"New update needs to be reworked I have never written an app review, but this latest update is so thoughtless, careless and useless that I hope that if enough of your users provide feedback you will be wise enough to provide an app enhancement that actually works effectively. "
5238,Rosefromthegrave,"January 1, 2017",1,"Ease of access gone This new update has completely ravaged the app. It's no longer easy to use, nor fun. What was a cohesive timeline now is a jumble of too large, disjointed posted that you have to resize to see and it disconnects from the entire experience that once was Timehop. "
5239,Sarah F. T.,"January 3, 2017",1,"Terrible ""update"" 1. Not user friendly anymore"
5240,Ten497,"December 26, 2016",1,"You ruined our family tradition My daughters and I have enjoyed looking t a Timehop every morning for the last 226 days until now. The update is horrible. Can't even see the entire photo and you can't read the old comments etc. Horrendous!   Now, will the developers do the right thing and bring back the old features that SO many people loved? I have recommended this app to a TON of people but can't do that any longer."
5241,Diamarvas,"December 27, 2016",1,"Dislike the new update I've had the app for a long time and this new update is definitely not good at all. It is hard to see multiple pictures from a post, cannot make it zoom in. Also, can't find the likes or comments on my posts...and it would be great if I could add a comment on an old post in Facebook. "
5242,Kes318,"December 27, 2016",1,"No good I love timehop! I check it daily and tell people about what I see almost daily!  But the new update is no good. It is not easy to see the photos, having to zoom out all the time. There's no way to see old comments, which I love. My videos won't load. And sometimes a couple of photos flip back and forth continuously so that you can't really see either one. Please just go back to the old format. I loved the old format so much."
5243,D from the 559,"December 27, 2016",1,"No longer a fan Not a fan of the new update. I miss having all the different frame and filter options for posting, the new update also doesn't show photos with past Facebook updates just text so it's hard to remember exactly what it was. Replaying videos is now very buggy. On top of that I really don't like how they keep coming up the street and the little Easter egg endings. It'd be better to go back to the old way."
5244,jhdemicco,"December 27, 2016",1,"Go Back To The Old Version! I wasn't going to rate this one star since I love the app concept so much. However, after reading the public message on their Facebook page that we need to get used to the new format I feel like I need to add my one star vote. This app made me want to take more photos because I knew I would see them every year. I'll stick with it for a bit longer but at a certain point I'll need to find an alternative."
5245,erinmariec1,"December 27, 2016",1,"New update ruined it The newest update is absolutely awful. It has made the app practically useless. It now zooms so far in on pictures that you can't tell what they are, and it won't let you zoom out all the way. They've tried to be like the new snapchat stories where you click through one at a time, but it glitches and freezes so much that it's almost impossible to get through everything."
5246,Melloochelloo,"December 28, 2016",1,"What an awful update This update is a joke. Is there another app that does the same sort of thing? Because I'll gladly switch. Not being able to see comments on fb posts make this useless for ""memories"" This app needs to go back to scrolling through the years and the ability to click on things and explore them. By the looks of it everyone agrees. I'll be deleting if it's not fixed soon"
5247,Unhappyyyyy.,"December 29, 2016",1,"YOU GUESSED IT: TERRIBLE UPDATE Wow, where do I begin? I use this app RELIGIOUSLY. This is really one of my favorite apps, or at least it used to be. Timehop, why did you do this? Why would you punish us like this? Have we not been loyal users? I am so tired. You have really let me down. The tapping thing is dreadful, honestly. Y'all wanna be snapchat so bad. The layout clunky and ugly. It doesn't even link me to the tweet anymore. I'm disappointed and frankly, hurt. Please change it back to how it looked before. PLEASE."
5248,Huska12,"December 29, 2016",1,"The new update has ruined Timehop I don't review products that often, time hop that's really messed up this update. They probably wanted their product to look more like Snapchat to make it seem more popular. However, The new update makes it practically unusable and not user friendly. You have to scroll through three or four pages of ads before you get to any of your content. This update made the app much worse."
5249,Sbdb18171,"December 29, 2016",5,"New version Newest version is the worst. I hate being forced to tap thru every single memory likes its a snapchat story, especially when they're automatically zoomed in. Awful. Just awful, timehop."
5250,Courttney Renee.,"December 18, 2016",5,"I love timehop but With this current update it only shows the first few words of all my posts unless you switch to twitter and then back to timehop, and I was at 156 day streak and it reset it to day 1! üò°  "
5251,Knex168,"December 22, 2016",1,"Love the app, hate the update This app was always great and fun every day but then this new update came. Timehop is now annoying to navigate and makes it more difficult to see your photos. I am not impressed and I hope they go back to how it used to be. Like who thought it was a good idea to show your picture zoomed in and then make the user tap to zoom out? Like common timehop, do some focus groups next time you release an update this big."
5252,MommaMer,"December 23, 2016",1,"New updated version is terrible I liked seeing the captions right under the photos, and easily being able to read the ensuing conversations about the photos. Now, it's too busy- too much to have to remember in order to see the memories: swipe this way and that and hold and press for this. Who has time for all that? I wish apps would stop making things ""better"" when they rarely accomplish it."
5253,Bhcate,"December 23, 2016",1,"The newest update is god awful. I've had this app for over a year, and have always really liked it, but the update that came out today is very disappointing. I liked the scrolling of the previous version. Having each memory on individual pages feels like I'm yelling at myself from the past. Also, gone are the comments/likes from my friends, which frankly were my favorite part. Not a fan. Not at all."
5254,Saric,"December 24, 2016",1,"5 stars to 1 star Used to be great. For people with large photo libraries or people who use their phone for work photos you now have tap a bazillion times to get through to the good photos whereas you used to be able to scroll quickly past the uninteresting ones. Unless you keep a manicured photo library, this app is now useless. It would be just as fast to navigate through the photos app to this day in history."
5255,Juggalox,"December 25, 2016",1,"Bad update Most of your customers use Facebook. Therefore, we do not use features like Snapchat and Instagram for swiping and moving. That is why you have so many bad reviews right now. We just want to scroll up and down to see our pictures from years ago. It is incredibly hard to share and very unintuitive. Try to update since it was debuted and it's just horrible. Fix it or we're all going to remove it."
5256,Lindsalah,"December 25, 2016",1,"So not a fan of this update I am not sure why the developers thought I wanted to click through every single picture in an album from a year ago or wanted to see every picture zoomed in on only half of the photo. I want to be able to scroll through as I once did, but at the very least, only zoom in when necessary or wanted. This update is horrid. I love this app but I will delete it if it stays this way."
5257,Mrs. Lusk,"December 25, 2016",1,"Why fix something that isn't broken? You had a good thing going on, Timehop. Until a couple of days ago. This new update ruins it for me. The swiping and zooming out to see the photo. Then only seeing thumbnails of other photos and not being able to scroll through albums or read comments. What a let down. Time to move on from Timehop and just stick with Facebook's ""on this day"" feature instead. üôÑ"
5258,Nwteacher74,"December 26, 2016",2,Recent update on app I am a daily user of the app but I have to say the most recent update isn't very good. It makes looking at your memories clunky. Having to swipe to the right to see the events for this day rather than just scrolling up and down with everything attached makes the sequence of events choppy and hard to read. Could we just reverse this update?
5259,Mmechristelle,"December 26, 2016",2,"Please bring back captions Timehop is my favorite app, but the new update took away some of the features that made it great. Most of them have been mentioned plenty on these reviews, but the one I care the most about is the captions. The captions written to go with the photos are just as important as the photos themselves! It's how you get the story to go with the picture. Please fix it!"
5260,Jesuslovesufaeva,"April 30, 2016",1,"Video feature in the app as bad as the 80's ""New Coke"" Remember the fear that accompanied opening someone's MySpace profile in 2001? That's what the new feature in TimeHop is like. One minute you're taking a stroll down memory lane before you get out of bed in the morning, the next your husband's waking up angry because your phone just started blasting some weird Owl City music. Looks to me like TimeHop hired the same creative team and Coca Cola in the 80s...hint: learn from the mistakes of others."
5261,2sams,"May 1, 2016",2,"Guess I'm not alone... The new update stinks!! Even if my phone is muted, the video blares music outrageously loud - not cool. Losing the posts I am tagged in is not cool either. I used to depend on you for ALL my FB history. Not being able to save photos? Not cool, you were the reason I started deleted photos off my phone - because I knew you would let me copy the again. Guess I'll have to find another app..."
5262,roeiboot,"May 15, 2016",4,could be 5 however the Timehop team is not responding to tweets anymore. why can we no longer zoom in and save photos? another good feature would be to be able to copy the description of past posts.
5263,Liberty2004,"June 6, 2016",3,"Going downhill... I've always thought timehop was the coolest thing!  I have posted directly from timehop countless times!  And occasionally I save old pictures that timehop shows me.  I won't anymore though, because timehop has their stamp all over it now!!  I guess they think they own all my pictures now.  Really wish they'd fix this..."
5264,Sarahbp1101,"June 12, 2016",3,"New update horrible I'm only writing this in hopes that Timehop sees it. It says I'm connected to Instagram, but it is not showing Instagram memories. Only Facebook. And when you see there is a comment on the Facebook post and you click it to read it, it tried opening FB separately. I really love opening Timehop every morning, so please fix this!"
5265,WoahXohno,"June 18, 2016",1,"This app is joining the rest of the money hungry pigs... They have implemented placed advertisements in your time feed now. It's horrible. The ads don't load properly, they will freeze your phone, and it's annoying! TimeHop used to be one of those great apps that I could use and not worry about stupid annoying ads popping up every 10 seconds. Now, they've joined the rest of the money hungry applications out there. "
5266,Brim 2241987,"July 29, 2016",5,Please fix this problem Love the app. But a little disappointed cause it wont load when I press the icon. I'm on a good streak and afraid it will reset if I can't open it tonight.

I check Timehop everyday and it took me Forever to learn that you had to scroll all the way down to even get the day to register on your streak (opening it should count, and it should be at the top), and then I lose my longest 22 day streak just like that. Not fair."
5268,Jodawg08,"October 30, 2016",3,This just started Okay so I love this app it's nice to see what I posted in the past but here recently it's been messing up and I don't know if it's the app or my phone but it seems like everytime I unlock my phone Timehop opens up automatically even though I didn't touch it and it wasnt in the background. Am I the only one experiencing this?
5269,ChelseaF093,"December 17, 2016",1,"What is with this new version? Worked pretty well for a long time. The last two updates has slowly made this a useless app. Only half of the status updates/tweets load (as in half of the sentence) and I lost my day streak. It keeps setting it back to day 1. I mean this is probably the most ""cutesy"" app I have and isn't the biggest deal, but I think we all enjoyed getting to see previous statuses, and this just made it terrible."
5270,Mwoot,"November 11, 2015",1,"Disappointed I still enjoy the look back at previous pictures. Though my main use for time hop was to share pictures but the new square cropping and the inability to share photos makes it far less interesting. I don't care to comment on a picture, I can go back and do that through other apps.... I hope there are changes soon as it will feel pointless for me to continue with this app."
5271,AllieAmazing123,"November 15, 2015",1,"I'm Sad I'm sad because a year ago today I went to a really cool concert, and I know I was tweeting like a mad man, and now I'm sad because I can't relive those tweet or those moments because for some reason timehop isn't giving me any of my tweets even though I'm connected. I used to love timehop but I'm very sad and disappointed. Please fix this. Soon. I don't want to have to wait a whole other year to be able to read my tweets and laugh at what happened today."
5272,Bobbi926,"November 27, 2015",4,"Awesome idea! Love the app!  Such nostalgia when looking at posts from previous years.  Agree w other commenters that it would be perfect if it didn't fail to list all posts from previous years, and if it also allowed looking at multiple days."
5273,Volkta,"December 21, 2015",5,Brings a smile everyday I love getting to see my photos and videos everyday. It's one of the first things I do every morning. It brings a smile to my face to see how my children grow and change from year to year.
5274,Chelles27,"January 2, 2016",4,I love time hop It gives me something fun to look forward too each day. Sometimes the past picture make me say ugh because of certain things in the past but overall it has helped me become closer to my old friends.
5275,Absolutely awfullll,"January 26, 2016",1,"Doesn't work I've had this app before- and it used to work great! I don't remember why I deleted it, but I just re-installed it, and even tried the newest update... And it doesn't give me anything. It says I have no memories & it's connected to my phone & Facebook & I'm very active on Facebook. I'm just curious as to why? Anyway, it's not working for me and I'm not sure if others have this issue- but I wouldn't recommend this application at this point."
5276,leaveluck2heven,"February 6, 2016",5,"Fun app It's a lot of fun to see what you did years ago. App works great, runs smooth. No bugs. Loading isn't slow. Only thing missing IMO is the option to search for specific dates. But I guess that's part of the fun."
5277,Shura123,"February 14, 2016",5,"Great... But small issue.. I love the app so much and ive never had a problem but recently, I have been getting on but it hasnt been showing me my pictures from Dropbox. I dont know if its just me or if the app has a bug."
5278,Hslzojen,"March 22, 2016",2,"Inappropriate things added I love the app and I love looking back at my posts, but recently they have been putting EXTREMELY inappropriate titles to my posts (f-bombs) and have been not family friendly with their captions. I will be switching to the Facebook ""on this day"" if this isn't changed with an update soon. I want to see my fun old posts, not be blasted with profanity. Very disappointing and disturbing."
5279,Kindle_Obsessed,"April 27, 2016",4,"And you broke it Now it just crashes upon opening with the latest update. Also, please bring back badge app icons. I choice to go back to previous days would be awesome as well for those days when it crashes and I miss my memories. Thanks!"
5280,BionicSocialite,"July 4, 2015",5,"Love this app! Facebook has tried to steal memories from TimeHop but I love this app. I think the more personal thing for me is how many photos it has found that I lost on old phones because I didn't back them up (dumb, I know). Great tool - love it!"
5281,kma_FL,"July 9, 2015",4,"Good app for reminiscing I wish you were able to save images to your phone without ""1 year ago"" etc. and ""Timehop"" banner across the top. Of course a screeenshot can eliminate this issue but they aren't as good of quality. Other than that I love the app, great for remembering the 'good ole days' and all that jazz."
5282,Kmmartin29,"July 25, 2015",5,Memories I love this app because it takes you back to things you had forgotten about. I also hate it for that reason :( but it definitely does show you how much you've grown and learned :)
5283,imacraftnut,"July 27, 2015",5,"It's a lot of fun! I wish the pictures wouldn't get smaller.  I wish the captions went with them too.  When I forget to look one day, it's lost until next year.  A fun app that I enjoy going down memory lane in my life!"
5284,wreak13havok,"August 2, 2015",3,"No Pics to Remember I like this app and check it daily but lately most, and by most I mean 90%, of the photos will not load and display, ""Photo did not reach 88mph"" (clever, by the way üòä).  It's too bad when I can the caption and know what the picture probably is but can't see it! Anyone else have this problem? Please fix it!"
5285,SoldierGirl0910,"August 3, 2015",5,"I love this app! This app allows me to see memories from the past that I forgot I had posted, it's great to see them and share them. Especially when they are about my kids and seeing how much they have grown."
5286,BowersFamily22,"August 31, 2015",4,Good Memory Lane Trip I really enjoy this app as it takes you back down memory lane. It's always good to look at what you did or how your child has grown over the time period. I think this app allows me to take a sweet stroll down memory lane without having to do much but click the app.
5287,Khmama,"September 7, 2015",5,Awesome. Fun. Great App. Fabulous app. So much fun looking back at all the post from your various social media accounts. Would highly recommend to anyone. Especially like the option to save the photo as a standard photo in your phone.
5288,Nennny,"September 10, 2015",4,Fun to look back It's a fun app and I like that it works over a couple different apps. But I can't stand the square cropping on the everything! It ends up cropping g out important parts of the picture. I end up going into Facebook and using their looking back feature to post.
5289,Insta#girl21,"September 16, 2015",4,"Fun app, but .... There are an improvement I'd like to see in this fun app:"
5290,Playne Insayne Jayne,"May 11, 2015",5,Time flies It's always amazing to see things come up that seem like they just happened yesterday. I like being able to see how some things have changed and how some haven't. I enjoy this app.
5291,Ojus89,"May 22, 2015",5,"Daily delight One of the few apps I use every day. If you have been using social media the last few years, you find a bunch of gems that are really fun to repost and share with friends"
5292,Shawn-A-than,"June 2, 2015",4,"Decent It's a fun app but I mean it's not really needed like you'll be fine without it, it can sometimes make you sad which is why I give it four stars it brings back memories some you want some you don't if you have a traumatic social media past its best to stay away."
5293,Callamoo,"June 3, 2015",4,"Great app! I like the app in pretty much every aspect, EXCEPT, if you have several photos, but don't want to post all, you'd be able to pick & choose what you want to post to ONE post, instead of individually. I know you can post all photos at once, but sometimes I don't want to do that."
5294,Leoryck,"June 4, 2015",5,So much fun I linked to all apps possible and I love looking back and sharing pics of my kids. It's a great way to look back a wonderful memories and see how things have either stayed the same or changed.
5295,Angie92288,"June 11, 2015",4,"Great but where's the caption? I love this app! My only complaint is that there isn't an option to include the caption on a picture in the share. A lot of the time the caption is a big part of why I'm wanting to share it, and it not being included forces me to take a screenshot instead."
5296,tdg119,"June 15, 2015",4,Love it! I love this app; I enjoy checking it in the morning and reflecting on things.  My only complaint with the app is that it won't let you share pictures at their original size; it often cuts them off and won't allow you to resize them.
5297,Cm3ggles,"June 16, 2015",5,"Fun app Easy to use, well laid out. I thought the daily reminders would be annoying but they're actually pretty fun (and easy to ignore). Sometimes it takes a while to load but not too bad"
5298,Puchey,"June 26, 2015",5,"Love this app! This app is amazing! It shows me what I was saying, doing, or thinking years ago. Sometimes it's a great reminder of past times and sometimes it's a great reminder of how far you've gotten and to not look back."
5299,maineshopgirl,"June 27, 2015",4,"Fun Generally a good app. I love the ""then and now"" feature. I could do without the new frames. They're big and kind of goofy. God thing they're optional. The only thing I don't like is it seems to show FB profile photo changes as a memory. Most times, for me, they're not a photo taken that day."
5300,Ryan Pflederer,"February 8, 2015",3,"ZIMEZONES! Okay, I really like timehop. Why wouldn't you? It's an app that shows you what you post several years back...that's pretty simple and neat. One issue...why have your developers not figured out how to make your app take into account time zones, and what the heck time zone is it on?! It's 2am CST...still yesterday's feeds. I figured it'd be California time...but apparently not. Time zones please :)"
5301,NWisser,"February 12, 2015",5,"Love it, but I love this. Seeing my posts from the same day in other years is fun, informative, and sometimes useful. Lately on my iPad, it's not scrolling like it used to, but I'm sure they'll straighten that out.  Recommend this app highly!"
5302,stephmarie.,"February 12, 2015",1,"No updates have fixed this problem When I scroll through my daily Timehop, I cannot scroll down. I have to scroll up, then down. The app will not let me scroll down. It's as though it freezes. This problem has been consistent through at least 2 updates. I used to love this app, but it's been difficult to want to keep it lately. Please spend a week or more fixing all of these glitches!!!!"
5303,Jennifermj,"February 20, 2015",5,Taking it back! I love love love this app! I can't wait until 8:00 am everyday to see my new posts! It's so cool & exciting to see how I was feeling or what I was doing a year...& years to the date it is!!! It by far is probably my favorite app that I have. :)
5304,Jmboucher1,"March 20, 2015",5,"TimeHope Review I absolutely love this app. It brings you back through many years of your past and allows you to see what you were doing on that day, which is cool. It also brings back so many memories :)"
5305,Mtgcandy,"April 12, 2015",5,Love this app It is user friendly and easy to maneuver through. I like the way I can share my past on multiple social media sites and remember what I was doing at the same moment years ago!
5306,SeattleFTW,"April 26, 2015",5,"Simple and fantastic As a parent, I really enjoy the use of this app as a daily reminder of the growth of my children. Very easy to see pictures and updates from years past to remind you of memories."
5307,All names are taken22,"April 26, 2015",4,Thanks for the memories I really like this app. It's given me a great snapshot of where I've been and it's fun to share past moments again. My one wish is that it would let me post several photos at once when they come up on the same day ( as opposed to then and now).
5308,MCEMommy,"May 5, 2015",4,Almost there Love this app. It would be great to see if you could see if there are comments and your replies to what was posted. Aside from that suggestions it's fun to see where you were this time in the past on the web. Almost like a peek into a virtual public diary.
5309,SincerelyAmanda,"May 8, 2015",5,For Your Inner Historian The historian in me adores this app. It's amazing how a little blast from our personal past can be like opening a new letter or gift in the mail. Now if only the archives of any date could be accessed when you so choose...
5310,AlishaAimee,"November 11, 2014",5,"Amazing! I love being able to look at old memories and Timehop does it day by day. I always said I wished Twitter would make an option to go back to any date you wanted and go through tweets. Love this app, it was a wonderful idea."
5311,Super p knows best,"November 13, 2014",1,"Only Facebook?!? I recently got fed up with info sharing through facebook, so I deleted mine. Then come to find out, you MUST have a Facebook to use this app.. I still have IG and I liked being notified about my iPhone pictures. The creepy thing is... I still get notified about FB pictures from timehop(my FB was 'deactivated' and I am 'signed out' of timehop). I will also be contacting FB... Please fix this issue. I want to keep this app, but will delete if it still requires FB"
5312,MuzikMan4,"December 26, 2014",4,Awesome except...... Every day I look at my time hop. I can not wait to see what memories will be one there. As of late I have been having a lot of good ones but when I go to post them the pictures are not coming up on Facebook or Twitter. I hope that this can be fixed soon.
5313,purradox14,"January 1, 2015",5,It's great but Does it go by the day or date because it seems to be a day off. My Christmas stuff came up on the day before. So did my New Years stuff. Now it's showing the birth of my child a day before. I know when I had her.
5314,CJsDia527,"January 21, 2015",3,"Feeling disappointed I have used this on my iPad for a long time, but now as someone else said its not scrolling right and I can't share at all... Umm what's the point if I can't share.... I am going to wait for the next update which hopefully will be soon but if it doesn't get fixed I will sadly have to delete it and I don't want to!"
5315,Talimeeka,"January 27, 2015",5,"I check it daily! I used to do this myself manually on LJ, look at my entries on that day years past. So delighted to have an app that does this for me, especially since it's impossible to look up social media by date"
5316,Jsodnaofbaog,"January 28, 2015",5,It's all about Abe. Abe the dinosaur is the cutest part about this app. It does its job by pulling from all your social media fronts. If you've been a prominent face on social media it's a lot more fun. It's a great way to see how you've grown in life. Subtle reminders that life moves fast. I love this app
5317,Gretchen Conway,"February 2, 2015",5,Probably my favorite app What better way to be reminded of all the fun things that have happened in your life than to have an app that tells you all of them on the anniversary of when they happened
5318,Rodeyrode,"February 4, 2015",2,"I want to love this but.... It's nice to see what I posted in the past. But more 50% of the time, photos don't share to Facebook properly. It's just a TimeHop frame around a big white nothing. No photo. If I want to share a photo I have to take a screen shot which is fine but then they go into the album iOS photos and not timehop photos. "
5319,Wooooosmurfs,"February 5, 2015",5,"Awesomeness lets you look at back at things you've completely forgotten It's like going back in time, and most of the time your happy with how you've grown up from all those stages but a trip down memory lane at its best."

5321,RyanCG,"July 9, 2014",4,"Fun app I like the concept here. Only issue I have is I connected Dropbox but none of my photos ever get displayed on Timehop. I have verified a few days where I should have seen sole Dropbox photos, but I only ever see Facebook posts. I have the correct folder selected. "
5322,_abel,"July 15, 2014",5,"Takes me back! I love it I love this app! And the developer is smart on creating this app , really let's u reminisce in your past , I honestly forgot a lot of my past on fb, twitter ect... And two go back on the day it's actually nice to see what you wrote ."
5323,Sydneyb11201999,"August 18, 2014",5,"The past Everyone hates looking back on the past, but this one looks back on what you were up to a while ago back and it's pretty cool. When you see it, you remember things! I give it 5 stars!"

5325,RachelPellerito,"September 7, 2014",5,"Perfect Peek into the Past Everything that you would want in this kind of app‚Äîand to top it off, it runs smoothly. It's so fun to reflect back on the past, and in this app you can connect multiple sources to do so. Happy with it!"
5326,SassHamilton,"October 12, 2014",4,"Fantastic app! Love getting these updates. Things only get a little wonky at the 5 year mark. A few days are confused, and they don't show up in my feed in the right order. Apparently, i cut my wedding cake right before i went to bed the night prior to my wedding."
5327,Avid Paypal-er,"October 14, 2014",3,"Almost perfect Timehop has become a part of my morning routine. I love looking back at my life, say, 5 years ago! BUT, I do get a lot of ""Timehop failed"". Also, quite often, when I 'share' something from Timehop to Facebook, Timehop confirms my upload, but it doesn't actually upload. Fix those 2 things, and I'll come back and give 5 stars."
5328,Jkabalen,"October 17, 2014",3,"Cool App but.... I love seeing the old stuff pop up but I wish there were options to set it back further; I'm only getting timehops from three years ago, nothing more really. And I wish it would automatically sync with Instagram, FB and other social media from iPhone without asking for passwords and logins on everything."
5329,Hashtagbridget_2,"October 25, 2014",5,For picture lovers I absolutely love the fact it shows things all the way back to like 2 years ago on the exact day we are on today!  I highly recommend this app!

5335,thats_lovely101,"March 3, 2014",4,"Awesome app! Really great functionality, simple layout, and very easy to share on social media.

5338,beffieboobo,"April 18, 2014",4,"Great app, but.... I love the concept of this app! It's so fun. I connected it to my twitter, and I haven't yet seen one tweet on my time hop. I have over 50k tweets so I know in the few months I've been using this app that I tweeted in the past on some of those days. All I've seen is photos from Instagram and my iPhone camera."
5339,Danizaur,"June 10, 2014",5,Great! Great concept for an app. The design is my favorite part. Whoever designed the art for the app gets an A+! Sometimes it doesn't load but I try again in an hour and it always works then. That's my only complaint.
5340,Ascaraf,"December 30, 2012",5,Look forward to my timehop everyday It does take a while to load but let's remember is pulling data from a year ago from multiple sites. It's really fun to see what you were doing a year ago. Very nostalgic!

But it just feels like you tried to fix something that wasn't broken, and in the process you broke everything. The ""gallery"" portion is terrible. If I want to see my photos larger or see the entire gallery, I can't. It's ridiculous. None of us minded scrolling. Go back to what you had going."
5351,Jessmadsen,"January 31, 2017",1,Missing functionality from before updates! I agree with everyone's reviews. Please fix this app! It used to work much better. Sometimes it will not load. It used to link back to my original post. Not so much anymore. I cannot easily see replies to a status in twitter. And I can't tell what day of the week I posted something anymore. And I feel like things are missing. I see WAY more in my Facebook memories.
5352,Lisa1127dyl,"February 11, 2017",1,"Ugh! I used to love timehop. Would check it every day. Now with the newest update half the time it crashes and doesn't even show me any memories and the other half the time it's zoomed in so far that I can only see about 1/3 of the picture. I've even tried changing settings to fix it. Also, when I try to touch the picture to manually zoom out, it just flips to the next picture. So frustrating!"

That being said, the new update has turned me away from the app and I no longer find it entertaining. The old layout was great, there was nothing wrong with it. The new layout is clunky and difficult to use, and practically impossible to use on poor internet connections. Please, please bring the old layout back."

5357,Dustin Johnson,"March 9, 2017",1,"Horrible Update Still not listening to what the users want, therefore I'll be deleting the app. Worst decision any developer could make. "
5358,Ohiosparrow,"March 19, 2017",1,Can't handle a lot of information More pictures and videos the worse this app does. Anytime I have a lot from one day this app crashes. The counter will reset even if you checked the previous day or it just won't update that you watched the previous day. Today is a crashing day. Use 10% battery just to try to get through it with no luck. Maybe they just want to end a very long streak! 300+
5359,gabrhig,"April 4, 2017",1,"Why'd you change it!!?? This app was actually quite interesting to use every day until this new update! The first thing that happened when the update first came out, I lost my long streak even though I went on it. I loved the simplicity of just going on and scrolling down then getting off. If there's another app like this I would recommend choosing the other one now that this update came outüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº"
5360,Uzneko,"January 2, 2017",1,It used to be amazing. Looks like everyone else beat me to it. 
5361,simple notes user,"January 2, 2017",1,"update ruined everything tinehop is now pretty much useless thanks to the update, it regressed in quality. now i can no longer see the whole photo, know where a picture is from, OR most importantly READ THE CAPTIONS of old posts. i'd rather just use apple photo's ""1 year ago today feature"" if the social media part is gonna take a bunch of unneccesary steps. i was really enjoying the app it's sad that i'll have to stop using it now."
5362,Smoffitt76,"January 3, 2017",1,"Update stole something special This update broke my heart. Yeah, I know, sounds dramatic, but it's true. See, my mom died two years ago-way too early. Every morning I looked forward to seeing if she left a comment on some post I made years prior. I treasured those comments. Please bring them back. (New layout is a bit overwhelming as well) if you really want to make an update consider allowing us access to the previous day or week timehop."
5363,Cdmn119,"January 6, 2017",4,"Took out my favorite part Still prefer the old layout, but I am satisfied now that we can once again see comments for each memory. Thank you for listening to feedback and responding to what the people want!"
5364,pattiepnut,"January 8, 2017",4,"No I do not like the newest update!! This whole tapping thing is quite annoying and I do not know how to get back to the beginning.  It was also nice to see the original comments and likes; that have mysteriously disappeared.  Please ""un"" do the newest update.  Thank you."
5365,Heidi-Eight,"January 10, 2017",4,"Useful reminders I love knowing what I was up to and photographing X years ago - they've put the links to those old tweets & posts back in, and FB photo comments too. While the recent update was very broken, the fixes bring back what was useful about the app. Whew!"
5366,Laurenjune411,"January 11, 2017",3,"Hate the new update! I'm a huge fan of Timehop! But this new update stinks! It zooms too far in on pictures, you can't see the whole thing! It also doesn't show the day of the week you posted things anymore."
5367,Mgm9411,"January 12, 2017",1,"Horrible update Update: it still is horrible. I'm glad I can see the comments/likes, but the layout of everything is the worst. Just please go back to the old version. It's a pain to look at the app now. "
5368,raiderdaisy1216,"January 19, 2017",1,"What happened? I've been using TimeHop for a long time and used to enjoy laughing at my younger self or revisiting old memories. I absolutely DETEST the new update - it takes so long to get through if there was a large album uploaded or something. I miss the old way of scrolling, where you could choose to spend more time on something if you wanted. If it doesn't change back, I'll join the many people deleting the app."
5369,Sophie655,"January 23, 2017",1,"App keeps crashing... This update is awful!! Not only is the new setup horrible, but for the last 4 days straight my Timehop just crashes. Every time I open it it fails to load and says ""try again"" and every time I do hit try again it STILL doesn't work. This new layout is also terrible and has a lot of issues. Do what everyone is saying and go back to the old version/layout. This app is now horrible."
5370,kcjo13,"December 27, 2016",1,"If I could use 0 stars, this review would be more accurate Why why why?? Do the people who develop these apps actually use them? Because this is absolutely terrible.  There is nothing, NOTHING helpful about this app now. I can look at old photographs myself without having to open an app that gives me zero information.  Please, Abe, tell your handlers to fix this right away. And by fix I mean scrap everything and start over."
5371,andydandy89,"December 27, 2016",1,"Fix new update!!! New update got rid of captions under photos which was something I also wanted to look back on. It's nice to see what I said about a photo I posted. Also got rid of ability to see comments and likes on posts and photos. In order to look at that I have to go to Facebook's ""On This Day"" and ignore stuff from other applications. Completely defeats the purpose of this app. I just want to look back on memories üò∞"
5372,keegdnab13,"December 28, 2016",1,"Hate new update Like someone else said, updates usually take some time to get used to, but I HATE this update and it doesn't make sense. It's not useful at all. I look at timehop every morning but this update makes it really frustrating. Every picture is zoomed, you can't see comments, and I tried to share a video and there was no option to do so. Please come up with a different update or take it back to what it was."
5373,acmers13,"December 28, 2016",1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible update Just adding my name to the list of people who really, truly hate the latest update. I hate literally everything about it. At first I was feeling like maybe I just wasn't being open-minded enough to a new update, but since my exact thoughts are spread out through the plethora of like-minded bad reviews already posted, I won't waste my time telling you just how awful this new setup is. Just joining the consensus."
5374,Schw1305,"December 28, 2016",1,New update The new update is AWFUL. I hate how the photos are ginormous--bigger than the screen.  I have issues trying to make them small to see the entire photo....even though that supposedly possible. I have been using this app for at least 2 years-- it's one of my favorites. I am about to delete it if this update is not fixed soon. Please fix this update. It's not worth downloading until this is fixed.
5375,DLeft89,"December 29, 2016",1,"What have you done?! If it's not broken don't effing fix it!! What you have done with this latest update is absolutely atrocious!!! All the pictures that I took 1, 2, 3, 5, 69, 10 years ago of my naked exes are now such a pain to look at!! I use to scroll through checking out the hot pics of them I took whilst stalking them. Now you have this slideshow bs like Snapchat... shame on you! I want to reminisce of my naked exes as I please, not as you please! Fix this now!!!"
5376,alyssa8372793,"December 29, 2016",1,"New is a no I've always looked forward to checking my Timehop every morning. Now with this update, I could care less. I don't like how you can't see the captions or comments anymore, most of the time they're funnier than the post itself. Also, not impressed with the auto zoom on everything. It gets annoying having to zoom out of all my pictures because I can only see half of it."
5377,ANGEL62885,"December 29, 2016",1,"HORRIBLE Update When I'm viewing my photos some of them are horribly zoomed in.  I'm expected to zoom out with some odd tap swipe hold something or another.  Just present me the photo as it was taken.  On top of that, now that you tap to advance, you can't really tell when the years change other than a small banner at top.  Just imagine tapping away, your photos advancing, and not seeing the years change.  REVERT!  This is AWFUL."
5378,MsMay1986,"December 30, 2016",1,"About ready to delete Timehop The new update is frustrating.  I hate the zoomed in pictures, I had them zoomed in when I posted them the first time, so now when I open it I can't see anything without messing with it...  I hate the large wording of the posts, it makes me feel like I'm 80.  I used to scroll through my memories daily and enjoyed it, now I avoid the app.  I'm ready to delete the app if it doesn't change soon."
5379,Upset Abe,"January 1, 2017",1,I wish I could give negative stars. The new update is awful. It's not very user friendly and I can't even look at all my pictures in the album! It's super annoying only being able to see the zoomed in middle of a picture and having to swipe a certain way to see the full view. I'm deleting this app until they switch it back or to something similar and easier to read and use.
5380,Lovegayle8,"June 8, 2016",3,"Was decent until the latest update My iOS is updated to the 9.3.2, yet I still haven't been able to open the app since I did the latest update. It forces closes every time before I can see the first picture. Aggravating. I missed 2 days worth of memories already. How can this be fixed?"
5381,Madienikie,"June 13, 2016",3,Stop saying I haven't opened it Every morning I check my Timehop (half the time it doesn't show my insta posts but that's beside the point) about an hour later I get that stupid little red icon at the top showing I haven't looked even though I've already viewed for the day. I have to reopen just so that red dot won't annoy me all day.
5382,Hdshjk,"June 16, 2016",1,"New Update Crashes The new Timehop update crashes consistently and now I will lose my ""streak"" of how many days in a row I have checked the app. It also makes it more difficult to read comments from previous posts because you now have to switch between apps and your internet browser to view them whereas before the app showed all the info you wanted right there. Extremely disappointed."
5383,Shortandcute,"June 16, 2016",5,Irritated I couldn't get on the app. I tried to update and it loaded however now I can't even get the app to open! I do like the streak and if this isn't fixed I'm gonna lose my 31 day streak! Ugh come on timehop! Let's fix this!
5384,Kris10hull,"July 14, 2016",3,"Ehh.. Bad update Typically, I adore Timehop. I love looking back at my old posts and reminiscing. I have to say though, I don't like how we don't have a choice about framing posts. "
5385,Relbelle,"December 8, 2016",3,"It Ends At 200?? I loved this app! I loved seeing how many days in a row I could get! But since getting to 200, it no longer shows my streak... just ""2...""! This is completely disappointing and such a let down for someone who loves to see how long I can keep something up. Now I will never know. This glitch needs to be fixed."
5386,Mike Essl,"December 24, 2016",1,This update removes everything that was great. Some photos won't let me share. The share button is on some images and not others. Photos are zoomed in a strange way. Instead of a grid of photos it animates the zoomed in photos and won‚Äôt let me share an individual photo. You can't see the social media comments anymore and I couldn't figure out how to get to the original post.
5387,Taystephkin9,"December 24, 2016",1,"New update, no thanks. Usually I just get over as updates and adapt but I am not a fan of this one. I may have to break my 97 day streak and stop using the app. Not only are all the pictures zoomed in but it doesn't tell you where the picture is posted from and what the caption is making it less of a trip down memory lane and more of a guessing game. The old Timehop was more efficient. There was no need to fix what wasn't broken."
5388,TheCoxes,"December 24, 2016",1,Not impressed They took away my favorite parts of the app. I can no longer see what social media platform my memory was posted on nor the caption of it. I can no longer see the comments which was one of my favorite parts. It feels too much like a snap chat story lay out and it needs to be more like a twitter or facebook lay out. I've had this app for over a year now and I'm really not into this update. It's ruined my favorite parts of the app.
5389,Akane135,"December 26, 2016",1,Plz fix update... I'm missing so much I have used this app for years. But the new update has many issues. There's no way to see all your pics you posted. There's many tings missing from each day. I miss all the frames we had. I will keep this on my phone for a little while longer. Trying to hold out for a fix. But I will be deleting if it is not corrected. I'm so sad i can't see everything like I did in the past
5390,Shmopeh,"February 20, 2016",4,"Would love to connect 2 instagrams I love this app, but one additional feature i would love is the ability to connect more than one Instagram account (especially since the new Instagram update lets you switch between accounts so easily)"
5391,MobileTexan,"February 24, 2016",5,Fun but never loads I love walking memory lane every day but for the last month the app has failed to load the current day's info. I've been stuck on the same day for 4 days. Please fix this
5392,Ellcie07,"March 24, 2016",1,"This app is useless! I can't get any of my pictures to load. I tried everything on their FAQ list and nothing worked. I contacted ""support"" and got a response that they can't respond to every customer but check into their FAQ'S.  Really?!!  All my friends that use it say that their pictures just appear so know one can help me out. I was hopeful that this app would work and hope that maybe this review will get a response from the app designer."
5393,brandystarlight,"April 1, 2016",5,"Fun fun fun Really enjoy this app. When I get something 8, or 10 years ago that pops up, it makes me smile! It's usually a post from someone I haven't talked to in a long time. Gives me a little push to make a phone call!  ü§ó"
5394,Whovian TARDIS fun time,"April 4, 2016",3,"Meh. I just got this and I thought it would be great but I've already had issues. It won't let me sync it with my Facebook, which was pretty much the only reason I wanted it. This is disappointing and I tried to uninstall and reinstall it but that also did not work. If this issue is fixed I will love it."
5395,Bwb5016,"April 13, 2016",5,"Awesome app Never had any issues with the app and a great way to see old photos, locations and posting.  I'm not even much of a social media person, and it has still been a lot of fun to use."
5396,greekrose,"April 29, 2016",5,"Bring back the old app!! This app was fantastic before the last upgrade. Please remove the ""retrovideo"" or at least give us an option to turn off the sound."
5397,mtnlion48,"May 2, 2016",2,"New update stinks Still appreciate the basic premise of the app, however, the retro video is a terrible addition. As others have noted, auto play with no option to turn off, and sound, makes for a horrible experience. Also, the notification turns on now even if I don't have anything from that day in history‚Ä¶ I think that's the worst part."
5398,bro.dy,"May 7, 2016",1,"Can't even get the app to open!! i deleted timehop for a while, simply because i'm relatively new to most social media and so i didn't use the app very much, but now i've just redownloaded and i can't even get the app to open! i've turned my phone on and off, and even tried downloading it AGAIN, to no avail! plus there's all this talk of a self playing video... makes me not even want the app to open at all! please fix this. shame on you."
5399,MarisaakaRis,"May 17, 2016",3,"Bug fixes, MySpace, desktop and snapchat I have noticed that timehop doesn't show everything and I really wish it would connect to MySpace. Also, I've had a problem with using timehop on my Windows 8 laptop. Btw it would be really awesome if you could sync to snapchat so I could see my old snaps again every year!"
5400,amyerb,"October 4, 2015",1,Used to be cool I have LOVED this app from day one. I even love the new updates where you can do the before and after views however 3/4 of the pictures and 1/2 the posts never load anymore. The app says they were deleted but I can easily see them when I go to Facebook's new On this Day feature. I have all the current updates and the problem stays the same. I have stopped recommending this app as it's an embarrassment to have.
5401,Nat158,"October 7, 2015",5,Love this app I love to see what has happened in the past 6 years and it reminds me daily of my life.  Great to see pics of my kids when they were smaller and good times with friends and family.
5402,Caseylandrew,"October 9, 2015",4,Shutterfly? I'm a new user bc I heard how much fun it was to use. After getting the app it's kinda pointless to me now that all my pictures are in shutterfly. Other told me shutterfly was apart but now the new update it's taken away.
5403,Gabbyik,"November 28, 2015",4,"Favorite app - 1 problem this app used to be perfect, but now when you post pictures - you can't see the entire picture :( other than that, i look forward to reading and sharing my old posts daily."
5404,Hdabru,"December 9, 2015",2,"Where is my content? For a few months it was a great app but for the last three weeks or so there's been absolutely nothing. A few photos, but know there was much more than that because I took a lot of pics and talked about finals in years past. Lol. Also my Facebook ""on this day"" gives me tons of content. So where's timehop's? Have checked all my connections. Don't get it."
5405,2ton Velasco,"December 19, 2015",5,Love it!!!! It's great to look back at your past and know that your now making a future!!!! Also reminds me of my forgetfulness of years past!!! I just can't not get this app when I get new phones!
5406,Green kite,"December 21, 2015",5,Used to work great It used to show pics and things but lately has been crashing and unable to open at all which is super frustrating.
5407,Illogical Cow,"December 24, 2015",5,No thanks. I am pretty sure I set some of these old pics from FB to private so I hate that I'm getting notifications that people I haven't talked to in YEARS are seeing these. Please delete this feature or make it optional.
5408,Tsumlovingkid,"December 29, 2015",2,"Fix the update Since the last update I haven't been able to load my memories. I don't like the snow graphic over the pictures. I also don't care about the people who are in the picture. I can handle that in other apps. Finally, the sharing to Facebook is no longer working for me. It looks like it works but never posts. Please fix Timehop. I love looking back."
5409,yakyaj,"January 27, 2016",3,"Buggy Lots of my ""memories"" come from my Twitter app. I try clicking on ""open in app"" so many times and it just won't work. Please fix this, was hoping it would be fixed last update but it's still not. And pictures take forever to load! I love Timehop but little bugs like this makes it a pain."
5410,T_Mel,"July 15, 2015",4,"Love the Dino This app was a cool idea to look back and see things you posted in the past, something a lot of people use, and still better than Facebook's ""memories"" because Timehop can collect from multiple apps. The Dino commentary/sayings at the bottom screen is the best part :)"
5411,Jon Thomas,"July 27, 2015",5,"Just fun! I initially thought,""Eh, who cares?"" Apparently I do! :-) It's a real kick to look back on my life and see thoughts I had long forgotten. Many of my old posts were kind of inane, but it's fun to see them, especially when a real gem shows up."
5412,Skchart,"August 6, 2015",4,Time hop Should be more like memory hop or blast from the past. It is nice to see what you were doing a year ago on this day or 3 years ago or more is really nice. It is such a confident app. You don't have to look thru everything to find out what had happened.
5413,Irox always,"August 6, 2015",4,"changes I think that you should be able to get pictures that have been deleted. And when I say deleted, I mean off of Instagram, twitter, and especially off your camera role. If that could happen, I would have ranked it 5 starts."
5414,Kaylie_leib,"August 27, 2015",4,"Love this app This app is great, really great! Unless a memory with an ex pops up :D The only thing I hate is the fact that I deleted an old Instagram and it still shows up stuff from my old Instagram but doesn't show the pictures. I wish they didn't show up!"
5415,Dogarito,"September 9, 2015",4,"I used to love this app, but... In the past couple of months, photos have been deleted (by whom?) at an ever increasing rate. In the past couple of weeks, well over half have been deleted. This creates frustration and disappointment. This is still a neat app, but the bloom is  off the rose for me."
5416,Jillo1996,"September 14, 2015",2,"I used to like this app I used to like this app a lot. But now I rarely use it because almost all the pictures have been deleted and the new ""look back"" feature on Facebook does not. Plus when I try to post some of the pictures it cuts off half the picture . Honesty, at this point I'm thinking about deleting it. It just doesn't work like it used to."
5417,xlaurenelise,"September 19, 2015",5,"Used to love it... Over the past several weeks this app hasn't been showing my pictures, just telling me they didn't reach 88 mph. Before that, I loved looking back on pictures."
5418,ldarlin64,"September 20, 2015",5,Spectacular! Timehop is awesome! It goes through my pictures for me and then I can choose the ones I want to use...brings back lots of memories without me having to dig through thousands of my pics myself!
5419,JustLilOleMe1210,"September 24, 2015",3,"Recently started working better I love this app, but it's very annoying when every update you have for the day that includes a pic gives a message saying it didn't reach 88mph. Didn't know there was a speed limit in the virtual world. Just installed an update. Hopefully that bug has been fixed."
