0,Waelwulfan,"March 28, 2019",2,App needs so much work The service itself is great.  All of my complaints are with the app and not Pandora itself.
1,CrystalNWilliams,"September 23, 2018",3,"Pandora‚Äô Disclaimer Allow me start off with how much I utilize Pandora. I have had a Pandora account for at least 8 years. But recently I have purchased the Pandora Premium account. I loved the idea of downloading music to listen to later and I have my own personal music list. I loved the idea of the ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù feature as well. But recently I have ran into a few issues. 1 of them being when I switch the offline due to being in an airplane... it only allows me to listen to SOME of the songs even though I have downloaded them. When I go to click on the song it states that it is not allowed for playbacks. üßê Sooooo... why was able to download it if I can‚Äôt replay it?? 2. Then I was listening to my songs with WiFi and it was telling me that I can‚Äôt listen to the songs because they are not allowed for playbacks... so no matter what.... you allowed me to feel like I was given the opportunity to have the song on my playlist BUT I can‚Äôt listen to it?? 3. You are able to listen to a lot of songs. You can search for a lot of songs. You can discover new songs.... but you can NOT download a lot of these songs... so my conclusion is... deal with the lack of skips, commercials and keep the free option because it‚Äôs not worth what they charge. Very disappointing."
2,pv15,"December 3, 2017",2,"Two stars for what Pandora once was... I‚Äôve been a fairly long time user of Pandora One. The poor performance of this app is almost making me consider leaving them for online radio. First and foremost, here recently the app has been real garbage. Every time I open it it‚Äôs either wanting me to sign into Facebook, or sign up for the higher Pandora service. To me that‚Äôs a bit insulting as a person that already pays for Pandora One. There aren‚Äôt supposed to be ads, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to sign into Facebook on Pandora. Here recently it‚Äôs been terrible about audio playback too. For example, the other day if I‚Äôd switch to another app or if my phone would go to sleep Pandora would quit playing music. An uninstall and reinstall of the app did fix this. Another issue I‚Äôve been having is sometime I‚Äôll get a notification from another app, the music volume turns down for said notification, but then it doesn‚Äôt turn the music back up after, making me close the app and reopen it. One other complaint I have is if I pause the music, the app sometimes just plain seems to forget once I hit play if I spent too long on pause. In order to get music to play again I have to go and reopen the Pandora app. Often times whatever song I was enjoying is no longer there. Really discontent with the quality here recently."
3,Combzz,"October 21, 2017",1,"Ads, ads, and then more ads Too many ads of course. I spend 1 minute (two 30 second ads) listening to your ads, ok great. Then a song comes on that I don‚Äôt like, press skip, instantly 2 more adds. So now 2 minutes have passed and I‚Äôm still stuck with listening to the SAME ads over and over and over again. The ad frequency is way too high compared to any other free radio out there. Plus, the music that does get to play isn‚Äôt even what I like to listen to. And a lot of time the music isn‚Äôt even tailored to the station. And then there‚Äôs the issue where after 8-10 songs, it literally LOOPS!!! It will the start playing the same songs you listened to an hour ago, or where you last listened to Pandora. Pandora is the WORST out there. Compare that to iHeartRadio who has a way better tailored music experience and less ads that are actually relevant to me. On top of that, the only benefits you receive after paying monthly for their premium is just ‚Äúmore skips‚Äù and ‚Äúless ads‚Äù. There are definitely way better services out there that when you pay you get ‚Äúno ads‚Äù and ‚Äúunlimited skips‚Äù. Pandora is just a major waste of time, they‚Äôre only in it for the money and because of that they‚Äôll eventually die off as someone else overtakes them; unless they radically change their business model and put the user listening experience in the spotlight."
4,SobbingPuppy,"January 4, 2020",5,"I love this app I don‚Äôt have the premium plan but nevertheless I would definitely vouch for this app. I recommend this to anyone who wants to jam to their music even with the slight interruption of random catchy ads that you‚Äôd surprisingly enjoy. The only thing I can think of that would make one confused or upset is the replay button when you specifically request a song in exchange of a few seconds of advertisement. The replay button within itself does its job; replays continuously until your time is up. On the other hand, when you tap that button twice, to request the song to repeat only once it doesn‚Äôt do so. It would replay the song continuously until time is up, which normally doesn‚Äôt happen tho because you‚Äôd realize it continued more times than wanted. But that can always be fixed, simply by stopping it from replaying by tapping the replay button once more to allow it to go on auto play immediately after or even just requesting another song üòÖ"
5,Caleb1744,"February 5, 2020",1,"Nothing compared to Apple Music There are a lot of adds on Pandora and after paying the smaller subscription (something like $5 a month), I found that I was still limited in what I could do. I was not able to make or edit playlists nearly as well as Apple Music if at all (I never figured it out), the amount of likes and dislikes was also limited. There came several times when I noticed an apparent glitch in the system as well. There was a type of song that continued to play on a certain violin station (Daniel D) that sounded almost like a metronome. I pushed dislike. But then, as if I actually pushed ‚Äúlike‚Äù, it played another similar song. Before I knew it, I was listening to nothing but that type of music and patiently disliking every last one. Then I ran out of dislikes. I have noticed that a lot of stations are seemingly preset mostly by popular trends. My likes and dislikes don‚Äôt have as strong an influence as they should."
6,Fixxerboy,"June 13, 2018",2,"Tricking people into buying the app... disgraceful I am a long time Pandora listener. Decent streams of all sorts of genres of music but a lot of replay in a short period of time which is bad/good for some so I‚Äôm not judging on that.  I would happily pay a fair price for their service ($2.99/month).  I feel they are greedy and not in touch with the reality of the situation, the fact that the internet is saturated with online music provides many of which are free.  But the reason I will never buy service from Pandora is because they purposefully try to trick you almost every time you click on the app by moving the ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù button at the precise time the average user goes to click on ‚Äúnot now‚Äù.  They have spent way to much time and energy trying to trick users into buying their service when a few days of honest assessing of the current competitor market would yield a fair but lower subscription price.  This would in turn give them a larger subscription base and in the end more revenue.  Please don‚Äôt do business with a company that practices borderline unethical business practices, if they are willing to do this everyday in front of our faces what else would they do to keep you locked in as a subscriber?  Come on Pandora, is this really the relationship you want with your customers?"
7,Navy Tester,"November 7, 2017",2,"I want an improved music service This is Pandora‚Äôs last week to prove that it‚Äôs the music service for me.  I drive a lot between major cities and service drops all the time.  Even when i have good service the app locks up and makes me reboot.  Lastly, it‚Äôs not clear what or how im paying for plus.  I guit once because of the ridiculous monthly tap when all i wanted to do was pay for a year and forget about the hassle  of remembering to deduct monthly payments.  Now, i cant see (on the app) how I‚Äôm paying, again.  Ill logon to the website and find out if I‚Äôll just quit then and there.  Apple music had been sending little treats and Pandora hasn‚Äôt been concerned enough to make the app work through my iphone ( so far) and without a pretty rapid service improvement ( i just updated the app) and a means to see how I‚Äôm paying for plus from my very secure phone, i will quit and move on.  I have to add one more, i was engaged many years ago by a stellar customer service representative.  She was so helpful that i nearly stayed on, in spite of the required monthly payments option at the time.  When Pandora finally adopted the annual payment option again, I don‚Äôt return. But now service is suffering.  Please make this right.  Thank you very much for reading my novella! üòÅ"
8,Courtney4367732,"February 16, 2020",3,"Pandora Plus...has its flaws. First of all, with Plus you‚Äôre supposed to have the ability to listen to a few offline stations. In theory, it‚Äôs supposed to switch to offline mode automatically when you lose cell service or internet access...rarely ever does this happen automatically. Also, of the 4 available offline stations, usually only 1 works. At least a third of the time it will say all stations are unavailable and will play nothing. My second complaint is something that annoys me so much, I‚Äôve been looking into other music services. Even though I pay for ad free and already have Pandora Plus, ads for Pandora Plus pop up constantly! Initially premium ads were coming up, and that‚Äôs annoying enough, but then to keep pushing Plus on me when I ALREADY HAVE IT is just too much for me."
9,Vipedogg,"December 1, 2017",5,Can‚Äôt get it right AGAIN!!! Once‚Äôs again you mess up the app. Now I can‚Äôt get it to work. When I turn it on the app then   when I closed the screen to let it play in back ground. It turns off the music. Then when I try to put it back on it freezes. I have to turn off the app then turn it back on. This happens every time. Now that I paid for this service it not working. This happen 1 day after the last fix. Plus you can‚Äôt see whats playing in the lock screen. Just shows the pandora app is on. GREAT JOBS!!! (Not)
10,watsontcbc,"January 6, 2018",4,"Really like Pandora despite its issues I really like Pandora. They fixed the latest crashing issue. I occasionally use and try other apps. Some are good for specific uses, like just finding a specific song or hearing what friends like. But Pandora consistently curated music very very well and I keep coming back, now defaulting to it for general listening in the car and at home. Jazz, electronica, fusion, trance, house, and artist or even song-based stations - you name it: I get an excellent mix suited to my tastes, with new tunes and artists I hadn‚Äôt yet heard. Yes, their ad behavior is irritating in the free version. But if you grew up listening to AM radio as I did, this is not really a problem. And if you can‚Äôt stand it, ante-up for the premium version. It is totally worth it if you hate the ads that much what with all the extra features you get. Keep it up Pandora. Just don‚Äôt make your ad function any more annoying than it already is (like popping up  more ads when I just want to see the album cover, making me click two or three times to see it!). If you make it less annoying I‚Äôll give you a full five stars!"
11,Arllc3,"March 24, 2018",1,"Done with this app This app seems to have a new unfixable bug where when I connect to my car (wired or Bluetoot) the skip doesn‚Äôt work. I press once on my wheel to skip, and pandora app skips 1-3 songs, effectively using all my free skips. Wrote to help desk telling them I tried resetting, reinstalling, updating the app, and restarting my phone. And what do they say? They completely ignore what I wrote and tell me to do exactly what I just said I did. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even read what I wrote. They literally advised me to do everything I said I did. "
12,BeccaFulton,"July 18, 2018",3,"Love you, but there‚Äôs one problem I've been using Pandora for years and I love it. Yeah, they have some bugs, but a lot of apps do. Some of my now favorite bands I found from pandora. I pay $5/month for the premium version and it‚Äôs really worth it. My only complaint, which is more of a suggestion or request, I wish I could choose which stations I had offline. I have stations that I‚Äôve listened to so freaking much, that‚Äôs how the app decides which stations are available offline, but I don‚Äôt want those for offline use. The fact that the more you listen to offline ones, the more hours you accumulate, solidifying their spots on the list. I frequently find myself with little to no data connection, so I really appreciate and rely on the offline mode. I tried deleting those stations and re-loading my offline stations, but alas it did not fix the problem... it honestly just made it worse. I deleted all of my stations that hadn‚Äôt been listened to this year and I‚Äôm realizing that to get the stations I want offline, I‚Äôll have to delete all of them but the ones I want. So if you could choose the stations to download, that‚Äôd be dope and then I‚Äôd definitely give you a well-deserved 5 stars üò¨"
13,MMoore49,"October 27, 2018",2,"Not a good algorhythm The problems I have with Pandora are that I type in a group or a song name I want to hear and maybe I‚Äôll hear one song by that group and then many, many songs by all types of other bands, many of which I give a ‚Äúthumbs down‚Äù but they still cycle around. Sometimes I‚Äôll dislike a group and then Pandora will send 2 or 3 more songs by that group, when I HATE that group, but no songs of the group I want to hear. "
14,Go2camp,"February 2, 2019",2,"Organization Hi. First if all, I would like to thank you for reading this request. Now I will get on with it. I really like Pandora, but I think that you should make it more organized. I think that the favorites should be on the top of all of the stations. I also think that to make it more attractive, the blue bar at the bottom of the screen should be either white, black, or non-existent. It‚Äôs just not attractive, and all of my friends and family agree. I‚Äôm sorry if you feel as if I am taking over your business, but that is just the way that the people want it. Only the album covers should be full with color. Everything else, I feel, should be black and white and grey. More modern = more attractive. Sorry, but it‚Äôs just what it is. My friends and I would also like if everytime we opened the app, music would not automatically start playing. I hope that you can find the time to make the changes in the next two weeks, or I will definitely be compelled to delete the app. I really do think that this app is a very good app and would like to give you props for making it. But the main point of this review is to tell you that the visual appearance of this app is just not attractive. Thank you for reading. Goodbye."
15,Margaret Kellyyy,"March 10, 2019",5,"It could be better I have the premium subscription and overall I‚Äôm pleased with the easy to use platform, music selection and the quality of sound. However I do agree with other users that I wish Pandora would give users (especially those that pay for premium) the ability to edit/sort your stations and playlists on your home page. Yes you can filter for your stations or downloaded playlists but I‚Äôm pretty particular and I like things to be alphabetical... or the order in which my brain thinks is most logical. But the thing that bothers me THE MOST is the fact that when you pause a song, and lock your phone and walk away for a moment or pause to have a conversation with a coworker and you go back to the app, it acts like you just opened the app and the song you were listening to you, at your favorite part, starts over. What‚Äôs with that?! I understand that music apps may be different but the free game apps I have don‚Äôt wipe out my progress if I pause the game and ‚Äúminimize‚Äù the app.... why can‚Äôt the app I pay monthly for do the same?!?"
16,MrRTB,"December 10, 2019",3,"Thumbprint Overrides Selection When I choose an Artist to listen to, I expect the majority of the music for that channel to be the Artist I selected, not just a few. It seems the more thumbprints your choose, the less of the actual artist you want to listen to actually get played.  Recently is seems to be maybe 10-15% of the actual artist/musicians channel that is chosen actually gets their music.  The only way I can see to fix the issue is to ‚ÄúUn-THUMBPRINT‚Äù the individual channels other artist/musician thumbprints to be able to listen to that channels music.  The thumbprints should only be used as a guide for using the thumbprint channel itself, or to fill in an occasional selection.  There should be no more than 25% of the thumbprint selections on an an individual / group artist / musicians channel except for thumbprint or various selection channels.  Perhaps if people prefer thumbprints over the actual artist /musician selected, a setup panel for individuals to choose how much thumbprint they want to listen to Vs actual artist / musician channel would be appropriate.  "
17,FreudTheFish,"August 23, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs alright... It‚Äôs a good music app and all but it has its flaws.  For starters I‚Äôm tired of when it switches to autoplay from my playlist it‚Äôs usually the same songs in the same order...that‚Äôs not auto play.  Switch it up man.  I hate how when I am in auto play and I stop the app, not close it but stop it, and I go back into it it starts from my most recently played playlist....WHY???  I suggest making it easier to delete playlists or songs in the playlist without having to go into my profile and search around for eternity.  Every playlist should have a delete option and every song in that playlist should have a swipe left to remove from playlist option.  Another thing is I swear when I do delete a playlist or a song in the playlist it‚Äôs gone from my library....every song in that playlist will just poof....disappear.  Finally when it comes to making a playlist, give the name it option like you do but give a plus icon so you can browse every song in your library with an add option instead of having to click every song individually, then the three dots, then add to playlist, then which playlist you want it in....simplify man come on!"
18,Pastel Peachüå∏,"November 30, 2019",4,"Why I love Pandora. Omg, Pandora is simply the BEST!! It‚Äôs a place where you can find all of you favorite songs for free! I LOVE MUSIC! And if you love music as much as I do, then your going to LOVE Pandora. I love it so much that I listen to it in bed! üòÇ But... the only thing I wish was different about Pandora, is that I really wish there were more songs that have a clean version. Sometimes, when I start listening to a song, I search for a clean version of it just in case. Let‚Äôs say I wanted to listen to ‚ÄúOn My Way‚Äù By Alan Walker & Sabrina Carpenter, then I would normally search for a clean version of that song. But sometimes, I click the normal version of it because I would think it didn‚Äôt have bad words in it due to the fact that it didn‚Äôt have a clean version. But then... I get startled by the cuss words. And then, just because of that, I tend to dislike the song. So whenever I hear that song on a different station, I will most likely üëéüèº the song. I love you Pandora, but please please work on those clean versions!! I really enjoy your music, I can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next! "
19,Baileyrhb,"April 9, 2020",2,"Rather lacking... I do love Pandora, and I use this app all the time, but certain features never work on my phone; for example, the friend search, and Facebook linking. I tried those on my husband‚Äôs Samsung phone, and they work, but not on my iPhone for some reason. Deleting and reinstalling doesn‚Äôt help."
20,alexk1682,"September 11, 2017",1,"Slimy sales tricks. Classless. Barely able to navigate app due to the overwhelming number of adds that they jam down your throat. Back to back Pop ups that require you to close, lazily slopped together commercials, and if that wasn't enough the variety of songs is  pitiful. After the first 7 songs it just goes to a loop where I hear the same familiar songs day in and out. For how little this app provides it's not worth sitting through horrible repetitive commercials and closing swarms of pop up ads. Goodbye pandora."
21,RoA(one and only),"October 10, 2017",3,Pandora Premium may not be so great after all My headphone controls are not working with Pandora anymore over the last few days and Pandora no longer comes up on my lock screen. This is absolutely irritating. Who do I need to complain to in order to get this fixed?! 
22,cereal8u,"October 25, 2017",5,"Love, Music and Pandora For people who truly love music Pandora is a godsend. There is a joy that That comes from a good surprise. With Pandora you don‚Äôt have to set up a playlist, so you‚Äôre never sure what song my play next. Pandora uses a song or band that you chose to start your station. They play music that is similar to your original chose. Pandora then uses algorithms that track your likes and dislikes of the songs that you have listened to in order to create a custom playlist for every user. I pay for the service that removes the ads and allows me to skip any songs or repeat any songs that I want.I have had Pandora for years and enjoy it so much that I stopped to write this small review. If you love music I think that you will also love Pandora. I hope that you give it a try. Music brings so much happiness to life, and with Pandora your music can always be with you. I don‚Äôt have to download hundreds of songs I can just listen to my music every were I go. I love music. I love Pandora."
23,Kitkatbiggie,"January 24, 2018",4,Downloaded songs not really accessible I like pandora but recently when I select shuffle my thumbs up it repeats the same several songs (songs I have given the thumbs up) along with new songs in the same vein. The new stuff is ok but why keep repeating the one or two songs over and over from my list of 302 songs. My other issue is I live in an area where reception comes and goes between my commute to and from work...so I downloaded quite a few songs. I wish I could select offline mode but I can‚Äôt. So I will be rocking out and when the song comes to an end I have sudden total silence while it connects ‚Äúbuffers‚Äù for the next 10 minutes. Instead of just going into off line mode and playing my downloads. So my question are they truly downloaded? Why else would the app keep searching ‚Äúbuffering‚Äù. If you live in a non rural area I am sure you don‚Äôt even notice but us Northern California coastal towns do! I end up switching to google play. As I want to rock out before I have a hectic day working at the local hospital or going home to take care of my three awesome teenagers and hubby!
24,Bella6789012345,"July 6, 2018",5,"Amazing! And I have a lot of proof for it too! I love this app! It‚Äôs great for listening to your favorite music! It doesn‚Äôt turn off in other apps, on your home screen, and when you turn your device off. I‚Äôve used some other music apps and this one is by far my favorite, in fact I‚Äôm listening right now. However, they do send a lot of emails. I‚Äôm okay with them but if you don‚Äôt like them you can easily unsubscribe from the emails and still listen to the music. Also there are a ton of different kinds of music and whatever you like is probably there. They also personalize it to you and it‚Äôs great. If you don‚Äôt like their suggestions you can always search up something you would like to listen to and you‚Äôll probably find it. I am constantly on there listening to music and thumbing up all of the songs. You can thumbs up or thumbs down songs depending on how you like them. You can listen to all of your radios together or you can listen to your favorite songs on the thumbprint radio."
25,Stephymtz01,"August 24, 2018",1,Unfair! I‚Äôm outraged!! I am taking my business elsewhere. They don‚Äôt have a number you can call if you have a quick question and they drag to respond. I sighed up for the premium family plan and I was actually kinda excited about it. I had it for 3 months and had my sister and parents on it. Just two days ago they didn‚Äôt take the money and pandora asked me if I wanted to subscribe to one of their plans. I thought there must have been a problem with the card I have since it‚Äôs been acting up. I went to where you sign up to the pandora family plan and it asked for my log in information. I logged in and it said ‚ÄúUnable to subscribe to Pandora Premium Family
26,Musically Lost,"October 13, 2018",4,"Has something changed with the Pandora app??? Ive had Pandora for several years now, it is the free version. I have not been able to listen to my Pandora for over a week now. When I click into one of my stations, it doesn‚Äôt play. I can‚Äôt even click play, rewind, or fast forward. The icons are there but not highlighted. I have logged in and out. I‚Äôve turned on/off my phone and I‚Äôve even deleted and reinstalled the app. I‚Äôve done this multiple times and still nothing. When I exit out of the station to browse for other options, it says buffering...your station will be right back. I logged out of my account and had my son log into his account on my phone and his account works on my phone.  I contacted the help support explaining all of this, and they sent me the troubleshooting information from their website after I explained I‚Äôve already done all of the troubleshooting. The email they sent me said, if I was still having trouble, to respond to their email, which I did , and I still have not heard anything back. Horrible, horrible customer support."
27,buddhaman79,"March 22, 2019",5,"No radio zone. I put off moving from Fl to the backwoods of western North Carolina mostly because there was only talk radio and two country stations (I don‚Äôt like country at all) but as fait has it, I moved up here anyway in ‚Äò07 & lived in misery until my first smart phone & finding the Pandora app in around ‚Äò14 & found again what living was again. Than in mid 2017 I was working at a house in the middle of nowhere for weeks on end. I got no service out there & the free Pandora didn‚Äôt work out of coarse too. At this point I decided to brake down & get Pandora premium for off line playlist. I have had Pandora premium since that time and have never looked back. I love it, it is my personal radio station. Like I own my own station & can play whatever the hell I want. A few things pop up (can‚Äôt play due to licensing) but it‚Äôs rare enough & it usually doesn‚Äôt last long. Dollar for $ it is the best app I have for sure. I literally have it on 12 plus hours a day. From Hannibal Burris to Bradley‚Äôs Postmodern jukebox & 99.9% of anything in between."
28,Cappel üíú,"February 22, 2020",4,"This is an annoying bug that needs to be fixed First off, I am only fourteen years old and I don‚Äôt have a bank account yet and I love the little sessions you get so you can listen to specific songs but there is something really annoying I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs just my phone or if it is pandora but I hope this sounds familiar. So I go on the half session (I watch an ad first üôÇ) So anyway the ad ends and it turns on my favorite song!

29,JungKart,"September 29, 2019",5,Best thing Ive had Pandora for YEARS.  I finally upgraded to a paid account instead of free.  I wish i had done this years ago.  I have always loved pandora and have found so many of my favorite bands through Pandora.  Now i used Pandora as a ‚Äútherapy‚Äù or ‚Äúmedication‚Äù. Im a combat vet with serious PTSD and until very recently have been able to go without any pills due mostly to Pandora.  I know that sounds silly but I legitimately medicate with music (specifically Pandora).  I use special stations ive set up when i paint as well for inspiration and to keep the right mood or frame of mind or energy for the style im working on that night.  Pandora has been and is currently a godsend for me and theres a decent chance I wouldn‚Äôt be here without it.  Im a lifetime customer and incredibly appreciative of all the free years i accessed it as well.  I hope someone up top reads this review because i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you have no idea you‚Äôve done in my life.  Tearing up as I write this lol...THANK YOU.
30,Mekjgyujb,"December 31, 2017",5,Why I love this app I love this app because I can have songs when I have my phone off so it will be able to not die when I don‚Äôt have a charger and I can play other games while I‚Äôm listening to music music which is amazing I love your guises game will app Pandora is the best app I‚Äôve used and I hope everyone gave you five or four stars not three are down I don‚Äôt think you guys deserve 32 or a one star I think you guys deserve five or for at least four but I say five I like how you guys can do an interview I likeI like how you can change times and you want to have different thumbs up thumbs down I don‚Äôt really like the ad but that‚Äôs OK you don‚Äôt really have ads and I like how you can just search Music or little search I like how you can change sounds and you want to have different thumbs up thumbs down I don‚Äôt really like the ad but that‚Äôs OK you don‚Äôt really have ads and I like how you can search Music or a little search you know I mean and I really like it I‚Äôm glad I can tell you guys this
31,DrewDoehring,"March 18, 2018",1,"Newest format is a let down. I have been a paid customer for three years and have used Pandora for long since I chose to pay for it. The ads never bothered me even as the frequency increased, but I paid for the service because I liked the random music sequence. A few years ago I‚Äôd select or make a radio station and then keep editing it. A song might become too repetitive so I‚Äôd just mark ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this song‚Äù and my station would start playing different music. I was able to get my stations tailor made to my liking through this setting, but since the beginning to mid 2017 I had this feature disappear on my iPhone.

32,Nixienymph,"April 14, 2018",1,"Great Disappointment I was really loving pandora. Playing music I knew and finding new music to love and then after a few weeks it started crashing. I followed the support directions: stop and close app, reopen: same error. Turn off device, turn back on: same error. Delete app, download app: same error. The support team the put a ‚Äútrace‚Äù on my account supposedly. No error for 2 was. Then the error started back up, so I went back through the above steps, as advised by support who had a ‚Äútrace‚Äù on my account. None of the fixes worked, and the ‚Äútrace‚Äù apparently means nothing. Support then advised that I need to delete the app, and connect to my computer to sync my iTunes, then download the app...blah blah blah blah....Guess what? None of that crap worked either!!! Huge waste of time and effort! I fail to understand how iTunes is at fault, but pandora surely isn‚Äôt going to solve any problems, let alone take responsibility and fix their app. No no no...instead they are busy creating ridiculous processes that fix nothing, and useless updates. Great job pandora! Some may pay for the service, and perhaps that prevents the crashing, but there are other apps that provide much more, that are stable, and don‚Äôt play games through their support team."
33,Zachpool,"June 5, 2018",5,"Great app Best music streaming app I‚Äôve used. The low monthly payments are great for ad free listening, offline listening, and unlimited skips. In addition to the low (optional) monthly fee your playlist is fully customizable to your music taste. If you hear a song to many times you can simply press I‚Äôm bored of this song and it won‚Äôt play for a while. You can add many different genres to one playlist or you can add different bands of the same genre to your playlist. The app selects music related to the bands, songs, or genres you‚Äôve selected. You can also mix it up and shuffle all your playlists together! Great app will use it forever thank you Pandora! The only thing I would like to see is macros or hotkeys with the volume button so I can skip and thumb up songs without stopping what I‚Äôm doing and simply use volume controls via side of the phone or volume control buttons on my headphones.(not sure if this is already a thing from what I‚Äôve seen it is not yet a thing)"

But how can you see the difference . I‚Äôm basically using two stations because I can‚Äôt figure out how to navigate or try new things. I have premium and I think I should have a much better experience than this. Maybe an online how to use the thing and separate it Into free, plus and premium . Meanwhile I have two stations that play a variety around that artist and I like that. The other complaint I have is some of the artist choose that artists music from the worst they ever did, I‚Äôll use Stevie Ray Vaughn for an example. The ‚Äú station‚Äù was playing all from an early album almost anyone who knows his music would cringe. Many of those same songs are on live albums and are so much better.

Being able to share new music with a friend and hear them say ‚ÄúThis is awesome, I haven‚Äôt heard this before!‚Äù is all thanks to Pandora and has fed that hipster pride that many who enjoy music feel when they‚Äôve ‚Äúheard something that you‚Äôve probably never heard of‚Äù.

After years of free listening with manageable ads I found that the number, frequency and length of ads went up exponentially about a year ago. So I decided to upgrade.  Commercial free and offline listening were big selling points to me. However it‚Äôs not really commercial free is it? I would have to play an ad to replay a song and sometimes even to skip. And don‚Äôt get me started on the offline listening feature. I am a commuter and am often on the subways and I find that not only do I have to have turned on the offline listening option before I‚Äôm underground but I only have a selection of maybe a dozen songs in that playlist. If I don‚Äôt switch to the offline listening option before I‚Äôm out of range there is no offline listening for me at all. Instead I watch as Pandora skips and buffers through dozens of songs as I listen to the complaints of commuters around me. I can‚Äôt honestly note a praiseworthy aspect of Pandora right now and since I‚Äôve canceled my subscription I have such a sense of alleviation. I am no longer wasting money or energy over an app that doesn‚Äôt work."

Just because you have to pay for no adds and offline use and all of that junk it's a great app. I've been using it for I think a year, maybe more, maybe less. I don't know. After the resent update, Pandora forces me to use my free trial for Pandora Premium. I was saving it for my next summer vacation so I could really enjoy it instead of just knowing I'm wasting my week of an amazing Pandora experience. At first, I had absolutely no idea what was going on and for a minute I thought I had bought the subscription and being a fourteen year old, I was super scared that I was charging my mother's bank account. So, Pandora, if you read this, your app is amazing, but please take away my free trial and let me save it!! Thank you! I haven't had any crashes, like ever. (The teenager came out sorry) so I'm not afraid of that. This app really deserves 5 stars except the free trial thing. Okay, so, all in all, this is a great app and you should really get it.

41,Verito Rose,"October 1, 2017",5,"Veronica Andrade Pandora filled my summer with exquisite songs and I found a lot of new music to listen to. I enjoyed the pleasant slow walks with quick steps in between running to soft calming tunes. I enjoyed the late night parties to Spanish music. I enjoyed the summer mornings spent playing basketball with my ball dribbling to the beat of drums. I could not put it into better words, but I felt like I was in love every single day in July and August. I cannot believe music has come this far. I cannot even trace where I found all such great music. The world definitely does not deserve Pandora because it gives more than we give back. I don't even have a favorite song. Because of all the great music Pandora has to offer. Rather I have a myriad of favorite songs ranging from R&B, pop, classic rock and romantic music. With artists like American Authors, OneRepublic, Pink, Daft Punk, and Taylor Swift. And favorite movie soundtracks like Paper Towns, Love Story, and Valerian.

This is really annoying because the USB allowed me to control Pandora through the radio/remote/device it was connected to and now I have to use an AUX cord. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and done everything I can think of to no avail. The Pandora Premium pop up is really annoying - shoving it in my face isn't going to make me buy it. Also, why, if I pause Pandora for more than ~15 minutes, does it ""refresh"" and start playing a new song?! On the app and site it does this. I don't want to pause it for long periods during songs I like because I'm afraid I won't be able to listen to the rest of it! And your ads are WAY louder than the music, which is REALLY OBNOXIOUS because I'll be jamming out and suddenly I'm blasted with a commercial (I'm already hard of hearing, you don't need to make it worse, kay thanks) Fix these issues and you'll be golden üëåüèº"

But asking me to upgrade for, what is it, less than five dollars a month 600 times in one day isn‚Äôt going to make my budget magically change to where I fee comfortable adding five dollars a month to it. Not quite a top priority right now with my bills. And why does the app crash in the middle of a song quite often on some days? I‚Äôd like to be able to search for an artist or a song by that artist and at least have that particular song be the first song I hear.

45,ThePowerful,"January 31, 2019",3,"What happened I used to love Pandora because it was free music that played all my favorite music and had a wide variety of music from movie soundtracks to music you hear everyday on the radio. But this past year or so Pandora hasn‚Äôt been the best. For one it used to have a problem where it would just shut off for no reason at all but that problem seemed to get fix. But now there‚Äôs a problem with loading the music, sometimes radio stations won‚Äôt load and you‚Äôll either have to play with a couple of other stations and then go back to that one. I understand the concept of liking songs and hearing similar songs like that one you liked but they continuously play the same liked songs all the time. I realized that you‚Äôre better off not liking or disliking a song if you want to hear different music. The last thing is the ads. I know that‚Äôs how you make your money and a lot of us can‚Äôt afford to pay for premium but it‚Äôs annoying when you can only listen to 2 songs before an ad pops up.

As for the biggest issue right now is pandora when apple maps is open. It completely messes up voice turn by turn and you only get audio prompts which defeats the purpose of eyes on the road. No matter what settings i change in Pandora or maps, no voice turn by turn possible when playing a song. This doesn't happen with any other music app...just saying.

Another is that they change songs and artists, for example on my station they replaced Avicii‚Äôs Wake Me Up with a version done by another artist and now I don‚Äôt get Avicii‚Äôs version but they still have his version in the app. Thirdly is the seeming lack of variety that I get. There‚Äôs been several times where I like a song by an artist and don‚Äôt get any other song by them, even though Pandora has more songs from them. I would hope that these get resolved at some point, and would also like it if they added more songs from artists like the plenty of TheFatRat songs there are that aren‚Äôt on Pandora.

Would be nice to enjoy my pandora premium out on a walk with the dog without my phone and using my AirPods or out for a jog. iTunes does support a stand alone app for the watch so you can listen to music through AirPods without connection to your phone.

Although annoying enough on its own, when it occurs during podcast listening it's infuriating. The app skips the remainder of what you are listening to and then LISTS IT AS LISTENED TO. Which means requiring the listener to find that podcast in an incredibly non user friendly search function, then try to remember approximately where they got interrupted, then try to get the podcast to play from that point without buffer skipping again. This is annoying enough but becomes impossible to do safely while driving, the main time that I listen to podcasts."
70,Boe25,"February 20, 2018",5,"9 Year User I love Pandora and have used some of the same stations for years on my computer and phone. I appreciate that the music adjusts to your responses to tracks they suggest. More often than not, when I thumbs down a track, Pandora suggests a song that follows the same style I am looking for that the song I disliked. It is so slick that you can create inspiration for a station and Pandora finds the songs similar to them for you! The only bummer is that with the last update, the option to add variety was taken away-or I haven‚Äôt found it, yet. I have found some new artists I would like to add to one of my longest running playlists, and may just need to be patient. The updates do tend to be more user-friendly than the last, but they are vastly different. So prepare to be on your toes. :) Overall, this music app has been dependable for me for nearly a decade!"

There is no possible way for me to know the algorhythm, or whatever Pandora uses to choose selections for an individual station. I have been actively using the ‚Äúthumb system‚Äù on a particular station for probably a couple of months now and still choices slip in that are nothing like all the  ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù choices I make. This may be a lot to ask of a ‚Äúfree‚Äù station, but I‚Äôd even be willing to pay to have my station more streamlined without ‚Äúthumbs down interruptions.‚Äù I want to set a sleep timer and not wake up the next morning hearing all manner of music I‚Äôd prefer not to hear and have to go through thumbing down again to maybe achieve what the station was before all those other choices crept in. Pandora offers a unique service, and I‚Äôd like to see this option offered for a fee."

I will never update again once I get it back up unless I'm forced to. Also how are we supposed to trust paying for the premium version if the app isn't promised to work when u update it.

At random times the screen will dim and ask if I want to pay for premium or a ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô option will appear under the ‚ÄòFree Trial‚Äô option. Almost every time I go to click ‚ÄòNo thanks‚Äô the screen reloads (not sure what to call it) and the ‚ÄòFree Trial‚Äô button moves to where ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô was. This is happening as I‚Äôm clicking ‚ÄòNo Thanks‚Äô and Pandora registers that I want to start premium and my iPhone pulls up the purchase confirmation screen.

I could live with the fact that in the last update (or maybe the one before that) my music would refuse to play after switching between apps or sometimes even stations. I would shut down the app and renter and playback would continue.

That‚Äôs after being a paying customer for years and years. If anyone at Pandora is listening, you have some internal decision making and design problems you probably should take care of. I think this is going to be a case study in how not to do product and how to drive customer loyalty away to competitors. 1) The app now tries to trick you into upgrading to the most expensive plan by showing albums (vs radio) at the top search results that can only be played on that very expensive plan. It‚Äôs purposeful, deceitful, and your product management and design team should be ashamed. What do you think is going to happen in the long term once you lose customer trust? 2) The Apple TV update has completely ruined the app. Before the update the Apple TV app was great, exactly what it needed to be. Now... it‚Äôs basically useless. It‚Äôs bad. Who made this decision? You should seriously question your product management and design leadership if they‚Äôre making decisions like this that will materially impact your business."

The only way to fix it is to delete all of your stations and start over.  Or, again out of nowhere, it will decide that some random station that you never listened to is now a great addition to your offline stations - which are full of random songs from random genres that make no sense on any of your stations.

The pop up happens so much and gets in the way of trying to change the station, or thumb up/down the songs..super annoying!

I know that I for one have songs that I like and songs that I love as well as songs that I dislike and songs I hate. The suggestion is that instead of just thumbs up or thumbs down there would be an advanced option. This would optimize my listening experience because being able to choose how much ‚Äúthumbs-uping‚Äù or ‚Äúthumbs-downing‚Äù a song will effect the rest of the music on my radio.

There are good stations and we enjoy the selection. However, that‚Äôs where the good ends. Now they‚Äôve nerfed it HARD. My boyfriend cannot listen to his music upstairs while I listen to mine downstairs. It kicks one of us off. Honestly, we should be able to both listen for $5 and some change. This has only happened the last few weeks or so. Very annoying and inconvenient. Another issue is the offline stations and switching between offline and online mode. It always switches to one specific station coming off offline mode. It never goes back to the way I had it before. There are also a lot of repeat songs when going on offline mode. Sorry, but we live in a rural area where there is spotty service, and I would like to not have to constantly worry about and check on Pandora because it can‚Äôt get the stations right.

I have always had some issues when connecting to the car system, I do not know if it is from 2013 but since the last update I have the problem that when connecting to the system with the USB cable, the entire car radio system stops working.  I have to turn off the car, take out the key, open the door as if I were going down and then turn it on again so that the system works again.  If I use Pandora only via Bluetooth, I can listen to it even though it does not show me the description of the song on the dash screen.  Could you help me with this?  I love Pandora.

It seems that for every three songs you listen to they will then have you listen to two commercials. That was annoying but I had invested my thumbs up on enough songs that I had a great mix of music to listen to throughout the day with not many repeats so it seemed like starting over would be a pain. This week I‚Äôm considering deleting it and finding an alternative. I don‚Äôt want to start over but they‚Äôve started playing a commercial that is entirely in Spanish and I hear it like every thirty minutes. I can‚Äôt understand a word of it other than the company whose ad it is. In these times of political correctness I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people who will be a negative Nancy over this review.

I‚Äôll open it and the songs are fire one after the next and the next they all are random songs that don‚Äôt even correlate to their station. For example I downloaded Pink radio because ya know, wanted to listen to Pink. 2 of her songs came on in between two other random songs played that were not Pink. After the second song of hers finished, it was a complete shuffle of the most random and unrelated songs to Pink Radio. Kelly Clarkson, Taylor Swift, Tina Turner, Carrie Underwood... Carrie Underwood? They‚Äôre completely different genres of music, how are they on the same station. So I obviously skipped. I skipped 25 songs before I was out of skips, not even until I got to the next Pink song.. with my unlimited listening hour. Long story short, Pandora‚Äôs efforts to match songs to the specified station or genre or artist is absolute trash. Why is it so hard to play Pink songs on Pink radio? I will never understand the inability.."

Now as a pandora Premium user, the thumbs up button is on the bottom right corner with the skip button to its left.

Lol you will never get my money after playing tricks like that. But to be honest it might just be Apple that's the failure and pandora might just be taking the flack. I'm becoming more and more afraid of using this app. Recently it keeps trying to charge me for things without me even being in the app. I will have it playing and when I arrive at my destination I will open my phone and see a message in the app stating failure to purchase or charge your account.

This app brings me music even when I know my reception is slow or I won‚Äôt have any at some point. One thing that‚Äôs like the downpoint in the app is the fact music plays almost too much the same when played for a long time. The playlist plays almost identical, and that‚Äôs said without exaggeration, the songs repeat too much and that makes the playlist sound over and over. After a long while of playing the app music repeats.

108,ndaghed,"December 29, 2019",1,"Done, done, and done. I have had pandora for several years and I have enjoyed it in the past as I don‚Äôt download music and rely on this online radio to listen to music. Lately this has been a nuisance. I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding why it plays me the same songs all the time to the point that it‚Äôs maddening. I have had to dislike songs that I originally enjoyed bc of overplaying. If I want to listen to the Coldplay station I get the most random songs or just the same 5 songs by Coldplay. I‚Äôm sorry but Coldplay has like 5+ albums currently why not switch it up???? If I want to listen to Arabic music I get maybe one song in Arabic and then it‚Äôs all Spanish songs. HOW IS THAT OKAY??? This baffles me and makes me irrationally angry. THEN, if I want to listen to a certain decade again it‚Äôs the same songs on a loop. There were more than 10 songs that came out in the 2000‚Äôs decade or was I living in a different reality? There is no variety and no sense at all in pandora and at this point I think twice anytime I want to listen to music. Uninstalling right now."

If I change stations, the screen will freeze, the previous song will still be playing and the only way to stop it is to reset the app, which forces me to start that same song and guess what, I can‚Äôt change stations or it will freeze. Sometimes it will even completely force close and I get to listen to that song I didn‚Äôt want to listen to yet again.  I am in a state where if I‚Äôm driving I have to be completely hands free, so that‚Äôs really difficult in the car where I‚Äôm trying to troubleshoot and not get in a car accident. I can‚Äôt use this app any more if it‚Äôs going to remain like this. Yes, I have tried deleting it and adding it back in. That made it worse. I have tried it while connected to WiFi.

Everyone I talk to about this app says ""you don't have any control!"" but you do. Why I say this is because it is just like a radio station. You have no idea what song is coming up next! But Pandora does pay attention to your thumbs ups and downs so if you do those then you can narrow down to your favorite songs while hearing some new ones. I also love the bedtime timer and alarm. Just lay back and relax while listen to your music while it automatically turns off depending on when you want it to. And then you wake up to the music you love when you want to. Also Pandora gives you notifications when an artist you like goes on tour or releases a new album."

First world problems, I know, but I‚Äôve been paying for Pandora for years and this has never been a problem. Just thought they‚Äôd fix it within a few days‚ÄîI‚Äôve been checking daily for an update.

112,Kirbosa,"December 11, 2017",2,Not worth the money. Pandora has a good selection of music and is a good when you first open the app. Only problem is after you‚Äôve been on one station for awhile it will start mixing crap into your favorite stations. My Queens of the Stone Age Station plays more Deftones Station than my Deftones Station and vice versa. And it‚Äôs not unlimited skips for 5 dollars a month. It‚Äôll play songs that fall into the genre when you first open the Station and after about 5 songs it‚Äôll just mix crap into it. After about 20 skips it won‚Äôt let you and say ‚Äúcannot skip this track due to licensing agreement‚Äù. It‚Äôll also announce that a station isn‚Äôt available sometimes after only one or two skips. It has a lot of potential but it seems like they just advertise as unlimited by mixing in corny independent bands that are distantly related to your station‚Äôs genre. I have a ‚ÄúSeasons in the abyss‚Äù that is supposed to play slayer and related bands and it hasn‚Äôt played a slayer song the last couple times that I selected it.
113,george0225,"May 11, 2018",2,False advertising I‚Äôve used pandora since I can remember I‚Äôve always held it in high regards when it came to a music streaming service which is why I decided to start paying for pandora plus. However ever since I started playing the unlimited skips never works I get one of two things that happens either a licensing song that I have to listen to which ok isn‚Äôt that bad or I skip and it buffers for five min between songs and won‚Äôt stop it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs purposely not wanting me to skips song I don‚Äôt want to listen to. I though it might be my phone so I bought a new one same issue. Idk if there is something wrong on Pandora‚Äôs side but i am finally gonna give up and start looking for a better service that gives you what they advertise truly disappointed and dissatisfied with pandora and I hope that they can fix this problem. I gave them two stars which is one of the lowest rating I‚Äôve given and if this problem would get fixed I would gladly fix my rating.

However, I recently switched back to Pandora from Apple Music due to Pandora‚Äôs convenient free radio and cheaper upgrade options if need be and come to find out, Pandora doesn‚Äôt allow access on the Apple Watch Series 3. I have the Pandora app on my iPhone, but cannot get it on my Apple Watch Series 3.

This one station has incredible and I highly recommend it. It is called XXXTENTACION radio. And something else I enjoy about Pandora is that after you like a few songs it gives you some of the best songs you‚Äôve ever heard because it is so good at determining what music you‚Äôre into.

117,Lightnluv,"November 24, 2019",2,Dissatisfied I‚Äôve had the $4.95 a month Pandora plan for a couple of years. I work in my studio for 4 - 6 hours most days. Yesterday in four hours it played six songs (at least) two or three times. C‚Äômon -with all of the songs most artists put out Pandora repeats and repeats in one sitting. I think it‚Äôs a plan to make people upgrade to the more expensive plan. If they don‚Äôt want people to select the less expensive plan they shouldn‚Äôt offer it. 
118,Legal!,"October 21, 2019",3,"Unintuitive I like the music aspect of the app, but it needs an overhaul in the user/ control aspect.  The controls are not user friendly. For instance, the repeat button is next to the thumbs down button; it‚Äôs too easy to accidentally bump the thumbs down. Chances are if you want to hear a song again it should be next to the thumbs up button so that if you accidentally bump it it‚Äôs all good. The thumbs down button should be on its own to prevent unintentional dislikes. Also, many of us are too poor or stingy to buy and Apple Watch and still run with our phones. The controls are so little that it makes liking, disliking, or repeating a song difficult while running. Perhaps they could include a ‚Äúrunning mode‚Äù with big buttons instead of the tiny ones they have at the bottom of the screen.  None of these things would be that hard to implement but would be a big improvement on the user experience."

Every time I connect to a Bluetooth such as my Kenwood in my truck, my older speaker and my brand new one, and my skull candy‚Äôs over the ear headset I have to restart the app up to 5 times. On top of that just about every time I‚Äôm on a Bluetooth device my phone will randomly reboot (sort of) and then I have to reboot the app afterwards and then starts right back at the beginning of the track that had just ended or right at the end. I thought I had found a way around restarting the app by just switching stations but then found that I no longer had control of the app ( such as >\=, skip or even volume) from the Bluetooth device or even the phone itself.

122,Acschnorr,"May 10, 2018",4,"Too many repeats Honestly, I love Pandora. I use it everyday. The only downfall I have for it, is that the same songs repeat in the playlist you make. When I hit the like or dislike button for the songs, it seems like it really picks the most off the wall songs to play after that. For example. If I like a certain song, more of that artist and artist alike start playing. Great. But its still the same old songs repeating. When I hit the dislike button, granted, it doesn't play again, but then it starts playing songs that sort of matched the one you didn't like. Instead, I think they should just take the song out of the mix instead of trying to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù a song you took out. But honestly, thats my only complaint. The commercial breaks are not that often, and dont bother me. Id rather have the breaks in order to keep pandora free."

I hate listening to one genre and with Pandora, I can personalize my playlists to incorporate a wide variety of music.

When I thumb up, yes I like the song, but I‚Äôm trying to give feedback and not hear that song repetitively. I would like to discover new music based off my feedback. My other suggestion is that there be an option to allow/not allow explicit content for each playlist rather than as a whole. There are certain playlists that I listen to around little ears that I would like to turn off the explicit content, but would like to allow the explicit content on playlists just for me."

It would be nice to put a particular song on. Also I have different stations because i feel like listening to certain songs at certain times but you seem to merge my stations. I will be listening to a station and a song that I put on one station will show up on another with a thumbs up and I know I didn't do that for that station. Also I have been noticing that a song that I gave a thumbs up to is playing as a different version but with the same name and a thumbs up and I never even heard that version before and I never hear the original version that I gave the thumbs up to again.

I had the app open while I was cleaning today and I heard Dvorak‚Äôs symphony from the New World three times in a matter of two hours. Some stations also are just very limited.

I‚Äôve used pandora for years and have enjoyed it for years but as of late I‚Äôve been having a problem where my phone will slightly crash out and close the phone and pandora making me go back and open the app back up. The song that I was on no matter how far in I was resets and I have to listen to it again or skip. That‚Äôs the main issue I‚Äôm seeing but there is one more. Every once in a while the app will tell me a station isn‚Äôt available but it will let me open the station for two songs or so then kick me out again.

But when I watch the ad for the uninterrupted listening for an hour, I don‚Äôt like that a voice tells you to return after you have watched the ad. I still love Pandora, but the voice is the annoying thing. I love how you can use however many stations you want so far. Still haven‚Äôt figured everything out. :) I listen to it so much. I am even listening to music on Pandora while writing this review. So it is good, you can listen to albums in order if you watch an ad before listening. Also, if you thumbs up or down, based on that, it can sorta determine what genres you like. They don‚Äôt just have artist stations. They also have stations like this year in pop, which I like. They also have teens and tweens radio, and so much more!!!"
149,Chestnuts are crazy,"October 6, 2019",5,Best app ever! This is the best app ever for playing music! It is so good and is really well put together. The people who made this app did a really good job! I always hear my fav songs on this app and I just love it! The only thing i would say is annoying is all the ads. Usually it doesn‚Äôt bother me but sometimes it gets really annoying and I don‚Äôt want to pay money to make the ads go away. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say no one wants to pay! Especially if we just want to listen to some music and have a good time! If this could get fixed the app would be even better! So somebody from the team who put this app together can you please take my advice and fix the app just a little. Overall the app is really well put together and the best! Thanks.

When listening to pandora on iPhone 7 Plus with AirPods, and the screen off, my battery goes from 100% to 0% in two hours. The battery gets extremely hot when this happens. I‚Äôve tried other headsets, same issue. I‚Äôve tried other music apps, no issue at all. Considering I use pandora at work for 12 hours a day and pay for it, I think it‚Äôs time I cancel my pandora subscription. The app is useless. Not to mention that when it did work, if I pause the music on break at work and then resume it later, it reloads the app and starts playing the same music over again. Nobody wants to hear the same song over and over again. The app should be capable of picking up where it left off, even if it‚Äôs paused for 20 minutes.

When it got to the point that I didn‚Äôt even want to use the app any longer, it was way too hard to manage my subscription. I would‚Äôve only checked for a cheaper plan, or possible to put some kind of pause. However, it was so inconvenient to find that I decided instead to cancel completely.

This is the reason I only used SoundCloud the past month because u can skip, replay, rewind, like, make playlists for absolutely free, so if you guys make it the way premium is for free it will be the best Streaming app ever and you will have more income then ever from people moving to Pandora That is premium but free right away"

Everything was great. Now I just purchased Premium to get the latest and greatest everything and am so disappointed. It‚Äôs the same songs, over and over and over. You add a new station and hit shuffle all, and it‚Äôs the same 4 stations shuffling over and over. The same bands always come up, over and over.

Another issue is variety. After a while it seems as though you hear the same 15 to 20 songs in rotation. Despite the fact that I have 20 artists on my Pandora app. For example if you put nicki Minaj or cardi b, you‚Äôll hear the same 20 rap songs before it comes back to super bass or you‚Äôll hear the same 15 Spanish songs before you come back to bodak yellow.

Well guess what, that artist sings jazz sometimes, and now suddenly your station is nothing but jazz! Oh, you‚Äôre heard that song by your favorite band 1,000 times this week so you downvoted it, well Pandora thinks you hate that entire genre of music now! Station transformed.

I have to cross my fingers and hope it works. I have several days a week where it doesn‚Äôt work at all! I‚Äôm seriously thinking about canceling Pandora and going elsewhere! This is horrible for a paid subscription. I have a new iPhone and I do every update. I hope and pray this update works! This has been going on for months! Also, can they let a person thumb up or down a station without having to log into my phone each time...can anyone reply to this, I‚Äôd like to pay for a different station that works."

I‚Äôve noticed one cd that I used to listen to on pandora, every song is censored, and do you know how annoying that is in rap music? Way to ruin the song. People that are easily offended probably aren‚Äôt listening to rap anyhow, so leave the songs alone and let people decide how they want to listen to their music. I‚Äôll probably just drop the service and subscribe to a different app if this continues. Leave music how the artist intended."

The up and up and up of services is a timeless classic to economy. Maybe flat rate fix to pandora allowing everyone to upgrade at a reasonable price would be the future instead of you get this or that. Maybe the people using the app, just like you made reviews easy could just as well swing on a ballet and make that a reality just as ""you"" ""pandora"" want the money."

For example when I want to rock out to David Bowie (on my dedicated David Bowie channel) it DOESN‚ÄôT mean I want to listen to ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù from the Beatles next. If the only way those two are grouped together because your data bank links two artists/groups together from England who happened to be performing the same years- that‚Äôs HORRIBLE!! They‚Äôre not the same genres! It‚Äôs pretty much the same complaint for all my channels. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll tell me that prime or whatever is better.

I was excited to see Pandora finally offer an offline listening option. I travel a lot and need my playlists to be available when I‚Äôm in airplane mode. I particularly enjoy listening to my ‚Äúliked‚Äù songs. The problem is that when you ‚Äúlike‚Äù a song, it often doesn‚Äôt download to the offline playlist and for some dumb reason this renders the entire playlist unplayable until all of the missed likes are downloaded. Pretty useless if you‚Äôre on an airplane.

And being its no way for me to contact them (no number on their website), I‚Äôm forced to just delete and cancel the app from my phone, in hopes that they won‚Äôt charge me anymore. There are too many other music apps out there that wouldn‚Äôt blindly charge you for services you didn‚Äôt request."

235,Happytraveler099,"April 23, 2019",5,"So much music so little time I love all kinds of music early jazz, classical, alternative rock, classic rock, ska, hip hop, bee bop etc etc. But too much of any one thing is a drag. Pandora lets me pull in a huge variety of music and put it on shuffle and groove through my day.  We have a little Dvorak, followed by Django, and then Depeche Mode. Plus I get to hear a lot of music I would not have found on my own. I am endlessly entertained throughout my day."
236,Lille_3,"May 19, 2019",5,"Pandora Rating Love this app, although it has a lot of ads when you don‚Äôt upgrade. It‚Äôs so cool that they give you times when you can have an uninterrupted hour with a 15 second add. I also enjoy the skips and replays with adds. You can also have a 45 minutes with no adds and you can listen to whatever you want. I do not like how some songs are ‚Äúrestricted,‚Äù meaning they don‚Äôt have the license to play them except on radio playback. I wish you got more skips and replays during an hour. The feed button is also annoying because it had a red dot and it is ALWAYS there. I live how there are so many radio stations, though. Pandora is a greats app, with few problems."
237,Avid Music Lover in Sc,"September 30, 2019",4,"Enjoy the app immensely.. Still trying to get accustomed to navigation in the app, but I have found its user friendly and easier than most music apps. I love the way it will play similar songs once my list ends...thought that was awesome. It will play n play if my Bluetooth is sufficiently charged....all in all I have enjoyed the music thoroughly. It helped the cleaning and unpacking from my recent move into a new apartment. So I appreciate the app because it‚Äôs the first time I tried a streaming app versus one where I cud download the songs. I‚Äôm sure this app has the downloading options as well, just not enough time to look at different avenues it has. Will get the different options down I‚Äôm sure with a little time on the app. Thank you sincerely "
238,Robyn Studios,"June 30, 2019",2,"Could be SO much better! I have noticed over the years some really strange behavior with this app. For instance, when you create a station from an artist, the station BARELY plays that artist. This has happened with EVERY station I have created from an artist, so I know it isn‚Äôt a fluke. Also, it will randomly start throwing horribly inappropriate music genres into a station that I have established, for instance, I have a station created from an indie folk group, I‚Äôve had it for months, all of a sudden, Pandora is trying to play horrible rap songs! I only have so many skips, and had to use them all to get rid of awful drake songs!! Is this a ploy for me to switch to the paid pandora? On my ‚Äúthunderstorms and nature sounds for relaxation‚Äù station, I will get loud obnoxious, obscure 70‚Äôs rock! How disturbing when I‚Äôm about to fall asleep!! I don‚Äôt get it!!! Pandora gets a 2 star because of this!"
239,beachgrl88,"December 11, 2019",5,Best music app out there!!! Best music app out there with no buffering issues.   A plethora of music to choose from.  I enjoy the ability to create my own music play list and that within itself is a very calming and relaxing option for me and to sit back and listen to my enjoyable music instead of having to  fast forward on songs/ music  I don't particularly enjoy is a must.  Definitely makes my days go by  more peaceful.  I don't even watch TV anymore because this music app is so enjoyable. I listen to it constantly so thank you Pandora for always being on top of your game by providing such a genre of music options.  I love the 70's and Southern rock etc and country both  new and classic.
240,Mr.Goodfeels,"November 22, 2017",5,"Good and bad Has countless channels to choose from, all the music you'll ever need, great quantity music, detailed description of some artists, and occasional subtitles to songs. But there are a few BIG setbacks. Once you ""thumb up"" a lot of songs, it seems to just play them, even though there are more songs by the artists. After a while of listening to a particular station for a particular artist, it eventually stops playing songs by that artist, never fails. And the skips, putting a limit on the skips is ridiculous, sometimes it just doesn't play the songs I'm in the mood for, but once the skips are gone it's not an option. Great app overall, just has big downsides."
241,Brastedhouse,"November 28, 2017",5,Update broke a Pandora Update: Deleted off iPhone and reinstalled.  Works fine now. Seems funny since it just updated to the same version an hour before. A pain but it‚Äôs back. 5 stars again. 
242,Spartalagon,"February 3, 2018",3,"Great for finding new songs! I just got a four month free subscription to Premium, so I have been on this app all the time! I love their smart thumbprint technology; I have it where radio plays the songs I like and others that I learn to enjoy! Although, a lot of the songs I want to listen to are not available for immediate play, and I have to listen through on radio to play the songs I want. Not very efficient when I want to listen to a song immediately. I know that it‚Äôs not possible to get the rights to all songs, but that‚Äôs me. Also, I noticed when I open up one of my stations and try to scroll through my previously played songs on that station, the screen goes white. It doesn‚Äôt crash, but I can‚Äôt look at anything. Just a small bug that needs to be fixed. So far, good experience."
243,Petinia,"February 17, 2018",1,"Awesome BUT clingy! I love Pandora. For the past decade, Pandora has tirelessly served the perfect song for every mood.

244,jpfmft,"April 14, 2018",5,Getting worse Used to love Pandora but they keep changing it! Can‚Äôt even find my stations now that I spent years customizing!! I am a premium customer but I think I‚Äôm going to cancel my subscription because the latest updates have totally screwed up this app! It used to have a scrolling alphabet so you could find your stations but they remove that. You also used to be able to sort the stations five a day you added them or in alphabetical order and maybe you can still do that but I have no idea how because they‚Äôve completely changed it. Why do companies change something that‚Äôs working well? Here‚Äôs a little tip newer is not always better
245,taj d,"May 26, 2018",2,"Custom stations I've enjoyed Pandora for several years, I especially like how I could keep my stations true byüëçüëé. About a week ago that all changed."
246,EasyCircle,"June 24, 2018",5,Large selection of today‚Äôs hits for free Pandora allows you to listen to pretty much all of today‚Äôs hits for free. By viewing a very short ad it unlocks Pandora Premium which allows you to listen to specific song or album for an hour. You can also upgrade to Pandora premium for a monthly fee and do away ads completely. It is nice that they have a free option. 
247,EchoIsLost,"November 8, 2018",3,"Less Variety, Please I understand the value of varied stations, especially ones made from specific songs, but I never get what I want when listening to artist stations I‚Äôve had a while. It would benefit the app, I think, if artist stations actually focused on music by that artist like it was supposed to - on my Nightcore radio I‚Äôve only heard songs from 3 or 4 albums of theirs, when there are 34 in total! I‚Äôve tried deleting all likes save songs from the artist, but that doesn‚Äôt help. If you could add a feature where you could request specific songs or albums to play more frequently on a radio, or just narrow artist radios to focus on the artist, it would be much appreciated, because right now the radios are so frustratingly varied that I don‚Äôt even see the point of the ‚Äúadd variety‚Äù feature."
248,Mr Piggy 2U,"December 25, 2019",4,Why Not VPN? The Pandora app is great! The reason for dropping my rating down to four stars from five is not because of the app. It‚Äôs because of the following Pandora service.
249,Hollyelese,"October 8, 2019",2,"Terrible app experience When I began paying for the first level of subscription, my only aim was to not have commercials/ads and have access to offline listening.  I really appreciate the pandora service and use it frequently at work, home, and previously, in the car.  Both worked great for a while.  For about a month, I have not been able to access offline listening.  If I am not connected to WiFi, the app says it can‚Äôt connect to pandora.  Period.  No offline listening anymore.  It won‚Äôt communicate with CarPlay either.  I have deleted and reinstalled. I wrote to pandora support and got a response that that offered no solution and thanked me for my patience.   That was 3 weeks ago and my patience is gone.  If you want offline listening, this is not your app.  If you want technical support, Pandora is not your service."
250,Lurgeon,"November 10, 2017",4,Great with following suggestion I greatly enjoy being able to listen to a plethora of songs and podcasts. My favorite station is the thumbprint station which plays every song I have ever liked. 
251,Tipatea,"November 21, 2017",1,Just lost a dedicated fan.... I have used pandora for years and stuck with it because I loved how over time it learned what my music interests were from station to station.. it‚Äôs the main reason I hadn‚Äôt switched to another more updated music application because i didn‚Äôt want to put the hours into finding the music I enjoyed through another app.. as of late though it‚Äôs become absolutely unbearable.. the application consistently freezes up and forces you out of the app.. it has loading/buffering issues( which isn‚Äôt related to connectivity or WiFi connection) its the application it‚Äôs self.. I can get through maybe 5 songs before it‚Äôs completely frozen or forced me out.. so it‚Äôs time that I say goodbye to pandora and find a different music application to you... moral of this paragraph.. if you want to listen to music you enjoy without much fuss or inconsistencies.. this is NOT the app you are looking for.

They always commented that they loved my choices of music to blast out those speakers to get me going and keep going until I was done with my shift.

And what I hear that You Tube is the next best app. This app Pandora has never failed me like ever , not in the 4 or 5 years that I‚Äôve used it. I really enjoy this application , I probably use this app the most out of the apps on my phone. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it, like seriously.  Just being totally 100% honest.

Why can't I choose to have my stations ( whether made from a song, an artist or a genre) in alphabetical order like in Pandora/Pandora Plus??? It makes finding the exact station that I want to listen to very difficult, especially if it's hooked to the car!   Scrolling down thru over 100 stations can get real old FAST!"
259,butterfinger0231,"February 23, 2020",5,"Just a few things :) I really love this app! I love jamming out to my music anywhere. I don‚Äôt pay for premium, but the ads really aren‚Äôt that bad; they‚Äôre actually quite catchy. One of the only problems I have is that you can‚Äôt give a song a thumbs up from your lock screen. I don‚Äôt know if that is just a thing with my phone, or the app, but it‚Äôs kinda annoying to have to enter the app to like a song. One other thing, is that some stations only play like 10 songs I‚Äôve given thumbs and then it plays songs that really don‚Äôt relate to the station at all (ex. Disney Children Radio). Other than that I really love Pandora, and would recommend it to everyone :)"

First of all, I don't appreciate being charged the same amount for less (I am not interested in a ""thank you for listening to my music"" by the artist when I paid $5 for no interruptions). Second, what happened to the variety?! I listen to the same freaking songs EVERY TIME I play a station. And RARELY do they ever add newly released songs to my stations. I'm likely moving on to someone else; maybe iHeart Radio will provide for me what Pandora used to be able to do."

Currently, the app is 100% updated, but I‚Äôve been running into major bugs. Such as when I open the app, it freezes and won‚Äôt play any music. Or another instance,  such as when I go to access a certain playlist, the app completely freezes up and crashes. I‚Äôve run into an enormous amount of crashing and freezing recently. Normally, I have to reload the app 3-4 times before it completely works and doesn‚Äôt freeze up. This happens with full internet access and on LTE, so it‚Äôs not an issue with my WiFi or data access.

First of all, I‚Äôm paying for this service and I‚Äôm now getting garbage support with minimal function. For the past couple of weeks your offline capabilities hasn‚Äôt worked at all. For months when it would switch to offline if would start playing a station I wasn‚Äôt playing or haven‚Äôt played in months. So I have to change from being safe and hands free to fixing it back to the correct station.  Then after playing for a few minutes it would all of a sudden just stop playing and a pop-up would say ‚Äúyour current station is not available.‚Äù LIES! More and more bugs. Now your offline plays when....NEVER! When I tried talking to someone from cs they were the absolute rudest. No resolution at all they just laughed. This company is becoming a joke. After years of having Pandora I‚Äôm so angry that I wasted my money on your BS. THANKS FOR NOTHING."

The first issue (no stations appearing even though they were downloaded) could be fixed if I go online and then switch back to offline (obviously defeats the purpose of having offline listening capability). I haven‚Äôt yet figured out a fix for the second issue (having 6 stations appear but having to guess which 4 work). Honestly, this is a subscription I regret getting."

However it now has 2 main issues, 1st and foremost somewhere between 25-50% of the time it will lock up it does it while playing so that you can‚Äôt pause skip repeat or any other function and the only way to make it stop playing is to quit the app, it also does it when it‚Äôs been paused I will come back to it and it will show the song I was listening to and say it is playing but it will buffer indefinitely until I either quit the app or exit the station start a new one and then go back to the one I was trying to listen to. The other issue is lately the recommendation engine seems to have gone off the rails, and I can thumb down 10-15 similar songs in a row but it seems determined to play songs that are not at all fitting for a given station."
272,cls-review,"December 2, 2017",2,"Last update - very disappointing Since the last update a week ago, Pandora is definitely not functioning properly.  It does freeze when first opened on my iPhone, then have to shut it down and open again.  Also, it no longer allows me to jump to the next song (which we pay for) using my ear phones; I have to remove the iPhone from it‚Äôs holster and do it on the screen (very annoying when it‚Äôs being used during my run or workout times).  Also, I cannot pause it, it has to be completely shut down from the iPhone.  Previously when the ear phones were unplugged, Pandora would pause automatically, now it just keeps playing through the phone speaker.  As others have said, very disappointing especially because it worked well before the most recent ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô.  Please fix it!!!!"

The app will not play music when initially opened, I have to swipe the app closed. When I open it a 2nd time, it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance that it may or may not play. I have to swipe the app closed AGAIN and usually the 3rd time is the charm. BUT, once it plays, it only plays for for around 30 seconds to 5 minutes before it shuts down and causes my phone to either reboot or freeze up. After all that, then it will usually play for a while.

I‚Äôm currently without WiFi so Pandora is the only music app that works for me so I have to depend on what comes in their radio. My issue is they REFUSE to play any Halsey on my Halsey radio. When I first created it they played her songs and I thumbs up‚Äòd all of them. Now they never play any of her music. Not a single song. I feel like they‚Äôre doing it on purpose. I literally skipped through a hundred songs hoping my favorite Halsey song would play and they never played one of her songs despite it being her radio. They actually repeat other songs like ten times that I didn‚Äôt even give a thumbs up instead.  Not to mention a lot of the songs that they‚Äôre playing are nothing like her music. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me.
275,Fiona At Night,"January 10, 2019",4,"No ‚Äúmove‚Äù or ‚Äúadd variety‚Äù anymore.

Maybe you can still do these things on desktop but I never use that; can‚Äôt at work anyway. Disappointing. Can‚Äôt imagine why they removed those great features that make Pandora so special. "

I actually got up and went running after hearing the house playlist, something I originally had NO intentions of doing that day.

My issue is that when I needed to switch to family premium I have to not only cancel my current subscription but wait a MONTH to upgrade to family???? Why? My current subscription was fine when my husband and I was in the same truck (we are OTR truck drivers) but now that we are in separate trucks in different parts of the country this is unacceptable. We are both in and out of bad reception areas and have to tag team when one or the other can listen to Pandora. I‚Äôm paying for a service that is no longer useful.

However after listening to stations I find that they get very repetitive, and that's even after adding variety. Another problem that I have is in what classifies as a certain genre. I would really like to see the algorithm that decides that. For example, I was listening to the Pandora Screamo genre station and got multiple songs not even close to hard rock/screamo. The second song I got was Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol and then a few songs after that I got Secrets by One Republic. Neither of those are even close to the hard hitting music I was expecting.

It's totally totally worth it but one of the original draws for me to use pandora was the quick access to lyrics when available. Clicking on the lyrics tab(with actual preview of first few words) goes to a blank page. Even songs I've looked at before. It's a major bummer to have to use chrome separately when the lyrics never did that before. I hope the devs can help with this.

Nope not pandora.  I literally counted 23 freaking songs in a row I thumbs down, had to get skips and than the kicker that made me close the app.  It went to a song I tried to thumbs down and ‚Äúbecause of whatever rights‚Äù it was unable to skip the song.

Why? The screen didn't go away until I disabled the offline listening feature. Thanks for the notice, but go away and let me just listen to the music. Why was I being nagged so much about a default setting? How did a team of developers decide that it was a good idea to completely interrupt the user experience just to show some useless message about a setting being turned on? "

I feel like the app could definitely be more sensitive to the songs that are thumbs down. The app is supposed to never play a song from the same artist if you thumbs down TWO of their songs. That‚Äôs absolutely not the case with the app. Some artists I‚Äôve given the thumbs down to AT LEAST 10 times so far. The other area that could be improve is more responsive REPLAY, THUMBS DOWN, THUMBS UP, PAUSE and SKIP icons on the main radio screen. Maybe icons that moved a little when you tap them? "

I swear I get the same ads so often, I can recite them word for word. I like to listen to music while I play video games and it gets really annoying when I get ads so often. It‚Äôs gotten to the point I may look at other music apps."
333,Joygirl Kitten,"December 1, 2018",2,Unlimited If you subscribe for the full price you read that you get unlimited skips.  But that is a lie you only get unlimited skips if there isn‚Äôt some licensed issue that prevents you from skipping a song for what ever reason you have.  And it is the only way if you want to play a playlist you created offline at least that is my understanding and if that becomes untrue I will come back and give the worst rating I can.  Just read the whole advertisement part of the terms and agreement.  And I have a problem with it because they say zero adds for premium but if you read they are still allowed to use adds for the same thing that you are trying to avoid so what is the point to upgrade to get away from the adds?  Zero means Zero not Zero except what we want to hear!

But lately, songs quit playing in the middle, or two songs will play at the same time. Sometimes Pandora will switch from my playlist to start playing random stuff.

Instead, my playlist is populated with thumbs up of stations that I listen to. There's NO option under""playlists"" to change this. If it continues, I'll be cancelling my subscription and looking elsewhere for my music. UPDATE: I emailed the developer. The problem was resolved by signing out then back in.

I grow up with AM radio and later FM with 8 track tapes.  Choices were limited by the radio station lineups and the budget.  I could only buy tapes when I could afford them.  Today a wide range of genre and quality of music is readily available.  I love listening too soft music like Loreena McKinnet and the soft hymns when I study or read.  It really enhances my concentration.  Thank you Pandora. Thank you Lord Jesus my God and Savior for giving us the ability to develop this technology.
381,Cflo1996,"November 9, 2017",3,"Love the app but issues are annoying Love pandora it‚Äôs great since it‚Äôs free. Kind of annoying that my today‚Äôs comedy radio station just like constantly repeats the same stuff. I like to hear the same songs but with comedy I can‚Äôt hear the same jokes all the time. Also, when I‚Äôm using pandora my phone literally restarts itself. It only happens with this app. It just shuts off the comes right back on then I have to reopen the apps, it‚Äôs usually just annoying but it‚Äôs very unsafe if I‚Äôm trying to listen to music and need directions while driving. I can‚Äôt just pick up the phone and restart my apps when I‚Äôm driving a car and it‚Äôs kind of hard to pull over randomly when you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going."

Many times, I don‚Äôt have a specific song I want to listen to and just want Pandora to surprise me. Unfortunately, i hear the same songs over and over now even if I setup a new channel. And lately, every time I open the app, I get prompted to upgrade to premium. STOP IT!!! It‚Äôs annoying. I said no the first time. I subscribed because I don‚Äôt want ads. And they make the ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù link so small, that I mistakenly press the wrong link to upgrade which I don‚Äôt want. Please stop this!!! I‚Äôm on the verge to just not use Pandora any more and look elsewhere. It‚Äôs so annoying that it made me write this review and I never write reviews. So please, with freaking sugar on top, stop freaking prompting me and just let me get to my music."

I simply want to give it a rest. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this track‚Äù feature enabled us to revise song rotation. Removing choice is a BAD choice."

If you don‚Äôt have the full version it‚Äôs not that big of a deal, every few songs there is one or two short ads and that‚Äôs it. They also offer one hour of free listening for watching one ad a lot. If you don‚Äôt get a lot of songs you like, try thumbing up and down, that helps A LOT. Also maybe you are on the wrong station and you should try another if that doesn‚Äôt work. One thing that can be improved is to make thumbing up and down when you are out of the app easier."

More importantly, I‚Äôm having to fully start/stop the app to get music to play or stop. I can‚Äôt use the play/pause button to work anymore. This was especially embarrassing at work today when basshunter started playing in my pocket as I was introduced to several high profile visitors!

It‚Äôs annoying and also, prevents the app from loading properly on Apple CarPlay, requiring me to physically dismiss them on the phone while driving, so as to get my station list to load on my infotainment system. That‚Äôs potential liability there...just a matter of time until they get sued for this ridiculousness.

The problem I have with it is that i choose a station i like very much and listen to the music but after a while the same songs are looped again. I like it at first because those songs are usually good. This becomes a problem when after the next five or six times i have heard the same few songs i get tired of listening to them. Then i am pushed to waste a skip on a song i have listened to multiple times before. Its annoying and frustrating because i didnt think its that hard to pick related songs for the station....

In addition whenever I play a song it‚Äôll play another song at the same time and I‚Äôll end up having to close out the entire app and reopen it just to have it do the same thing again.

It's a liability at the workplace and anywhere else you don't want everyone else to hear what you're listening to randomly. It does occasionally work alright as it should, but maybe 1 out of 10 times. As others have said, it just started adding songs from other stations into rotation, even if they are nothing a like.

While having complete access to playlists, unlimited replays and uninterrupted listening is really exciting, being unable to sort through 60 stations quickly and easily was a deal breaker for me.

I‚Äôve learned that the system learns about your preferences as you like and dislike and skip songs. Recently playlist was recommended based off my likes and I must admit it is AWESOME! For those skeptical, be patient. Cause soon you‚Äôll be jamming hard to songs you‚Äôve grown up with and new tunes that‚Äôll get you moving! Offline mode is great as well for when I‚Äôm not driving but taking the train or just in a bad area with horrible reception. I love PANDORA! And I‚Äôm sure you will too!"

Granted, you can go right back on the premium session but still. I also think that you should be able to pause your session because sometimes I am listening to the music but then I have to do something like eat dinner or something. This app is totally amazing and if you don‚Äôt at least try it.... YOUR CRAZY."

The current station used to be highlighted in blue, now easily finding your station is a thing of the past, especially since when you back it if the station homepage to the station list, it doesn't put you on your station. It starts you at the top of the list every time. And once you select a station it goes to this sort of homepage for the station then you have to press play again from there. I don't understand why they'd do that. It's just more stuff to do while you're on the road. Even using a hands free device, you can't quickly identify the current station, you have this needless redundancy when trying to get a station to play, it's ridiculous and causes your attention to be off the road for too long when using the app."

Instead of profiting from people and companies, why not get sponsors. Yes, maybe it is a difficult way to do it, but as an overall app for music we want to here music not ads as soon as we skip 1 song. And instead of having advertisements have sponsor videos. Yet, you are giving credit to your sponsor for helping profit the use of pandora. I‚Äôve been thinking of ways to improve apps and I believe if you stopped changing cosmetic and change the quality. Because people want quality not quantity. I have many other ideas but that‚Äôs just one or two."

I used to really love pandora, I had many stations tailored for different tastes and occasions. Now that I have an Apple Watch and use it to stream music I am forced to use other services. My only options are Apple Music and IHeartRadio. Apple Music has been pretty pleasurable and I would go as far as saying it is a better source for music.

For instance: if I‚Äôm listening to Beyonc√© radio they play a lot of Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, Megan Thee Stallion, City Girls and etc. If I‚Äôm listening to R Kelly radio they play Drake, Chris Brown, Tank, and Jodeci, but it‚Äôs only the songs that‚Äôs top the charts.

I loved the original Pandora. Today pandora isn't what it used to be, i hear duplicate songs in a play list, every other song is a 4min ad on something that is followed by another ad, the sound quality is terrible and the ad sound quality is higher quality and louder in volume.

Whoever said pandora learns what you like has lied to us all. If that were the case then why would it play every song on a bands album that I keep thumbs downing. Clearly I don‚Äôt like that band stop pushing it on me. On top of that if you do not thumbs up at least 80% of the songs they push on you it will discontinue that station. I‚Äôve even had it delete my station bc i was thumbs downing all the garbage songs it would randomly throw in there. I pay money for this app I should be able to listen to what I want and thumbs down what I want without it kicking me off my station. Please except people aren‚Äôt going to like every song they have pushed on them and fix this issue.

The app will chime when you lose service and then play a whopping 2 songs off-line. This is awesome if you lose service for less than 10 minutes... or take a 10 minute flight somewhere (the ad boasts a woman excited to listen off-line while flying). UNFORTUNATELY, I don‚Äôt want to listen to 2 songs on repeat my entire drive to work. So I cancelled my subscription.

It need to seamlessly switch between online and offline mode. If I lose signal while listening to a station that‚Äôs also saved as offline it shouldn‚Äôt switch stations to a different offline station or just freeze when signal drops. Second main problem I have with pandora is the thumbs down to tailor a station to my preferences. Lots of bands have a few bad songs, giving one thumb down shouldn‚Äôt remove the band entirely from the station. Would also be cool if I could add or suggest a band/album to be part of a station. Make those changes and you‚Äôve got a 5 star app."

Even if i close out of the app, while i have it on my station, then remove it from the background, THEN turn it back on, it starts the app just playing the podcast. There is no way to edit podcasts, and select to remove them from your lists! This podcast option had taken over the app that was supposed to be designed for listening to music.

This is where the flaw comes in: why can‚Äôt you thumbs up/thumbs down songs from the lock screen? This would be such an easy feature to add that would help users immensely. The whole point of saying whether you like or do not like a song is to customize the station to play the songs you want to hear. Having to unlock your phone every time to do this is very cumbersome.

487,jseri,"February 2, 2019",2,"What happened This used to be an awesome app. I upgraded to plus and it got worse. It spends more time buffering then it does playing music. It buffers in off-line mode as well, which defeats the purpose of off-line mode. It continues to mix music and genre in stations where they do not belong. If I thumbs up a song or group on one station (ex. Gun &Roses) I do not need to hear it on my 70s Rock station. Off line mode will switch on if I lose a station for a quick moment but will not when in a dead zone. I am really disappointed and feel this app is gotten lazy. I appreciate that it was a great app at one time but I feel that the good things got worse and the worthless crap gets upgraded. Go back to doing what you did so well and stop fixing what is not broken."

I have dozens of finely tuned stations that I absolutely love. My boyfriend and I both share the same account, and both listen to Pandora all day at work- every day. We pay for the Pandora Plus package for the unlimited skips and no ads. But because we share, this means we are typically both listening around the same time- which has never been an issue until recently. A new rule has been implemented that allows only one listener at a time and is constantly kicking one of us off- and in my opinion, it‚Äôs worse than having ads that interrupt my music. I am canceling my subscription and changing to another music source. After 14 years, i am extremely disappointed"

Pandora aggressively promotes the Premium program as one can download up to 10,000 songs on a device for offline listening.

I will still enjoy using the regular pandora with adds and so fourth, the premium is just a little too expensive for a month to month subscription, my gym membership costs less a month."

Much better then playing cds cause you get to play and practice all different styles of different drummers which is more fun to me. I guess if I wanted to try and memorize a song a cd might be ok but I been playing since the dinosaurs been around & still can‚Äôt read music but music is about enjoyment and if you don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm playing have another drink and I‚Äôll sound better & if you still don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt listen but as far as pandora goes they are great because of the great variety they play!!!!!

542,Funplay321,"December 3, 2017",5,Best radio ever You can make a station and slowly shape it however you want. You can even have a station of just the artists you like most and it'll pick around their genres. As you play and thumb up or down songs it'll play eventually only the songs you've thumbed up till new songs from the artists or genre come out. It only does this though once you've gone through all of Pandora's library from those artists or genres so it could take a long while or be very short depending on how new or old the bands/artists are.

There‚Äôs not really a way to get into new music :/. You‚Äôre lucky if they do play something new in a station. Some of the stations don‚Äôt make sense and have random songs that are in no way similar to the artist. Some play old songs from the early 2000 for artist stations like Rihanna. I would buy premium again but I couldn‚Äôt even save certain songs because of a license or something and if I‚Äôm going to have a music app I want to be able to get all the music I want.

Also, if a customer is aware of the ‚Äúevery hour commercial break‚Äù makes it a little less annoying for the user experience. Other than that the music algorithm is good.

For instance- I started a Rush channel and it might play a few Rush songs but then play blocks of weird Indy music from this decade. If you skip or thumbs down the channel crashes. I started a Sonic Youth channel and it inserts weird stuff like The Mamas and the Papas and Pink Floyd. I can‚Äôt thumbs down either of those enough. Sonic Youth and Pink Floyd DON‚ÄôT GO TOGETHER!!! Foo Fighters same deal- it might play 3 songs by the Foos total and then 53 random songs (yeah I counted) and if you skip the channel crashes. What gives Pandora? Rush and The Happys aren‚Äôt in the same genre so why do you persist to pair them together? I bet a Millennial programs the play lists.

It also seems like the amount of skips have decreased as well. It may seem a little unfair to only give them one star but as a long time listener I don‚Äôt want to feel like I am being bullied in to the payed service by changing what I‚Äôve come accustomed to.

Now it quits playing music if I hit my home button to check anything else on my phone. I‚Äôm not about to sit around with my phone unlocked and screen on with pandora open every time I want to listen to a song. Lastly, it will not display any information or respond to any commands made via Bluetooth. Whether it be my headphones, car stereo or Apple Watch nothing works with it. "

The app on my iPhone has always worked until the most recent Apple update. I‚Äôve been trying to patiently wait for them to work out the bugs and fix it but it has been a month now at least and no fix!! Stops playing music, kicks you out, freezes and won‚Äôt let you play and now it won‚Äôt let me connect to devices to play it through my TV or other speakers. It‚Äôs not my phone bc it is doing it to my husband too and it does it on multiple devices. This is ridiculous and especially frustrating not being able to put on Christmas music at Christmas time and looking ahead Christmas morning!!! Please fix it!!!"
595,How many people have mr handy,"March 25, 2018",5,"A very helpful suggestion So I was in the shower, listening to Pandora (as I always do), and 3 songs, in a row, played that were in my music library. I only got Pandora in order to hear music that‚Äôs NOT in my library while I‚Äôm showering. So I had an idea that you should include in an update. A menu will pop up, asking you for permission to scan your music library, and once it‚Äôs done, it will exclude those songs from the songs that play on the application, regardless of the genre or artist. Other than that, great app. Highly recommend"
596,LeilaniRoseA,"May 8, 2018",2,"Gets crappier every year I‚Äôve had pandora for YEARS, however, they get worse every year! More and more ads every year, the ads that they play are the most annoying things ever. If they‚Äôre trying to sell something, they‚Äôre not doing a good job. They‚Äôre not comedic, entertaining, and they make me hate the company. I‚Äôve also noticed, if you listen to pandora long enough it‚Äôll even start playing the same songs you already heard some hour prior. It also takes up too much battery power and will restart my phone and/or laptop. The last two years I‚Äôve listened to more radio than pandora, and pandora was supposed to be the alternative to avoid crappy/long commercials."
597,sigh--,"March 28, 2020",4,hi lol The app is pretty great! I just have a few complaints:
598,Solapas865,"March 19, 2020",4,"Singers I gather that the more likes I give to a singer the more of his/her songs will be played. I would like it if that wasn‚Äôt the case because then the variety of songs that could be played in say under Donna Summer, are minimized and narrowed to the one singer that has received the most songs. So fir example, I select Donna Summers as a favorite singe to listen to; Pandora will play her songs and those of similar singers like Steve Wonder. If I give Steve Wonder likes, Pandora picks up on that and will proceed to play more songs of Steve Wonder than that of Donna Summers though Donna is the singer of choice. Hope this helps. Thank you."
599,iPhonePhive,"March 1, 2020",1,Pandora misses the point of offline mode! With Pandora‚Äôs offline mode you can‚Äôt use the app over WiFi. Having to manually toggle ‚Äúoffline‚Äù mode on and off when I leave my house or job is annoying. There should simply be an option to ‚Äúnot use cellular‚Äù rather than complete offline mode. How does Pandora not realize this? If I want to listen to music all day it‚Äôs not realistic to do so using cellular when I have WiFi available. But this nonsense of toggling ‚Äúoffline mode‚Äù several times a day is ridiculous! I also don‚Äôt like that I can only thumbs up station songs. Why can‚Äôt I thumb up a genre song? I don‚Äôt listen to stations. Stations are a dime a dozen. Stations come and go. I don‚Äôt want to waste my time creating a station only to have it gone in a year.

Apparently the only way to write a bug report now is by writing a bad review on the app. I am a Pandora Premium user, because I have a long history, not because Pandora is better than other music services. Pandora appears to have stopped improving the algorithm appears, and mostly just plays songs that the app wants you to hear, not any real machine learning. I WISH THERE WAS A BUG REPORT IN THE APP.

I have to switch to some other part of the app (like the ‚Äúfeed‚Äù or ‚Äúprofile‚Äù) then back to stations, at which point it gives me the alert screen telling me about the ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù feature.  Only after dismissing the alert does the app take me to a populated list of my stations. Every. Single. Time. It‚Äôs annoying enough I‚Äôm thinking about not using the service anymore."

My WiFi is on by default to connect my job‚Äôs WiFi and my home‚Äôs WiFi but it continues to do this. Because of this I lose the whole day‚Äôs worth of music and can not backtrack to the last few hours to see what I can replay or book mark or thumbs up. It‚Äôs actually very frustrating to hear that stupid offline mode sound when I open the app daily. "

I primarily listen to music from downloaded playlists I‚Äôve made. Now, after I updated the app a week or so ago, the app has been seriously messed up. I‚Äôve never had any trouble skipping a few songs at a time, but now suddenly the app won‚Äôt allow me to skip the majority of my songs. I shuffle my playlist of 100+ songs, and it ends and turns off after playing 3! All my music takes forever to buffer even if I‚Äôm on wifi or on offline mode. I‚Äôve checked my account and I‚Äôm still paying for Pandora Premium, so that‚Äôs not the issue. The recent update has been incredibly frustrating. Please fix these issues Pandora!"

Leave it alone! But more and more they want to control everything you do and how you do it don‚Äôt get me wrong I do like Pandora but geez this is getting ridiculous and the fact that more people don‚Äôt notice it just shows me that we‚Äôre all just a bunch of lemming

Also, some stations seem to play the same songs in the same order every time I listen to them. I‚Äôm canceling premium to see if it goes back to the pandora I used to love.

I don't lose any progress on anything and reopening the app starts off the song I had been listening to from the point my phone restarted.

I don't like how some unrelated songs just randomly come on though. It's kinda annoying. I also think that, the   ads are really annoying and repetitive. My suggestion is to only put one ad after a few songs instead of putting 1 or 2 ads after, about 2-3 songs. But other than that this app is amazing and I highly suggest it. "

If you try to use from infotainment screen in gmc it launches but wont play anything because on your phone that ad pops up with the button that says skip to pandora. You have to unlock the phone and click the button. Not a very safe setup especially when the goal of carplay is to make driving safer based on the theory your not getting on the phone itself. The other issue is once it is playing a song, if you skip the song, there is then a delay in playing the next song because  the screen changes back to the full station list then back to the new song, not a huge delay but still far from working like it should."

Also when I download music to take offline it works absolutely fine but the moment I restart my phone the app erases all my downloaded music. "
699,UprightSinger,"June 13, 2019",2,"No go for the iwatch Purchased the monthly service because it is the only music streaming provider other than iTunes for the iWatch. I recently upgraded my phone to the iPhone X and now no songs will load from Pandora onto my iWatch. The whole reason to use your service is to have music from the watch while running while away from my phone, if the music doesn‚Äôt load or there is no way to chose what songs or playlists should go onto the watch it serves no purpose. Frustrating. I‚Äôm going to wait a month to see if the app updates and than drop because if I can‚Äôt play music without the phone nearby I don‚Äôt need the service. Otherwise the music is great. Thanks"

When i open the app to skip, see the album cover, read background or whatever there is an ad and I close it, but another one pops up! It happens about 3 times in a row. It's annoying and I always accidentally click the ad. But all in all it's a good app. Great songs, unlimited stations, everything's fine except a couple small things that I could fix by upgrading. I guess that's how business works üòÖ"
701,Og. money,"September 30, 2017",5,"Tim I love Pandora, it is a great way to listen to the music I love. I think it would be nice to have a station in each genre that plays the new hits so that you can load that station and add your selections to your normal play lists. That would be better than random new music playing on your selected thumbs lists. All in all Pandora has been great! Thank you for all your work in keeping up this software a good company wants to know how their guests are feeling and makes changes to accommodate the reasonable requests of their patrons."
702,TxTeacherGuy,"November 12, 2017",3,"Controls Often Fail I love the free music and the commercials are totally fine. However, the controls are buggy. Often, I have to force quit and re launch the app two or three times to get the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button to work. Once playing, the ‚Äúpause‚Äù button will not work. The only way I can get the music to stop is to force quit the app again. Then it stops. Because of this using it in the car through Apple CarPlay isn‚Äôt viable. Using the app on my phone playing through speakers has the same result. Force quitting to make the app respond. Please fix ASAP as Pandora is my go-to for streaming at home and in the car. Please!"

Suddenly not being able to access this is very upsetting and has totally thrown our routine off, which is a huge deal for a kid with autism.

However they‚Äôve lately launched a user feedback community and in late 2019 and early 2020 have really fixed CarPlay, added station personalization, and revamped Apple Watch function. If they keep on this trajectory they could really eat away at the other music apps. Keep up this progress."

You can restart it but when we are in the pool this is a problem to get out very time it happens. I didn‚Äôt have this problem when I had my Netgear router only when we changed to eeros mesh network but it does not happen with Apple Music so we have determined it is not eeros or the receiver. It has to be pandora by process of elimination. I don‚Äôt know if pandora made changes to their app since July but it is a problem now and we will be changing to Apple Music.

The most recent update is absolutely unusable. The song will play for 10 seconds and then stop. Every time. Rebooting the app does not fix it. It does it every time. I‚Äôve had issues with Bluetooth connection with Pandora since I started using it. It‚Äôs amazing that they‚Äôve never fixed it. It‚Äôs only gotten worse. Absolutely horrible.
751,ficklenotion,"March 31, 2018",3,"Paying for no ads, but they still advertise I love Pandora, always have. I love being able to select a band based on my mood and have the rest of my music planned out so I don‚Äôt have to download music and create my own playlist, HOWEVER; the company recently (within the last few months) started running advertisements on my paid subscription. I‚Äôm not being forced to listen to :30 of consumer ads, but I don‚Äôt want to hear :10 spots by bands promoting a tour, information about different station that I‚Äôm not listening to, or a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù from the band for listening to their station.

Since I have been listening to relaxation and spa radio to fall asleep I will suddenly be jarred awake by trumpets blaring and loud ad voices. It‚Äôs just like TV when the commercials are louder than the shows. It would be nice if pandora could ease into the ads instead of assaulting my ears and waking me up. I thought I would give it one more try at night but have decided I will only listen to it occasionally during the day when the ads don‚Äôt bother me as much. Otherwise the music selection is great."
753,bell pernson,"June 10, 2018",5,So good This is such a good app because you can listen to all of your favorite music so I love it and now with pandora plus it allows me to go off the Internet and still listen to my favorite music I love this app because you can roam free with the choices of music that you like and you can explore new things and in if you‚Äôre in a party mood just set it to party and you got it and if you‚Äôre in a mood turn on some fun music and have a dance party I love this app because it‚Äôs so much fun and it has always my favorite music

755,Dunnfamily4,"September 18, 2018",5,Only one I use I like how you can like songs and it plays songs like it and it usually is right. I have saved stations I listen to a lot! It saves time skipping trying to find sometime I like. The ads are sometimes annoying but I understand why they there. They give you trials to try different plans you may like. I‚Äôve trialed one other radio but was disappointed compared to pandora! So I‚Äôve Never wanted to try another. I‚Äôd say that makes this an enjoyable good ap. Rarely crashes. Try it out

I gave this app five stars because I know it is something I will use in the days and hopefully years to come.
758,Maro2222,"January 24, 2019",5,Most used app I use pandora whenever I want to listen to music (majority of the day M-F). The commercials aren‚Äôt as bad as listening to the radio ones and don‚Äôt last as long. Only downfall is after you start liking songs on different ‚Äústations‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt keep them separate you just start getting a blend of everything you like no matter what station you have chosen for your mood. But I‚Äôve found a few new bands / songs I like from letting it play for a while. By far my most used app.
759,Fran in Colorado,"January 31, 2019",5,"Struggling with Pandora I have had this service for quite a while and used to be very happy with how it worked.

Now that I‚Äôve gone back to my old channel, Hillsong Christian music, I keep getting Hispanic worship music, which I have repeatedly given a Thumbs Down. I‚Äôm over it! This is my FINAL month!

I tolerate the blue cross and hospital ads for now but it's just laziness that I haven't signed up for the premium service for $5 a month and added download and no ad service. Music and artist notes are good to excellent, with just a couple of exceptions noted. Pandora plays in my workshop and around the campfire when not playing myself. Really excellent work by the pandora boys and girls. Highly recommended."

Crashes all the time, doesn't always download the music I ask it to, when opening the app it does not go to the current song playing.

I really don‚Äôt want to have to go back to Slacker Radio. There has been many years I have enjoyed Pandora, but after I switched to Apple, it doesn‚Äôt want to cooperate."
764,jjaken,"November 20, 2017",1,"A Pandora user since 2008 This is the worst state Pandora has ever been in. I've been using Pandora since before it had an app. This app is obnoxious to use. It started with an incessant pop-up asking me to get premium. The pop-up disables the entire screen until it is dismissed. There's also a ""feature"" to disable the screen when I have the phone plugged into my car stereo. That means that even if I'm stopped I can't change stations unless I unplug the phone first. The latest is a pop-up asking me to connect facebook. I don't even have a facebook anymore. Every time I open the app I have to dismiss two pop-ups to use the app. How can this be a good user experience?"

Now, when I start my car, I have to reopen the Pandora app and hit play - it won‚Äôt just pick up where I left off. The audio quality constantly resets to ‚Äòlow‚Äô when I set it to high. Worst of all, when I am driving the audio quality gets really bad and quiet requiring me to restart the app, every 5 minutes or so. That‚Äôs ridiculous! I pay for this service and it is becoming too dangerous to try to listen to music while I drive thanks to the very poor app quality. I have been with pandora since it first came out many years ago, but at this rate I am paying for something I can hardly use, even when I want to."

Pandora allows me to create multiple stations and add variety to each station and listen to it on shuffle to get a mix of everything from old skool gangsta rap to classic rock, oldies to current hits, alternative rock to 80's pop, and Jonny Cash to Jack Johnson. I have over 30 stations to choose from if I'm feeling in the mood for something specific. I like that I can choose and discover new music without being stuck on one playlist with a set song list."

Pandora allows me to create my own stations that they link up similar songs and artists that I may like based on my likes and dislikes. Throughout the years I have been introduced to some INCREDIBLE artists that have become some favorites. &I absolutely love the fact that they have such diverse music genres and something for everyone.

Thank you for making it possible to have the best music from all over the world and get the lyrics so you understand better the artist‚Äôs message . You offer all the songs made by the artist .

769,JamesP$,"July 14, 2019",5,"Station Listening I love Pandora! Music is great, the shuffle is on point and my overall experience is fantastic. The only constructive criticism (issue) I have is for listeners who play the same station on repeat tend to run into a lot of the same songs on repeat! A wider range or spectrum of music specific to the radio station being played needs to widen. Aka a larger array of music needs to be presented on each individual radio station! Other than that Pandora keep feeding the music nation what they want to hear!!!"
770,ChristianKustomz,"March 2, 2018",2,It's ok When I first downloaded it I was all gung hoe for it because let's face it...anything is better then iTunes and being ripped off by paying for every song.
771,CoolGamer6,"April 8, 2018",5,Great Music Station It gives you the chance to pick what you like. It adapts to the type of music you like. It doesn‚Äôt give station recommendations to you unless you were listening to that Lind of music. It also shows you how to find new music if you pick a station you can listen to it then if you like a certain song you can make that one song into a station and it will play songs that are related to it.  That‚Äôs why I love pandora and why I think it deserves a 5 star rating. :)

If you download this then your child could listen to ANYTHING! They could hear cuss words in some songs or even inappropriate sayings in the song. I don‚Äôt listen to those songs I just skip them. This app also takes internet so if you don‚Äôt have that then don‚Äôt get it because it will disappoint you. Overall I love this app :D I highly recommend this app. PLEASE GET IT :D

There is plenty of songs similar to Lauren hill yet I get ludicrous so I end up thumbing down everything because of the algorithms are crap. I‚Äôve decided to stop using this app. Maybe you need more artists or you need to pay artists better so you can get more music but Jill Scott has multiple albums and y‚Äôall only play 10 of her 30+ songs !?

I was also getting sick and tired of every 15 minutes seeing the recommendation to try premium. So I did, what the hell. Thought I could hear more original songs instead of the same 5 they always repeat, which I think is probably done on purpose. I was also stoked about being able to repeat the songs I like and add them to playlists, but guess what?  Already 5 times in the past hour have songs come up that I am unable to repeat or add to play lists due to licensing restrictions. So why advertise that ability when clearly it is false.

I‚Äôve gone from listening to Taylor swift and Mylee sirus (how ever you spell her name) to relaxing spa music. Neither of which I wanted to listen to. I use the shuffle option A LOT!

While listening if i could just look at the track that‚Äôs playing and designate it as a seeder or have a seed-search option for each of my stations.

Though there's one big annoyance that I hope the company can fix. It tends to skip a song if it is left buffering to long. This is a big annoyance for someone like me who lives in an area with limited cell reception. Buffering in and of itself is a pain but it becomes worse when you end up losing the song you were jamming out to. Fix it please!

Then it would as it always had go to a song I had given thumbs up to. I don‚Äôt mind listening to 4 new songs in a row.

That enables me to appreciate songs in various languages. What is amazing is that after all this time Pandora has actually figured out what kind of music I like. Good work Pandora"

Only reason why I‚Äôm submitting this review is because this has become a new ad I can‚Äôt get rid of.  Maybe this will make them think twice before asking me for my opinion next time lol.

833,Dudeman090909,"May 24, 2018",1,"Not worth paying for premium My main problem with pandora is the more you use it, the more it feeds you what you‚Äôve already heard. While trying to guess what you‚Äôd like to hear it nearly replays what it knows you like so after a while you will never hear a new song. Also the stations themselves do this individually. Put in a genre and it will find songs in that genre that it knows you like but no more. There is no way to find new music without knowing what you‚Äôre looking for also there is no shuffle option anymore. Pandora does not do anything better than the other major services and is severely limited for a paid service. I will find something else and put my money there."

Also, is there a way to search for your stations quickly. Like as in a search bar??? Gasp.

I cannot in good faith support an application which uses its platform to push a political agenda instead of providing the service I use it for.

I dont listen to pandora as much as I use to, so I thought it was some cool update or something but I just recently got billed for the pandora premium which I no longer have as of July of last year. I literally had $14 in my bank account for my daughters necessities til my next pay check and pandora just took it. I am not pleased with these actions."

Two problems 1) I have a punk rock station with over 300 songs set as favorites yet the app only cycles through 40 or so. 2) A station set up from a band, The Who, for example, plays very few of their songs. How idiotic is that? "

Ive been using pandora for a long while now, and I have always thought about if you guys could implement a way for me to put a station on a queue for after a song (or set amount of songs) plays, and switches to the station in queue. Would be most convenient for going to bed with music and wanting to switch to my primary station, but i left it in deftones last and change comes on and i want to listen to soad station. I can see this potentially help with less skips (by switching stations in the middle or beginning of a song)"

Also, when I'm listening to the top songs from an artist, it will play 3 or 4 songs and then play a  totally different artists song and then go back to the artist I was listening to. Other than that I really like the new features like being able to customize a station and listen to only that artist.

There is no way to sort my stations and it just lists them in reverse order of when they were created. This really doesn‚Äôt correspond to my preference level.

But on my Travis Scott radio, i‚Äôll very often have slow artists such as billie eilish play.

In the last year or so the adds have become overwhelming.  I love the content pandora offers but getting an add almost every song really puts a damper on what ever I am trying to do while listening to music (exercise, homework, relaxing). I realize it‚Äôs an incentive to upgrade, but it‚Äôs just been to much for me.  I‚Äôve tried to stay loyal to them but have recently purchased Apple Music and love the freedom it offerers. I will be bummed out to lose the deeply customized stations I have built all these years, but I will not miss those adds."

The monthly subscription is a little much but it‚Äôs not super expensive. If it were like $1-3 I‚Äôd get the sub. But for $5? I‚Äôll get it eventually but not right now. Gotta pay bills first. By the way the subscription is to remove ads which would be nice. I think they have some more features with the sub but I‚Äôm not sure. But yes it‚Äôs a great app for music.

All I listen to all day is what you know radio and I can‚Äôt find a better play list on any other music app. Love how they adapt playlists to my liking and how songs I dread to hear aren‚Äôt ever played by just a click. And new music they suggest are actually songs I want to listen to. This has just been the perfect app for studying-to-going to the gym or even hosting a party! This app revolves around your taste and that‚Äôs how you should always listen to your music!
926,camsuki_93,"October 9, 2019",2,It was great until... I‚Äôve been a premium member for a couple years now and I‚Äôve been loving it. I downloaded so many songs since I don‚Äôt have service at my job. But here recently the app has been acting a hot mess. I went and removed an album from my collection. Then suddenly it downloaded a HUGE bulk of my collection. Now I‚Äôve been trying to get my music back but it just keeps glitching or taking forever to download. Now sometimes when i try and play a song I‚Äôve downloaded it just says buffering. Which is strange because the song is downloaded. It would be great to have this fixed. I‚Äôve loved Pandora Ever since high school!

Much respect to the originality and creativity of the website and app developers. Top notch media/music player and user interface. As a long time fan and utilizer of Pandora it is still my favorite streaming media service ever created. I just hope they will continue to improve on their variety and expand on their musical library of available songs.

I‚Äôve been with Pandora for at least 12-years and during that time I‚Äôve been divorced, moved, retired, had grandchildren, attended funerals of family and close friends and throughout all those times, again, Pandora‚Äôs been there with what I needed at the time.

The first one is that the songs constant repeat say I‚Äôm listening to tunnel vision at 9:30am. It turns like 11:30am and it repeats that same few songs. I have had problems with it in the past. The second problem is I hear like 2 songs then there is commercials every time. I get that there are ads so you upgrade but this constant amount of ads just makes me not want to use pandora. Anyways I love the app just some issues need fixed.

I‚Äôm tired of the constant annoying advertisements for better Pandora service popping up as I‚Äôm driving. And of course, the font is so small I can‚Äôt see it‚Ä¶ especially when I‚Äôm driving.  The music selection is sparse compared to other apps and the app tends to forget the music that you like and dislike over time.  I‚Äôve also experienced an increasing number of hangs where I am forced to change stations in order to play a song. I still think Pandora is the most capable & affordable app for music but the minute I find something better, I‚Äôm dropping it."

Every time a new song starts, my phone starts the entire process of connecting to the car all over again. It is very distracting while driving and therefore useless since I won‚Äôt risk fiddling with it while driving. It‚Äôs also disappointing because I pay for pandora premium and am now paying for a service that I can‚Äôt use. This is only since the last update so I know it isn‚Äôt my car or my phone.

My only wish is that it was possible to make multiple mixed playlists, so that I can have a pumped up playlist as well as a relaxing mixed playlist. I also love the thumbprint radio and the fact that the stations constantly update and change based on what you like, dislike, and what new music is available. Great app!"

Having said that, for the past few months, since some apparent update Pandora did, the app is unreliable, unpredictable, just stops playing sometimes, freezes, etc. It‚Äôs been very frustrating and it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to reach a human being at Pandora to help.

The only problem is the app keeps saying I've reached a limit for listening to my playlists and etc when I have Pandora plus. So either there's an error or I just missed something about the subscription. I tried seeing if anything on your guys website could help but I couldn't find anything. But other then that it's an awesome app!!

When I log back into it, every single song or album that I had downloaded is no longer downloaded. Everything is still collected, just not downloaded. I travel for work, and sometimes my service has absolutely zero bars, so having it downloaded gives me the chance to listen to what I like and enjoy. It‚Äôs really beginning to get annoying when I have to go back through and redownload all of the songs and music every other day, especially when I pay for the premium subscription."

Spending way too much money on an album, to get that one cool tune, and find out the rest of the album sucked.  Now I dial up Pandora, and it's all there ready for the taking. So easy...so fun.

Even though I have several stations (with at least 20 musicians/vocal artists that are within the same genre), I rarely hear music by the person that the station is named after.

1087,Jwillgoesfast,"October 15, 2018",4,Good The service is good and the app is good. I just wish the app would stay persistent in the background. E.g. I take out my air pods and come back after several minutes and the music does not continue playing when I put back on AirPods like other music apps. Often the ‚Äúplay button‚Äù on the lock screen does not engage the app to start playing music either. Lastly the coolest feature ever could be to be able to upvote or downvote a song from the hardware buttons e.g double tap the up or down volume buttons.

Every time that I get comfortable with their organization they change it. First stations were organized by when they were created, then by alphabetical order, and now by most recently played. Everything is way too complicated for an app solely dedicated to playing music. I don‚Äôt care about playlists, or podcasts, or current hits. There are other platforms for that I just want to listen to music and relax. I love that I can discover new music on the app but figuring out how the app works each month is tiring.

Over the last year or two, the amount of ads increased so you now get them pretty frequently, which was a pain but if you wanted to use it a lot you could always get the paid version. The latest version seems designed with ads foremost, you have to click through some menus to get to the song that is playing. The ads that show while the songs play don't make the video ads any more spaced out though; you can expect about 1 ad per every 2 songs.

My biggest complaint is that the app forgets user tasks (eg, searching a particular artist‚Äôs catalogue, playing a particular song on a station, etc.) when backgrounded. It then kicks you back to the ‚Äúmy music‚Äù section while auto-launching a new song on the last station played. Quite annoying."

And since the iPhone displays the Pioneer splash screen I cannot control it from there either. In order to skip songs I have to do so from the iPhone lock screen.  After one song the display says Buffering until I change stations or stop and restart Pandora.  Have tried 4 different iPhones and all have same issue. Pandora fix your app!!!

The music that plays is all relevant to whatever station you are using, and after liking or disliking a few songs it‚Äôs even better at choosing songs, and even finding artists I wouldn‚Äôt have known."
1207,Shayneboogi3,"August 22, 2019",4,"So far so good I love this, I love music! However, they do concentrate on what you currently listen to; they don‚Äôt stray far enough away from what I prefer to give me ‚Äúother‚Äù choices or alternatives. If I have on Pink Floyd; I‚Äôll hear them, Nirvana, STP, and such. I guess what I‚Äôm saying is throw some other alternative-rock bands in the mix! I got away from listening to radio because of two major reasons: 1) playing the same thing over and over! Stop! 2) do the hosts or DJ‚Äôs ever shut up? Nope! Don‚Äôt care what they have to say, play the music."

But the only thing I don‚Äôt really like is the way it goes offline when ur in a car, or some kind of hotel. I personally LOVE Kpop, but when I want to listen to a song like 3RACHA songs there‚Äôs not many I can‚Äôt find much of them,especially ‚ÄúRunners high‚Äù from 3RACHA. See if pandora could add a few more Kpop songs for the STAYS and ARMYS and NCTZEN‚Äôs and DAY6 fans that would be AMAZING(I‚Äôm a boy group Stan, don't judge meh)! Anyways,Love pandora!"

1210,William kaiser,"December 26, 2017",5,"I like it It exposes me to new music for free. I select a song artist or genre, and they give me music similar to it. Not always the exact song, but often music similar enough that I can enjoy it. There is a like and dislike system. Disliking a song makes it so that you will never see it in that playlist again. Liking it mean you will see it more often and I believe it helps to narrow done or widen that channel towards what you dean is good."
1211,Working Sometimes,"January 13, 2018",1,Bluetooth Connection in my Car Like many of you I‚Äôve had Pandora for years. Not until a few months ago the Bluetooth connection in my car will randomly work. What‚Äôs the point of hands free if you have to constantly fiddle with it???? Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt connect. I have to use Bluetooth on my car and not the pandora connection. Which doesn‚Äôt allow me select stations nor thumbs down/up songs. I have an Acura TLX but I‚Äôve heard this has happened to many other makes and models. I recently got the new iPhone X thinking new phone old issue gone. Nope!! If you‚Äôre going to have Pandora in cars then fix it so we can use it. Geez!!

Almost after every commercial it stops playing music and start buffering ( no I don‚Äôt have slow internet!

Then in some instances where I want to add more skips and replays, I agree to watch an un-skippable ad, then when I‚Äôve done so it still doesn‚Äôt let me skip the song.

The problem is, when I listen to music(example: Disney (Children‚Äôs) Radio), it shuts my phone down after a while, then makes a sound similar to the one your phone makes after an update. Then I have to turn my phone on and restart Pandora. This is annoying especially when I listen to music at night to help me fall to sleep. But good job on anything else!"

Additionally, it has refused to remove a song from my music after I uncheck it multiple times. This doesn‚Äôt all happen constantly, but frequently enough to really tick me off.

Also, there are sooooo many interruptions in the music. Not conducive to use while driving since there are so many pop ups to close taking your attention away from the road. Pandora is going to be responsible for highway deaths in the near future. Then will get sued and shut down. So this commentary is for nothing. As with all Dot Com companies, they don't care about feedback...you are the experts and we are the suckers, I mean users, so why listen to what we have to say?

I would give it a perfect five but I‚Äôm not sure it has music programming that includes all of the music it should have. It seems repetitive in some situations almost redundant. I also wish that if you want to offer a free trial of the advertisement free radio just make it free. I don‚Äôt want to give credit card information and then potentially miss the end of the free period and get charged. For the most part i really enjoy it though.

And I know you might say the app was glitching so I tried a number of things like contacting Pandora, that didn‚Äôt work. I tried deleting the app then reinstalling it you can guess the outcome of that.

Pandora does not force you to buy the premium and all you have to do if you don‚Äôt want ads is you can watch the one hour uninterrupted ad and you get an hour with no ads. It a win-win. I would recommend.

For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know that means softened, downgraded, to have its intensity turned down. It sounds as if my volume is stuck on halfway despite it not being so. I use other streaming services or Apple Music and it sounds fine but pandora has gone silent. If they can‚Äôt fix the sound I may never use this app again. I haven‚Äôt even checked it in months. Nice work pandora devs, you lost another user due to poor quality sound. Your whole reason for being lol"
1270,Chattydave,"December 9, 2017",4,"I liked it before I bought an Apple Watch. Now that I have an Apple Watch I basically lost control of Pandora. The Controls won‚Äôt work, you can‚Äôt pause it, play it anything on the phone. Once the screen closes out on the phone your music turns off. Before you could lock your phone and keep listening. You have to look for the app on your phone now, just to turn the music back on. Totally a pain in the A**! Fix or I will have to cancel my service!!"
1271,MikeSA80,"December 13, 2017",1,Very disappointed! I‚Äôve been a pandora listener for over 10 years and a premium subscriber for over 6 years. In the last 2-3 months I have had so many issues. The app constantly freezes. EVERY time I open the app it locks up. Then after a few app open and close cycles and an occasional crash it works ok until I do anything to it. Like skip or station change. It is useless in my SYNC3 system on my Ford- which until the last update was fine. If the issues are not resolved very soon I‚Äôll be unsubscribing and finding a less stressful way to listen to music. I have a new iPhone and all updates and no other app issues.

This goes for both putting the AirPod back in your ear and using the double-tap functionality bound to pause and play. The music resumes for half a second, then pauses. At that point, not even control center can make the music resume, you have to go to the Pandora app, which is really, really annoying when working on something, especially if you are wearing PPE."

Songs I grew up with; songs I‚Äôve never heard and have to stop what I‚Äôm doing to learn their names; songs from movies; songs my parents played when I was a kid; songs from genres I didn‚Äôt even know existed! Pandora has opened dimensions of the music world that will keep me tapping or stomping my foot forever!
1393,soundbowy selecta,"September 17, 2018",2,"Hmmmmm Song suggestions seem to be way off from the original artist station, and also just cuz I like a song on 1 particular station does not mean that whatever I thumb up should seep into other stations unless I thumb it up on more then one station which I don‚Äôt think you all do and the catalogs of some artist seem to be very limited compared to the amount of music the artist has created. So keep things simple and don‚Äôt keep playing the same songs in almost the same order every other time I open this app. Other than all that, keep the music jamming. Thank you"

It restarts itself by itself and it‚Äôll change to a new song in the middle of a song already playing. When are they going to allow you to un-thumbs up songs??

1399,EEBBUEN,"March 5, 2019",5,Best Music App I tried apple music for 3 months and I didnt like it.  In my opinion Pandora is more user friendly and actually plays music thats related to what u picked and hit music not just anything random. On apple music I would create a station with hip hop and then all of a sudden it would play some thing not even related! That would really annoy me. Maybe there is a way to fix but like I said PANDORA is user friendly!

It opens up to the P like it's loading and nothing ever comes up. No music no nothing. I try to tap out of the app and it's like my phone is frozen. I can only look my IPhone and if I tap the home button it goes right back to the pee. I can't do anything on my phone for about 10 minutes. Then when it finally lets me close out the app I lock my phone and then unlock it to the app to be reopen but this time I can close it out just fine. It will not load at all.

Either way, this is the best way for me to enjoy music I already know and while finding great songs and artists I had never heard before. "
1415,Sociology grad student,"April 17, 2019",5,Like it! Fun to use! Although if you add variety to a station do it by song instead of band. I find it gives more of what you're wanting for that station instead of a bunch of random suggestions that don't seem to make much sense for what you're trying to do. Makes it easier instead of constantly having to thumbs down some things. If only Netflix could get the hint also lol!
1416,WOWWYATT,"May 15, 2019",4,Good and fast for playing music It is reliable for music and very easy to learn and to move around in and easy to look for music that you would like. It is also great because they have a wide variety of podcasts and quite frankly very nice ones. The only things I don‚Äôt like is of course the ads and the point where you can only watch 1 ad video for the rewind button and that‚Äôs it you can‚Äôt do anything to go back and listen to music.

But here is the problem, you can‚Äôt play all your favorite songs because of ‚ÄúMusic Licenses‚Äù which restricts certain songs and even almost all songs from some artists, which really irritates me. If these ‚ÄúMusic Licenses‚Äù were removed, then without a doubt I would rate Pandora at 5 stars."

I‚Äôm considering just using Apple Music as my music program now, I‚Äôm a student so I can pay them basically the same amount every month and listen to whatever I want.

You have the ability to search for specific albums or tracks. Then pandora personalizes the experience with the thumbs up/down buttons, slowly learning your tastes over time while subtlety introducing you to new music along the way. There is no excuse not to have this app. Five stars all the way!"
1427,ajduffin,"April 19, 2018",3,"Review When I first downloaded pandora years ago, I enjoyed it immensely. Over time it has added a tremendous amount of advertisements. I liked that it was a free service, so I became disappointed with the huge increase of ads. The reason for the three stars is because there are too many ads, forcing your users to purchase the service. It‚Äôs also logged me off of my old email address, which is no longer valid. I lost every playlist I had made. I do like that the music selection has expanded."
1428,Iamthetreewhisperer,"June 25, 2018",4,Exclusive requesting expansion It‚Äôs cool how they have the family plan for six family members at fifteen dollars a month but I would like the ads to tell me how it works for just a singleton to get premium. Also mates when I travel it‚Äôs not offered in my favorite spots like Dubai. I‚Äôm just bummed. Would Pandora mind helping me make my dreams come true? I appreciate the chance to give my four stars to the current standard but it‚Äôs not up to par with five stars so please do not hesitant to gain an extra star üíú

If I could make one critique though, I would like to have a little more variety in my stations. It seems like I hear all the songs I‚Äôve thumbed up but not very many new songs. I still think that this is the best music app on iOS for price, compatibility, size, features, layout, and ease of use. I really am happy with it. Thanks and keep updating and making it better Pandora team ü§ì"
1430,jorge del mar,"September 19, 2017",2,Frustrating It seems as if no matter how many times you thumb down artists you don't like they keep trying to play them. There must other artists that fit the theme. Then if your in the mood for something harder edged they play slow ballet sleepers no matter how many times you thumb down. Then you add an artist and they play someone else. I want Rammstien they play Disturbed over and over. I still use pandora as my primary music source but I switch channels frequently to avoid music I don't like because thumbs down doesn't convey to the system my displeasure at the choices.
1431,steelguns,"September 22, 2017",5,"Great options I've been using Pandora for a few yrs now. Very convenient. I have numerous stations for my various modes. It's great to be able to create various stations & tailor them by adding variety.

Also the playlist shouldn‚Äôt be limited to the same 20 over and over. The music genome project should be netting a lot more songs that are similar to what each station is centered around.... sometimes I‚Äôll thumbs down live versions or particular songs of an artist - this doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt like the artist - it simply means I don‚Äôt like that particular track.

1447,Choccolotto,"December 26, 2018",3,"Variety where art thou Ay listen, Pandora is pretty great at first in that when you wanna listen to a radio it plays a certain variety of songs.

Imagine dragons have 4 whole albums but the only songs I‚Äôve EVER heard from this radio(or similar radios) are radioactive, demons, believer, thunder, and natural. It‚Äôd be nice if there were more songs that play."

Over the last couple of weeks, this garbage has started:"
1457,Saint Eskimo,"December 18, 2017",2,"Premium subscription a waste of money If you're thinking a premium subscription will be better than the free tier, think again. Pandora‚Äôs catalog is deficient, too many songs are only available for radio playback as part of a station, and the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù sound quality is on par with pre-digital terrestrial FM radio. Since Pandora purchased Rdio I had hoped their on demand service would be in the same league or, at the very least, in the ballpark but, sadly, it is not. Save your money. Pandora free with ads is a considerably better experience than a paid subscription."

While I am most definitely NOT going to pay for premium, I can still enjoy my music.

For example, on my Image Dragons radio, I started getting love song. Really?!"

There are many different genres to choose from as well. I pay to have the ads removed and that is so much better. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the offline mode doesn‚Äôt work and sometimes it plays the same songs too frequently.
1461,StevieHicks5,"April 18, 2020",1,"Declined over the years I‚Äôm so disappointed with Pandora. The app has been going south but I‚Äôve been on it for so long that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard to break free. I just downloaded the newest update and you can‚Äôt even search for song, artists, etc. I get that we‚Äôre on lock down but how does that function go out? They need to figure out better ways to get new artists and songs in front of you. Their method is layed-out terribly, just offer a few things not every song I‚Äôve played. Their options remind of the Cheesecake Factory menu, overpriced and exhaustive. Focus on functionality and getting new music infront of paid subscribers"

Pandora will not run on an iwatch with out being feathered to another device. What‚Äôs the point of owning an iwatch with cellular???? It‚Äôs worse than garbage!!!!!!! Developers should start screening apple to allow them to list their apps reverse of how it used to be.

However, I digress and shall not do that. Pandora! Please bring back accessibility. That‚Äôs all I ask. Now you have an interface that‚Äôs barely accessible and really ridiculous to mess with. This is why I stopped paying for premium. Because it seems of the each update of the application, things get worse instead of better."

1477,TSWU-NJ,"November 2, 2019",3,"Loyal but not always satisfied I gave the rating of  3 stars because although the music variety is good, the stations don‚Äôt usually reflect the artist. For example if I select a rapper / hip hop station, it often plays r&nb music. Possibly the genres are mixed up and there are many hip hop / r&nb collaborations, however some songs / artists don‚Äôt belong on certain stations if it‚Äôs not a collaborative song and mix of artists. If I‚Äôm requesting to listen to DMX I don‚Äôt want to hear a song from Jill Scott on that station. Otherwise I do enjoy Pandora most times"

First, it is nice to be able to not have to keep my phone screen unlocked, like some other apps require when using the free version. I am glad Pandora still allows for that freedom.

This has happened on several different occasions and it does the same thing on my friends phones as well.

You frantically search for the last place you laid your device down and turn on the screen to discover your groove was de-railed because some lame video ad decided to play.

Pandora has broadened my horizons by allowing me to select similar artists to artists that I already like. Another aspect of Pandora that appeals to me greatly is the fact that I hear cuts of music that are never played on commercial radio. An example is a live version of an epic Led Zeppelin tune.

If you‚Äôre Apple Watch is connected to cellular, and you‚Äôre phone isn‚Äôt around, it does nothing.

Might as well just use the free Pandora and listen to ads....unless that one changes songs 30 seconds in too......"

I‚Äôd also like to pepper in the fact that after the ad plays, the station freezes and there‚Äôs no way to listen to it unless exiting out the app and when you go back, it replays the song you just skipped or the song that just ended and went to that ad that froze it."

1647,MMGKE,"April 28, 2018",4,"4 stars because... When I create play lists there is often random music from other genres that randomly gets thrown in. This occurs on all my play lists that are all different genres, the biggest problem with this is, if I like the song but don‚Äôt want it in that play list I have to give it thumbs down. The chances of it playing in the genres or playlist that it should of originally played in is now slim to none."

So I thought I would go ahead and try the premium pandora cause of course you get the first month free well I happened to not really care for the upgraded version so I didn‚Äôt put the money in my account to pay on it and then I go and try to unsubscribe and it will not let me and this is now currently causing issues in me upgrading my apps on my phone because it claims my billing information is incorrect when it is not! Other than that pandora has always been good to me. So I hope they fix this issue soon!

One thing I would like to see added would be a more refined rating system. Use 1-3 thumbs. If you really like a song you can give it 3 thumbs up. This song could then be played more often in your playlist than one you have rated 1 thumbs up. All in all a very good app.

1779,.......Unknown.......,"July 24, 2019",4,"Good, but.. I'm very picky with my music. There are only about 15 songs I like, and two that I absolutely love. So I thumbs down a lot of the songs, expecting to not have to deal with them again. But I keep getting those songs recommended to me again and again. I have the same problem with giving songs a thumbs up. All of a sudden, it says that I never liked the song. "
1780,Katherine1990-Nic,"November 10, 2018",5,Life saver I have been in a hart break and all of this songs just turn me up and I just want to sing out loud today I learned to let go because you and only you own yourself you don‚Äôt need someone else to tell you what you can do or have to do take this from In I have been in hart breaks I‚Äôm might still be sad but I‚Äôm over of my ex.
1781,S4mgh,"November 29, 2018",2,"I used to love Pandora but they got greedy This app is so focused on getting people to premium, I already pay for no adds, I don‚Äôt want to pay more.  I m tired of opening the app and having to cycle to settings and then back to stations just to see my choices. Then I get this stupid hey do you want to see concert availability? Absolutely the worst! I use this to listen in my car, I don‚Äôt want stupid distractions to start my music. Yes I‚Äôm going to cancel, too bad this was my favorite app for years but the last two years have been absolutely Hell. Goodbye!"
1782,Marcy Ella,"December 5, 2018",4,Doesn‚Äôt know the difference between Spanish and portugu√™s I love pandora but I had to leave one start only because I am Brazilian and I want to listen to my music in Portuguese and I was able to find my favorite singers however pandora keep mixing Spanish songs in it and I hate it. I mean Portuguese and Spanish may be very similar but it‚Äôs also very different I have no ideas what I‚Äôm listening to right now while writing this.
1783,joshton_66,"December 11, 2018",3,"Music Standstill? I just downloaded Pandora onto a new device so it is the latest update so I have never any problems until now. I don‚Äôt know why but whenever I leave a station and go back to it minutes later, the same song is still playing or has started over. It is happening with every station, I don‚Äôt know if this part of the update or the app is just acting. It is still a decent listening app but this kills me if I have to keep pressing skip."
1784,Sqpeggy,"March 1, 2019",3,"Chromecasting glitches I definitely love pandora and love to shuffle my stations.  Recently though- I can‚Äôt seem to list my stations alphabetically on my phone app so I‚Äôm shuffling through a list of 99 to find the 4 or 5 I want to shuffle.  Also- it does not seem to play well with Chromecasting. Other apps will work fine but when I try to open pandora app- the casting icon is missing 50% of the time. Same WiFi, same phone, updated app- new glitches.  Very frustrating."
1785,00_RaNdOm_00,"April 9, 2019",3,"I have problems I‚Äôm experiencing a number of bugs every day from this terrible premium service on and offline.  Music I didn‚Äôt select will play over top of music I‚Äôm listening too from the app, my music will randomly stop and say that Pandora is having trouble, we‚Äôre fixing it, when nothing is wrong at all, my music won‚Äôt work online during some periods and sometimes I get ads on stations. (I have premium so this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue) Please fix this."
1786,Christinaj0107,"May 18, 2019",5,Music Is The Heart For Ones Soul Pandora‚Äôs got my 5 stars due to always providing me with just the right songs I need to when I need to be lifted or even just to sing or dance. 
1787,Sam & Dean Winchester,"June 8, 2019",4,Had it for awhile decided to write a review. More skips would be nice but the problem is the new update look I don‚Äôt like it. Don‚Äôt on Pandora for almost two hours and then I come back in the update looks weird and I can barely see whether or not I have liked the past songs I listen to. just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Sometimes it won‚Äôt play songs when I have good Internet but other than that it‚Äôs OK.
1788,NBA_Drose25,"July 18, 2019",3,"Keeps Freezing Last week, I would‚Äôve given 6 stars if possible. I love pandora. Ever since you guys added the premium feature, I subscribed right away. However, for the past few days, the app freezes when you go to edit a playlist. Also, once you leave the app, the music just keeps playing for about 4-5 seconds after the app is closed. Please fix this because i just resubscribed to premium and I would not like to have my money wasted"
1789,theyrerelentless,"June 18, 2019",3,"Relevant Ads? I don‚Äôt mind using the free app and hearing the ads every few songs. I just wish there was a way I could choose the types of ads Im exposed to. There is a children‚Äôs station that I play for my niece and nephew that will suddenly BLARE a GAMBLING ad after we‚Äôve just listened to Moana for the hundredth time. Not only is this a kids music station, but also, I don‚Äôt gamble, so it‚Äôs completely irrelevant and frankly if google is able to provide ad tailoring why not pandora? Thanks for considering my complaint."
1790,Wakkawakkamuthafakka,"January 18, 2018",5,"Only music app I use I've been using Pandora almost exclusively for music for the last six or seven years. Easy to use, infinitely useful. Good for listening to old favorites or exploring new music. I started with two stations- one for ABBA in general and one specifically based on RunDMC's ""Tricky"". Now I have somewhere around thirty stations. 10/10, would recommend, you won't regret it."
1791,Jabech,"January 22, 2018",3,"Disappointed with the ads Just took a ride with my kids in the car, turned on Pandora and heard an ad for Adam and Eve adult products. I have never used that website and to be honest I am very disappointed that it would pop up in the ad rotation.  I can‚Äôt think of a setting where this would be a nice thing to hear while listening to my stations on Pandora, I know that the ads support the stations but can‚Äôt they tailor the ads?  Is that too much to ask?"
1792,Soulsista763,"April 16, 2018",5,I ‚ù§Ô∏è Pandora I‚Äôve been using Pandora for a very long time and during that that time I‚Äôve used a multitude of different music streaming platforms. None of those platforms has ever come close to Pandora when it comes to catering to the different type of music I love listening to. I can always count on Pandora to give me new music as well
1793,Jonesy1104,"May 10, 2018",2,"Room for improvement Having limited skips on the free version was frustrating, so I decided to pay the $5 a month. This is the third time that I‚Äôve decided to pay, and every time have been let down. Almost as soon as I begin paying, it will stop mid song and tell me the station is currently unavailable. Click ok, tap play and the same sone it just cut off begins playing again. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on shuffle or a specific station, it does this constantly. It‚Äôs annoying and almost not worth the hassle."
1794,Lolinix,"May 10, 2018",2,"Not happy I upgraded to plus like four moths ago because i got tired of sooo many ads and skip limits.. however the app has been updated to the point that my subscription has been useless. No more unlimited skips, no more listening on two devices. Now they expect $13/mo for these features.. what? It wasn't like that smh. Even though I have paid subscription i still often get prompted to upgrade which is annoying!! And i still get ads with artists telling me to go listen to another station!! Not happy at all.."
1795,Tats79,"June 18, 2018",3,Don‚Äôt pay I signed up for a free trial so I could have ad free music when with clients. I was especially interested in the offline mode. Pandora promised music when WIFI was not available. However every time I lost internet connection the app did nothing but buffer. I contacted support about it. I went through the steps they gave me but the app still wouldn‚Äôt play music in offline mode. Don‚Äôt waste your money with Pandora if your looking for ad free music in a professional setting.
1796,EllieGamer_123,"June 21, 2018",2,It‚Äôs okay... So I got the app not to long ago and I love it but there are some issues. First off all it won‚Äôt let me delete songs I don‚Äôt want anymore. Then I have the issue when in the middle of my playlist it stops and puts what it wants on. This means I have to restart my playlist then play the song again where I left off. Pandora has also crashed on me a few times and I have to rest my phone for it to work again. It won‚Äôt let me play some songs for whatever reason. Other than those issues the app is great!
1797,Ta'resa,"August 30, 2018",5,Volume Very Low I love Pandora no other apps shuffles musics like Pandora but I can't really jam to it Bc the volume is so low compared to other music apps or even when I'm watching videos.  Please turn my music up. It makes me not want to listen or use Pandora but I really want to. in fact I've just given up at times because it's too low it's annoying.
1798,dmoney801dmoney801,"September 21, 2018",1,Check your connection I choose to have the free version. I have been using pandora for a very long time now.( maybe 5 years ) Lately I have had connection issues. The have me to check my connections. Which I end up shutting down my phone and restarting it. That usually works. However today nothing I have done will correct my connection issue with pandora. I do have unlimited data on my phone and at home I have enough WiFi to supply my neighborhood. I really like pandora. But there is no app worth paying for.     Apple 8+
1799,kadelirwin,"September 29, 2018",1,Worthless app This is quite possibly the worst app I have EVER used. 75% of the time the app would just freeze up and not play anything and the other 25% of the time I have to wait about 10 seconds for a DOWNLOADED song to play. So I go to try and cancel my subscription and their garbage website won‚Äôt even allow me to. Been trying for 3 days and it just tells me to come back and try again later. On top of all that they don‚Äôt even offer phone support so I get to wait on someone to email me back. I still can‚Äôt figure out where all of the good reviews are coming from. It‚Äôs horrible.
1800,LaurenBradley,"September 18, 2017",5,"I like it Most of the time my pandora knows me so well, other times, it's a stranger. I've had the same profile for over 7 years, so it's fine tuned these days, which is why I get surprised when it plays something I hate. Also, I had premium and then it cancelled so I paid it again, and it still won't upgrade back! What do I do?? Tired of commercials. Help!"
1801,Alldaybaybay,"October 28, 2017",4,"I love this app, but.... It‚Äôs been super buggy lately! It‚Äôll make my phone screen black out and then it‚Äôll have the loading sign when it turns back on. Once it comes back I have to enter my password, no touchID, then reopen pandora. It‚Äôll start the song I was listening to all over again (which sometimes it isn‚Äôt a bad thing)! Really annoying so I‚Äôve been looking for alternatives unfortunately."

1803,Doc Julius 821,"December 2, 2017",5,New update bugs Love pandora however:
1804,mlle.nicolette,"December 3, 2017",1,"What Happened? I‚Äôve been using Pandora for years, even defending it when people complain about its lack of superiority as a music service. But with the new update the app isn‚Äôt even usable. What‚Äôs the point of a music app that doesn‚Äôt play songs for longer than a few seconds? And why will it not play if you close your phone or navigate to another app when previously you could? What on earth am I paying for? I‚Äôll be canceling my subscription if this isn‚Äôt fixed, I was already on the fence about the continued use of Pandora but this has really changed my mind and infuriated me."
1805,Vfrat,"December 8, 2017",3,"iPhone 6s & Pandora & iOS 11 are not compatible I loved (note loved NOT love) Pandora. Ever since the new iPhone update, Pandora is a disaster. Every so often it will just stop.  When you check the phone you have to sign in with the phones passcode. When you restart Pandora you listen to the same program at least 5 minutes in the past. Sometimes it just locks up. I get advertisements for the paid subscription to sign up and I am already signed up. PLEASE PANDORA. FIX YOUR APP!!!!"
1806,F@&* No!!!,"December 27, 2017",2,"Dissatisfied Customer ‚òπÔ∏è I subscribe to Pandora. I love the music, artist and stations. A true 5 star rating. However, I have a few problems with Pandora and their app. I pay my monthly fee to listen with unlimited skips. But for some reason due to licensing issues I am unable to skip. Get rid off the song until I can skip like I pay to do. Also, when I use Pandora in my car, I cannot rewind/replay at all. Again, I pay to have this function. You need to fix these issues since I am a paying customer. Dissatisfied customer"
1807,Lnn11,"April 28, 2020",3,"Inappropriate Ad on Kids Radio Station I tried finding a spot in the app to report this but didn‚Äôt find one.... context:  I enjoy this app on a regular basis, but I have a station for my 1.5 year old to listen to cute kids songs and twice this week on this station was an advertisement for Planned Parenthood, which I find offensive. I‚Äôm not against having advertisements (you need to make money somehow), but definitely should be able to switch to a different ad for situations like this. Thanks."
1808,Ejavu,"March 26, 2020",4,Ok app I don‚Äôt listen to the app as much as I used to since I don‚Äôt have unlimited data anymore. I have a constant notification and it really bothers me that I don‚Äôt know how to clear it since the app has changed a lot since I last used it. I tried look online how to clear it and I couldn‚Äôt find anything. I‚Äôm tempted to delete the app just to make the little app notification go away. And I made sure it‚Äôs up to date.
1809,Kappyva,"March 9, 2020",4,"Big fan, but Got short changed on my 1-hour uninterrupted I listen to Pandora every time I go workout or go for a walk and am very happy. Really like the new options for the stations. My problem was that I got a free hour, but 45 minutes in Pandora froze and didn‚Äôt come back for 20+ minute and when I left and came back my time ran out as though the timer continued when my session was froze"
1810,Denis Tejedor,"May 25, 2019",2,"Outdated and mediocre I used to swear by Pandora. But in the past two years it started becoming very mediocre. I pick an artist and it creates a station that hardly plays that artist. I'm constantly clicking dislike on songs, and it still plays those songs. Every time there is an update, it almost erases all my history of liked songs and when I'm on a plane it plays abt 15 songs on repeat. I've been a paying costumer since about 5+ years and my friends always laughed at me for doing so. They were right to do so. This app is meh."
1811,300Bowler#1,"May 26, 2019",5,Erica Wilson Hi I'm Erica Wilson and I always wanted a music app but I couldn't find one and then I found pandora! So I downloaded pandora. I sighed in on my laptop and I loved so I downloaded it on my I pod and I loved it even more! I found music I have never heard and now I listen to it all the time. They are all on my thumbs up list and I probably have more to put on. I love Pandora!
1812,Lizkid73,"December 19, 2019",5,"Great music, wish more selection Pandora plays a great mix of music BUT if you listen to the same station days in a row you start hearing the same songs (like a regular radio station).  Wish there was some way to not repeat songs until x number of days had gone by or until x number of songs were played in between."
1813,skskskhydroflaskanioop,"December 7, 2019",5,"Only a few problems A lot of ads, can‚Äôt move around in songs, you can‚Äôt go back to the previous song if you accidentally skip one, limited skips and you can‚Äôt replay songs. Otherwise I like how you can skip, like or dislike, and that you give them a song or artist and it creates a station with music like it."
1814,Krocodile.kyle,"November 28, 2019",5,The box that opens and can never be shut.. I downloaded this app... i think 3 years ago and i cant say how many times this app made the night. Whether it was a close family thing or a bunch of friends this app has been there.  Never pay a cent all this time and ive had awesome music the whole time.  Keep up the free feature and ill be here forever ;)
1815,Yellow_FLA,"October 30, 2019",5,"I love Pandora This is way better than streaming. I like the interaction of telling your station what you like via thumbs up, thumbs down, skip , replay and then eventually you have a collection of various similar artists to jam too. The other streaming options out there are just not for me.  Artist albums aren‚Äôt the same so this works for me. 6+ yeas and still love it!"
1816,frustrated person324,"October 8, 2019",5,Amazing!!! I have been listening to pandora for at least three years. I have never had a problem and love the app. My favorite part is how well they can help you personalize your stations and your music. The offline mode makes it so wherever you go you have great music. Highly recommended and not a paid review. Keep up the great work Pandora.
1817,Qwertyjon,"August 31, 2019",5,Thank you Music is a really big part of my life and it means so much so to able to listen to my favorite music for free is a really big deal. The ads are not very long and it give you a fair amount skips. And although I may use Apple Music most of the time this app is very good and I highly recommend it. Thank you for making it and also keeping it freshüëåüèª
1818,grl2B,"August 24, 2019",3,"Collection Wish my station collection could be alphabetized. Makes it faster to find stations when I want them. And... when I had to share the radio with my kids we picked stations by ‚Äúsay a letter, pick a number 1 through‚Äù how ever many artists were in that letter. Everyone was happy. Not it‚Äôs pure chaos trying to fairly pick a station on road trips. I haven‚Äôt decided yet if the ads are worth having. üòí but regardless we are still Pandora users on the daily."
1819,xXHippieSlayerXx,"June 12, 2019",2,"Sub par I‚Äôll have to admit I do like your assortment of music on the radio stations I listen to. At times they can get repetitive, especially if you listen to the same radio station multiple hours/days. But then I can just change stations I guess. The thing I can‚Äôt get over is having explicit content ON and listening to edited music. Like you totally destroy Eminem radio for me.  Pandora can‚Äôt figure out that I don‚Äôt want his edited tracks if I have explicit content ON. It‚Äôs been a problem for a long time and they still haven‚Äôt fixed it!"
1820,Kaylala916,"September 21, 2018",5,Repetitive I love my pandora radio! However once you download a station and start liking songs they repeat too often. I downloaded the 90‚Äôs 2000‚Äôs and today‚Äôs hits and The station continuously plays the same 30 songs on a loop. You would think with three decades worth of music there would be thousands of songs to choose from
1821,Shepherd753,"October 23, 2018",3,"Some bugs Randomly losing sound without pausing. I then have to click pause and then play to continue music, happens multiple times soon after song starts but does not keep happening after that. Seems to be happening soon after app is launched, and right at the beginning of songs, and originally thought it may be advertisement interference but there is no sound unless you click pause and then play again"
1822,lindy631,"November 6, 2018",5,No Need to pay for satellite Pandora is amazing and flexible gives you the opportunity to create the stations that you like choose the songs you like and even only played the songs you like all the time every genre any kind of music without all the crazy fees that satellite brings and with satellite you can skip and you can really choose.
1823,J Schizzel,"November 29, 2018",5,"Disappointed with new changes I‚Äôve always loved pandora and have paid for the add free subscription for years now, but constantly being bombarded to pay higher prices every time I open the app has really turned me off. "
1824,jldc5,"December 21, 2018",2,"Not worth paying for I‚Äôve had it for a while now Nd last couple months it‚Äôs been almost useless, the offline which was what I pay for initially doesn‚Äôt even work and when it does work it plays 1 station or thumbs up only in which they each play 4-5 song in a loop üôÑ"
1825,svavshshsbdbhd,"January 13, 2019",4,Moonlight rip x I give it a four because you can‚Äôt pick the song but other than that it‚Äôs good because iit has sleep time mode so that way it will shut off the music so I doesn‚Äôt wake me up again because i left my tv on before and i woke up too it so from now i turn a sleep timer on this and my tv and i can listen to pandora on my tv i dont have cable if you worndering i have a roku and its so much better
1826,DanaZotti,"January 22, 2019",3,"Why is this happening I love Pandora but recently I‚Äôve had issues with the songs in my playlists actually playing.  About two updates ago I noticed this issue, I‚Äôve tried downloading each song to get them to play. That seems to do the trick but just until the next time I use it. It‚Äôs a pain having to skip through songs until one actually plays. "
1827,jbmyers6491,"January 24, 2019",3,"Not so sure anymore Too many options as far as pay options now. They‚Äôre taking away what we can do with basic pandora. Every time I search I end up with podcasts and things I don‚Äôt want. And pandora is super difficult to maneuver when you‚Äôre having trouble seeing. Love the music options, but I don‚Äôt want to have to watch an ad or pay an extra monthly fee to listen to what I want (and I don‚Äôt even have the basic pandora, I pay for plus)"
1828,West A,"March 25, 2019",5,Fav music Pandora always finds that song on my playlist that just seems to know my mood.
1829,ZombieHarvester99,"April 22, 2019",5,"My favorite app Pandora is by far my most frequently used app. I love the ease of listening from my mobile, PC, and even smart TV without compromising my long-curated stations. Pandora does a great job of matching similar music based on my thumbs up. I have a wide range of taste in music and Pandora allows me to create and maintain a station for every mood - I highly recommend it."
1830,i <3 FOB,"December 7, 2017",1,"Crashing, Crashing, 1-2-3 For the past few months, every time I use Pandora for more than 10 minutes, the app crashes. There have been several updates since the issue first came to light, but even though each update has ‚Äúreduced crashes,‚Äù it hasn‚Äôt helped on my device. I have an iPhone 7 Plus, which has software that is up-to-date, yet the problem persists. I will have to find a new music app if this continues, because not only is it frustrating but dangerous as well (it happens often while driving)."
1831,CarlyTh3Cat,"January 18, 2018",4,"Amazing, but a lot of ads I love this app, it‚Äôs perfect for finding all your songs, without the price. Although in order to listen to some songs ‚ÄòPandora Premium‚Äô songs, require you to sign up for Pandora Premium or watch an ad, which are usually 15 seconds long, I feel like they should reduce the ad times, or reduce the amount of songs that require that. "
1832,TUnghajer,"March 1, 2018",2,"More ads than music I understand that to use the free pandora app you have to have ads. When I began using pandora it was awesome. Every 4-5 songs you had a 30 second add, tolerable and understandable. After each ‚Äúupdate‚Äù the ads became more frequent. Now, I hear an ad after every song, at the most 2 songs in a row. Plus, every other ad is for upgrading to premium. Your trying to force an upgrade by making it intolerable to listen to the free ap. All your doing is making me abandon pandora for another service."
1833,landl53,"May 3, 2018",3,"Review of service For me, seeing how an app performs for free is simply good business for both parties.  So far I have experienced increasing connection difficulties.  A short while back I decided to try the thirty-day trial but it came back telling me (‚Äúwe are sorry, there are no subscriptions available at this time‚Äù).  Really?!?  You ask me constantly if I want it but I can‚Äôt have it?  Everything is expected to work as the company advertises/pursues.  Maybe in the future I will explore another attempt."
1834,psycho poodle,"May 29, 2018",5,"The best It is incredibly difficult to find decent music on regular radio. I listen to Pandora all day long and I love being able to select the different genres of music. A particular delight is that when I pick a genre, Pandora loads the station with similar artists and I discover great talent that I never would‚Äôve discovered prior to listening to Pandora"
1835,Nichthyes,"June 3, 2018",4,"Great music selecting, concert updates Love how it finds similar artists for you. Found so many new artists from my multiple stations. Also the new local concert updates are awesome! "
1836,Dave wow,"June 6, 2018",3,"Good but needs work I love pandora use all day everyday, but with pandora premium when playing a single at times it will stay stuck on repeat.  Have to fully close app and reopen just to take the song off repeat and let it continue to auto play. As well as with stations when certain songs play you are not allowed to skip. Whole point of premium is to be able to skip if it can‚Äôt be skipped then shouldn‚Äôt be on premium!!!"
1837,Keoni27!,"June 13, 2018",3,"O.k I do like Pandora, you can find most music and building a playlist is simple. The downfall is that it cuts in and out when listening to music you like and then have to close the and app and load it up again, sometimes that doesn‚Äôt work. I have great connections through carriers and WiFi but Pandora says it has no connection and plays music that I may have downloaded in my library and that gets quite frustrating. Other than that it‚Äôs ok."
1838,Sfhe Seviin,"June 16, 2018",1,"The app doesn‚Äôt work I love pandora, and listen to it at least 3 days a week (just while I‚Äôm at work lol) and one day it just stopped working. It‚Äôs telling me to check my internet connection, but my internet connection is fine? I updated it thinking that was the issue, I also checked to make sure my data was on for pandora through my phone, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Quite disappointing because I‚Äôve had/used my pandora account for at least 5-7 years now. Hopefully you come up with a fix soon, or I‚Äôll just have to use another app üòï"
1839,The Giant Businessman,"September 3, 2018",5,"Fantastic Here you provide a choice of a song you love, and the program then starts to play it and other songs it thinks you might want to hear as well.  Every song you hear you will either indicate you like or not; this helps the program fine tune the next songs it will add to what it will offer next."
1840,CritterGuardian,"September 10, 2017",3,"Upgrade spam App itself is fine enough and my go-to for music streaming. But the constant full screen pop ups ""suggesting"" I upgrade to the top tier subscription is annoying enough for me to take the time to write this review. "
1841,jenny6060,"September 19, 2017",5,"Best music app I appreciate the person who invented this app. I can listen to music limitlessly. All the songs I love can be thumbed up, replayed. I don't know why but I love music more than anything and it's something that I can always turn to when I'm sad,happy,mad,etc. I truly thank the person who created Pandora because there is no other app that beats Pandora that's for sure!"
1842,jayyylanette,"September 27, 2017",5,Long time user I‚Äôve been a Pandora user for a long time. I‚Äôve tried other apps but I always come back to Pandora. Their stations are always on point. Their staff does a great job at selecting music. My only issue is their app layout. I upgraded to premium and they still have some work to do in making the layout face good. It just feels like a mess.
1843,atlashapless,"September 29, 2017",5,"Why I gave Pandora one star Pandora I've been listening to for almost 10 years since you are brand new and since then your quality has diminished immeasurably you play the same songs to know and and generally the most popular, nothing obscure or original. When I can afford to pay for music I won't use your app"
1844,Conveniently great,"October 7, 2017",5,"Love the three choices: free, cheaper premium version, premium I personally chose the middle of the three, because I don't need much more than the free version. I just can't stand listening to the ads, so paying five dollars a month is worth it to me.

It seems to me that the music matching with my tastes and moods is always better synchronized on Pandora. And there is less attempts to get me to listen to and like music genres outside of my clear preferences. 
1847,Seachelle1512,"March 27, 2020",2,"Used to be so much better Pandora used to be so much better. Now if you try to search for a song or genre the app asks like 100 times if you want to upgrade to Premium before you can hear the song. I try to play Disney playlists for my kids then after like 5 songs, it switches to other non-kid-friendly stations that I listen to. It‚Äôs not user friendly anymore. Used to be able to listen to a genre or station endlessly with a commercial after like 5 songs, which was fine with me."

Then have the nerve to put all these ads when they just play the same songs over and over again. I‚Äôve had to stop hitting thumbs up on the songs I like because I know they are gonna repeat the song so many times. It‚Äôs a lame app honestly. I select Hip-Hop/ Rap radio I get ONE rap song and then and your playing slow sad songs or pop ON THE HIP HOP RADIO. What‚Äôs the point of having certain radios if you play whatever bull crap you want to play. Honestly y‚Äôall need to sit down and fix this!

I check and sure enough, it's Pandora. The app isn't open, sometimes it's even in offline mode!

I looked in the prefs and didn‚Äôt see anything to control that. And I noticed that some songs that I like, I can‚Äôt list to anymore. They changed to station only."

If I can‚Äôt get them back, I‚Äôm gone forever. I spent years liking and disliking songs and creating stations. Won‚Äôt put another 9 years into a music app. And if I have to downgrade to the free version to get my playlist back....so be it. My work is more important than unlimited skips."

I‚Äôve sat for 20 minutes at a time on 3 separate gym days waiting for pandora to load up and only thing I see is the new emblem blinking for 20 minutes before I switch to a different music streaming app. I should have left the update alone!!!!
1917,HighKashi,"June 5, 2018",5,It doesn‚Äôt even work anymore So after the most recent update the app literally doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll load it up and it it‚Äôll tell me to check my internet connection which I know is fine. Only been having this issue since the update. One star till its fixed.

I‚Äôll check back once or twice, then if there are still ads on my $5 per month service, I will stop payment and go elsewhere.  Don‚Äôt be stupid Pandora.  Please."

I still have songs pop up that I've repeatedly thumbed down in the past. And now there's not enough variety. Thumbs up radio is the worst. I do not want to listen to the songs I ""liked"" 7 years ago as a depressed HS teen. The biggest bullsh** is that you'll choose five songs that are so far from what I want to hear, that I've never even heard before, and take up ALL my skips."

When it happens, it affects the fingerprint sensor on two other apps.   I then have to restart the phone and then everything works normal until I use Pandora again.

It‚Äôs like you guys are trying to flood our ears with R. Kelly. And with only a few skips, we are being forced to listen to him and that‚Äôs uncool and unfair!!! Do this and you get 5 stars from me!!!"
1938,Brokennightmare_,"December 26, 2019",5,Overall good free stream Pandora is a good service if you want free music. Quite often they let you enjoy an hour of uninterrupted music by watching a 15 second ad which I think is a fair trade. Their selection of music is a little limited in the free version but it doesn‚Äôt bother me that much because that just means I get to listen to the songs I like lol
1939,Treehugn,"December 7, 2019",5,"Great for discovering new music What I like most about Pandora is how you can create stations based on an artist or song you like. When they play artists or songs that are similar, you can check them out. I also like that they give you a thumbs up or thumbs down option for songs, to further narrow your likes and dislikes."
1940,Puppywizz,"March 17, 2019",5,Awsome This app has always been super amazing and makes amazing music the only thing that is annoying is the adds but also the adds aren‚Äôt that bad because wot not like they come right after every song they come after like 7 or 8 and they have every album and every thing I recommend this all the way

Although this was one of the benefits of having Pandora and not other apps, I tried to replay a song watching ads, but I‚Äôve watched several ads and it would tell me ‚ÄúSomething has gone wrong.‚Äù Which was not so well designed. Hopefully this gets patched next update. "

When I want to play a specific song on my playlist I click on it and it doesn‚Äôt play the song but the song above or below it. This only happens with certain songs but it makes it so that this song doesn‚Äôt show up when I shuffle the playlist. I also don‚Äôt think the shuffle option is random.

I switched to premium thinking I could trust Pandora not to remove a cherished feature like the playlist feed (or maki it impossible to find, if they were not so antagonistic as to remove it). either way, I was not able to see who sang several songs in theme last set so you have lost sales for your artsists."

However, when I'm listening to a station and an artist I don't particularly like nor ever want to hear comes on, it's unpleasant. I was thinking as an update, maybe make an option to dislike/block artists so they don't just appear on a good station and I can't do anything about it except skip it, but they end up coming back anyway.

I took a break from the app in hoping a hot fix would be done, but nothing has changed.  The only way to fix it is to reinstall the app whenever I wanna change station, which fixes it for about 2 days before I have the same issue.

Used to connect easily, now it requires me to close out constantly to get it running properly. Then when I do (after 10 minutes of torture), I get the same 5-7 songs every time....until it of course disconnects or freezes. At which point I turn off the app and listen to standard radio. Terrible!"
1987,Jah Drago,"December 6, 2017",5,Amazing Selection I appreciate Pandora because it allow me to control the flow of songs I like and dislike with the thumb system.

It‚Äôs easy to use... one little downfall.. after a while of using the same channel it stops adding new song options. Then I have to listen to the same stuff. So I end up creating a new channel to get something different to listen to. But I really do enjoy and appreciate Pandora.
1989,Llama_love,"January 16, 2018",5,"Very easy to use It is not at all complicated; you just start a station with the artist or song you want, and it not only gives you the song or songs by the artist you chose.

Now they offer ‚Äúpremium‚Äù instead of the ‚Äúplus‚Äù plan, and something tells me these terrible glitches will go away if I give them a bit more money every month.

Today is the last day i use this app... im deleting it and going with another music app... even willing to pay another outfit because i feel that pandora is hijacking and holding hostage my music experience and i wont be a part of that.

2123,Guardian1289,"November 4, 2017",3,"Keeps randomly shutting off I don‚Äôt know if this is a compatibility issue with iOS updates or what, but every time I listen to Pandora, it closes in the middle of the song and also closes other apps I have running. For example, if I‚Äôm driving, using my gps and listening to Pandora, pandora and my gps shut off and I have to go back and put in the address again into my gps and turn Pandora on again."
2124,mikalya manicent,"November 6, 2017",4,"Four stars I love Pandora so much. Because you can go to other apps or turn off your phone and you can still hear the music. But the reason I gave it four stars is because there‚Äôs a lot of ads, and you can‚Äôt listen to it off-line without Pandora premium so that‚Äôs not my favorite but I can‚Äôt be complaining because I have unlimited data now so yeah that‚Äôs my review. Get it. You‚Äôll love it."
2125,johnny bistline,"November 13, 2017",2,"Crashes too much I listen to music for an hour every day while I work out. Without fail, during this single hour, the app crashes and shuts down my phone once a day. Every. Single. Day. It‚Äôs really frustrating, to the point where I won‚Äôt be using it anymore. This has been going on for the better part of 6 months. I‚Äôve waited this long because I have multiple playlists that pandora has perfected, and I didn‚Äôt want to move away. But at this point i really don‚Äôt have a choice."
2126,Apple makes me rewrite this,"November 16, 2017",1,"What happened? I have listened to Pandora for years and have a multitude of stations.  The last few months the variety of music has decreased substantially on just about every station I have listened too.  Also the last couple weeks if listening to a jazz station for example, an obnoxious pop song comes on that is different and it‚Äôs the not the title listed as playing.  When I skip it, another commercial plays.  This happens as frequently as every third or fourth song.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times.  Just terrible!"
2127,ASLcollegelife,"December 2, 2017",2,"Update is miserable I have loved pandora for years. Then, I got the update recently. It will no longer play music when I do not have the app open. If I navigate to another app and then back to pandora, it won't play. I have to restart the app. If I leave my phone for a little bit, the screen turns off. Pandora stops playing. It is super frustrating. I don't want to have to go and tap the screen every 30 seconds and never move to another app just to listen to some music. It's not worth it."

I could always play the downloaded songs when I had internet connection or WiFi, but when traveling on a plane with no connection everything was lost. It wouldn‚Äôt even let me access anything I saved in the past or anything I downloaded. I decided to delete my subscription because there really is no point."
2129,Fujiboy,"December 27, 2017",1,App doesn‚Äôt play well with iPhone X The app on the iPhone X is a disgrace.  Most of the time it won‚Äôt start when I tag the play button or won‚Äôt stop when I tag the pause button.  I have deleted and reinstalled the app on my phone but it still does not work like it used to on my earlier iPhones.  I have to tag the skip button to get pass the hang up.  Looks like Pandora missed the boat for this app on the iPhone X and I have no idea if earlier iPhones are having this issue since the last update.  It is pretty bad when you can‚Äôt pause if playing or start if paused.
2130,SpldWife,"September 14, 2017",5,Pandora Premium Pandora premium is amazing minus the fact there is no Repeating songs!!! Make it to where listeners are able to repeat a song as much as they may want and I'd give it 5 stars...hands down it's the best music app but you definitely have to pay in order to have zero commercials/ads and the unlimited skips.

When I pause my music for a moment and then I either swipe up to hit the play button (I have an iPhone) it doesn‚Äôt work(it‚Äôs works with my other apps). This also happens with the lock screen. Also it auto skips a lot of songs halfway through them.
2133,reviews are my job,"January 20, 2020",3,I hate ads and the amount of skips Pandora is just amazing the only problem is the amount of skips that you get because there are some songs that you love and you are jamming out to it then a song that you really don‚Äôt like plays so you skip it and then a bunch of songs that you don't know and or you don‚Äôt like and you use all your skips so then you have to deal with a bad song or watch a ad and no one likes adds

Apple refused a refund upon immediately requesting one for a subscription I am not receiving content for. They refer you to Pandora. Pandora refers you Apple. No refund and no commercial free music.

I have about 14 different stations and it it‚Äôs always the same five songs that replay even though I have so many songs that have been liked. It‚Äôs become way too glitchy now. If I leave the app and go to my Apple Music and then try to go back to Pandora all the songs that were playing restart to the very beginning.

2148,Lawlwarrior,"June 27, 2019",2,"Premium Not worth $14 or whatever it costs. Offline mode, you‚Äôd think would work like an MP3 player (organization options, picking a song). It‚Äôs not, have to shuffle and let it start where ever it wants. The shuffle is fixed, so you still hear songs in the exact same order everytime. It also gets stuck playing the same 10-25 or so songs. So if you‚Äôre thinking of getting because you don‚Äôt get signal often at work (like in construction) you‚Äôd be better off getting a 2001 mp3."

Now it stops mid-song, makes the notification, and jumps to my ‚Äúprimary‚Äù station (which is not the one I listen to when I‚Äôm out and about). Its hugely disruptive to the experience."

2152,SVTII,"September 13, 2018",1,"Algorithm still needs work Although music streaming services are convenient, Pandora still needs work. When you set up a channel based on a certain artist,  the channel starts with that artist and peppers in other related artists along with the original. After a certain amount of time passes, you're listening to everything else EXCEPT the original artist you wanted to listen to. Add to that the fact that music ventures away from the originally selected genre. There‚Äôs got to be a way for the coding to keep the music closer to the artist and genre selected."
2153,Rtriay,"September 21, 2018",2,"Terrible streaming quality and false propaganda for the benefits they promised on paid version I got the most expensive service from pandora and it is BAD!

Onus should be on advertisers, not Pandora, to come up with a variety of commercials that don‚Äôt repel consumers. There‚Äôs a way to do it, as evidenced by traditional radio stations. Yeah I could pay for the app, but then how would that help Pandora push for its advertisers to do better if they want to draw in more consumers."

Furthermore, I hate how your only allowed to skip a few, without paying for a subscription.  If only they went down to $1.99 a month, which is more affordable.

2227,Daisy3303,"November 3, 2018",4,App works great Pandora used to tout itself as a way to be introduced to new music based on an artist you like- instead it builds a station by similar artists all from the same time period and only songs played on the radio. . .

However, for the last month/two months, when I try and shuffle a playlist, it will shuffle 5 songs in the playlist and then stop playing music. This is constant and I‚Äôm very annoyed with it. What‚Äôs the deal?! The main reason I paid money for premium was for the playlist section so I‚Äôm very upset that even with updates this is not working correctly. Please fix!!"

I love Christmas songs but I draw the line at it coming on in August."

Everything was fine until I did a thumbs-up on a 1920‚Äôs Jazz Orchestra and then that‚Äôs ALL they played on that station.

2267,julie._02,"August 3, 2019",5,AMAZING I love this app so much. It is an easy way to find music u love. If u have Pandora Plus (which I have) when u go into offline mode for more than an hour and notice it repeats the songs previously played (basically just a loop of the same 10 songs). But it‚Äôs really good otherwise. I really enjoy listening to music on Pandora.

It doesn‚Äôt play through like it use to. So you either have to listen to the song you hate or use a thumbs down, which usually means all songs by that particular artist stop popping up at all.

With all the songs in the world I shouldn‚Äôt listen to the same song in at least one week! Then I pick a station for specific song and it doesn‚Äôt play that song!

2332,dovehead777,"September 2, 2018",4,Why Pandora is Sublime Pandora‚Äôs platform provides a calming and chill atmosphere to enjoy your music in style. This eclectic music streaming service has evolved and done well for themselves since the early 2000s. The visual placement of the album cover and overall simplistic design adds to the quality of your preferred listening experience. It also boasts a great selection of recommended artists. Love it to death.

There is nothing wrong with my WiFi as all my other apps work just fine. What‚Äôs frustrating is that there is no way to get out of the error message that‚Äôs displayed on the screen so I have to delete the app from my phone and go re-download it from the AppStore.   Irritating!"
2334,ChrisCom19,"September 26, 2018",5,$5 a month and better service = happiness I sprung for the $5 a month plan which was cheaper than competing commercial free music apps. The variety of comedy and music has gotten a lot broader than in the past. Fewer songs repeat. And I like being able to play specific songs and take a few stations with me.

For how ever many years up to this recent update I was able to click on a station and if I didn‚Äôt want to listen to that song I would click to the next station.

2355,rubyk2003,"December 25, 2017",4,Pretty good This app is amazing it has all of the songs that I enjoy listening to and many new songs that I have never listened to. One major down side to this app is that u need premium to get unlimited skips and to listen offline. It also has adds and glitches sometimes. However my over all experience with this app is good and I recommend it if u love listing to music.

2359,TNTjelo,"January 19, 2018",3,Upgraded to premium... Upgraded to the premium service and have had some issues. The navigation is HORRIBLE!  There is no home button that I'm aware of and if you keep searching for artist you have to keep pressing back back and back to get to the original menu. It's a roll of the dice every time you update. Might fix your problems you have or might cause new problems.  I'm happy with the music selection though
2360,keinagai,"September 17, 2017",5,Songs The only thing that is wrong with pandora is when you type a certain song it comes up with a radio and not the song you type in and one other issue is songs that come on that you like that you can't replay it or it disappear
2361,Sir Craiggels,"October 3, 2017",4,"More of the same artist I love pandora! ...... But!... after like 45 mins into a station you stop hearing songs from the artist that the station is based around. I feel like if your going to have a station I would like ‚Äúseether‚Äù. Just using this as an example, the station should alway start out with the band and I also feel every 1out of 5 song should also be that same band. To many times do I listen to a station and not hear a song by the band I‚Äôm playing after 30 mins. "

I wish it would just play when there is a strong WiFi connection."
2363,ThreeFiftySeven,"November 7, 2017",1,"Absolutely awful I will start by saying that I used Pandora for quite some time and it was okay. Then came the ads. More and more often. Sometimes in between each song there is an ad. And the final straw was when some ad started up and the replay volume in it had to be four fold the volume setting of the song prior. It was so loud my ears were ringing. I‚Äôm done with this, if you need the money from your advertisers so badly that you need to play their ads at a volume level that could abort unborn children then I don‚Äôt need use your garbage product."
2364,Sar_a_S,"November 19, 2017",5,"AMAZING!! THE BOMB!!!! Pandora is the bomb! Even though you need WiFi or data to use the app, it still rocks.

I recommend downloading the app because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll regret it greatly!!!"

Sometimes it works, other times, it requires the app to be selected on the head unit, then the phone, then close it on the phone and let the vehicle try to push the app open again. Very frustrating and not okay for a service to not have good quality control. We have been paying customers of for years, but that may soon stop."

2367,BBeach1718,"April 7, 2020",5,Overall Great App Is a great music app and worth paying for the subscription but only thing you all should consider doing is updating music audio quality to better and louder ability i have to turn my radio all the way up in my car to high volume for it to even be loud but besides that love the app

This used to be such a great app but now that there‚Äôs an upgrade/premium service, the free app plays the same 10-15 songs over and over again. Also, before the paid service came along you could listen for at least half an hour before a 15 second ad. Now it‚Äôs every other song - I‚Äôm not exaggerating - two unbearably LOUD 30 second ads!

2540,berserker hunter,"May 29, 2018",5,Why is pandora so good Pandora is good because you can listen to your favorite music at everywhere at any time but it has adds and I I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs bad not lots of people like adds but it is ok I will let it slide but over all it is awesome! And I think you should get it and I give Pandora 5 star rating üòÑüòéüòÄüòÉüòÉüòÑüôÇüòÉ
2541,McW1970,"July 6, 2018",3,"Pandora ads I love Pandora. I don‚Äôt mind hearing advertisements and there is a wide variety of music. What has me giving only 3 stars is the change in volume with the ads. If I‚Äôm listening to classical music to relax it‚Äôs very startling to hear the advertisement come on in such a loud volume. Sometimes I use Pandora to lay my grandchildren down or nap the children in my preschool class. Again, the ads should be at the same volume as the music."
2542,lt.gerard,"September 1, 2018",5,Pandora I really love Pandora.  You pick an artist that you like and hear songs that he/she has done and songs from similar sounding singers/groups.

I mean, COME ON...does it REALLY need to be as difficult as it is??  Don‚Äôt sign in from a mobile device, if you have it thru X (multiples) then change it this way or that way, do it this way but it‚Äôs going to log you out constantly -  It‚Äôs ridiculous!  I just gave up - which may be what the company wants, meaning I‚Äôll continue to use the app until I settle down enough (AND HAVE THE TIME!) to figure out how to change it. Unbelievable."

2545,Sluggish S34,"September 27, 2018",4,One of the best music streaming apps Overall I‚Äôve always loved pandora both desktop and app but lately even after the latest update that was supposed to fix the problem of the app not opening up and having to delete and reinstall the app on my phone. After dealing with this a few times ive given it a temporary 4 star rating.

I‚Äôm getting really frustrated with hearing the SAME songs multiple times a day. I‚Äôve noticed the same songs seem to almost be on a rotation. I‚Äôll have to dislike just so I don‚Äôt hear it again in an hour. I really hope the right people see this and come up with a resolution. There are millions of songs out there, I do not want to hear the same 30 everyday. Please, correct this problem."
2547,Cory and Cindy,"October 23, 2018",5,"Pandora Review I really love using Pandora. It gives me a ton of music I adore! The only negative thing to type is that many of the same songs will play again and again, I know I can just click ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this track‚Äù to get rid of it for a while but I have to do that way too often"
2548,Amoreena56,"November 26, 2018",5,"Pandora Rocks! Every morning and evening, on my commute to and from work, I listen to the wonderful music that Pandora plays.

2550,dannyee5,"January 1, 2018",3,Problems with connecting to radio I'm having this problem with a keenwood DNX892 excelon. Now my problem is I usually have to plug in my phone then close out of Pandora and swipe it up basically resetting the app and then plug it back in in order for it to actually get picked up for the radio. I noticed this a few months ago and thought it was just a bug that would get patched but nothing as of the first of 2018.
2551,Emz:)),"January 6, 2018",5,"Wow I can always count on Pandora to make me feel better. I listen to songs that I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time.

2552,Power Champ,"January 13, 2018",5,Love Pandora My experience with Pandora is awesome. I listen to it all the time in my car. Especially in my car on long trips. I have I Tunes but this allows me much choice in what I can listen to without having to download all the songs I like. I would recommend the pay version of Pandora. It is great.
2553,cjosh,"January 31, 2018",4,"Works well Works great, other than i dont like how when you click on a station, it switches to a big image of the art work, and you have to click the back button to get back to the stations. Is there any to change this, to the way it used to be, where you can just click through the stations without it changing screens."

Unfortunately I have to suffer through advertisements unless I want to pay to not. Also, I am continually clicking the album cover so I'm not staring at an ad!

Now after I updated anytime I get on it turns my music off. I don‚Äôt get the concept of doing that. Also now anytime I open a different app it turns the music off also. It gets old fast having to constantly have to turn it back on. Would prefer for you to fix this. Thanks :)"

Also, you still get a great quality of music free!"

But anyway, I notice that the music keeps looping and playing over. It was like that before but not to this extent. Lil Wayne has over 1000 songs and I think I only heard less than 50 songs. In the past, it played over 100 songs. It‚Äôs kinda like pandora has downsized songs just to get a person to purchase the app"
2567,Elsa M. Remington,"December 19, 2017",1,"A bit frustrated I have enjoyed Pandora for a while until now. For the past month or so, I have been getting pop ups to try their premium version and I kept clicking no. Until all of a sudden, It was requiring my apple id and changing my world. I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how to undo it as it tells me to go the the app store to change it and I go there, inly to find nothing. I have tried several different ways to figure this out and I am close to deactivating the app because that might just be easier."

It‚Äôs only the Pandora app that stops playing music out of nowhere and shuts down as well as my phone. That‚Äôs the only issue i have with mine. Other than that, it works fine."

Because I'm always looking for a station to warm up, or dance to! But overall  this is an amazing music app!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëç"
2571,TheDria,"May 1, 2020",4,Ads/tracks/stations There are 1-2 ads on average every 2-4 songs that play fully. Sometimes the intro to the app has an ad or 2 & then it‚Äôs smooth sailing.

I have to change the channel after every commercial since the music won‚Äôt play after that. Never did it until just recently. Annoying enough that I am now in the market for a different music streaming service."
2578,Jascs199323,"October 11, 2019",1,Changing layout Pandora is literally the worst for ads.  Not only that but there are too many pop ups with the exit button in an inconvenient spot. The button to get back to station lists doesn‚Äôt work half the time. They changed the exit button for the pandora premium pop up do you‚Äôre more inclined to accidentally get skips which makes you watch a long add. This is especially annoying while driving. It should be easier to use and switch stations while driving.
2579,KI5FR,"October 8, 2019",1,"New update is a pain to navigate I had occasionally considered the possibility of changing apps, but for 6 years, Pandora worked very well for me particularly for my runs. Now it is a multi step process to change channels, NOT good while running.  I am not afraid of change, but since I am forced to relearn the app to use it, I guess it was your way of telling it is time to check out other apps for a potential change. Oh well, life goes on. I will likely keep it on DirecTV, but then again, I might not. This rating is for the version current on 8 Oct 19."

I think they are trying to push member like me to pay for it so they give us all these interruptions."

And if you want to listen to the song again you half to push the rewind button and you have to watch it then you can rewind.

It cycles through the same 10-15 songs on each station. It‚Äôs laggy, the ads sometimes play 2-3 in a row. I don‚Äôt know how much they charge for unlimited, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs less than Apple Music, and I would rather pay 5x as much for Apple Music because it actually works well and gives variety, than to listen to Pandora for free. What a joke."

And maybe an option to remove the other artist after you add them to your station.... if you decide later you only want the main artist!!
2611,Nickobile,"April 28, 2018",5,My review When I am trying to listen to my Neil young stations ever time my channel takes a break playing Neil young and plays other ridiculous music which isn‚Äôt related to him whatsoever. I gave three stars though because I do enjoy listening and you guys have done exceptionally well on this program üëè.
2612,SANDLOT FOREVER!,"May 8, 2018",4,"üëçüëéüèª It works almost perfectly when in WiFi. If I go out of the WiFi zone, even when I turn on cellular data, this app does not work hardly at all if I‚Äôm not in WiFi. The one exception is if you start a song in a WiFi zone and then leave the WiFi zone, it will finish that song only out of WiFi. In WiFi though, five stars! "
2613,Barbidoll999,"May 16, 2018",2,"What's The Deal Pandora? If Pandora was as concerned with it's glitches as it was with me streaming on my computer and phone simultaneously, then they would probably have a good product. However, Pandora has been continually crashing for some time now, and it seems updates make it worse if anything. I'm paying for a service that hasn't even worked properly lately. The least they could do is not harass me when I stream more than one device."

2617,Letsdothis0840,"June 26, 2018",5,"What I think about Pandora I really like this app because it plays music that I like, I also like it because it updates me on the music I like.

Then a few months ago they updated and it has NOT been working right since. Pause button sometimes works. The app pauses after my screen goes dark (it never use to).  I will have to hit replay when the app is open just to get it started back up. "
2622,Travi3sit0,"December 28, 2017",3,"It‚Äôs pretty good The app is good and all no much to say about it but there is a small problem on a radio station that i listen to, the radio station C-Kan would play American country music which has nothing similar to with the genre that i listen on the this station and i would appreciate it if it could be fixed because i don't enjoy that type of music and if nothing is yet to be fix i will end my subscription."

Keep up the fuego app"

Have cancelled my subscription and will never redownload. Yes, I realize I sound like one of those crazy internet people who has a bad haircut and an entitlement issue but this was INSANITY. Btw if this happens to you, hold down the power button, while pressing the up button and then hold the down button for 30 seconds. Then do yourself a favor and delete the pandora app."

I struggled at first to find a good station but eventually I put three artists together in one playlist. Since then all I use is pandora, song after song geared directly towards what I want to hear. I definitely would recommend this Music app, one of the best other than Spotify(Still my fave)"
2627,Vgjjgv,"February 21, 2018",2,Medicore music app I have Pandora plus for a year. It loops. So I hardly get to listen to new songs especially in my limited driving time. And sneaky Pandora wants me to try Premium trial. And there is no easy way to discontinue the trial. Invariably it asks me whether i want the free trial when I am driving because that is when I listen to pandora. So all this shady marketing tactics made me discontinue even their plus subscription. There may be better music apps out there for your money. Don‚Äôt get this.
2628,Wayne_85,"March 7, 2018",3,"New update is irritating Updated to newest version, now I get a video of a wiener dog barking at me every time I open the app/change stations/change songs... that's on top of the mandatory 30second video ad every 3-5 songs. I will not upgrade to premium, ever. So I deal with the ads. But the barking dog video that comes out of the top left corner? Get rid of it. It serves no purpose at all other than to psy-op us into upgrading to plus/premium to get rid of it."
2629,-TW!T‚Ç¨H-,"April 6, 2018",4,Love it Enjoy listening to Pandora; it‚Äôs the best way to discover new music without searching for it! But I do wish they would team up with Apple Music like Shazam did. I‚Äôd like to be able to bookmark a song and have it instantly available in my iTunes the same way Shazam works. Would keep me from going back and forth switching between apps.

At first I was like ‚Äúoh no my phone is broken!‚Äù But none of my apps does this until I use Pandora. I‚Äôm going to check it out just to make sure it didn‚Äôt put a virus on my phone but you need to fix this! Not installing it again until you fix this problem!

Over the past year with my iPhone 6, Pandora crashes about 10 minutes in of use to the lock screen doing a quick reboot of the phone. I thought it was a hardware issue.

2636,Aubscene,"November 30, 2017",1,Stops playing when screen locks Before this last update there were no issues. Pandora played whether the screen was locked or unlocked. Now if you go out of the app by locking the screen or just hitting the home button to multitask the song stops playing. When you go back into the app this song does not restart. You have to close the app completely and then re-open and make sure your screen doesn‚Äôt go off or lock in order to continue to listen. Fix it!! I need workout music.

With the newest updates though my phone is laggy, while using the app. The app will also crash in the middle of a song, and when I have the Bluetooth connected to my car it will restart my whole phone which is super annoying since my main use of pandora is in my car.

I pay $4.99 a month for the ad free version. Connecting to Bluetooth in my car is extremely frustrating and if I am listening to Pandora and try to check email, send a text or do anything on my phone at the same time Pandora freezes. I thought this was an iOS 11+ problem but now I‚Äôm not so sure. Very frustrating. If problems persist will cancel."

I'm hoping this helps. Once I put Pandora back I'll see if there's still a problem, if there's a problem I'll most likely just forget about one of my apps"
2641,BeastModeNerd49,"September 11, 2017",5,REALLY AMAZING !!!! I LOVE this app!!! It's really nice to be able to listen to music and exit the app. You can also go offline and listen to music. It only plays songs you like. You can give the songs you like a thumb up and the songs you don't like a thumb down. And you get to create your own stations from songs you like.

2643,Bills manager,"October 16, 2017",5,Music Variety I enjoy music all kinds of music and love pandora for having that variety.  The stations are updated frequently to keep up with the latest songs.

It used to work better many versions ago.  I‚Äôve contacted them with no response, and my poor reviews have been deleted.  I‚Äôm a paying customer (not on the free version) and they don‚Äôt care.

The ads still play even after buying it and I am extremely upset. To make matters worse they automatically have you buy the 6 months subscription instead of letting you choose the month by month option which you can switch to afterwards which is misleading.

2838,Shop kick mom,"May 20, 2019",4,Love it- sometimes I really love Pandora and listen to it daily when I exercise. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a five is because the same songs play over every time I start the app. You will hear the same 4-6 songs tomorrow and the next day as you did today. I switch stations just so I get different songs to listen to.

2842,Crisp high five,"September 28, 2018",5,"Still great Started listening to Pandora 7 years ago and it still delivers today, even with increased ads.

2849,alisszza,"January 18, 2019",5,Incredible For a person who has trouble remembering the names and artists of their favorite songs Pandora not only is a good way to educate yourself about your favorite bands/ songs but also to discover similar artists and brand new songs before they‚Äôre main stream. I love pandora.
2850,Jairus844,"April 6, 2018",3,"I love Pandora but I love Pandora ,but Pandora Premium is buggy and I had to cancel my subscription after a couple of days. I really wanted to love it , but I couldn‚Äôt listen to a lot of songs because of licensing agreements and that‚Äôs understandable. My breaking point was when one of my favorite artist released an album and it was no where to be found. Very disappointing! I had to crawl back to Apple Music like a dog lol ."
2851,Tommy_M_407,"May 2, 2018",3,"Better selection Pandora is great but it has its flaws. Plays the same songs over and over. If you pick a artist or band or group they play more ‚Äúlike‚Äù music then that particular group. Save that for the genre selection need more music from selection group, name, artist etc. with the catalog pandora has i should not hear the same song in a day. Even if liked.... Other then that app is great"

2853,TheAckerman,"May 22, 2018",5,Wonderful For someone like me who works night shift and is mostly on the floor stocking stuff listening to music/stand-up is nearly a necessity.

You get ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù skips but get stuck with ‚Äúwe can not skip this song due to licensing‚Äù and pretty often I would get an error that would say something about the station being temporarily unavailable if I skip a lot. It‚Äôs a joke. You‚Äôre paying for unlimited skips but they still find a way to prevent you from skipping 4+ songs at once
2857,Jupiters caulk,"June 26, 2018",2,"I love the app... when it works This is driving me crazy- the app will finish a song then just stop playing. Takes me like a minute (or more) of closing and reopening and changing stations to get it to start playing again. This happens a couple of times every hour. Tried uninstalling and restarting the phone, but to no avail. iPhone 7, latest version of app. This might be acceptable for a free app, but as a monthly subscriber, I‚Äôll cancel if this continues for much longer."

2860,Hpeterson23,"November 29, 2017",5,Excellent! Pandora reads your mind! They play what you want to hear! That is all. Wait- pay for a subscription so you don‚Äôt listen to commercials.

2861,Jmmyco,"December 1, 2017",5,No quality control Was going to upgrade for my business but waaaaay too many problems when it‚Äôs free?! Poor Bluetooth connectivity. Works fine on phone and then it‚Äôs a crap shoot to work in the car. 2 different 2015‚Äôs Honda and Nissan. What‚Äôs up? Can‚Äôt see to pay for something that lost its appeal.
2862,Dmoneygets$,"December 12, 2017",4,Great but stop asking me to link my Facebook Can you stop asking me to link Pandora with my Facebook? It's annoying and I hate that I'm constantly asked to do so. If I want to keep my social media accounts separate I should be allowed to.
2863,thejackeye,"December 12, 2017",1,"‚ÄúUnable to save your feedback‚Äù Worked just fine yesterday then I updated the app last night.

The app continues to crash on pretty much a daily basis. I‚Äôve gone so far as to uninstall it and reinstall it. Makes difference. It‚Äôs a real pain when driving and seems to have something to do with the upgrade prompt popping up. It shuts down but when I restart it the app goes back to the song I was listening to.  Updated Pandora today 12/14 same problem
2865,Girth Brooks 420,"December 20, 2017",1,"Fix this app!!! This used to be my favorite music streaming app. However, since the iOS 11 update it has become nearly useless. I have to open the app 2x ever time I want to listen to music. Freezes the first time every single time it‚Äôs opened, then works on the second try. It also used to resume from the previous spot when paused or when I turn off my car when I‚Äôm connected to Bluetooth. No longer does this happen.

2869,KAK1025,"February 21, 2018",1,"They purposely make it difficult to cancel. It‚Äôs so easy to upgrade via the app, but if you want to cancel- you need to go to a desktop computer (didn‚Äôt need that to sign up), and follow a bunch of steps.  I‚Äôm still not able to cancel.  I will not sign up again for Pandora, and I will advise everyone I know to stay away.  Shouldn‚Äôt make it so difficult to cancel.  Poor customer service. "

2871,radio?,"September 25, 2017",2,Radio? I was excited when this radio genome project started but now it is a joke. I'm constantly getting solicited to pay you for a better radio station. Why? Radio is supposed to play music regardless of the input or if you are playing to an empty room. I don't have time to constantly be giving this or that song a thumbs up or down. I'm working! This genome project has turned into a money scam. Have you made your millions yet? Thanks for caving into the society of sheep. Good luck being boring.

2922,ChimchimineyGiroud,"August 12, 2018",2,"Purposeful design In an era where user friendliness is woven into the fabric of the design of apps, here sits Pandora which, like the more cynical app developers out there, purposely buries anything having to do with cancellation behind a series of nonsensical instructions. It‚Äôs just like cable companies assigning fake fees and hoping you‚Äôre too unsuspecting or unwilling to spend hours on the phone to fight. Shame. Otherwise the app is functional and pretty decent.

One thing I do realize is when I‚Äôm listening to a station for a certain time length the music would change to a different genre.

2928,Stands in light,"October 15, 2018",2,Would be nice if the app worked properly Product gives me high anxiety because every time you stop/pause the music and then close out the app. The app by itself reopens and will begin playing on its own. Even though I have stopped and closed out. It takes 7 attempts to actually make Pandora fully stop. Just like everything else sold in America today. It half works properly because the level of care just doesn't exist anymore

2932,Kari8118,"April 30, 2018",4,Station variety Many stations the variety is great and just what you need. Others are limited and play the same songs too often. Sometimes songs do not come up enough by the artist you created the station for. Im not sure if the thumbs up/down feature is a disadvantage that causes a generalized narrowing of options...

I didn‚Äôt know once you put your credit card info on Pandora you are forever stuck with your subscription. Pandora says you can cancel anytime with out a hassle but when you go to cancel it only allows you to update your account and pay more money. Listen to the app for FREE!!! Once they have your credit card there is no way to stop the charges Even if you delete the app!!!!!

It will jump back to online all by itself. So annoying because then it will go back to offline when I lose reception. This is a problem for me because I‚Äôm a truck driver who‚Äôs not aloud to touch his phone while driving. It makes me frustrated. I guess I will start looking into other apps.

3101,markle/sparkle,"November 17, 2018",4,Enjoy my Pandora My only observation is that occasionally Pandora deviates from the station genre and sometimes quite a bit.  Jogging to my 80s rock station is great until a 2000s rap song comes on.  Kind of puts a damper on the song and the workout for  a few minutes.   Otherwise great and I very much enjoy the ap and its wide spectrum of artists and titles.

I emailed pandora support, and they haven‚Äôt provided any resolutions. I‚Äôm probably the only person with this issue but even if I was, this is ridiculous. I shouldn‚Äôt have to keep listening to the same songs over and over again for weeks. I understand if it‚Äôs a few days, but it‚Äôs been almost a month. No. Y‚Äôall can keep it."

I‚Äôm up early this beautiful Saturday morning listening to the beautiful music ever & although there is so much going on in our world right now with the COVID‚Äî19 I refuse to allow it to steal my joy!!!

3151,more variety not a playlist,"January 29, 2020",2,"Larger selection I thought PANDORA would offer more genres and artist instead of Apple Music so I didn‚Äôt have to create a playlist. But now I‚Äôm afraid to thumbs any song up or I‚Äôll only hear those selected songs on rotation no matter what station I‚Äôm on. I hear more gospel songs on my soulful Christmas station than on my gospel station. I hear more variety in country music on Cardi b radio then I do on any of my numerous country artist stations. It‚Äôs weird, but I guess it works for now"
3152,Lyssapwi11,"January 5, 2020",3,"Kind of irritating I love the app. And I‚Äôm very simple. I have selected stations that I want to be included in my shuffle. Sometimes when I go back to check or add new stations to the shuffle rotation, a whole bunch of my stations are unselected. How? I do not know. But it‚Äôs getting annoying having to continuously twerk my shuffle.  Why isn‚Äôt it staying the same way that I left it until I change it myself ???"
3153,nickman9870,"December 16, 2019",1,"December 2019 Review I downloaded Pandora probably 5 yrs ago. At the time, it was the best music app for me. I loved how easy it was to use the app. Now, in 2019 I did notice that they play two or more commercials(I have the free version), they limit the number of skips more than ever before. But the fact that when I downloaded it, they would only play one commercial and now to increase to two or more(some of them are 45 seconds and more) that is very irritating. Definitely will switch to a different music app"

3156,C Brat,"December 4, 2019",5,Welcome to the Future The BIG trick to Pandora is its algorithm. What this means to you is how you select music. Main stream artist don‚Äôt bring up much variety.

I subscribe monthly for plus to be commercial free to keep that music just constantly coming in without interruption.

3202,Vincent Schipper,"May 15, 2018",5,Great way to discover new music. I love the way that the app chooses music.

All in all worth what I pay.
3207,sicklypickly,"June 4, 2018",4,Pandora premium One thing that is so irritating about pandora is that they continue to bug you about going premium. If I wanted premium I would make it happen without pandora popping it up every time I hit my pandora app. There is no way that will pay $12 a month for music. I am happy with the pandora I have at $4.99.
3208,callimop,"June 7, 2018",2,What is the point of skipping The app is fine and crashes a bit. My problem is that I can‚Äôt skip tracks without it saying you have reached your skip limit. FROM WHAT. I just open the app the first time that day and I decided I didn‚Äôt want to listen to a song they say I have to watch a add to get skips. Is that the app now? I don‚Äôt have premium but by looking at the reviews it looks like a rip-off. Y‚Äôall do good for a few months then you do stuff like this.
3209,TaylorBreChristensen,"June 7, 2018",5,Great Even though I‚Äôve had plenty of issues with it through out the years and I recently couldn‚Äôt get into it for awhile. It‚Äôs my favorite.

3213,bosschic314,"December 26, 2017",3,Set up does not make access easy while driving I do not like how they set up the format on this app. Did they test it out by driving and trying to change to a station at the same time?  They need to simplify the ability to change the station. As a rideshare driver I want to change on the fly. I don‚Äôt have time to swipe till I find the station give me a simplified list plz.

3305,olivemarieran,"April 15, 2018",5,Music I love this app so much but it‚Äôs a bit frustrating because every time I get on it the same playlist plays over and over with the same songs and my offline mode keeps only having one song on each station

Why would I upgrade if you can‚Äôt even get the most basic level corrected????
3309,lando58501,"June 23, 2018",5,Pandora I give Pandora a five star rating because it helps me listen to the music that I want to listen to you instead of having to listen to the radio because you don't get to choose the music when you are on the radio

The latest update was of no help at all. I sincerely hope you get this figured out because until then I‚Äôll be using iHeart radio. Sorry Pandora.."

3317,stillwaiting in CT,"December 13, 2017",1,Pandora changed Sonos list in app??? Why have you changed how you integrate with the Sonos?   Many still prefer stations in the Sonos app to be sorted alphabetically and not chronologically. Interestingly this is still an option however it in your Pandora app. Sonos states this is your issue and then only other option is to use your Pandora app to control our Sonos systems.   Really don‚Äôt like the limited Pandora app functionality to control Sonos and preferred the integration the way it had been previously for years.

3319,Already Bruh,"December 22, 2017",1,"How do I cancel my subscription??? I go on the app, go to settings and then to subscription and all it says is ‚ÄúManage your subscription on the Pandora website.‚Äù And so I go to their said website, log in and all that pops up is a window that says ‚ÄúStart listening‚Äù and once you click on it, it takes you to the App Store. I don‚Äôt want to keep paying $10 when I pay the same amount for iTunes already. If someone could help me cancel it before I get charged, AGAIN, that would be great."
3320,Booooooooooooooooooo18,"October 5, 2017",3,"It‚Äôs great, but... After awhile, the app causes my phone to crash. Also, I noticed that the crashing has been getting worse and worse. At first I thought it was just my phone acting up or something, but it only happens when I use Pandora. It‚Äôs a pretty annoying inconvenience. I used to use Pandora a lot, but now I don‚Äôt use it as much because a crash is pretty much guaranteed."

3322,Orellin,"October 15, 2017",5,Update I have used pandora for a very long time and never had any issues. The latest update however seems to make my app close at random during a song. Not sure what the cause of this might be as it‚Äôs never at any given time.
3323,Hcapt1978,"October 17, 2017",3,Can‚Äôt edit shuffle on Premium I really like Pandora but I upgraded to Premium and found out that the feature to edit what stations you want to shuffle is gone. I use shuffle quite a bit and I have a very random taste in music so I like to shuffle certain stations at different times. How is this available on free version but not premium? So until they add this I cancelled premium and back to the free.

3327,Achilles_1069,"November 23, 2017",1,"Unacceptable app What happened to this app? It rarely ever works now. I'm constantly having to fight it to get it to play ONE song. Doesn't matter if it's over Bluetooth, USB or straight out of the phone itself (iPhone-X for reference). Constantly have to forward whatever song was open just to get it to play any song. It used to be a solid app but for the past several months it's been terrible. I'm having to look for a replacement for Pandora because the app has become unusable. Very disappointing."
3328,cat_lovr,"November 25, 2017",5,My review of pandora I love pandora so much because you can pick your favorite station and listen to your favorite songs. And create a playlist with all your favorite songs. The only thing I dislike is how you can only have an amount of skips.
3329,Y2kuphy,"November 25, 2017",2,Issue with automatic Bluetooth sync When syncing to my cars Bluetooth the station no longer automatically starts playing. Must reopen the app and switch the station in order for it to play. And even then it sometimes freezes up and stops working. This has been a recent development. Perhaps the latest update changed something. Disappointing especially since I am paying for Pandora plus.

3331,C.V {I`m a girl},"September 23, 2017",5,24/7 Pandora is my most used app. I love my Indie Folk Revival station; I listen to it literally everyday. Pandora saves me so much money.

The app only allows me three or four songs before shutting down, and then gives me a limit as to how many times i can restart the supposedly ‚Äúunrestricted‚Äù premium session, and limiys the amount of skips and rewinds i get per day. To open everything up for these three or four songs, i have to watch two adds, plus the one you receive every time you open the app. Pandora might be free, but time is money also."

3350,Iridedressage,"May 20, 2019",2,Wrong Songs It would be really great if when you played a playlist they actually played songs by that artist.

I have used pandora forever and have never had this big of an issue with the app. I have deleted and loaded the app several times on both phones and it will still not load. Just a blinking P.

3401,Mysteran,"January 9, 2018",1,"Music ads, terrible patch notes Almost all the ads contain a lot or are almost entirely composed of music, which isn‚Äôt bad in itself.

If it were ads just containing talking it would be less disrupting. "

3404,Lito628,"January 12, 2018",4,"Love Pandora iPhone X support please. I love the app. Wish we can search and play a song and/or create a station of chosen songs.

3422,i13mel,"October 6, 2017",3,"Not bad Not bad but crashes every now and then. Also, once you like an artist on a genre station ( like turn up radio) it will play that artist almost every other song or about two or three songs in a row. As well as playing the same songs very frequently on that station. I think I've heard a Drake song every single time I open my turn up station."

3426,babeotter,"November 6, 2017",1,Shuts off when iPhone locks Not sure what happened between the last version and this version.  Or maybe because I actually started paying for pandora plus.

3427,Cherrybombs.,"November 11, 2017",5,Wish IÔ∏è had the old version Just updated. Old version worked great. This one keeps stopping and play/pause button does not work. Have to keep forcing the app closed and reopening it. Also stops working when different apps are opened - even texts.
3428,WabashMud,"November 13, 2017",2,"Jumped the shark? Several years of using this app made me a big fan. The procurement is still top rate. However, the recent major update has me considering my alternatives. The app design is terrible now. Five touches on the iPad to set the sleep timer when three used to do the trick. Sporadic crashes and freezing play/pause control where there used to be none. I understand and can tolerate increased ad times. You have to monetize to exist. But you broke a great app and that is just sad."
3429,Dadesque,"November 13, 2017",1,"Not so sure now. Accidentally ‚Äúupgraded ‚Äú to premium. I don‚Äôt like it at all compared to plus. In settings it states that I can manage my subscription in the App Store, but alas this isn‚Äôt the case. Difficult to navigate by comparison and the shuffle feature is gone!?! Best part of the entire app for me. If I can‚Äôt switch back I will be canceling my subscription and will have to check out the other guys. I do not want to, but if I have to figure out a completely foreign app I might as well try to find one I like."

3720,FRAGgleROX,"November 30, 2017",5,What happened to this great app. I have noticed a significant amount of app crashes when using the Pandora app. Other apps do not have this issue.  Typically the app will crash if I am streaming and a text message comes in.

NOT HELPFUL WHEN DRIVING!! I know how to use the app, and I have turned off info on artists in my area, but it keeps popping up. If I paid to remove ads and removed all notifications in settings, Pandora, you need to knock it off. I may be moving to Apple Music soon for this reason."

I primarily use this app to play music for kids and have noticed that video ads for horror movies have a tendency to pop up.

Hope they fix the issues."

3737,D7200user,"November 22, 2017",1,Very buggy! Please fix it! When paired with my Pioneer car stereo it sometimes disconnects constantly and I have confirmed it happens when I have a full data signal. Also when using it on my phone I often have to restart the app because hitting play merely cycles through ads and will not play any music at all until I kill it and restart it. The latter sounds more like a revenue generator for their ads than a bug. All in all a very poor app until these issues are properly addressed.
3738,Sahm222,"November 29, 2017",5,Constant crashes Constantly crashes and sometimes won‚Äôt even load. Also the controls from the lock screen don‚Äôt work. To pause or change the song you have to go to the actual app

My regular stations okay but once I start trying to listen to specific songs or albums, the song doesn't play unless I download it.

The stations you do download never update just the same 50 songs over and over again it never updates when you connect to WiFi so you get stuck with looping music that now I can‚Äôt even get because it deleted everything! What a waste of money!

The only annoying thing are the loud commercials they add in between plays. I don‚Äôt mind commercials but I do mind when they increase the volume a lot. It is annoying when you are in the office with visitors. That‚Äôs why I just stream classical music from the radio.

I have not closed the app. I have an iPhone and a Prius and I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a pretty common config. Yet I turn my car off for a short time and when I start back up my music doesn‚Äôt play so I go to my open Pandora app and it acts like it doesn‚Äôt know what I want. In fact it has to ask me dumb questions like do I want local information. No I just want to listen to my music I pay monthly.

3871,More of Les!,"April 17, 2019",5,Music makes the days wonderful! No matter how my day is going Pandora ads the special touch! If the day is full of work it ads character to my day. When relaxing and enjoying down time it turns out great
3872,zen fingers,"April 20, 2019",1,"Same music over and over I don‚Äôt mind hearing my favorite music regularly, but Pandora plays the same songs over and over and over. I try switching it up or creating new stations, but the same music follows me a lot of the time. They need to add variety and play new songs more often instead of the same ones over and over again. I hear this from other friends too and I‚Äôm about ready to quit paying and try something else."
3873,pick a name NOT taken,"May 4, 2019",3,"Ehhh Pandora has way to many commercials, messes up often and when your in the middle of trying to change a station they CONSTANTLY show the screen asking if you want to pay $4.99 a month for Premium. If you are not careful you may actually hit the accept button, luckily you have to confirm but still an annoying inconvenience."
3874,Tex K,"May 22, 2019",5,Great one Great way to listen to all kinds of music.  Easy to use.  Not many commercials even on the free version.  Would definitely recommend it.  Love to listen to the relaxing Hawaiian music when camping out at the lake and enjoy the Southern Gospel and all the music that XM Radio doesn‚Äôt carry.
3875,Cat dog and I,"May 24, 2019",1,"Not bad Pandora is not that bad. It was great in the beginning listening and discovering new artists that were similar to my favorite bands and singers, but now all I hear is the same songs and keep being aggressively pushed to pay for the Pandora premium or whatever. like every ad or a pop-up will happen. It‚Äôs getting boring for me because He just plays the same songs over and over and I use Pandora discover new bands or singers but I really here different songs"
3876,Marine Machine 0311,"August 21, 2019",4,Pandora review Hard to set up playlist. Too expensive to upgrade. Commercials too often. But overall good app. Easy to set up station that I like.

3877,Astirfryreview,"August 5, 2019",5,Life changing When I first started listening to Pandora my music mind was closed to different types of music but pandora opened my eyes to the true power of music by introducing me to my new favorite artists and songs thank you for this perfect app.

3895,JUST WHY!?!?!,"January 1, 2019",4,Why I would give this a 5 star review but this is why not. Whenever you play some music and get off the app the music stops playing. And there are these adds that pop up when listening to the song and the adds are very inappropriate. If you can fix this please do so.

I‚Äôve been a loyal listener and have avoided Apple Music for years bcz I like my stations but if it keeps depleting my battery I‚Äôd rather pay Apple for their premium app than to have battery issue on my phone."
3915,Keeping my money,"July 24, 2018",1,"Commercials louder than music I don‚Äôt mind commercials when listening to music, but Pandora purposely plays the commercials louder than the actual music so that you‚Äôll buy a subscription.  Not a fan especially when playing classical music for a sleeping baby only to be interrupted by obnoxious commercials.  I can happily listen to music with the commercials.  However, I can‚Äôt agree with the volume level of ads being louder than the music.  For this reason, I‚Äôll never subscribe."

They act like you can listen to full albums and most of the albums or tracks I want to hear you can‚Äôt play it‚Äôs ridiculous.

3946,BreesN2SuperBowl,"October 21, 2017",4,Very good music app App works great and rarely doesn't get a signal. Amount of ads for free version isn't too bad.

3955,The Flame Broiled Whopper,"April 2, 2020",5,"Great App. Pandora doesn‚Äôt just allow me to enjoy the music I love. It also introduces me to other lesser known bands and artists from the same genre, who also had a great sound, that were never endorsed by the mainstream stations. Share with your friends and enjoy."
3956,Sir's wife,"April 1, 2020",5,"Favorite I love Pandora. I was lost with some of the other apps for awhile but none of them have to offer what I can get from Pandora. I don‚Äôt mind the advertising because it provides me this wonderful app which is Pandora. I‚Äôm a forever, very appreciative fan."
3957,sooshib,"March 31, 2020",3,"Frustrated I have cancelled this yet just got a bill saying I‚Äôve signed up for Pandora plus! I cancelled because after years of enjoying Pandora my list was taken over by all Latin music and no way to delete it. So in defense sadly unsubscribed. Still a receipt came and said my next will be in April. Contacted Apple, no satisfaction. Not usually a complainer, but this is frustrating."

My old music app turned off the music the second I got on a game. I think the person who can up with this had an AWESOME thought processes, to come up with this. You would love it."
3961,Chickasaw saya,"March 21, 2020",5,I Love Pandora radio Have been listening to Pandora for about 6 years. Much better than some other music services that I listen to.  Will continue to recommend Pandora to my friends & family
3962,Devilredredronni,"March 14, 2020",5,Actually 4 stars I started  The station ‚ÄúHappy‚Äùby Pharrell . At first it played similar songs then drifted a bit into slower songs. All where happy but I was looking for more dance songs. I was afraid if I put a thumbs down that song wouldn‚Äôt play on other stations
3963,Goldrush25,"March 11, 2020",2,Frustrating I loved this app for years. Recently during an update everything was changed and explicit songs were in all genres making it very disturbing and frustrating. If an artist had a clean version or an explicit version the explicit was played in the shuffle.  There‚Äôs no need for explicit songs or if that‚Äôs what one person wanted they could select that version. I‚Äôve deleted this app after years
3964,Grahannabelle,"January 28, 2020",5,"My children For the past four years I have listened to Children‚Äôs music on Pandora in the car; we listen to nothing else.  My children are now, 6, 4 and 2 years old; they love the various stations for children.  Thank you!"
3965,mms1947,"January 22, 2020",5,Great Music It‚Äôs thrilling for older people like myself to be able to access songs from back in the day. Plus its easy to play newer music like Kids Bop for my grandchildren. I can live without cable (rip off) but I have to have music in my life!  Thank you.
3966,Blue kittikat,"January 22, 2020",5,You can always count with it! I have had pandora for about 8 years now and I enjoy the music.  I listen to Spanish music and English as well. Love using it.  I also like that I can use if offline.  You can always find the latest hits here!
3967,ListeningToItAllNow,"January 15, 2020",4,Expand Song Lists Automatically I‚Äôve been using Pandora for some time and am generally pleased. If there is one thing that could be improved would be to automatically expand the song lists on a given station after being played x times.
3968,RichardAdamKimbrough,"January 12, 2020",5,"Great app and a great price. I pay $10 a month and it‚Äôs worth more than that. Though one feature about it is annoying. If you previously picked songs, and you hit random, it‚Äôll repeat the ones you already listened to."
3969,mamaroho,"January 12, 2020",5,"Just Right I put a single artist in on my new site and they curated the perfect play list for me. Only complaint was I only heard one song by original artist. However, all other music fit with the genre and was so enjoyable to relax while listening to good tunes."
3970,Ramblin' Camaro,"December 22, 2019",5,"Pandora is hard to beat I have many channels on Pandora, some I have borrowed, others created on my own, but all have incredible depth, which can be listened to for many hours, without any songs I don‚Äôt like."

3974,Mikayla Rays,"November 28, 2019",4,"My Pandora Review ~ Pandora is an amazing app to use whenever I have a need to listen to music, it‚Äôs a very useful app. I like everything about it except for the fact that it stops when I enter certain apps.

3975,Samantha K. Regalado,"November 24, 2019",1,Not worth it I‚Äôve been dealing with so many technical issues. From only playing some of my downloaded songs. To deleting all my downloaded songs when I‚Äôm offline. Last month I pay for premium. It‚Äôs been continuously freezing. I used to love pandora as I listen to music every single day. It was one of my favorites but after so many months of paying for a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù service and getting crap instead I‚Äôll have to look for a new music platform.

However, the user interface can be freezey and I often have to close out the app if I haven‚Äôt used it in a few hours. If they fix this, 5 out of 5 stars for sure."
3978,GrahamBaconUV,"November 4, 2019",3,"Please Improve I love this app and all the songs and stuff but the one thing that has been annoying me is that as I‚Äôm playing a song or my playlist it cuts out and plays some random song that I never heard before, when I‚Äôm repeating a song it cuts out and goes into a whole different song... so please improve this. I still really enjoy this app üëçüèª"

Almost commercial free LOVE YOU.
3984,General Lee 1776,"October 6, 2019",1,App flipping out on new IOS Got the new IPhone 11 and this app has been flipping out since I downloaded it. Restarting app makes no difference it still spazzes and then crashes. App doesn‚Äôt open and close properly. It is consistent about randomly changing stations and songs without warning. 
3985,RedneckButlerBoy,"September 29, 2019",2,Buttons in top left don‚Äôt work Just got the iPhone 11 Pro and it‚Äôs running iOS 13.1. The screen works fine in all other apps but in Pandora the back and down buttons that are in the top left do not work. Makes it very difficult to change stations as I have to go into artist details which opens tabs along the bottom that I can use to get to my profile and then my stations.

3991,markma2526,"August 1, 2019",5,"Awesome You really cannot out ask Pandora.  Make a station or pick an artist and they are going to wrap music around it that will sometimes make you think...‚Äùwhy have I not heard them before‚Äù.  Couple that with ease, you have a perfect mix."
3992,Skylove23,"August 1, 2019",2,"Battery drainer Usually I‚Äôd give pandora 4 stars, other than The 1299 I have to pay every month I absolutely love it, but lately it is draining my battery like crazy. After listening for 2 1/2 hours my batteries at 9% and looking at my battery usage on my phone Pandora is taking up 30% of that.

3997,Mischifsocali,"July 7, 2019",5,Great Love how the music changes up to the songs that I love. Love that I can pick a single or the hole album.. also the fact that it doesn‚Äôt just play new songs but the artists old songs. The ones that made you like the artists.

4002,cicely101,"April 23, 2019",4,More song variety I don‚Äôt like that once you like a few songs that play in rotation those few songs dominate the station afterward. I would still like more new songs to be integrated into the stations playlist along with the songs that I have previously liked.

I like not paying for it, the ads are conspicuously accurate to our wants, would like more of the artist played for which the station is created....I mean, I didn't type in a genre, I typed in an artist. Play that artist. I understand you're not that hipster radio, which is good, but I typed in a direct want - you can vary the station that calls for a genre or a song characteristic, you must have that capability by now."
4011,f'ina,"January 6, 2019",4,"Ditto about thumbs down on an artist I like music that is somewhat similar to Journey, but I hate Journey.  I want to be able to Thumbs Down an artist.  Or thumbs up an artist too!"
4012,JE/LW,"January 14, 2019",5,Pandora Music This is the best music app there is. You select the type of music you want to hear and they play it non stopped. I pay $4.99 a month to eliminated adds and it‚Äôs the best money I ever spent.
4013,KD Ruffuea,"January 14, 2019",5,"It‚Äôs nice Pandora helps you find all genres that are your style of music. You can search up artists, song titles, or races like Korean & many others like that so I think that Pandora is the best way to go if you want a music app on your phone."

I use it in order to assist me with my exercise goals and with every run or walk and even over WiFi, the music will stop playing for up to 2 mins at a time.

Sometimes I love a song so much that I go to the app to thumbs it up but I‚Äôve already given it a thumbs up. This is why I think they should add a feature where they let you double (or triple) thumbs up a song.

I love when I‚Äôm listening to an artist I really enjoy and then pandora will play a similar artist I‚Äôve never heard of. I have been turned onto so many new artists that are now some of my favorites! All thanks to pandora!
4126,Craig_0010,"October 24, 2018",5,"Good app except... This is a good app for any genre of music except for the constant advertising of the premium package. It is constantly popping up. I wish there was a way to block that. I don‚Äôt mind the other ads but every time I get on the app, that is always popping."
4127,52291995nobody,"November 29, 2018",5,Solid app Pandora is a nice option. I wish there were less commercials and more variety. It‚Äôs unfortunate pandora has joined all the services on the net that are trying to get 5$ from everyone in the world. Free is always better.
4128,Cristyav,"December 11, 2018",2,Loved it but the Updates took that away... Pandora nooo don‚Äôt do that! The update took many of the words out from the songs. No it‚Äôs not a good remix. The songs should have original words not some DJ thing on my songs? I‚Äôm way old enough to make sure I have manners and not use curse words around professionally. I‚Äôve always listened to Pandora but might need to go to another app to enjoy the original versions. Come on Pandora..
4129,Dannyshsbsksl,"December 11, 2018",1,Freezes and fails ALOT Don‚Äôt pay for this service it‚Äôs trash. Since I‚Äôve paid for the premium service (a few months ago) I‚Äôve had to delete and re download countless times and it freezes literally every day can‚Äôt even stream for long before it freezes and I have to close the app out or delete entirely and re download. Again don‚Äôt waste your time paying for the premium service there is better streaming services and more reliable.
4130,Worth it review,"June 27, 2018",4,"This WAS a good app... Ok. So, when I first downloaded this app, it was great! Good music, good stations, etc. But now, whenever I try to play music, it keeps telling me ‚ÄúAn error has occurred‚Äù. Do you know how downright frustrating that is? I would give it a full 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for this issue. Please fix.  Other than that, it‚Äôs an amazing app."

I even have an upgraded version I pay for but because I refuse to pay MORE for premium my music selection has been limited. My shuffle plays the same songs over and over and over even though I have multiple artist selected, different music styles, even overarching selections like 90s alternative or today hits. I hope more people drop pandora over greed and poor selection."

For two, so many ads are played. An ad is played after like every two song, at least that‚Äôs what it feels like. They do play good songs, but I would say there are probably better music apps out there."

4151,Soundingon,"January 11, 2018",1,"No Phone Support/Support Artists! A big difference between Pandora and other streaming services (like Applemusic) is phone support, which to me is huge. Especially if I‚Äôm paying a monthly $12 fee. Most streaming services offer this. Not Pandora. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of streaming in general. Streaming services take a lot of money from artists, especially independent artists, making it a lot harder to make a living than how things used to be. I say PURCHASE the music. Support the artists!"

4154,Timber27,"March 8, 2018",1,Battery consumption is ridiculous I recently updated to the premium service thinking there would be a wider library of music on stations and not only is there not that but if I listen to Pandora even with a downloaded station my battery will go from 91% to 77% in the time it takes me to give my kids a bath (maybe 20 minutes). I like being able to make my own playlist but I just wish I knew why it was eating my battery all of the sudden.
4155,Guero G,"March 10, 2018",5,Guero This is the best music source for me. The variety is incredible but being able to tailor your station by using the thumbs up/down feature makes your selected station truly yours. Have been on it for years and  will continue

4386,Cheapwash,"December 29, 2018",1,Check your battery settings! Pandora was regularly draining my battery with background activity even when I never used the app.  I turned off background app updates in settings and this did not solve the problem.  It wasn‚Äôt until I uninstalled the app that all the background activity stopped. Now my battery is lasting exponentially longer.  Don‚Äôt trust this app.  You will blame your phone until you do the research. Shame on you Pandora!

4396,shadowblade3345,"October 1, 2018",4,Ads I like pandora because I can listen to the music I like and I helped me find different bands that I now like but the reason I gave it a 4 Star is because of how many ads their are and yes I know that their is a payment option to get rid of ads but I don‚Äôt want to pay 13 a month

4405,T-Man-73,"June 17, 2018",5,I Love this App I have been a Pandora user for at least 8 years. I learned how to rate music and create channels designed for me. I can listen for 11 hours strait while driving to my next video shoot never here a song a don‚Äôt like.

4407,TheWatsonyolo#,"June 20, 2018",4,Too many ads I understand the need for ads but every few songs is too much. Should make the interactive ads for an hour free more prevalent. Great music algorithm 90% of the time though. The other 10% I just use another device included in my 2-day shipping program.
4408,Kiki-Gus-Rex,"June 30, 2018",5,"Luvin it! I am loving now that when I thumbs up my favorite songs, that  Pandora is playing more of my favorites, plus adding new songs to the mix. This is an awesome way to learn new music that is out there and enjoy my favorites. Thank you Pandora üé∂"

I also don‚Äôt like how mines not showing me the song unless I swipe up. I liked the older version better. I hope this gets fixed soon cause I actually like the fact that‚Äôs you can listen to music for a little before any ad pops up for 3 minutes.
4411,Becker712,"March 12, 2018",2,"Ads, ads, ads! Why so many ads? Pandora started out being a really awesome free music app. I have had a pandora account for a LONG time, but it seems like recently they‚Äôve started running LOTS of ads. Sometimes one after every single song. Sometimes two in a row. It‚Äôs SO frustrating. And I know it‚Äôs just because they now want me to pay for the ad-free version. The greed is so sad and disappointing."
4412,crayfish23,"March 29, 2018",1,"User interface becoming unusable Dear Pandora: Your software is nothing I couldn‚Äôt do with conditional log-linear modeling refined with some creative Viterbi approximations.

4417,Gameuser1,"May 5, 2018",5,Pandora Music I love to hear my classical music on Pandora and I don‚Äôt mind the one commercial between sets of music I like to hear. I don‚Äôt think it is worth it to buy the premium station. I am satisfied with the way I listen to this station now

When I‚Äôm driving & on a phone call or trying to listen to driving directions it just starts playing I can‚Äôt turn it off! Not a safe situation while driving. I had to delete the app it was the only way to silence it!! It just wouldn‚Äôt stop.
4421,Auntytt1,"December 21, 2017",3,Do not like I have it in shuffle and it keeps going to instrumental music and I keep hitting the thumbs down button but every two songs it plays again. I had pandora before and never had this problem. I decided to download it again and that's practically all I get is instrumental. I thought it would remember my likes and dislikes.
4422,Kataddictedtomusic,"January 2, 2018",5,I love Pandora! I love the fact that I have control over the types of music I want to listen to but I wish that my playlists would be with the list radio stations. Other than that I love the basic concept of the Pandora app!!
4423,Thegreatlegend,"January 3, 2018",5,Good App Pretty good music app. Very user friendly and straight forward. The app also has a good premium option but you can of course just watch adds to get some premium options if you don‚Äôt want to pay. Overall I‚Äôd recommend.
4424,SaraCincy,"January 5, 2018",1,"Randomly playing out of the blue This week, my Pandora app started launching and randomly playing out of the blue. This happens even after force closing and there is no immediate way to stop it except silencing my phone. Super frustrating and inconvenient as it has happened twice at work.

Then I have to click play again. It‚Äôs quite annoying. But other than that it‚Äôs been great.
4426,ebreezy421,"February 3, 2018",4,Premium is worth the money. Being able to skip songs however many times you want is great and also find out songs you like from suggestions and creating Playlist are easy. It's great if you always have to make long distance drives.
4427,Leeshen,"February 18, 2018",1,"It‚Äôs all adds I know I am using the free version and I do expect some adds, but ever sense the new update all I see are adds. Not only are there giant adds that make me so I can‚Äôt even see what song is playing, the adds slow down switching to different stations. Not to mention when an audio add pops up I can no longer skip it after 15 seconds, the adds are full screen and three to four 30 second adds play in a row before a new song plays."
4428,alexandyr,"February 23, 2018",2,Annoying Popups Every time I open the app and am trying to select stations I get two popups that I must dismiss before I can proceed. One is an upsell to Pandora premium (I already pay for Plus) and the other is trying to get me to log into Facebook.

4436,Chelemi71,"December 2, 2017",2,New update a bust I loved the fact that my Pandora (plus)app would continue to play even when I closed my screen or opened another app. This has all changed with this recent update. Pandora now freezes and I have to close the app completely and reopen it and start again.
4437,Walks in the dark,"December 5, 2017",1,It locks up all the time! I have the monthly ad-free subscription. I usually listen while I drive. With the latest update it freezes up immediately upon switching to any other app (like google maps). The only way to get it back on is to swipe out of it altogether and reinitiate pandora and stay there.  I did note yesterday that if I put it on and let it ‚Äúsettle in‚Äù for several songs that I could then switch to Google Maps and it kept playing.

Singers and musicians fine tuned their talents in basements, garages, or on street corners but they had zeal, belief, and persistence. Individuals made every step, Motown lit üî• the way..."
4464,MarSue1,"March 19, 2020",5,Awesome music Love the choices you have and receive once you pick your stations! I shuffle mine for all day music while on my job. 
4465,Medaman02,"March 11, 2020",5,New version Whatever you did with the last update on the App Store it‚Äôs saying to check my network but every thing is still working fine. What happened? Please go back to the way it was.
4466,haylee corbitt,"January 22, 2020",5,Haylee I love pandora it works great I just have one wish I wish I could listen to it offline for free because I‚Äôm 13 I can‚Äôt pay for it I would like to be able to listen at school on my phone with out my data working.
4467,rini_patissiere,"January 13, 2020",5,Music filtering I love the app I just wish the music filtering can be a bit better. There are some days the choices are great and provides new songs to listen to. It would be nice to also have more current music as well.
4468,Andykva,"January 8, 2020",4,"Good, but not as good as it was! I started using Pandora several years ago on my iPad. It was a free service and I put up with a brief advertisement after every few songs, much like commercial radio."
4469,Funkali,"December 23, 2019",1,"Tide ads - quitting I use Pandora and don‚Äôt mind hearing relevant ads, which may lead me to purchase online like we all do. However, they purposely overplay terrible ads, such as all of the Tide ads in the last few months. I had planned on purchasing Pandora for family members for Christmas but can no longer do this in good conscience. Will be deciding on which alternative I will willingly pay money for to avoid a company that purposely tortures their customers in hopes for $5."
4470,Char04Conn06,"December 20, 2019",1,"Updated Still won‚Äôt download some or all of station even on super fast connection. Still shows the station sometimes isn‚Äôt available. Restart app and it will play what wasn‚Äôt available. Attempted to get some help and before o could I even type the question, Support says ‚ÄúLooks like we can do this better over email.‚Äù Guess this is what happens when an app gets too big. Really like my stations. Going to have to find another option."
4471,Cleveland Pumkin,"December 18, 2019",4,"Love it, to many commercials I love Pandora on my iPhone 8 Plus. The only thing I don‚Äôt like it has to many commercials and after listening to it for so long it feels like the same songs keep playing. Other than that it is very creative about choosing music I may like. Love it"
4472,djjtnxnygghdb,"December 5, 2019",5,"Love my music I found all the music that makes me stop and listen because Pandora has all the music I listened to as a child with so many memories.  Pandoras music can take me from childhood to junior high, high school and all memories throughout my 60 years."
4473,disabled and broke,"November 12, 2019",5,There is no way to cancel and it because they don‚Äôt give out that information I am getting charged for my pandora and I can‚Äôt afford for them to keep taking money out of my account. 
4474,ZVE676,"November 7, 2019",5,My Playlists won‚Äôt play anymore I can only use stations and all of my saved playlists from before are not playing
4475,MyKidGetsAllTheApps,"November 5, 2019",2,"Recent update is BS!! Thanks Sirius for screwing everything up I was forced to update my station today and Pandora deleted all my stations that I have spent YEARS building. I listen on a daily basis, and now I have to start OVER?!?!"
4476,SCMCSM,"November 3, 2019",2,"False advertisement They quick to take your payment but not give the service ASAP when I purchased It was my birthday party and the commercials kept playing even after I updated it wasn‚Äôt until an hour or so later it finally started working THEN they advertise unlimited skips witch is FALSE, you Have a certain amount of skips in one hour.... If you have an iPhone get apply music!"
4477,Teed ferguson,"November 2, 2019",5,Pandora + It‚Äôs not all what you think. There‚Äôs times when I‚Äôm in a tunnel for a period of time and on certain stations it‚Äôll just skip a million songs automatically instead of playing them
4478,KirkC11,"October 29, 2019",5,10Years I have never not had pandora since my first access to a computer then cell phone. Thanks for the free music 15 second adds are manageable. Never do I turn down a 1-HR freebie it‚Äôs easy listening that allows me to manage my work flow of focus. 
4479,nfjo.nc.jkd,"October 27, 2019",3,"Lots Of Stuff To Fix.... First of all, this app is pretty good but a few things to fix. One thing they need to fix is that there are too many adds. They keep repeating the same adds over and over again. Another thing they need to fix is sometimes the app goes to another song. Pandora, please fix these problems."
4480,Tiff us,"October 9, 2019",5,"Great, but I want to love it So much to like. But, ... "
4481,J. Guardipee,"October 9, 2019",5,Better music than any other Better than any other music app out there if I could give ten stars I would!! I never have any problems ever!! 
4482,andre18m,"September 30, 2019",5,5star Pandora I really like this app it has brought me to new music listening to one artist then getting someone else that I will really love and listen to him/her. Pandora can be a little off with ads but one every 14 min is alright 10/10
4483,Briannamethyst,"September 26, 2019",2,"Are You Still Listening? Pandora has been the source of music for the business I work at for years. However, during the latest update, if you haven‚Äôt touched pandora for more than 30 min it stops playing and asks if you‚Äôre still listening. We don‚Äôt want to have to keep tending to pandora and are now looking for a new option for music for our store."
4484,Vieja del 62,"August 30, 2019",5,Is the best 1 keep number 1 Can complain it all always there for wen I happy or little depressed or not sleeping or falling sleep keep up the good work u r d greatest thanks this time 1 thing can you explain me how can I hear my thumbs up appreciate that if you help me with that thanks
4485,Lilhorn,"August 16, 2019",5,Unhappy customer I can‚Äôt seem to find a support number for pandora
4486,matt70lock,"July 31, 2019",1,Is there a point to thumbs up? Because I have songs that I have thumbs upped on stations built around the artist that I haven‚Äôt heard once in WEEKS but that same station will routinely start playing random crap by other artists nothing like the station seeds.
4487,BoFriendly,"July 27, 2019",5,Ever Improving Functionality! I really enjoy the added features of recent releases; my only disappointment is it could be made even more convenient to switch between functions or modes.  Keep it up!
4488,Livelaughlove20141,"July 26, 2019",2,"Love the music, hate the app I generally enjoy using pandora quite a bit since I drive an hour for work everyday but when I went to go and cancel the free subscription before it billed me for the month, there was absolutely no way for me to do it through the app or the website when using a phone and I don‚Äôt have access to a computer which is honestly super disappointing"
4489,RogerThatCopyThat,"June 28, 2019",2,"Recent update is unappealing and not user friendly This recent update is awful. It is not easy to navigate and the layout has switched to that of a primitive app, even the color design looks elementary. The screens also lag and glitches when trying to switch stations."
4490,babycakegummybear,"February 25, 2019",5,"I LOVE IT!!! I always can‚Äôt decide what song I want, but now I can just choose a station and it‚Äôs amazing, not to mention I get to listen and be introduced to other artists, and if I don‚Äôt like it, I can skip the song or give it a thumbs down! Overall amazing!"
4491,Mandi Gomez,"February 27, 2019",3,"Love it but been having problems I love Pandora, my fav music app. I recently subscribed to the Premium and been having problems with it always buffering and freezing on me while I am driving and trying to listen to my playlist. So I have decided to continue with due to the fact it is constantly freezing. Other its an amazing app"
4492,thegamer50017,"March 3, 2019",5,About pandora I think it‚Äôs amazing because you can find the right song your looking for!But when you want to hear your history you can‚Äôt because you have to see ads
4493,FreemanAve,"March 3, 2019",5,Jeff Wells concert hall My time with Pandora has been very pleasing I must say! I listen to a diverse song selection and have never had a problem with finding a song that pleases my listening taste! Thank you for being there Pandora!
4494,üçìü••,"April 18, 2019",4,Urgh Your app is really great. But today I had some difficulty skipping my songs when it was on offline mode. I would go to skip a song I didn‚Äôt like and it would just start over. And when a song ended it would play again. Other than that it‚Äôs a really great app.
4495,Lone_wolf1220,"April 20, 2019",4,Pandora I definitely love this app. The only problem I seem to have is the constant adds I get. Every other time I skip I get an add. One time I got this hour free of adds but I don‚Äôt know how to control the adds. Other than I love how you can create your own stations with a variety of songs.
4496,Tough mouth,"April 25, 2019",5,"Great Radio Station I really enjoy Pandora because you can put in artist you like and they pick songs for you. I hear songs that I haven‚Äôt heard in years, and songs that I had forgotten about. Keep up the good work Pandora."
4497,KatieZ0333,"May 3, 2019",4,"Love Music This is a great app. It is mostly on target with my likes. The only concern, as a parent, we listen to the Disney station a lot. When we like a Disney song with Ke$ha as the singer, I think that leads to other artists in her genre. There have been times when swear words from rap songs have popped up on this channel. That‚Äôs disconcerting."
4498,456AB3-3,"May 18, 2019",5,"Latest Update I don‚Äôt like the latest update, very frustrating, I‚Äôll say this for ‚Äúmale chauvinistic pig‚Äù, too much change just ain‚Äôt good, please go back if possible, like the previous review, love the music, but....oh, I don‚Äôt want to upgrade, did it once, that‚Äôs enough for me."
4499,gator gerrlll,"June 10, 2019",3,"It‚Äôs OKAY... Pandora is amazing, BUT the new update is throwing me off. When I listen to a playlist, and I turn my phone off, instead of resuming the playlist, it chooses another instead.  However, I LOVE that you can lime or dislike the songs, and I think it‚Äôs very convenient for a ‚Äúthumbprint‚Äù playlist.  Just fix the bugs and the app would be 5 stars!"
4500,idfk_23,"December 16, 2018",5,"Pandora Plus It would be nice if they could let you make a playlist without having Pandora plus, because not everyone can afford pandora plus."
4501,Dkfkdjc I,"December 17, 2018",2,I‚Äôm confused... I‚Äôve been using pandora everyday faithfully for about 7 years now. All of s sudden almost all of the songs I listen to switched to the clean version. It‚Äôs really hard for me to enjoy the song when it‚Äôs the clean version. I feel like we should have the option to switch to the clean version of songs rather then being forced to. Please fix this Pandora. Thanks.
4502,HowieDew801,"January 3, 2019",2,How is it still running I‚Äôve used pandora for years and loved it but for some reason it just keeps playing music? I‚Äôve unfortunately had to delete because even ‚Äúforce closing‚Äù the app won‚Äôt stop the music for long. It comes right back a few minutes later and when I open my running apps it‚Äôs not there so I have to open the app to force close it again
4503,jls0711211,"January 6, 2019",3,More appropriate ads please Love the variety of music and that I can have stations that appeal to myself and my ten month old. But when I have a Sesame Street children‚Äôs radio on for bedtime the last advertisement I want to hear on there is one for a horror movie. Someone needs to adjust the algorithm so that more appropriate advertisements are played on children‚Äôs music stations
4504,cant all taken,"January 19, 2019",5,Commercials despite subscription Don‚Äôt understand when a paid subscription began forcing paying members to listen to commercials despite them paying to avoid them. Highly disturbing and wrong.
4505,Rybob214,"January 21, 2019",5,Couldn‚Äôt live without my pandora It‚Äôs worth the upgrade but pay attention there are two different ones I have the cheaper and it is perfect all the perks to the more expensive one in my opinion
4506,Chloe_Rae15,"February 1, 2019",2,"Password help. About two weeks ago pandora logged me out of my account. Since then I haven‚Äôt been able to remember my password and every time I try to reset it, the website says that you are conducting system maintenance and to please try again later. I‚Äôm getting extremely frustrated, as I use pandora quite a bit. What are you doing to fix this problem??"
4507,rougethefree,"February 16, 2019",3,Underwhelming now I used to love it but They continues to play the same songs it‚Äôs like my channels have 20sings on each and that‚Äôs like all I get and they put it on shuffle it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I can click on a station and know what song is going to come on I use to love the new artist it pushed out and new music now it‚Äôs just that artist more or less
4508,Nevin1998wooD,"February 23, 2019",5,Best music source Always has diverse music to learn about new artists. The option for premium is nice even though I can‚Äôt currently afford it. Fun to use for my spare time and being able to use other apps at the same time is perfect
4509,TheHeartArtist,"February 24, 2019",5,"Music for the soul! Love pandora! Been using it for years. As an artist traveling all over the country from art to art show, music is vital to daily happiness! Thank you Pandora for so many choices and creating an app that gives so much happiness"
4510,Banana Jamal,"November 6, 2018",5,Could be better. I really enjoy Pandora. It would be the only thing I listen too except it‚Äôs not supported on Apple Watch. I find myself slowly using it less and less because of this. Otherwise great app.
4511,BLG6,"November 6, 2018",2,"Getting worse I‚Äôve had Pandora for years and paid for the pandora one subscription so I wouldn‚Äôt have the annoying ads. Now they have a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù pandora and I constantly get ads to upgrade. This is what I PAY monthly to not have. And, over the past 6 or more months the app crashes, or won‚Äôt play and you have to restart your phone. Why is this app getting worse?"
4512,miss Laladdjrjkekalogkekjdhcjf,"November 7, 2018",3,"Only use pandora for Questlove Supremo Love that show but I'm tired of having no option to rewind a cpl seconds and tired of the confusion in trying to get to main page of the show I like and going everywhere but there. There's no intuitive ""back button"" to get to the episode you really wanna check out. So those things annoy me. But it's coo otherwise."
4513,dhndnfjrjene,"November 8, 2018",1,Pandora needs changed ASAP! Pandora used to be great... now it plays weird music on the hip hop stations nothing really new unless you pic the specific artists. It does not separate Spanish rap from American hip hop. Way too many commercials I mean your supposed to be listening to and enjoying a music experience ? Also after paying for the premium I still didn‚Äôt get skips or repeats I actually am starting to dislike pandora and search for other music sites!
4514,kaden kee,"November 14, 2018",5,Pandora Awesome it allows me to listen to music for hours and never fails if you are looking at this wondering if you should get it yeah you should I‚Äôm listening to it right now while I‚Äôm making this my name is kaden Kee I‚Äôm 13 so if your my age go ahead and get it.
4515,Tallbuz82,"November 28, 2018",3,"Due to this and that, not 5 I LOVE Pandora and the paid membership is worth every penny.  Except when I want songs that are unable to be played without needing to create a station.  That knocks it down a few stars since I can‚Äôt listen and add songs to a playlist due to copyright, license or whatever.  If I can get that fixed, I‚Äôd gladly change the review."
4516,willbo_saggins,"December 3, 2018",3,"Newest update stinks.. The newest update (December 2018) stinks. Every so often the music randomly stops playing, but the timeline of the song says that it is still playing but there is no music coming out. Service or Wi-Fi connections do not matter, or dont improve performance or change the issue.  I'm glad that I do not pay for premium or platinum..."
4517,sip wreck bar,"December 5, 2018",2,"Pandora one no more I purchased pandora one years ago, which set the mood for many many lake parties. We listened to all kinds of random tunes some new some old, now it‚Äôs not the same to say the least, I have all kinds of long commercials. I have also upgraded my phone and list all of my stations. Still listen at home at work on the boat etc. just very difficult to navigate."
4518,h8tank88,"December 7, 2018",5,"Makes discovering new music a breeze If you have a favorite band or song and you want to find more of that kind of music, look no further. Pandora Makes discovering new music that you might actually like easy."
4519,Fyere,"December 8, 2018",2,"New update buggy - CarPlay Sad to see this. After SO long with issues regarding how this app works with Apple CarPlay (neverending loaf screen) now, with the latest update, all I get is ‚ÄúIndentifier Not Found‚Äù when I try to access my stations. "
4520,*Britney*,"September 15, 2018",3,"Was fine, until Wanting to cancel due to trying another service instead and absolutely zero way to do that without using a computer. Cannot be done from the app, cannot be done via safari on your mobile device. Yet you can of course upgrade your plan that way. Horrible process."
4521,LisaLynx,"September 21, 2018",5,"Much better customization with updates Much better with new updates. Ads still abruptly loud and too many aggressive subscription ad pop ups, but overall excellent thumbprint customization."
4522,üé∂üë©üèº,"September 21, 2018",4,"Love the app, but not connecting I love the music and choices, but almost every time I try to open the app, it says the network is not connecting, when it clearly is. I have to delete and re-download the app to get it to work. Even then, after about 2 hours, it stops connecting."
4523,jacobly24,"September 21, 2018",2,"Used to work but now.... I am a premium member for 4 months now but am unable to listen to my downloaded music offline, I am unable to search for music even when I have WiFi of service, sometimes when I‚Äôm shuffling through music the app will quit all together. It also won‚Äôt let me see my account. Please fix because I‚Äôm currently paying 10$ a month for an app that isn‚Äôt working"
4524,Jackie Knoff,"September 21, 2018",5,"After recent update no more music The latest update has blocked me from going into online mode at all, even though I am paying for a subscription üò¢ guess that is it for me and pandora"
4525,Zerfdor,"September 25, 2018",5,"My go to Pandora is basically how I focus at work. I go to work, clock in , put my head phones on turn on the app let the music play! Thanks Pandora because without you work would be real quiet and frustratingüëçüèΩ!"

4527,marevir2,"October 14, 2018",5,Always on point! It‚Äôs amazing how it knows what i might like to listen too! Sometimes I hear old songs I didn‚Äôt even remember I liked and then pandora surprised me with new songs that turn into some of my favorites.
4528,DreamyMoss,"October 18, 2018",5,"Everyone needs this in there lives I love pandora. No matter what high speed data or low speed data, it plays smooth all the time. I haven‚Äôt even got the premium yet and am very happy with it. Hands down greatest app of all time :)"
